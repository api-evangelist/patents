No. 09\/536,879, filed Mar. 27, 2000, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference.","The present invention relates to scripting and more particularly to automated scripting solutions.","Newly developed software programs must be thoroughly tested in order to eliminate as many \u201cbugs\u201d or errors as possible before the software is released for widespread public use. Accordingly, development of software is largely a trial and error process. Several different methods for testing software programs have been developed. One conventional approach, generally referred to as beta testing, involves distributing the program, typically under a non-disclosure agreement, to a group of users who use the program for a period of time and report any errors which are encountered to the software developer. Although this type of testing is commonly used in the software industry, it is often found to be very time consuming, adversely affecting the scheduled release of products incorporating the software program. In addition, beta testing can be extremely difficult to control, particularly when a large number of users are provided the beta version of the software. Furthermore, due to the non-systematic use of the program, there is no guarantee that every error, or even most errors, will be identified with this approach, even under circumstances where a large number of users are using the software.","As software is developed on and runs on computers, it is not surprising to find that many of the techniques for automating the testing of software have been implemented in digital computers. A common approach for testing software is the use of test suites. Test suites compare \u201cknown good\u201d outputs of a program (for a given set of input) against the current output. Tests that check program file output are easy to implement and can be automated with shell scripts (e.g., Expect available on the Internet). For programs with user interfaces that communicate to standard input\/output devices (stdin\/stdout), a similar method may be employed. Capture\/playback tools are available for recording keyboard input and program output as a person tests a program.","Much of the code written today is for software products with a graphical user interface (GUI), such as Microsoft.\u00ae\u2122. Windows.\u2122. In fact, much of software development itself is done within a graphical user interface, with software tool vendors providing products which allow software developers to develop GUI software using visual programming techniques. The Quality Assurance (QA) engineer faces more complex problems when testing GUI software. In particular, GUI programs must behave correctly regardless of which video mode or operating environment is being employed.","Intuitively, testing user interfaces should not be as difficult as testing a complex internal engine, such as a compiler or a real-time, multi-user operating system. In practice, however, user interface (UI) testing is the most challenging part of the QA process. This problem stems largely from the difficulty in automating UI tests. Tests for complex engines, in contrast, are often command-line programs whose testing can easily be automated using simple batch execution. Thus despite the plethora of present day tools for automating program testing, the task of developing, maintaining and analyzing the results of UI tests remains an arduous task.","The basic steps traditionally employed to test user interfaces may be summarized as follows. First, the application being tested is controlled by placing it into a specific state using either pre-recorded keyboard or mouse device actions, or entering input through a test script. Next, the then-current state of the application is recorded by taking a screenshot (e.g., capturing a screen bitmap). Finally, the captured screenshot is compared with a baseline screenshot that is known to be valid.","The approach is far from ideal, however. Consider, for instance, the determination of whether the state of a check box is valid within a specific dialog box. Here, the QA engineer must take a screenshot of that check box and compare it with the expected image. Thus, testing of even the simplest component is laborious. Moreover, the approach itself is prone to error. A change of just a few pixels across all windows\u2014a common occurrence in GUI software development\u2014causes all tests to fail. Consequently, as software becomes more and more complex, it becomes less and less feasible to test user interface tasks with present-day screen comparison methodology.","The software testing phase is a critical phase in the software development process. During the software development process, the software testing phase occurs after the software has been designed, implemented in a programming language, and tested to a limited degree. During the testing phase, software testers test the software extensively to ensure that the software meets all of the requirements it is intended to meet. In order to accommodate simultaneous testing of several different software packages by several testers, multiple test machines are often implemented. Different types of software packages may need to be tested on different types of test machines, such as, for example, test machines with different hardware configurations and\/or different operating systems. When a large number of software testers are required to share common resources for software testing, provisions must be made for scheduling the tests in order to efficiently manage these shared resources. The efficient management of these shared resources may also require that tests and the results of the tests be recorded so that the tests can be used repeatedly if needed and so that the results of the tests can be analyzed and subsequently used for comparison with the results of tests performed at a later time.","In an effort to maximize efficiency in the handling of test scheduling and test execution, attempts have been made to automate software testing by using a server to manage test machines and to allocate test packages among the test machines in accordance with a schedule. Generally, these types of systems pre-allocate tasks to test machines by calculating the current and scheduled loads on the test machines and scheduling the tasks so that they are performed in a tine-efficient manner. For example, Sun Microsystems, Inc. has proposed an automated task-based scheduler for use with UNIX platform systems which allows users operating \u201cclient\u201d machines to schedule tests to be executed on \u201ctarget\u201d machines. A central server receives a request from a client machine to perform a task. The server maintains information relating to all currently scheduled tasks on all target machines in a \u201cstatus\u201d database. The server maintains information relating to the expected duration of each test package and other test package attributes in a \u201cpackages\u201d database.","When the server receives a request to perform a task from a client machine, the server determines the loads on each of the target machines which are suitable for performing the task. The loads are determined based on the expected duration of each test package. The server then schedules the task on the target machine with the least current load. A task file created at the client machine and copied to the server includes priority information relating to the task requested by the client machine. Once the server has selected a target machine for the task, the task file is copied to the selected target machine. The target machine selects a task to be performed based on this priority information contained in the task file copied to the target machine. Once a task is completed, the results are copied back to the server which compares them to a set of \u201cgolden results\u201d and creates a comparison report which is mailed back to the user that requested the test.","The present disclosure provides for affording synchronization in an automated scripting framework. First, script data is received utilizing a language-driven interface. Then, reports having user readable sentences are created based on the received script data. The received script data is then translated into automation code. Finally, automated testing is provided utilizing the automation code.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the reports are created as hard copies. Optionally, the received script data is translated into automation code using relational table values. In another embodiment, the script data may be divided into a plurality of components stored in a database. Further, the database may reside on a remote server.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0098","num":"0097"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","106","108"]},"The present invention has been developed and implemented to automate regression testing of host applications. Among other roles, the present invention can be used in an Integration Test (IT) phase to develop a more robust and systematic process for executing test scripts during certification testing. The present invention is a two-tier application, consisting of a database (Microsoft Access 97 or SQL Server) and an automation tool (Mercury Interactive WinRunner). The present invention reduces testing time and allows the testing team to detect and log more application issues, ensuring quality software delivery.","The present invention provides data-driven test scripts with an English-based, form-driven user interface. The present invention data architecture divides and stores test script information (steps, actions, application widgets, etc.) into separate, reusable components. The table relationships between these components provide the capability to develop easily maintained, data-driven test scenarios.","Traditional testing tools are manual and require long hours of slow and tedious testing. The few automated tools that do exist have limited flexibility and hard coded scripts.","In contrast, the present invention's unique and innovative features yield exceptional benefits in both scope and time. Organizational benefits include: increased development productivity, higher issue counts and shorter development cycles.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0103","num":"0102"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","202","204","202","206","208","210","212","204","214","216","218"]},"In use, the client computer  updates test script data located on the database  utilizing an ODBC connection. The test script data is further passed to the ASA modules  via an SQL query. The ASA modules  then process the test script data and pass the processed data to the test script automator . Automated execution of the processed test script data is then performed by the test script automator , which is connected to a host application executing on the client computer .","In addition, the client computer  may be utilized to obtain the on-line help documentation  located on the server system . The server system also stores the metrics statistical reports  after execution of each test cycle. Finally, test script data is dynamically converted into English-based, test script documentation .","A preferred embodiment of a client computer system  in accordance with the present invention is preferably practiced in the context of a personal computer such as an IBM compatible personal computer, Apple Macintosh computer or UNIX based workstation. A representative hardware environment is depicted in , which illustrates a typical hardware configuration of a client computer  in accordance with a preferred embodiment having a central processing unit , such as a microprocessor, and a number of other units interconnected via a system bus . The workstation shown in  includes a Random Access Memory (RAM) , Read Only Memory (ROM) , an I\/O adapter  for connecting peripheral devices such as disk storage units  to the bus , a user interface adapter  for connecting a keyboard , a mouse , a speaker , a microphone , and\/or other user interface devices such as a touch screen (not shown) to the bus , communication adapter  for connecting the workstation to a communication network (e.g., a data processing network) and a display adapter  for connecting the bus  to a display device . The workstation typically has resident thereon an operating system such as the Microsoft Windows NT or Windows\/95 Operating System (OS), the IBM OS\/2 operating system, the MAC OS, or UNIX operating system. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention may also be implemented on platforms and operating systems other than those mentioned.","A preferred embodiment is written using JAVA, C, and the C++ language and utilizes object oriented programming methodology. Object oriented programming (OOP) has become increasingly used to develop complex applications. As OOP moves toward the mainstream of software design and development, various software solutions require adaptation to make use of the benefits of OOP. A need exists for these principles of OOP to be applied to a messaging interface of an electronic messaging system such that a set of OOP classes and objects for the messaging interface can be provided.","OOP is a process of developing computer software using objects, including the steps of analyzing the problem, designing the system, and constructing the program. An object is a software package that contains both data and a collection of related structures and procedures. Since it contains both data and a collection of structures and procedures, it can be visualized as a self-sufficient component that does not require other additional structures, procedures or data to perform its specific task. OOP, therefore, views a computer program as a collection of largely autonomous components, called objects, each of which is responsible for a specific task. This concept of packaging data, structures, and procedures together in one component or module is called encapsulation.","In general, OOP components are reusable software modules which present an interface that conforms to an object model and which are accessed at run-time through a component integration architecture. A component integration architecture is a set of architecture mechanisms which allow software modules in different process spaces to utilize each others capabilities or functions. This is generally done by assuming a common component object model on which to build the architecture. It is worthwhile to differentiate between an object and a class of objects at this point. An object is a single instance of the class of objects, which is often just called a class. A class of objects can be viewed as a blueprint, from which many objects can be formed.","OOP allows the programmer to create an object that is a part of another object. For example, the object representing a piston engine is said to have a composition-relationship with the object representing a piston. In reality, a piston engine comprises a piston, valves and many other components; the fact that a piston is an element of a piston engine can be logically and semantically represented in OOP by two objects.","OOP also allows creation of an object that \u201cdepends from\u201d another object. If there are two objects, one representing a piston engine and the other representing a piston engine wherein the piston is made of ceramic, then the relationship between the two objects is not that of composition. A ceramic piston engine does not make up a piston engine. Rather it is merely one kind of piston engine that has one more limitation than the piston engine; its piston is made of ceramic. In this case, the object representing the ceramic piston engine is called a derived object, and it inherits all of the aspects of the object representing the piston engine and adds further limitation or detail to it. The object representing the ceramic piston engine \u201cdepends from\u201d the object representing the piston engine. The relationship between these objects is called inheritance.","When the object or class representing the ceramic piston engine inherits all of the aspects of the objects representing the piston engine, it inherits the thermal characteristics of a standard piston defined in the piston engine class. However, the ceramic piston engine object overrides these ceramic specific thermal characteristics, which are typically different from those associated with a metal piston. It skips over the original and uses new functions related to ceramic pistons. Different kinds of piston engines have different characteristics, but may have the same underlying functions associated with it (e.g., how many pistons in the engine, ignition sequences, lubrication, etc.). To access each of these functions in any piston engine object, a programmer would call the same functions with the same names, but each type of piston engine may have different\/overriding implementations of functions behind the same name. This ability to hide different implementations of a function behind the same name is called polymorphism and it greatly simplifies communication among objects.","With the concepts of composition-relationship, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism, an object can represent just about anything in the real world. In fact, one's logical perception of the reality is the only limit on determining the kinds of things that can become objects in object-oriented software. Some typical categories are as follows:\n\n","With this enormous capability of an object to represent just about any logically separable matters, OOP allows the software developer to design and implement a computer program that is a model of some aspects of reality, whether that reality is a physical entity, a process, a system, or a composition of matter. Since the object can represent anything, the software developer can create an object which can be used as a component in a larger software project in the future.","If 90% of a new OOP software program consists of proven, existing components made from preexisting reusable objects, then only the remaining 10% of the new software project has to be written and tested from scratch. Since 90% already came from an inventory of extensively tested reusable objects, the potential domain from which an error could originate is 10% of the program. As a result, OOP enables software developers to build objects out of other, previously built objects.","This process closely resembles complex machinery being built out of assemblies and sub-assemblies. OOP technology, therefore, makes software engineering more like hardware engineering in that software is built from existing components, which are available to the developer as objects. All this adds up to an improved quality of the software as well as an increased speed of its development.","Programming languages are beginning to fully support the OOP principles, such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and composition-relationship. With the advent of the C++ language, many commercial software developers have embraced OOP. C++ is an OOP language that offers a fast, machine-executable code. Furthermore, C++ is suitable for both commercial-application and systems-programming projects. For now, C++ appears to be the most popular choice among many OOP programmers, but there is a host of other OOP languages, such as Smalltalk, Common Lisp Object System (CLOS), and Eiffel. Additionally, OOP capabilities are being added to more traditional popular computer programming languages such as Pascal.","The benefits of object classes can be summarized, as follows:\n\n","Class libraries are very flexible. As programs grow more complex, more programmers are forced to reinvent basic solutions to basic problems over and over again. A relatively new extension of the class library concept is to have a framework of class libraries. This framework is more complex and consists of significant collections of collaborating classes that capture both the small scale patterns and major mechanisms that implement the common requirements and design in a specific application domain. They were first developed to free application programmers from the chores involved in displaying menus, windows, dialog boxes, and other standard user interface elements for personal computers.","Frameworks also represent a change in the way programmers think about the interaction between the code they write and code written by others. In the early days of procedural programming, the programmer called libraries provided by the operating system to perform certain tasks, but basically the program executed down the page from start to finish, and the programmer was solely responsible for the flow of control. This was appropriate for printing out paychecks, calculating a mathematical table, or solving other problems with a program that executed in just one way.","The development of graphical user interfaces began to turn this procedural programming arrangement inside out. These interfaces allow the user, rather than program logic, to drive the program and decide when certain actions should be performed. Today, most personal computer software accomplishes this by means of an event loop which monitors the mouse, keyboard, and other sources of external events and calls the appropriate parts of the programmer's code according to actions that the user performs. The programmer no longer determines the order in which events occur. Instead, a program is divided into separate pieces that are called at unpredictable times and in an unpredictable order. By relinquishing control in this way to users, the developer creates a program that is much easier to use.","Nevertheless, individual pieces of the program written by the developer still call libraries provided by the operating system to accomplish certain tasks, and the programmer must still determine the flow of control within each piece after it's called by the event loop. Application code still \u201csits on top of\u201d the system.","Even event loop programs require programmers to write a lot of code that should not need to be written separately for every application. The concept of an application framework carries the event loop concept further. Instead of dealing with all the nuts and bolts of constructing basic menus, windows, and dialog boxes and then making these things all work together, programmers using application frameworks start with working application code and basic user interface elements in place. Subsequently, they build from there by replacing some of the generic capabilities of the framework with the specific capabilities of the intended application.","Application frameworks reduce the total amount of code that a programmer has to write from scratch. However, because the framework is really a generic application that displays windows, supports copy and paste, and so on, the programmer can also relinquish control to a greater degree than event loop programs permit. The framework code takes care of almost all event handling and flow of control, and the programmer's code is called only when the framework needs it (e.g., to create or manipulate a proprietary data structure).","A programmer writing a framework program not only relinquishes control to the user (as is also true for event loop programs), but also relinquishes the detailed flow of control within the program to the framework. This approach allows the creation of more complex systems that work together in interesting ways, as opposed to isolated programs, having custom code, being created over and over again for similar problems.","Thus, as is explained above, a framework basically is a collection of cooperating classes that make up a reusable design solution for a given problem domain. It typically includes objects that provide default behavior (e.g., for menus and windows), and programmers use it by inheriting some of that default behavior and overriding other behavior so that the framework calls application code at the appropriate times.","There are three main differences between frameworks and class libraries:\n\n","Thus, through the development of frameworks for solutions to various problems and programming tasks, significant reductions in the design and development effort for software can be achieved. A preferred embodiment of the invention utilizes HyperText Markup Language (HTML) to implement documents on the Internet together with a general-purpose secure communication protocol for a transport medium between the client and the Newco. HTTP or other protocols could be readily substituted for HTML without undue experimentation. Information on these products is available in T. Berners-Lee, D. Connoly, \u201cRFC 1866: Hypertext Markup Language\u20142.0\u201d (November 1995); and R. Fielding, H, Frystyk, T. Berners-Lee, J. Gettys and J. C. Mogul, \u201cHypertext Transfer Protocol\u2014HTTP\/1.1: HTTP Working Group Internet Draft\u201d (May 2, 1996). HTML is a simple data format used to create hypertext documents that are portable from one platform to another. HTML documents are SGML documents with generic semantics that are appropriate for representing information from a wide range of domains. HTML has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information initiative since 1990. HTML is an application of ISO Standard 8879; 1986 Information Processing Text and Office Systems; Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML).","To date, Web development tools have been limited in their ability to create dynamic Web applications which span from client to server and interoperate with existing computing resources. Until recently, HTML has been the dominant technology used in development of Web-based solutions. However, HTML has proven to be inadequate in the following areas:\n\n","Sun Microsystem's Java language solves many of the client-side problems by:\n\n","With Java, developers can create robust User Interface (UI) components. Custom \u201cwidgets\u201d (e.g., real-time stock tickers, animated icons, etc.) can be created, and client-side performance is improved. Unlike HTML, Java supports the notion of client-side validation, offloading appropriate processing onto the client for improved performance. Dynamic, real-time Web pages can be created. Using the above-mentioned custom UI components, dynamic Web pages can also be created.","Sun's Java language has emerged as an industry-recognized language for \u201cprogramming the Internet.\u201d Sun defines Java as: \u201ca simple, object-oriented, distributed, interpreted, robust, secure, architecture-neutral, portable, high-performance, multithreaded, dynamic, buzzword-compliant, general-purpose programming language. Java supports programming for the Internet in the form of platform-independent Java applets.\u201d Java applets are small, specialized applications that comply with Sun's Java Application Programming Interface (API) allowing developers to add \u201cinteractive content\u201d to Web documents (e.g., simple animations, page adornments, basic games, etc.). Applets execute within a Java-compatible browser (e.g., Netscape Navigator) by copying code from the server to client. From a language standpoint, Java's core feature set is based on C++. Sun's Java literature states that Java is basically, \u201cC++ with extensions from Objective C for more dynamic method resolution.\u201d","Another technology that provides similar function to JAVA is provided by Microsoft and ActiveX Technologies, to give developers and Web designers wherewithal to build dynamic content for the Internet and personal computers. ActiveX includes tools for developing animation, 3-D virtual reality, video and other multimedia content. The tools use Internet standards, work on multiple platforms, and are being supported by over 100 companies. The group's building blocks are called ActiveX Controls, small, fast components that enable developers to embed parts of software in hypertext markup language (HTML) pages. ActiveX Controls work with a variety of programming languages including Microsoft Visual C++, Borland Delphi, Microsoft Visual Basic programming system and, in the future, Microsoft's development tool for Java, code named \u201cJakarta.\u201d ActiveX Technologies also includes ActiveX Server Framework, allowing developers to create server applications.

Before the present invention, the Resources architecture offerings provided services that supported the construction, execution and operation of very large custom built solutions. In the last few years, client needs have shifted towards requirements for solutions that continually integrate well with third party applications (i.e., data warehouse and portion of the present description management systems). Previous engagements have proven that it is difficult to integrate these applications into a new solution. As application vendors continue to produce new releases that incorporate technical advancements, it is even more difficult to ensure that these integrated applications continue to work with a given solution.","The ReTA approach to constructing, executing and operating a solution emphasizes the ability to change solution components with minimal impact on the solution as a whole.

These issues relate to the fact that the application is based on the use of Active Server Pages, Microsoft Transaction Server components and Java Classes.","Sequence of Events","To perform the code migration, certain steps should be followed to ensure that users that are currently in the application are not adversely affected. This can be accomplished by performing the migration in the following order:","Using the Internet Information Server administration utility, monitor the site's number of active users. A count of zero indicates that no clients are currently hitting the site. Shut down the web listener to prevent additional users from connecting to the site.","Within the MTS Administration tool, shut down all server processes. This cleans up an components that may still be awaiting garbage collection from the Java Virtual Machine.","If the component interfaces have not been modified, it is possible to copy the new version of the Java Classes directly to the new environment. If the interfaces have been changed, the MTS administrator may need to delete and recreate the individual components within MTS.","Copy any new web server files (ASP, HTML, graphics, etc.) to the target directories on the web server.","Restart the web listener to allow users access to the application.","Module Location","There are basically three types of modules that get migrated during a ReTA engagement. Web Server files, Application files and database objects.","Web Server modules include Active Server Pages (ASP), static HTML portion of the present descriptions, graphics or images and JavaScript files. The ASP and HTML portion of the present descriptions may have security restrictions placed on them from within Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) and from the Windows NT Server. Security can be set to include individual user accounts, groups\/roles, or no security.","Application Server\u2014Two file types are migrated within application servers, COM Dynamic Link Library's and Java Classes. Both files are created during the application and architecture build processes. The COM DLL's require registration within MTS by inserting them into a MTS Package. In the event that the Web and Application servers are two physically different machines, an export process is required between them to instruct the Web server where the business components physically reside. For more information on the registration and exporting processes refer to the MTS online help.","In the case of the Java Classes, they need to reside in a directory that is defined within the server's \u2018CLASSPATH\u2019 environment variable. For ReTA Phase 1 & 2 development and testing all runtime files were located with C:\\ReTA. Therefore the following classpath environment variable was defined on each developer's workstation:\n\n","Database Server\u2014These items include tables, views, sequences, triggers, stored procedures and functions, and user\/schema information. These items are not necessarily particular to multi-tiered development. However, care should be taken to ensure that architecture tables and other objects are located separately from the application objects.","Security","Within the ReTA application model, security is enforced at the Web and Application Servers. In the case of Web server security, access to ASP and HTML files can be restricted using the Access Control List security provided by Windows NT. Security on these objects can be set at the group (role) or individual user levels.","A component within MTS utilizes role-based security to determine who may or may not have access to a specific COM component. A role is a symbolic name that defines a group of users for a package of components. Roles extend Windows NT security to allow a developer to build secured components in a distributed application.","For example,  depicts the application of Roles  within the Microsoft Transaction Server Management console . The package labeled \u2018ReTA Applications\u2019  has a single role defined as being able to access it, \u2018ReTA User\u2019 . Users that are members of the local \u2018ReTA Administrators\u2019 and \u2018ReTA User\u2019 Windows NT groups , are allowed to function in the ReTA User capacity defined for this package.","Due to the security options available at both the Web and Application server levels, care should be taken during code migration to ensure that security settings are consistent and applied correctly to ensure accurate execution.","MTS Transactions","Within MTS, every component has a transaction attribute that can be set by the MTS administrator to indicate what level of participation a component has within a transaction. Care must be taken during MTS component migrations to ensure that the correct transactional attributes are set within MTS.","The transaction attribute can have one of the following values:\n\n","Many configuration management tools are available on the market today, some of which provide many features useful for code promotion and management.","During the ReTA Phase 1 engagement, was utilized for it's labeling and source code management capabilities. Additionally, the database could be utilized for source code migrations that required change management knowledge and approval. In the event that client requires the use of paper or email based migration control, the template can be used.","Procedures\/Standards","Processes","The processes that guide development within ReTA engagement environments are represented in , which illustrates an environment migration process . These processes include creating a new application , modifying an existing application, and applying emergency bug fixes . The solid lines represent stages required for new\/modified application process. Dashed lines show the path for emergency bug fixes. Note: The term application used here is broadly applied to any managed module or component.","Processes are defined by stages shown as individual boxes. Through these stages, applications are eventually (or quickly in the case of emergency bug fixes) promoted to production. Stages provide for initiating, managing, securing and coordinating changes to applications.","The stages for the projects were developed in conjunction with representatives from each development team. It is important to note that the development stages represent the lifecycle of an application, not data. Within each development stage, there can be multiple data sets. For example, within the system test stage, an application team might wish to run several test cycles in parallel. In order to do that and keep the data consistent, a database for each cycle is required.","The CM process may ensure application modules are promoted through the development stages in a consistent manner. It is up to each application team to decide how to use each stage. For example, the application testing team may want four databases within the system test stage for different types of tests, whereas the assembly testing team may only want two.\n\n","A very important tenet of the CM process is that an application modification can only be in one stage at any point in time. Consider the example of module. Module starts out in development. When the development team indicates, the Source Code Librarian moves module into system test. As soon as that happens, no changes can be made to module. Only after module is promoted to production  can modifications be made to the module (further enhancements, bug fixes, etc.). The purpose for this rule is to prevent the situation where one developer is modifying a module when that module needs to have a bug fix to continue testing. There is one exception to this rule, emergency fixes.","When the situation dictates an emergency fix, the module affected needs to be modified immediately. When this happens, the module in question should be fixed within the development stage. When the fix is made, the module may immediately be put back into production. However, the same change also needs to be applied\/promoted to the module in system test stage. This may allow modules in system test to always be current with what is in production.","The CM process depends on change control records (CCR) for tracking changes to the system. A change control record is created for every new module or modification. The CCR is used to coordinate migrations and communicate status for each module in the system. One may see the use of the CCR throughout every process description. The CCR processing system may be automated through Notes.","Major tasks and responsibilities define each stage of a process and are covered in the pages that follow. These tasks and responsibilities are not intended to be a development methodology. Any references to deliverables and\/or portion of the present descriptions is informational only and provided to help anchor an already existing development methodology. However, specific deliverables and portion of the present descriptions required for the change management process are required and may be highlighted.","Development\/Unit Test","Development team checks required application source code out of source code control. See , which illustrates a Development\/Unit test  for existing applications. Note: In the event that this is a new application, the developer may use the appropriate template from source code control.","As needed, DBA  checks required database source code out of source code control. Also as needed, DBA works with development team to approve and prepare modifications to development database. All work occurs on developer's workstation using local web and application server processes. Note: A shared web\/application may be used for vendor staging.","Unit testing is ongoing during development. The development team checks modified application source code into source code control. The development team also fills in a change control record indicating which modules have changed. As needed, the DBA checks modified database source code into source code control. A source Code Librarian  verifies\/prepares necessary objects for building new applications. Unit test and development is completed. In some cases, a string test may be required. The system test team is notified, such as by e-mail.","Deliverables from this stage might include:\n\n","CM Deliverables from this stage include:\n\n","With reference to , an assembly test team  reviews user requirements and prepares validation or test plan.

Both applications are relatively simple use and administer. Visual SourceSafe is preferred for small to medium sized engagements and PVCS Version Manager is preferred for large, enterprise-scale development efforts. For a complete description of the configuration and usage of the Microsoft Visual SourceSafe application as it was utilized on the ReTA Phase 1 engagement, refer to Source Control.","Visual SourceSafe","Visual SourceSafe from Microsoft ships with the Visual Studio suite and as such is tightly integrated with the Visual Integrated Development Environments.

(See , which illustrates Microsoft Visual SourceSafe \u2018Labels\u2019 ). Labels allow for marking a specific set of files within the repository with a logical name and version. At a later point, it is possible to display the different labels and retrieve the desired version.","Environment Management","This portion of the description identifies the miscellaneous application and system-level services that do not deal with the human-computer interface, communication with other programs, or access to information. Environment Management Services identify each component used to perform the operating system services, system level services, application services, and run-time services.","Systems Management","In order to maintain an effective and secure infrastructure, System Management procedures are essential in the success of obtaining a stable environment. These systems require tools, utilities and processes that allow administrators to monitor running components and change their configuration. Systems Management involves all functions required for the day to day operation of the ReTA environment (e.g. event monitoring, failure control, monitoring, tape loading, etc.). Regardless of the changes taking place within the Net-Centric environment, Systems Management activities must take place in an on-going manner.","System Startup & Shutdown","A comprehensive development environment rapidly becomes sufficiently complex that the startup and shutdown of the environment must be managed carefully, and preferably automated. This is key to ensuring the integrity of the environment. Startup may involve the carefully sequenced initialization of networking software, databases, web servers and more. Similarly, shutdown involves saving configuration changes as needed and gracefully taking down running software in the correct sequence.","An Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) provides a server with power when the AC power fails or is marginal. The UPS may also shut the server down, in an orderly fashion, in the event of a power failure. The UPS may not shut down the server if the power failure is brief.","The Smart UPS 1400 should be configured with an interface to the server. The recommended interface is the serial port B (COM2) on most servers. PowerChute Plus 5.0 software from American Power Conversion is the recommended choice.","The basic purpose of PowerChute Plus is to safely shut down an operating system and server in the event of a power failure. To do this properly, PowerChute Plus needs the UPS to provide battery power to the system while PowerChute shuts down the system. This is where the correct sequencing of Events becomes important.\n\n","The incremental value of the daily work performed on the development project is high. This investment must be protected from problems arising from hardware and software failure, and from erroneous user actions and catastrophes such as fires or floods. The repositories and other development information must therefore be backed up regularly. Backup and restore procedures and tools must be tested to ensure that system components can be recovered as anticipated. The large volumes of complex data generally require automation of backups and restores.","The advent of Netcentric technologies has introduced an increase in media content that requires storage. The environment may support a high volume of media files, which must be considered in the backup\/restore plans. Storage capacity planning should allow for the typically increased size of these file types.","As the amount of storage may grow significantly over time on a large project, the hardware requirements may increase. Sufficient room for growth should be planned when selecting the tools and hardware. Switching tools and hardware can be problematic due to lack of upward compatibility (DDS-DLT, various tools etc.).","The time required for backups must also be considered. Usually the number of hours without development per day decreases over time and if backups can only be performed when no user is logged in, this might become a problem. It is generally the case that the project may benefit from buying the fastest and largest backup hardware\/software it can afford.","Storage Management","ReTA may implement an automated tape management system that provides location\/retention special handling, file integrity and data protection.","Archiving","Archiving can be particularly useful to safeguard information from previous versions or releases. More generally, it is used to create a copy of information that is less time-critical than the current environment at a given time. Archiving may be performed to a medium, which is different from the backup medium, and may involve other tools, which, for example, provide a higher compression ratio.","Performance Monitoring","Performance Management ensures that the required resources are available at all times throughout the distributed system to meet the agreed upon SLAs. This includes monitoring and management of end-to-end performance based on utilization, capacity, and overall performance statistics. If necessary, Performance Management can adjust the production environment to either enhance performance or rectify degraded performance.","Operating System","Windows NT may function as the ReTA Phase 1 Development Environment operating system, handling Environment System Services such as multi-tasking, paging, memory allocation, etc.","System Level Services","The Windows NT Domain Controller allows users and applications to perform system-level environment services such as a login\/logoff process for authentication to the operating system; enforced access control to system resources and executables; and access to the local or remote system's user or application profiles.","Application Services","The ReTA Phase 1 Frameworks may perform application Security Services, Error Handling\/Logging Services, State Management Services and Help Services within the application.","State Management","State Management Services enable information to be passed or shared among windows and\/or Web pages and\/or across programs. In Netcentric environments, the HTTP protocol creates a potential need for implementing some form of Context Management Services (storing state information on the server). The HTTP protocol is a stateless protocol. Every connection is negotiated from scratch, not just at the page level but for every element on the page. The server does not maintain a session connection with the client nor save any information between client exchanges (i.e., web page submits or requests). Each HTTP exchange is a completely independent event. Therefore, information entered into one HTML form must be saved by the associated server application somewhere where it can be accessed by subsequent programs in a conversation.","Security Services","ReTA implements Application Security through the ReTA Session and Activity frameworks. The Session framework provides \u201cSession level Page access authorization\u201d, \u201cUser identification\u201d and \u201csession timeout\u201d services. The Activity framework provides \u201cActivity level Page access authorization\u201d.","Error Handling\/Logging Services","Error Handling Services support the handling of fatal and non-fatal hardware and software errors for an application. An error handling architecture takes care of presenting the user with an understandable explanation of what has happened and coordinating with other services to ensure that transactions and data are restored to a consistent state.","Logging Services support the logging of informational, error, and warning messages. Logging Services record application and user activities in enough detail to satisfy any audit trail requirements or to assist the systems support team in recreating the sequence of events that led to an error.","Runtime Services","The ReTA Phase 1 Development Environment may use the Microsoft Transaction Server and the Microsoft Java Virtual Machine as a Run-Time Environment System Service. This affords a layer of abstraction between the applications and the underlying operating system.","Problem Management","Problem Management tools help track each system investigation request\u2014from detection and portion of the present description to resolution (for example, Problem Tracking, Impact Analysis, Statistical Analysis). Several problem management software packages are available from a variety of vendors.","Tool Recommendation","SIR Workbench","The SIR Workbench is another Microsoft Access tool that was developed for small to medium sized projects. It provides basic functionality of entering, modifying and reporting of architecture and application problems encountered during the testing and release phases of the project life cycle.","Visual SourceSafe","Visual SourceSafe (VSS) from Microsoft ships with the Visual Studio suite and as such is tightly integrated with the Visual Integrated Development Environments. One of the features provided by VSS is the ability to search through the source code for given text strings. This is useful for performing impact analysis.","Security Management","Security Management tools provide the components that make up the security layer of the final system, and may provide required security controls to the development environment. While some of these tools may be considered as nothing more than security-specific Packaged Components, many are an integral part of the development environment toolset.","Database","Development Database security may be minimal. Database User IDs may be setup to grant user-level security. The engagement Database Administrator (DBA) may have a logon to allow for full permissions. Otherwise, a Developer ID may allow read\/write access and a Core User ID may allow for read access only.","Network","A Windows NT Group created specifically for the engagement may protect the Development shared file folder and subsequent sub-folders (ex \u2018ReTAArch\u2019). Project members individual network accounts may be added to the Domain Group ensuring access. Local network administrators may be responsible for the creation and maintenance of individual and group account information.","Application Server","The application server has two forms of security: Static security and dynamic (context dependent) security.","A Windows NT group may be created for each Role in the completed application (e.g. Customer, Manager). Microsoft Transaction Server's integrated Windows NT security allows the developer to determine the security rights for each component.","The dynamic, context dependent security is implemented by the developer using the Event Handler framework for the logging and display of errors to the user.","Web Server","The web server has static security for each page and security to maintain control of the flow between pages. The static security uses the Windows NT group for each user role to restrict access to each page. For the flow control, the developer uses the Session framework to restrict the ordering of page requests. The allowed ordering of pages are entered into the Session database tables.","Systems Building","System Building tools comprise the core of the development architecture and are used to design, build, and test the system.","Analysis & Design","The BI Methodology has several application development routes that apply to different development scenarios. Routes currently exist in the methodology for custom and packaged application development. Component development is among several routes to be developed. Until the component development route is completed, component-based projects should be planned using a combination of BI Methodology and ODM task packages.","In general, BI Methodology should be used for all tasks that are independent of a specific technology. For example, tasks related to business modeling, user interface design, training development, package selection, and product testing should all be taken from BI Methodology rather than ODM. These technology-independent tasks typically occur early (business modeling, solution strategy, and requirements gathering) and late (product testing through deployment) in the project.","ODM content should be used for all tasks that are related to component and object development. In addition, ODM is the primary source for those tasks related to obtaining characteristics associated with component- and object-based development (such as flexibility and reuse). When using ODM task packages, take care to ensure that one consider how they link with the other elements of business integration (such as human performance).","Data Modeling","Description","Data Modeling tools provide a graphical depiction of the logical data requirements for the system. These tools usually support diagramming entities, relationships, and attributes of the business being modeled on an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD). Several techniques have evolved to support different methodologies (e.g., Chen, Gane & Sarson, and IDEF).","As systems are often built on top of legacy databases, some data modeling tools allow generation of an object model from the legacy database data model (DDL). By understanding the E-R diagram represented by the database, it is easier to create an efficient persistence framework, which isolates business components from a direct access to relational databases. Caution is required, however, as the resulting model is at best only partial, as an object model has dynamic aspects to it as well as static relationships, and may not correctly reflect the analysis performed in the problem domain.","When a component or object-based approach is used, data modeling is not performed. Rather, the object model represents both the data and the behavior associated with an object. In most systems, relational databases are used and the object model must be mapped to the data model. Standard mechanisms for mapping objects exist.","Tool Recommendation","Visual Studio","Microsoft's Visual Studio 6.0 includes a database diagram tool that helps developers visualize structures of tables and relationships within a relational database. See , which illustrates a Database Diagram  within Visual Studio . Using this project within Visual Studio it is possible to, for example:\n\n","Additionally, Rational Software's Rational Rose 98 provides Oracle data modeling functionality including schema analysis, SQL\/DDL generation, reporting and editing. For a complete description of the product and its features visit the Rational Rose Website at www.rational.com.","Performance Modeling\/Management","Description","The performance of a system must be analyzed as early as possible in the development process. Performance modeling tools support the analysis of performance over the network. A simple spreadsheet may be suitable in some well-known and understood environments, but dedicated performance modeling tools should be considered on any project with high transaction volumes or complex distributed architectures involving several platforms.","In the case of Internet-based applications, as the Internet is not a controlled environment, performance modeling is limited to those components within the domain of the controlled environment (i.e. up to the Internet Service Provider). However, in the case of intranet-based systems, where the environment is controlled from end-to-end, performance modeling may be performed across the entire system.","Performance modeling for components involves the analysis of the projected level of interaction between components and the level of network traffic generated by this interaction. It is important for performance reasons that communication between components is minimized, especially if these components are distributed.","Tool Recommendation",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0490","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0095","list-style":"none"},"li":["Visual Quantify","Tivoli","Sniffer Basic","Application Expert\n\nObject Modeling\n\nDescription\n"]}},"An object model usually contains the following deliverables:\n\n","Tools such as MS Word, MS PowerPoint, ABC Flowchart (MicroGrafix), may be used to produce these deliverables.

The Security Management Architecture deliverable is used to illustrate the potential security implications. The ReTA Security Management Architecture portion of the present description is divided into three main portions in order to encompass security requirements for Development, Execution and Operation Architecture.","Development Architecture Security Management","Preserving security of information as it travels across the Internet, or even your own intranet, has become increasingly complex. The Internet is a public resource accessible worldwide, and is built on a foundation of inherently insecure technologies. Information which is available across the Internet is becoming more and more sensitive as business continue to deploy to the Internet. Implementing effective security in our new Net Centric computing environments presents some challenges without a doubt, but not insurmountable ones. By designing security into your Net Centric solution, and implementing the appropriate application, infrastructure, and procedural controls, security can be appropriately aligned with business risk. See , which illustrates an IDEA Framework  with components in scope ReTA Phase 1.","Everyone today is talking about Net Centric security. Keeping up with all of the security issues surrounding Net Centric technologies is more than a full time job, it has become a full time obsession. When designing a Net Centric solution, security is always at the forefront of everyone's mind, but what are the important things to consider? How do I know that I've addressed all the appropriate questions? How may my solution affect the security of my computing environment? How may that security impact my business? This paper may answer these questions, providing an overview of \u201cthings to consider\u201d when designing a Net Centric solution. It may not attempt to provide detailed technical solutions, but it may navigate one to the right path to find that information.","Impacts","Security Impacts","There is no question that the trend toward Net Centric computing may impact the traditional computing environment. Systems are much more distributed, and applications are being used by a larger number of people to reach new objectives every day. Along with all of these changes come significant security impacts. So what is it about Net Centric computing that can lead to security problems?","First of all, the Internet is a public resource. Traditionally our computer systems were only used or accessible by a small audience which we knew and could control. Now our computer environment is linked to the Internet, which is accessible to virtually anyone who has the time and the money to invest. While most of these people have good intentions when it comes to using your resources, some have an evil purpose. Threats can come from many sources: teenage hackers, spies from other companies, even curious people who inadvertently cause damage. The public nature of the Internet also increases the ability of these malicious individuals to collaborate and recruit others, thus strengthening their cause. The Internet contains a wide variety of information that people are interested in, from public information resources to sensitive customer databases.","In addition to the very lure of interesting information on the Internet, there are vulnerabilities inherent to Internet technologies which can make that information more easily compromised. In fact, the original intent of the Internet was to share information, not to be used as a business tool. Security weaknesses are widespread and present in nearly all Internet related technologies. The very communication protocol used, TCP\/IP, was designed with few provisions to protect the security of the data packet.","Of course, security problems weren't created with the Internet; many of our standalone computer systems have the same types of security exposures. However, the global nature of the Internet now transfers these insecure services rapidly around the world. Weaknesses that before could only have been exploited by a small number of users with access to the system, can now be exploited by virtually anyone. These breaches are also now publicized to the entire Internet community. For example, many high profile web pages have recently been attacked, including NASA, the Department of Justice, and the CIA. Although these attacks were limited to vandalizing their web pages, (as far as we know), the publicity generated from the attacks has raised questions about the security of their systems in general. Internet access not only made these attacks possible, it also publicized the attack around the world.","This rapid transfer of information raises an issue regarding the dynamic nature of today's environment. The Net Centric environment includes traditional long term users of systems, as well as one time users who require instant logons and immediate connections. Security may stand in the way of business objectives if it is not flexible and dynamic enough to adapt to ever-changing business and technology requirements. In addition, new threats and risks evolve quickly in the Net Centric environment, and security programs may become ineffective and obsolete if not reviewed and updated regularly.","The Internet also brings with it a whole new set of legal issues, and topping the list are potential privacy implications. Businesses can now track your every movement on the Internet, from your email and IP addresses, to each site you surfed to and which ad one clicked. Does this constitute an invasion of your privacy? One may have freely given other businesses sensitive information aboutonerself, such as one's credit card number or one's social security number. To what lengths must that business go to in order to protect that information? If and when that information is compromised, who is liable? What is the penalty for breaking into a computer to which one is not granted access? What if one just looks around and does not cause any damage? These questions are just beginning to be addressed as cases are introduced in court and legislation is passed in Congress. But we are a long way from finding all the answers.","All of these security concerns have been widely publicized in the media, to the extent that the public now perceives security as a major issue on the Internet. These concerns may have the effect of impeding the success of an Internet solution, or even delaying a business decision to deploy to the Internet. Even as new technology emerges to solve many Internet related security problems, public opinion, legitimate or not, may still impact the success of any Internet solution.","Application Impacts","There are obviously a myriad of security implications from the move towards Net Centric computing. The Internet, and the growth of local intranets, has made our computing environment look much different today than it did five years ago. So what does this mean? When designing a business solution in this new environment, security implications have to be considered at every step of the process. Application design presents a specific set of security related challenges.","Application Design","The underlying theme in application design, from a security perspective, is to design in security from the beginning. Talk to Information Security representatives, and even internal auditors early on, and get their approval for your design. This can save retrofitting costs in order to achieve an adequate level of security, and may also end up giving one a more secure solution by integrating security right into the design of the application.","Once one is considering security, what is the best way to design it into your application? Even the most pompous security expert should recognize that your primary goal is not to build an application with really good security, it is to build an application that achieves a specific business goal. The challenge is to integrate security into that business goal so that it may not impede efficiency. Often security is tacked on a the last minute and impedes performance in the application, such that users may bypass security if possible, and curse it if not possible.","The next step is to consider the basic parameters of your application and how security applies to each of them.","Who needs access to the application, i.e. what is your user group? Is it all Internet users or some authorized subset? Does one only have one type of user or are multiple levels of authorization required?","Where may your application may be accessed from, the Internet or your intranet? How much control do one has over the security of that location and PC?","What is the confidentiality of the information your application may be transmitting or accessing? What implications would there be if that information fell into the wrong hands?","Once these questions have been answered one can begin to choose the appropriate tools or mechanisms to provide an adequate level of protection.","When designing your application, consider implementing the minimum level of functionality and authority required to meet your business goal. This is often contradictory to basic instinct when designing a new solution, but consider the potential implications. If your application does not need to allow users to execute arbitrary operating system commands, don't let it. If your application does not need to run as root or supervisor, don't let it. Designing for minimum functionality may obviously be a tradeoff between business and security benefits, but in general, it is better meet the level of authority required, not exceed it.","Security Integration","When designing security into your application, remember that one may not have to re-invent the proverbial wheel. Most information security groups may have corporate security strategies with which one can integrate. For example, an enterprise wide authentication scheme may be in use, with which one can integrate for remote access. Or there may be a single sign-on product with which your application may need to be compatible. Even if there is not a corporate security strategy in place today, consider the direction that the company is moving toward, and provide for future integration if possible.","Auditing and Logging","Application auditing and logging is often overlooked because it is less than glamorous, but it does provide security administrators with a crucial tool for monitoring use of an application. Good logs should be searchable for known or suspected patterns of abuse, and should be protected from alteration. Logs can monitor a virtual myriad of data, including access times, user IDs, locations from where the application was accessed, actions the user performed, and whether or not those actions were successfully completed.","Web Browser Security","While web browsers may not be exactly part of your application design, they are intimately related to many of the design decisions one may make, such as the programming tools one uses and the format your user interfaces take. The application programming tools portion of the description, above, discussed some possible ways a Web browser can exploit application security flaws. There are also design anomalies within the Web browsers themselves which can be exploited. Microsoft has fixed many of these flaws in their newest release of Internet Explorer, but their older versions are still vulnerable. This type of problem demonstrates that when considering integration with the major commercial web browsers, it is important to monitor news releases for recent security flaws. One may want to consider requiring your users to use the latest, most secure version of their Web browser if possible.","Infrastructure Impacts","Today's Net Centric computing infrastructure requires a complex mix of operating systems, web servers, database servers, firewalls, management tools, routers, and underlying network components. Each different component of this infrastructure has specific security considerations which need to be addressed. These requirements are always growing and changing, as are the solutions which can be implemented. When designing this complex infrastructure, similar to designing an application, security should be considered early on in the process.","Operating System Security","It is crucial to choose an operating system (OS) which can provide adequate security; and once chosen it is just as important to configure that OS in a secure manner. Any OS must address the same basic security questions, such as restricting permissions for what each user can access, limiting what actions each user can perform, providing monitoring and logging of user access, and restricting what services are available. Windows NT is without exception.","NT has been publicly available for over three years now, and while security issues may have appeared, fresh out of the box NT is a very secure OS. But there are still steps to take to improve this security. Configure your OS securely from the start, implement tools where appropriate, and continue to monitor the bulletin boards and vendor announcements for problems as they come up.","Web Server Security","Many of the OS security guidelines apply to web servers as well. Regardless of your choice of web server, it is important to configure that server securely. The server should be set to run under an ID which is used only by that web server, and never as root. Directory permissions should be assigned according to a need to know philosophy, and your portion of the present description root (where published information is stored) should be different from your server root (where server binaries and configuration files are stored.)","In addition to these somewhat generic operating system security tips, there are several features which are specific to a web server which could create security exposures. In general, if one doesn't need a feature, don't turn it on; and if one does need a feature, make sure the potential security risks are understood. Server side includes allow HTML authors to place commands inside their portion of the present descriptions that cause output to be modified whenever that portion of the present description is accessed by a user. Hackers can take advantage of server side includes if they are able to place arbitrary HTML statements on your server and then execute them.","Legacy System Integration","In order to truly take advantage of the power of Net Centric computing, new technologies need to be mixed and integrated with existing systems. More sophisticated intranets and extranets often require on line transactions or database inquiries of legacy environments which may not have the level of granular control required for secure access. In some cases, it may be possible to mirror the information from an existing platform to a more securable web server or database. This may protect the integrity of your sensitive systems while still providing the access for your on-line transactions. If a mirror system is not possible, a thorough audit should be performed of the security of your legacy system, to ensure that one is providing access to only those resources which are allowed.","Network Security","Now one has chosen your access control mechanisms, configured your OS, and it's time to connect to your network. This action may strike fear into the heart of many network and system administrators, because this may create one more way network security can be compromised. Contrary to popular belief, it is possible to establish and maintain effective network security. The first step is to understand what all of your network components are, and how they are connected. By examining your network topology, one can determine where all of your access points are, and (hopefully) the way that access to them is controlled. If remote access directly into your network is required, the use of your modems must be appropriately restricted.","Don't rely on knowledge of the phone number or a single static password as effective security controls.","In addition to identifying one's access points, one should examine the path that one's traffic follows, and determine if that path is vulnerable to snooping and attack. One of the more infamous hacker gangs, the Masters of Deception, once infiltrated a major telecommunication provider's data network, and had access to the corporate secrets of hundreds of companies as information was sent across the lines. Even if your data is just traveling over internal links, a network management station could still be monitoring traffic, or a sniffer could illicitly be installed anywhere along the line. There are two major security controls that mitigate these risks: firewalls to restrict who can access your secure network, and encryption to protect your data as it's sent over an insecure network.","Firewalls","Firewalls are often thought of as THE answer to network security. There is a common misconception that purchasing and installing the \u201cbest\u201d firewall available may automatically protect your network from the Internet. This is not necessarily true. In fact there are many factors to consider when choosing a firewall, and when placing and configuring that firewall in your environment. First of all, consider the type of network connection your are trying to protect. Firewalls are not only used to separate your intranet from the Internet, they can also be used to segregate a particularly sensitive or particularly insecure area of your intranet from the rest of your network. Depending on the services one wants to provide your users and what risk one is willing to accept, your choice of the \u201cbest\u201d firewall implementation may change.","There are many different components of the firewall architecture to consider. Packet Filtering Systems selectively route packets between internal and external hosts by either the type of packet, the originating host address, or the target host address. Packet filtering is typically implemented on a specific type of router called a screening router.","Proxy Services are specialized applications or server programs that run on a firewall host, which take users' requests for Internet services (such as ftp and telnet) and forward them, as appropriate according to the site's security policy, to the actual services. The proxies provide replacement connections and act as gateways to the services. For this reason, proxies are sometimes known as Application Level Gateways.","A Bastion Host is typically a dual-homed gateway with one interface on the internal network and one on the external network. It can be used to run proxy services or perform stateful packet inspection. The bastion host typically acts as the main point of contact for incoming connections from the outside world, including email, ftp and telnet requests, and DNS queries about the site.","A Perimeter Network or DMZ refers to a small network between your internal network and the Internet which provides an extra layer of security. Any publicly available resources one provides, such as a Web server or an ftp server, may typically be located in the DMZ, and restricted from one's internal network by a firewall machine or bastion host.","There are many commercially available firewall products that provide some or all of these features. Which product or firewall configuration is right for one may depend on what one's network looks like, what one is trying to protect, and what your users require.","Event Monitoring","Before an incident can be responded to, it must first be detected. In the Net Centric environment, your firewall, routers, web servers, database servers, applications, and network management tools must be monitored to ensure they are working correctly and no violations have occurred. Monitoring packages can be configured to take different actions on a series of specified events, such as sending an email message if a log fills up, flashing an icon on a system administrator's screen if someone's user ID is disabled, or paging a network administrator if a link to the ISP goes down. Once this initial notification takes place, there should be escalation procedures to decide whom to notify next. For example, if the link to the ISP goes down, how long does one wait before notifying one's manager? one's users? In addition, not all monitoring needs to be reactive. There are proactive monitoring tools available which can detect patterns of abuse or failure which may lead to larger problems, and can help one detect those problems before they affect your users.","Backup and Recovery","People kick over servers, accidentally delete files, and spill coffee on machines. For these reasons and a host of others, Net Centric resources must be backed up in a manner so that they can be recovered. This does not mean dumping a bunch of files onto data tapes and stacking them in a corner of the server room. An effective backup and recovery strategy should address how backups may be taken, the media on which they may be stored, the location where they may be stored, and the frequency with which they may be taken. Backups should also be periodically tested to make sure that they are recoverable, for example to make sure the backup tape drive is still working. When designing your backup strategy one should also consider the specific types of applications, databases, and hardware which are in use in your environment. For example an Oracle database may probably not be recoverable from a .tar file. In addition to software resources, consider what would happen if your router or your ISP link were to go down. It may be necessary to maintain a backup link to a secondary service provider in the event that your ISP goes down for an extended period of time.","Execution Architecture Security Management","The Execution Architecture Security focuses on Authorization, Encryption and Authentication in order to securely support applications and ensure data integrity throughout the life cycle of a single transaction. The ReTA Effort chose the Netcentric Architecture Framework (NCAF) to identify the appropriate components to focus on within the Execution Architecture. See  which illustrates a NCAF Framework  with the shaded components  in scope for Phase 1.","Authentication","Regardless of the operating system that one is using, access control is a major security concern. NT authenticate users by their knowledge of an ID and password that can be used multiple times however, all passwords are vulnerable in some manner. The advent of sniffing technologies allows passwords to be monitored and read over the network. Even if passwords are encrypted as they are sent, a keystroke capturing program could be installed at the client PC and used to capture passwords before they are encrypted. Perhaps advanced client side security can mitigate this threat as well, but even with the highest technology solution, a user could write his password down and stick it to the side of his PC, thereby defeating all of the technology just implemented.","The solution to this problem is some type of two factor authentication, meaning that users are authenticated with something they have, and something they know. The \u201csomething they know\u201d can still be a password, and the \u201csomething they have\u201d can range from the high end being a one time password generator, to the low end being an ID file stored on the user's PC or on a disk. In choosing an appropriate solution, one should consider ease of management and ease of distribution, the required strength of the solution, and integration into your environment. There are several examples of technologies which can meet your requirements, including the use of one-time passwords, time based passwords, or challenge response schemes. Once chosen and implemented, a secure authentication mechanism can be incorporated with both your operating system and your application to remove the risks associated with static passwords. Some authorization options are depicted in this","Authentication Matrix:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0606","num":"0827"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00056","num":"00056"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Product","Description","Pros","Cons","Implementation","Vendors"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Smartcards","The smart card is a plastic","Strong","Additional","4-6 people","WetStone"]},{"entry":[{},"card having the size and","Authentication","Hardware","weeks","Schumberger"]},{"entry":[{},"shape of a credit card, and","Login from","No Standard",{},"SmartCard Technologies"]},{"entry":[{},"containing a","various","Slow"]},{"entry":[{},"microprocessor chip with","locations","Acceptance"]},{"entry":[{},"both secure storage of","Scalability"]},{"entry":[{},"public\/private key data"]},{"entry":[{},"and cryptographic"]},{"entry":[{},"processing capabilities"]},{"entry":["PKI","The system required to","Strong","Requires","4-24 people","GTE Cybertrust"]},{"entry":[{},"provide public-key","Authentication","infrastructure to","weeks","VeriSign"]},{"entry":[{},"encryption and digital","Enables the use","operate",{},"Entrust"]},{"entry":[{},"signature services.

In order to guarantee confidentiality over any insecure network, including the Internet, some type of encryption must be used. Encryption may ensure that data cannot be read by anyone other than the secure target server, and that the data being transferred has not been altered. Today there are so many different strategies for implementing encryption, it is often difficult to choose which scheme is most appropriate. The specific encryption strategy chosen may rely on a number of factors.","What information exactly needs to be encrypted? If one is running a smart store over the Internet, maybe one only needs to encrypt the single piece of data that has the customer's credit card information. If one is allowing their system administrators to dial into their network via the Internet, one may probably want to encrypt the whole session.","How many users are there? If one want to just encrypt data between a few users and one's system, a private or secret key encryption scheme may be appropriate. If one is in a multi-user environment one may probably want to consider public key encryption, and the key management strategies that go along with it.","What does one's computing environment look like? If your applications or operating systems provide native encryption, these may be the easiest and most secure to implement.","Based on your answers to these questions, there are a number on encryption solutions available for implementation. If one is running a Netscape web server, one may want to consider Secure Sockets Layer, or SSL, which provides data encryption, server authentication, message integrity, and optional client authentication for a TCP\/IP connection. Another WWW security solution is Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (S-HTTP), which is a security-enhanced version of HTTP, developed by Enterprise Integration Technologies (EIT). S-HTTP supports end-to-end secure transactions by incorporating cryptographic enhancements to messaging at the application level. Pretty Good Privacy, or PGP, is a common encryption solution for electronic mail. PGP may both authenticate the sender of the message, and encrypt the contents of the message through the use of a public key\/private key pair. In electronic commerce solutions, the Secure Electronic Transactions (SET) specification which is being jointly developed by Visa and MasterCard may be considered. SET may require authentication of all parties involved with a credit card transaction through the use of digital signatures and certificates, and may use a separate encryption handshake in order to guarantee both confidentiality and integrity. Other encryption solutions include Point to Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP), Private Communication Protocol (PCT), or the use of CryptoAPI.

ReTA abstracts database connection from the application developer through the Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS) 2.0 connection pooling mechanism.","Object Messaging","Description","Object Messaging enables objects to transparently make requests of and receive responses from other objects located locally or remotely. Objects communicate through an Object Request Broker (ORB). An ORB enables client objects to access server objects either locally or remotely over a network and invoke operations (i.e. functions and methods) on them. ORBs typically provide interoperability between heterogeneous client and server environments: across languages and\/or operating systems and\/or network protocols.","ReTA Implementation","ReTA implements Object Messaging services through Microsoft's COM\/DCOM mechanism.","Security Services","Communications Security services control access to network-attached resources.","Combining network Security services with security services in other parts of the system architecture (e.g., application and database layers) results in robust security.","Authentication","Description","Authentication services verify network access requests by validating that users are who they claim to be. For secure systems, one or more authentication mechanisms can be used to validate authorized users and to verify to which functions and data they have access.","ReTA Implementation","ReTA implements Authentication services through Microsoft's NT 4.0 Server (and IIS).","Authorization","Description","Authorization services determine if users have appropriate permissions and either allows or disallows the access.","ReTA Implementation","ReTA implements Authorization services through Microsoft's NT 4.0 Server (and IIS). ReTA also supports application defined \u201crequired workflow sequence\u201d web page access authorization through the ReTA Session framework.","Encryption","Description","Encryption services encrypt data prior to network transfer to prevent unauthorized interception. Encryption has two main components: the encryption algorithm, which is the series of steps that is performed to transform the original data; and the key, which is used by the algorithm in some way to encrypt the message. Typically, the algorithm is widely known, while the key is kept secret. There are several types of encryption in use today, including:\n\n","ReTA implements Encryption services through the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) mechanism. ReTA also implements encryption for the User ID and User Password used by the ODBC mechanism through the ReTA Session framework.","Environment Services","Environment Services provide miscellaneous application and system level services that do not deal directly with managing the user-interface, communicating to other programs, or accessing data. Sub-components covered during the Phase 1 of ReTA include: Application Services, Component Framework, Operating System, Runtime Services, and System Services.","Application Services","Application Services are miscellaneous services which applications can use for common functions. These common functions can apply to one application or can be used across applications. They include: Application Security Services, Error Handling\/Logging Services, State Management Services, Help Services, and Other Common Services.","Application Security","Description","Besides system level security such as logging into the network, there are additional security services associated with specific applications. These include:\n\n","ReTA implements Application Security through the ReTA Session and Activity frameworks. The Session framework provides \u201cSession level Page access authorization\u201d, \u201cUser identification\u201d and \u201csession timeout\u201d services. The Activity framework provides \u201cActivity level Page access authorization\u201d.","Codes Table Services","Description","Codes Table Services enable applications to utilize externally stored parameters and validation rules. For example, an application may be designed to retrieve the tax rate for the State of Illinois. When the user enters \u201cIllinois\u201d on the screen, the application first validates the user's entry by checking for its existence on the \u201cState Tax Table\u201d, and then retrieves the tax rate for Illinois. Note that codes tables provide an additional degree of flexibility. If the tax rates changes, the data simply needs to be updated; no application logic needs to be modified.","ReTA Implementation","ReTA implements Codes Table Services through the ReTA Codes Table framework.","Error Handling\/Logging","Description","Error Handling Services support the handling of fatal and non-fatal hardware and software errors for an application. An error handling architecture takes care of presenting the user with an understandable explanation of what has happened and coordinating with other services to ensure that transactions and data are restored to a consistent state.","Logging Services support the logging of informational, error, and warning messages.","Logging Services record application and user activities in enough detail to satisfy any audit trail requirements or to assist the systems support team in recreating the sequence of events that led to an error.","ReTA Implementation","ReTA implements Error Handling\/Logging Services through the ReTA Event Handler and Persistence frameworks.","Other Common Services","Description","Catchall category for additional reusable routines useful across a set of applications (e.g., Date Routines, Time Zone Conversions, Field Validation Routines).","ReTA Implementation","ReTA implements client side Field Validation Services through the ReTA UI framework.","State Management","Description","State Management Services enable information to be passed or shared among windows and\/or Web pages and\/or across programs. In Netcentric environments, the HTTP protocol creates a potential need for implementing some form of Context Management Services (storing state information on the server). The HTTP protocol is a stateless protocol. Every connection is negotiated from scratch, not just at the page level but for every element on the page. The server does not maintain a session connection with the client nor save any information between client exchanges (i.e., web page submits or requests). Each HTTP exchange is a completely independent event. Therefore, information entered into one HTML form must be saved by the associated server application somewhere where it can be accessed by subsequent programs in a conversation.","ReTA Implementation","ReTA implements State Management Services through Microsoft's IIS Session component and the ReTA Session, Activity and UI frameworks.","Component Framework","Description","Component Framework Services provide an infrastructure for building components so that they can communicate within an application and across applications, on the same machine or on multiple machines across a network, to work together. COM\/DCOM and CORBA described in Communication Services are the two leading component industry standards. These standards define how components should be built and how they should communicate.","Object Request Broker (ORB) services, based on COM\/DCOM and CORBA, focus on how components communicate. Component Framework Services, also based on CORBA and COM\/DCOM, focus on how components should be built.","ReTA Implementation","ReTA implements Component Framework Services through the ReTA Activity framework.","Operating System","Description","Operating System Services are the underlying services such as multi-tasking, paging, memory allocation, etc., typically provided by today's modern operating systems. Where necessary, an additional layer or Application Programming Interface (API) may be provided to gain either operating system independence or a higher level of abstraction for application programmers.","ReTA Implementation","ReTA implements Operating System Services through the NT 4.0 operating system.","Runtime Services","Runtime services convert non-compiled computer languages into machine code during the execution of a program. They include: Language Interpreter Service and Virtual Machine Service.","Language Interpreter","Description","Language Interpreter Services decompose a 4th generation and\/or a scripting languages into machine code (executable code) at runtime.","ReTA Implementation","ReTA implements Language Interpreter Services through NT server 4.0 and IIS 4.0.","Virtual Machine","Description","Typically, a Virtual Machine is implemented in software on top of an operating system, and is used to run applications. The Virtual Machine provides a layer of abstraction between the applications and the underlying operating system and is often used to support operating system independence.","ReTA Implementation","ReTA implements Virtual Machine Services through NT 4.0 Virtual Machine component.","System Services","Services which applications can use to perform system-level functions. These services include: System Security Services, Profile Management Services, Task and Memory Management Services, and Environment Verification Services.","Environment Verification","Description","Environment Verification Services ensure functionality by monitoring, identifying and validating environment integrity prior and during program execution. (e.g., free disk space, monitor resolution, correct version). These services are invoked when an application begins processing or when a component is called. Applications can use these services to verify that the correct versions of required Execution Architecture components and other application components are available.","Profile Management","Description","Profile Management Services are used to access and update local or remote system, user, or application profiles. User profiles, for example, can be used to store a variety of information such as the user's language and color preferences to basic job function information which may be used by Integrated Performance Support or Workflow Services.","ReTA Implementation","ReTA implements Profile Management Services through ReTA Session framework.","System Security","Description","System Security Services allow applications to interact with the operating system's native security mechanism. The basic services include the ability to login, logoff, authenticate to the operating system, and enforce access control to system resources and executables.","Task & Memory Management","Description","Task & Memory Management Services allow applications and\/or other events to control individual computer tasks or processes, and manage memory. They provide services for scheduling, starting, stopping, and restarting both client and server tasks (e.g., software agents).","ReTA Implementation","ReTA implements Task & Memory Management Services through MTS 2.0.","Information Services","Information Services manage electronic data assets and enable applications to access and manipulate data stored locally or remotely in portion of the present descriptions or databases. They minimize an application's dependence on the physical storage and location within the network. Information Services can be grouped into two categories: Database Services, and Portion of the present description Services. Portion of the present description Services may not be covered during ReTA Phase 1.","Database Services","Database Services are responsible for providing access to a local or a remote database, maintaining integrity of the data within the database and supporting the ability to store data on either a single physical platform, or in some cases across multiple platforms. Database Services include: Access Services, Indexing Services and Security Services.","Access","Description","Access Services enable an application to retrieve data from a database as well as manipulate (insert, update, delete) data in a database. This can be done through the following:\n\n","ReTA implements Database Access Services through the ReTA Persistence framework, which utilizes the Standards Based SQL API approach through ODBC.","Indexing","Description","Indexing Services provide a mechanism for speeding up data retrieval. In relational databases one or more fields can be used to construct the index. So when a user searches for a specific record, rather than scanning the whole table sequentially the index is used to find the location of that record faster.","ReTA Implementation","ReTA implements Database Indexing Services through the Database Management System (either Oracle or SQL Server).","Security","Description","Security Services enforce access control to ensure that records are only visible or editable by authorized people for approved purposes. Most database management systems provide access control at the database, table, or row level as well as concurrency control.","ReTA Implementation","ReTA implements Database Security Services through the Database Management System (either Oracle or SQL Server).","Presentation Services","Presentation Services enable an application to manage the human-computer interface. This includes capturing user actions and generating resulting events, presenting data to the user, and assisting in the management of the dialog flow of processing. Typically, Presentation Services are only required by client workstations. Sub-components covered during the Phase 1 of ReTA include: Window System, Desktop Manager, Form, Web Browser, Report & Print, and Direct Manipulation.","Desktop Manager","Description","Desktop Manager emulates the idea of a physical desktop allowing one to place portion of the present descriptions on the desktop, launch applications by clicking on a graphical icon, or discard files by dragging them onto a picture of a waste basket.","ReTA Implementation","ReTA implements Desktop Manager Services through the NT 4.0 operating system.","Direct Manipulation","Description","Direct Manipulation Services enable applications to provide a direct manipulation interface\u2014(often called \u201cdrag & drop\u201d).","ReTA Implementation","ReTA implements Desktop Manager Services through the NT 4.0 operating system.","Form","Description","Form Services enable applications to use fields to display and collect data. Form Services provide support for: Display, Mapping Support, and Field Interaction Management.","ReTA Implementation","ReTA implements Form Services through the NT 4.0 operating system.","Report & Print","Description","Report and Print Services support the creation and on-screen previewing of paper or photographic portion of the present descriptions which contain screen data, application data, graphics or images.","ReTA Implementation","ReTA implements Report and Print Services through the NT 4.0 operating system.","Web Browser","Web Browser Services allow users to view and interact with applications and portion of the present descriptions made up of varying data types, such as text, graphics, and audio. These services also provide support for navigation within and across portion of the present descriptions no matter where they are located, through the use of links embedded into the portion of the present description content. Web Browser Services retain the link connection, i.e., portion of the present description physical location, and mask the complexities of that connection from the user. Web Browser services can be further subdivided into: Browser Extension, Form, and User Navigation.","Browser Extension","Description","Browser Extension Services provide support for executing different types of applications from within a Browser. These applications provide functionality that extend Browser capabilities. The key Browser Extensions are:\n\n","ReTA supports Browser Extensions through Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer.","Form","Description","Like Form Services outside the Web Browser, Form Services within the Web Browser enable applications to use fields to display and collect data. The only difference is the technology used to develop the Forms. The most common type of Forms within a browser are Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) Forms. The HTML standard includes tags for informing a compliant browser that the bracketed information is to be displayed as an editable field, a radio button, or other form-type control. Currently, HTML browsers support only the most rudimentary forms\u2014basically providing the presentation and collection of data without validation or mapping support. When implementing Forms with HTML, additional services may be required such as client side scripting (e.g., VB Script, JavaScript).","ReTA Implementation","ReTA implements Form Services through the NT 4.0 operating system, Internet Explorer 4.0 and Netscape Navigator 4.0. ReTA supports creating the form objects and the JavaScripts used by the browsers with the ReTA UI framework.","User Navigation","Description","User Navigation Services within the Web Browser provide a user with a way to access or navigate between functions within or across applications. These User Navigation Services can be subdivided into three categories:\n\n","ReTA implements the Hyperlink functionality of web browser Navigation Services through the ReTA UI framework.","Window System","Description","Typically part of the operating system, the Window System Services provide the base functionality for creating and managing a graphical user interface (GUI)\u2014detecting user actions, managing windows on the display, and displaying information in windows.","ReTA Implementation","ReTA implements Window System Services through the NT 4.0 operating system.","Transaction Services","A transaction is a unit of work that has the following (ACID) characteristics:\n\n","A transaction can be terminated in one of two ways: the transaction is either committed or rolled back. When a transaction is committed, all changes made by the associated requests are made permanent. When a transaction is rolled back, all changes made by the associated requests are undone.","Transaction Services provide the transaction integrity mechanism for the application. This allows all data activities within a single business event to be grouped as a single, logical unit of work.","Transaction Monitor","Description","The Transaction Monitor Services are the primary interface through which applications invoke Transaction Services and receive status and error information. Transaction Monitor Services, in conjunction with Information Access and Communication Services provide for load balancing across processors or machines and location transparency for distributed transaction processing.","ReTA Implementation","ReTA implements Transaction Monitor Services through MTS 2.0. ReTA uses the Activity framework to define a transaction.","Resource Management","Description","A Resource Manager provides for concurrency control and integrity for a singular data resource (e.g., a database or a file system). Integrity is guaranteed by ensuring that an update is completed correctly and entirely or not at all. Resource Management Services use locking, commit, and rollback services, and are integrated with Transaction Management Services.","ReTA Implementation","ReTA implements Resource Manager Services through MTS 2.0.","Transaction Management","Description","Transaction Management Services coordinate transactions across one or more resource managers either on a single machine or multiple machines within the network. Transaction Management Services ensure that all resources for a transaction are updated, or in the case of an update failure on any one resource, all updates are rolled back.","ReTA Implementation","ReTA implements Transaction Management Services through Microsoft's Distributed Transaction Manager and MTS 2.0.","Transaction Partitioning","Description","Transaction Partitioning Services provide support for mapping a single logical transaction in an application into the required multiple physical transactions. For example, in a package or legacy rich environment, the single logical transaction of changing a customer address may require the partitioning and coordination of several physical transactions to multiple application systems or databases. Transaction Partitioning Services provide the application with a simple single transaction view.","ReTA Implementation","ReTA implements Transaction Partitioning Services through Microsoft's Distributed Transaction Manager and MTS 2.0.","Business Logic","The execution architecture services are all generalized services designed to support the applications Business Logic. Normally, how Business Logic is to be organized is not within the scope of the execution architecture. However, the ReTA Application Frameworks extend the services of the execution architecture to support the \u201cInterface Controller Model\u201d (ICM) pattern approach to packaging the Business Logic as components.","Business Logic is the core of any application, providing the expression of business rules and procedures (e.g., the steps and rules that govern how a sales order is fulfilled). As such, the Business Logic includes the control structure that specifies the flow for processing business events and user requests. In a ReTA application, the Application Frameworks define a structured approach to the concepts of Interface, Application Logic, and Data Abstraction.","Interface logic interprets and maps the actions of users into business logic processing activities. With the assistance of Presentation Services, Interface logic provides the linkage that allows users to control the flow of processing within the application. ReTA implements this service through the UI and Activity Frameworks. Application Logic is the expression of business rules and procedures (e.g., the steps and rules that govern how a sales order is fulfilled). As such, the Application Logic includes the control structure that specifies the flow for processing for business events and user requests. The isolation of control logic facilitates change and adaptability of the application to changing business processing flows. ReTA implements this service through the Activity Framework.","Information Access Services isolate the Business Logic from the technical specifics of how information is stored (e.g., location transparency, RDBMS syntax, etc.). Data Abstraction provides the application with a more logical view of information, further insulating the application from physical information storage considerations. ReTA implements this service through the Persistence Framework.","The ReTA Application Frameworks provides services that encourage and support the thin-client model. Also, the Frameworks shield business logic developers from the details and complexity of architecture services (e.g., information services, component services) and other business logic.","Execution Architecture Physical Model","Purpose","The ReTA Execution Architecture Physical Model portion of the description shows the actual components comprising the Execution Architecture and their relative location and interfaces. Additionally, the model depicts the platforms on which the components may reside as well as the distribution across the environment. The components in the Physical Model may support a portion of a function or more than one function from the functional model.","Physical Configuration","The content for this portion of the description is defined in the Technology Infrastructure Procurement List portion of the present description.","Physical Model",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0723","num":"0996"},"figref":"FIG. 47","b":["4700","4702","4704","4706","4708","4710"]},"Operations Architecture Design","Overview","The Operations Architecture is a combination of tools, support services, procedures, and controls required to keep a production system up and running efficiently. Unlike the Execution and Development Architectures, its primary users are the system administrators and the production support personnel. With reference to , all components of the Operations Architecture  are integral to the successful management of a distributed environment. Any processes, procedures, or tools developed or chosen as an operational management solution for a specific operational area must be able to integrate with any existing or planned process, procedure, tool solutions for other Operations Architecture areas.","Operations Architecture Component Design","Physical Environment ","Implementing\u2014Initial Installation","Description","Initial Installation prepares the physical location for the rollout of a new site or service, pre-assembles the equipment (hardware and software) based on developed specifications, installs the equipment and tests that the equipment is fully functional prior to allowing the users to utilize the system in a production environment. Precise build procedures must be delivered early enough to drive Release Testing, Procurement, and rollout plans. For large multi site installations that require significant rollout of new hardware, optimization of the configuration tasks (hardware and software) can be achieved through the use of a central staging facility.","Planning Considerations","The deployment of the physical environment must be scheduled as early as possible, and detailed communication regarding the technology infrastructure deployment plan should be distributed regularly to key stakeholders.","Where a pilot implementation has taken place previously, or is in progress, the experiences from this activity need to be incorporated into the deployment plans. The purpose of a pilot implementation essentially is to minimize the risks of full implementation. Any experiences from the pilot should be identified and plans to avoid trouble, or accelerate progress, should be included within the deployment work plan.","Ensure that the organizational functions are ready for the change. Functions of the organization may need to be ready for the technology infrastructure change before it is deployed. These functions include:\n\n","The organizations supporting these functions need to understand how their support roles may change, and what new demands the technology infrastructure may place upon them. Ensuring that these areas are comfortable supporting the new infrastructure, and that they are able to troubleshoot problems is critical to the overall support and success of the business capability.","Event\/Data Management","Event\/Data management is the process of receiving and classifying events. An event is a change in the state of a network component. There are two types of events\u2014solicited and unsolicited. A solicited event results from the direct (synchronous) polling of a network component  by a network management station  as represented in .","An unsolicited event occurs when a network component  sends (asynchronously) data to the network management station  as represented in .","Once the event is received, the management station classifies the event. If it is classified as a fault, it would then be passed to the fault management facility. Otherwise it is classified as a normal event and is logged for historical trending purposes.","Event Processing","Event processing manipulates the raw data obtained in the event\/data generation layer into a more workable form. This layer performs functions such as event filtering, alert generation, event correlation, event collection and logging, and automated trouble ticket generation. Event processing routes the processed information on to either the presentation or management applications layers. Again it is important to consider the interface of the event processing component with the other components of the operational architecture.","Event Management in a Net-Centric Environment","The MODEnc project has further defined Net-Centric Computing as the standards and considerations involved with Internet\/Intranet\/Extranet environments.","When using the Internet-based net-centric model , as shown, for example, in , Internet standards such as TCP\/IP, HTML and CGI are used to publish, interact, and transact with data\/content on the public Internet . Typically, a firewall  is implemented to secure a service provider's internal resources  from the public Internet. A service provider locates Internet-based resources outside of the firewall and may provide controlled access from the web to internal information through mechanisms such as CGI . Access to Internet resources may be through web browsers as depicted or via other mechanisms such as e-mail or ftp.","When using the Intranet-based net-centric model  as illustrated in , Internet standards are used within the confines of a private network to implement publish-, interact-, and transact-based applications. Browsers  are used to access HTML pages or other services located and controlled through internal web servers .","When using the Extranet-based net-centric model , as illustrated in  companies share computing resources by connecting over the Internet  or Virtual Private Network (VPN). Each company typically shields its internal networks from the public Internet via firewalls , and provides controlled access through the firewalls to its partner's resources.","When performing the Event Management function in a net-centric environment, the following factors should be considered:\n\n","Net-centric service providers must consider that the Internet provides few event management services. Though a service provider's systems that reside outside the firewall may host SNMP and\/or other event management agents, public Internet hosts currently may not provide event management data to a 3rd party service provider.","New Events [Internet, Intranet, Extranet]","New event metrics such as metrics related to an Internet connection may be required to get an accurate overall picture of the net-centric environment health. The emerging thin client architecture may also require new event categories.","Integration with Other System Management Tools [Internet, Intranet, Extranet]","Events generated by net-centric management tools may need to integrate with other system management applications.","Centralized Event Polling Issues [Internet, Intranet, Extranet]","Management of a net-centric environment relies more heavily on remote sites generating and queuing their own event management information. The reason for this is if there is a network failure, a centralized polling approach to event management may not be able to assess the health of nodes behind a broken network link. Remote nodes must generation their own events, queue them in case of failure, and resends the queued events upon reestablishment of network connections.","Intra-Application Events Should be Analyzed [Internet, Intranet, Extranet]","Service Providers should monitor not only what pages\/interfaces that users are accessing, but what they are doing within each page\/interface to maximize the marketing value of usage data. This can also provide valuable input to application design teams in making application refinements.","SNMP in a Net-Centric Environment [Internet, Intranet, Extranet]","Since SNMP traps may have to traverse multiple networks, and MIBs may need to send management information to multiple stakeholders, managing events across net-centric environments can be difficult. An Internet Service Provider (ISP) may have to consider clever filtering to ensure that the right traps get to the right users.","Presentation","The presentation component provides the interface between the manager(s) of the system and management data generated by the system. Data can be manipulated for various forms of output. By integrating the operational architecture it is possible to reduce the number of front-end interfaces required. Commonly, the presentation component uses a GUI front-end interface. This component is also responsible for real-time and historical report generation.","Management Applications","Management applications are those tools which are used to manage the system. Most of the MODE functions tie directly into this component. The management applications component ties in directly with the integration platform component as the management applications tools must comply with the standards set by the integration platform. Management applications receive data from the event\/data generation, event processing, and repositories components and then send data to the presentation or repositories components. Management applications tools include capacity planning tools, performance management tools, license management tools, remote management tools, systems monitoring tools, scheduling tools, help desk tools, etc. Some Enterprise Management tools even poll the event\/data generators for information but these options may impact network performance. Web Server management has been introduced as part of the management operations framework. As Corporate Internets and Extranets implement Web based software products to sell and advertise business services, corresponding administrative, security, event notification and performance requirements must be performed similarly for the companies web based system. The two critical path issues are security management and network management.","Security Management","Security Management controls both physical and logical security for a Net-Centric environment. Due to the nature of the environment, security may need to be managed either centrally, remotely or through a combination of the two methods.","Security Management also handles the logging of proper and illegal access, provides a way to audit security information, rectify security breaches and address unauthorized use of the system.","Network Mangement","Network & Systems Management Planning is responsible for the planning activities involved in running the day-to-day operations and maintenance of the production systems\n\n","Repositories contain all the management data generated or used during the management process. This includes historical data, capacity data, performance data, problem knowledge bases, asset databases, solution sets, and management information bases (MIBs). The repositories component interacts with the management applications, integration platform, supporting infrastructure, and presentation components. Again it is important to make sure that the other components of the operational architecture are compatible with the database tools.","Backup\/Restore","Archiving","Integration Platform","The integration platform provides a common platform for the operational architecture. At the lowest level this means deciding on common standards, interfaces, massage formats, and file logging forms to be used with all the management tools. Products like Tivoli Management Environment, require the use of a separate integration platform component into which the management applications are connected. Many third party vendors insist that they provide solutions which incorporate the event\/data generation, event processing, repositories, and presentation components of the MAP operational architecture. It must be noted however that some of these total solution providers may sell a proprietary based solution, at best, and\/or may include customized Application Programming Interfaces (API) or Software Development Kit capabilities in order to completely integrate your non-proprietary network.","Lastly, some environments use a home grown integration platform. The choice of integration platforms depends upon its ability to integrate with the execution and development environments.","Supporting Infrastructure","The supporting infrastructure is the subset of operating systems, utilities, languages, and protocols used to support the management of the system. The supporting infrastructure is most often determined by the execution and development environments and the business applications on the system. It is necessary to ensure that the other components of the operational architecture are compatible with the existing supporting infrastructure.","Managing Hardware","Managing hardware is all hardware directly used to manage the environment. This includes all staging components. These components are devoted to systems management functions. Examples of managing hardware include management servers, management controllers, management consoles, probes, and sniffers. One significant component in the hardware monitoring arena is Firewall access control policy management. Firewalls are regularly used for network based security management. It is typically a system or group of systems that enforce access control between two or more networks and\/or perform network data packet filtering.","Usually packet filtering router hardware and application gateways are used to block unauthorized IP packets and enforce proxy defined user commands.","Management Tool Selection","It is important to note that there may be requirements which cannot be met by any tools. In this case, in-house development may be an alternative. This approach is likely to be more expensive, however, and more difficult to support the long term, and thus should usually be avoided if possible. Were possible, the tool with the best fit should be purchased, and customized to meet the necessary requirements. Some additional considerations are outlined below:\n\n","Overview","Assumptions","This portion of the present description assumes:","That the target hardware configuration for the database server meets the specified requirements for the software being installed.","Embodiments mentioned within this portion of the present description may not be current as of the time of this reading. Care should be taken to ensure that the latest embodiments are used and that individual installation processes are reviewed to ensure that any changes are followed.","Individuals performing this installation have experience in relational database concepts, tools, administration and performance tuning.","Database Model","Users and Schemas","The following table provides a list of the user accounts, roles and schemas used during ReTA Phase 1 development.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0763","num":"1054"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00059","num":"00059"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"161pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Account Name","Description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["RETA_ARCH","Architecture Schema.

A general knowledge of these technologies is important as one builds your Membership site.","Directory Services and the Membership Directory","A directory service is a database that stores organizational data and is highly optimized for database lookups (reads). Directory services provide an index of users and network resources. Site Server 3.0 contains Microsoft's most recent directory service, the Membership Directory. It is the central repository for user data, including member accounts, permissions, and site resources. All directory services use LDAP as their communicating protocol. In the future Microsoft Windows\u00ae 2000 Server may implement the much-talked-about Active Directory, which may take the Membership Directory to the next level. The Active Directory may also be responsible for storing all the information needed for the Windows NT domain architecture.","Lightweight Directory Access Protocol","Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is the underlying protocol used by Site Server Membership to communicate with the Membership Directory. LDAP was designed to be the standard Internet protocol for accessing directory services. LDAP runs on TCP\/IP networks and is independent of platform, allowing directory-based information to be shared across operating systems. Site Server Membership implements an LDAP service for reading and writing information to the Membership Directory database.","Active Directory Service Interfaces","As stated previously, the Membership Directory must be accessed using the LDAP protocol. Rather than making raw LDAP calls to the Membership Directory, Site Server Membership uses Active Directory Service Interfaces, better known as ADSI. ADSI provides a common standard interface to multiple directory services (through ADSI providers) and communicates with the directory services using LDAP. ADSI makes life easier by allowing the developer to write code to one API while working with multiple directory services.","Active User Object","Site Server provides the Active User Object (AUO) as a single component that aggregates all of a user's attributes from multiple Active Directory Service (ADS) providers. The primary provider is always the Membership Directory. The AUO is a COM object called membership.userobjects. It uses ADSI to retrieve a user's information from the Membership Directory and greatly simplifies the code a developer writes by automatically binding to the current user's information in the Membership Directory. The binding occurs when the component is created, but requires that the Web site be mapped to a Membership Server and that the user is authenticated.","Membership Directory Authentication","Authentication Choices","When one sets up a Membership Directory for a Web site, one must choose the type of authentication to be used. Membership may be set up to use Windows NT accounts (Windows NT Authentication) or accounts that reside solely in the Membership Directory database (Membership Authentication). Windows NT Authentication is most useful for intranet sites where one wish to leverage existing accounts and use the Windows NT Security Accounts Manager (SAM) for authentication. However, Membership Authentication is a good choice for Internet sites, especially sites in which the number of users may increase dramatically over time. As your user base grows, it is much easier to administer your accounts and privileges using Membership Authentication.","Since Integrated Direct Channel (IDC) uses Membership Authentication for the purposes mentioned above, further detail into that authentication method is discussed below:","Membership Server Mapping","It is important to note that Membership Authentication maps Membership groups to proxy Windows NT group accounts to determine a member's security permissions. One still has the benefit of the strong security of Windows NT and can administer security permissions for a Membership group by assigning permissions (ACLs) to the proxy account. For every group in the Membership Directory, Membership creates a corresponding Windows NT group called Site_directoryname_groupname, where directoryname is the name of the Membership Directory and groupname is the name of the Membership group.","Membership Authentication Configuration Options","Under Membership Authentication, there are also several options for configuration. There are four Security Support Providers available: 1) Automatic Cookie Authentication, 2) HTML Forms Authentication, 3) Distributed Password Authentication (DPA), and 4) Clear Text\/Basic Authentication. At all four of these levels, there is an Allow Anonymous option, which allows unrecognized users to access the site as a generic account called IUSR_[server_name].","1. Automatic Cookie Authentication","This method provides us with a quiet and discreet authentication method for both anonymous users and registered members. Cookie authentication issues two cookies\u2014SITESERVER and MEMUSER\u2014to store information on the user's computer. When this option is selected, the ISAPI (Internet Server Application Program Interface) filter (which was installed by the mapping of the Membership Server) parses the headers of the client and looks for the two cookies. There are three possibilities. If the cookies exist then the information found therein is used to authenticate and bind to a member. If the cookies are invalid then the member is redirected to an ASP page in the_mem_bin virtual directory. If the cookies don't exist then the ISAPI filter creates and binds to a new member in the Membership Directory, in the ou=AnonymousUsers container. Once bound to this user, two cookies are written to the browser. These two new cookies SITESERVER and MEMUSER may be used in future sessions to identify the member uniquely.","2. HTML Forms Authentication","To provide a more secure (but equally simple) form of authentication, we can use HTML Forms Authentication. This method of authentication uses HTTP's POST method to send the user's credentials to an ASP page, which handles the submission. The ASP page then makes use of a special COM object\u2014the VerifUsr object\u2014to verify the user's credentials. HTML Forms Authentication also makes use of the ISAPI Membership Authentication filter. When a user makes a call to a page that uses HTML Forms Authentication, ISAPI traps that call and redirects to a special ASP page called FormsLogin.asp. This page is provided in the_mem_user virtual directory of the web application. FormsLogin.asp is nothing more than an asp page with form elements for user login name and password. Upon submission, the page redirects with the form elements to verifpwd.asp, which contains the script to verify a user's credentials. If the user is authenticated, the user is taken to the page s\/he was trying to access and issues a FormsAuth cookie in addition to the SITESERVER and MEMUSER cookies.","3. Distributed Password Authentication (DPA)","DPA works for Membership authentication in much the same way as Challenge\/Response works for Windows NT Authentication. For DPA, users are authenticated against the Membership Directory (rather than the Windows NT SAM database). Moreover, since the username and password are never sent across the wire, DPA is very secure. Unfortunately, it's only possible for Windows Internet Explorer clients to use DPA where usernames and passwords are hashed with a challenge sent by the server.","4. Clear Text\/Basic Authentication","When we select Basic Authentication, we authenticate any user that requests a resource against the credentials stored in the Membership Directory. We can specify extra information with the user, from which to authenticate users. But here lies a difference between Basic Authentication under Windows NT authentication and Basic Authentication under Membership Authentication: in the former case this extra information is in the form of a domain, and in the latter case the information represents sub-containers in the directory. The Clear Text\/Basic Authentication method is supported by a number of applications, including Netscpape, and most clients should be able to use it.","Other Considerations","DPA and Clear Text\/Basic Authentication can be selected simultaneously. In this case, the server may first attempt to issue a DPA authentication challenge. If (and only if) the client cannot interpret the challenge, the server may offer the Clear Text\/Basic Authentication request.","IDC and Membership Authentication","The Integrated Direct team used HTML Forms Authentication with anonymous support under certain circumstances for a few reasons. First of all, this authentication method provides an html interface as opposed to a pop up dialog box. This gives the application a more consistent look and feel since the FormLogin.asp page is customizable with graphics and layout. HTML Forms Authentication is also has no compatibility issues that DPA or Clear Text\/Basic Authentication methods may have. It is simply an html page, which posts form elements to another asp page, which contains authentication methods. Finally, HTML Forms Authentication issues one session essential cookie, the FormsAuth cookie. The use of one cookie makes user administration issues, such as session time and logout, simpler.","Description","This portion of the description provides the steps necessary to configure a workstation for use doing application or architecture development on a ReTA engagement.","Assumptions","This portion of the present description assumes:","That the target hardware configuration for the workstation meets the specified requirements for the software being installed.","Embodiments mentioned within this portion of the present description may not current as of the time of this reading.

Accordingly, no attempt is made to explain HTML concepts such as frames and tables.","Scope","These standards are intended to be independent of any particular hardware, operating system, or development tool. Due to the nature of the Internet, platform independent code is imperative.","This guide covers standards for HTML 2.0 and does not cover standards for HTML 3.2. This embodiment can be assumed to be \u201csafe\u201d for all Web browsers. However, HTML 3.0 and 3.0+offer an extensive array of non-standard elements which enhances the presentation of a Web page. This guide may include tables and frames which are not fully supported by all browsers. Thus, when implementing tables or frames, it is important to consider your target audience and the type of browsers they may be using to surf the Internet.","There are a variety of tools to aid the authoring process of HTML. A HTML editing tool like WebEdit or a HTML template like Internet Assistant may not be consistent with our standards and guidelines. Projects using these HTML editors and converters are subject to the proprietary standards of their respective software applications.","Convention","In this guide, standards are presented as follows:\n\n","The statement of one or more standards is usually followed by a discussion of the standard(s). Such a discussion may include justifications for using the particular rule, common alternatives, other supplementary information, or even situations where the standard may not apply.","Program Organization","Source Code\n\n","file comment block\n\n","Defining a standard source file layout makes it easier to understand and maintain code written by other programmers.","File Names","HTML files adhere to the same naming and directory standards set forth by the Internet Center of Excellence (ICE). For more information, refer to the ICE portion of the present description on file naming and directory standards.","Programming Styles","HTML Tags",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0860","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0155","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0155-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0156","list-style":"none"},"li":"All HTML tags and attributes should be capitalized."}}}},"HTML is not case sensitive, however, to preserve readability, it is important to adhere to uppercase lettering for HTML tags.","However, some HTML editors, such as Microsoft FrontPage, generate lower-case HTML tages. Since more HTML editing may probably be done through similar tools, it does not make sense to have to go back through the code and make any changes. For this situation, simply adopt the format that your HTML tool generates, and make it consistent throughout your project.\n\n","Excluding tags such as <LI>, <HR>, <BR>, <IMG>, <META>, <BASE> and <P>, it is important to close a HTML tag with a <\/(tag name)>. For example, an open HTML tag is <HTML> and a closed HTML tag is <\/HTML>.

This setup is intended to simplify regression testing. There are limitations: this method cannot test interaction with widgets, for example, nor can it handle dynamic results. (An output such as today's date can't be hard-coded into getExpectedResults. Using method invocations in getExpectedResults would defeat the whole purpose of the test, as we might well be comparing garbage to identical garbage.)","The following example shows how this framework might be applied to the Account class.

Three different tests (load, stress, and performance) may be executed to accurately determine the performance picture of the ReTA Phase 2 architecture. Each test and its accompanying test cycles may be designed to simulate varying user volumes.","Key Differences Between Load, Stress and Performance Testing","For the purpose of this portion of the present description, Load, Stress and Performance Testing may be distinguished. It is important to understand the subtle differences amongst the three types of testing.","Load Testing","Load testing is used to subject a server to the load conditions that may be realized in a live production environment. This should enable the tester to make a more predictable assessment of the performance of a production system and thus eliminate much of the uncertainty. Load testing focuses on the number of users accessing the server, the combination of business transactions that are executed on the server, and the impact of the combination of users and transactions on different environment components.","Stress Testing","Stress testing extends the focus of the load test. Whereas load testing stresses the server to normal production levels to determine performance, stress testing focuses on locating the point at which server performance breaks down. This is achieved by steadily increasing the number of simulated users that execute a given transaction until a breaking point is reached. In addition, a variation of this test would be to execute a single transaction repeatedly for an extended period of time.","Performance Testing","Performance testing focuses on measuring performance for a specific transaction.","The performance of a server should be measured under different user load conditions. For ReTA Phase 3 testing, cycles may be executed against both Oracle 8 Enterprise and Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 databases.","Testing Process","For each of the performance tests, the following process may be used to plan, execute, and evaluate the results of the tests:","Plan the Scenario","Determine the goal of the test such as the number of simulated users, the transactions to be performed and the transactions to be timed.","Record Web Scripts","Record the steps a user may take to complete a transaction with the application. The majority of automated testing tools available on the market offer recording capabilities for the tester to capture the various actions that make up a single transaction as the tester navigates through the application.","Define the Scenario","A list of virtual users has to be defined in each workstation that is used for testing.","The number of virtual users and the scripts to be used by each virtual user have to be set up before the scenario can be run.","Run the Scenario","Since the execution script is pre-recorded, simply clicking a button can run it. The testing tool may automatically launch all the virtual users and keep track of their test status. It should also record and measure the server response time as well as other statistics.","Analysis of Performance Graphs and Reports","After the scenario has completed its run, the performance graphs may be generated and shown to the tester automatically. The tester can then analyze the graphs and reports available. Graphs should be available that provide individual page averages, complete scenario execution times, and high\/low response times.","Testing Application","The application to be used during the ReTA Phase 2 Performance Tests provides three simple business and operational function.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1416","num":"2031"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00132","num":"00132"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Functional Area","Description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Review\/Submit","This set of dialogs provides functionality for"]},{"entry":["Feedback","inputting and reviewing feedback.
