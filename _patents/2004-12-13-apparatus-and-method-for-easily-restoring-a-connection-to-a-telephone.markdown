{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The advent and continued development of telecommunication systems, including telecommunication systems that integrate voice, video, web services, and wireless communication systems, has led to an increased use and dependence thereon. Whether the dependence is a matter of necessity for business and\/or emergency service applications or a matter of convenience for personal contexts of use, there is a need to quickly and easily re-establish a communication link in the instance the communication link is interrupted. Interruptions to a communication link may occur for a number of reasons, such as, for example, a loss of a cellular telephone call signal between two or more communication devices using a cellular communication network.","One area of communication system design and applications in which improvement would be especially desirable relates to the reconnection of two or more communication devices that were previously communicating with each other. Accordingly, there exists a need to provide methods and apparatus for efficiently reconnecting two or more communication devices previously connected and communicating with each other, particularly in the instance the communication between the two or more devices is unexpectedly or undesirably interrupted.","Apparatus and methods are therefore presented for improved management and reconnection of telephone calls.","According to some embodiments, a method of reconnecting a telephone call is provided herein. The method may include establishing a first telephone call between a first communication device associated with a telecommunication system and at least one other communication device. The first call may be unexpectedly or otherwise undesirably interrupted. In some instances, the call may end and one or more of the participants in the telephone call (i.e., user or caller), may want to reconnect with other participants of the terminated call. The method may allow for a telephone call to be initiated to the telecommunication system from the first communication device using a predetermined number. In response to the call to the predetermined number, the telecommunication system may initiate a reconnect call to establish a second call between the first communication device and the at least one other communication device.","According to some embodiments, the first telephone call and the second telephone call may involve more than two communication devices, and the first communication device, at least, may be a wireless communication device (e.g., a cellular telephone).","According to some embodiments, ANI (Automatic Number Identification) information of the first communication device that initiated the call to the telecommunication system using the predetermined number is extracted and used to identify a caller associated with the ANI information.

Collaboration data  may include pre-configuration data to facilitate rapid set-up of future multi-media collaboration sessions.","Storage device(s)  may also store ANI (automatic number identification) data . ANI data  may include data concerning ANI information for a communication device (e.g., a cellular telephone, a landline telephone, or any other device that may have telephony functionality incorporated therein, such as, a PDA) associated with telecommunication system  and\/or server . ANI data  may include a series of digits, either analog or digital, that are included in a call that identifies the telephone number associated with a communication device making the call. Furthermore, ANI data  may include a pointer, reference, or other indicia associating a user with the communication devices identified as being associated with the ANIs stored in ANI data . Thus, a mechanism is provided for identifying a user (i.e., caller) that is associated with a communication device identified by the ANI and associated with telecommunication system  and\/or server .","It is noted that a user may have one or more communication devices connected to, or at least associated, with telecommunication system  and\/or server . A user may, for instance, own\/use a cellular telephone and a landline telephone associated with telecommunication system . Further, telecommunication system  may be aware of the presence and\/or activity of a communication device (e.g., cellular phone , landline phone , SIP telephone , or computer ) by virtue of, for example, functionality provided by server  or the like. For example, communication broker  may provide presence monitoring as mentioned hereinabove. Thus, telecommunication system  may be aware of a telephone call participated in by a communication device associated therewith. Part of the presence monitoring may be to detect, determine, or otherwise obtain the status and activity of communication devices associated with telecommunication system , including for example, the phone number of a communication device(s) connected to the telecommunication system  associated communication device in a telephone call.","Thus, telecommunication system  may be aware of the presence and activity of a first communication device associated therewith and communicating with a second one (or more) communication device(s) via a telephone call. Telecommunication system  may have knowledge of the users associated (e.g., registered) with the telecommunication system and the communication devices of the users associated with the telecommunication system. Thus, when the first communication device places a call to telecommunication system , telecommunication system  (e.g., via functionality provided by server ) may extract ANI information of the first communication device from the incoming call and determine that the first communication device is associated with telecommunication system  by referencing ANI data . ANI data  may include a pointer, reference, or other indicia to associate the telecommunication system  registered user with the extracted ANI information. Having determined the ANI-to-user information (e.g., using ANI data ) and having a knowledge of the activity of an associated user, telecommunication system  may ascertain the phone number of the second one (or more) communication devices previously engaged in a telephone call with the first communication device. Telecommunication system  may use the phone number of the second one (or more) communication devices previously engaged in a telephone call with the first communication device to implement a number of functions, including reconnecting the first communication device to the second one (or more) communication devices.","Storage device  may store other data and programs which are not explicitly indicated in , including data and programs in accordance with the OpenScape\u00ae software application, available from the assignee hereof.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["100","100"]},"At an initial operation , a user may associate or register a first communication device with telecommunication system . It is noted that the user may associate one or more communication devices with telecommunication system . The communication device may be any one of a number of devices having telephony functions incorporated, integrated, or associated therewith such as, for example, a landline phone , a SIP phone , and a cellular phone , or a PDA (not shown). Associating a communication device with telecommunication system  may encompass, for example, indicating which of a number of communication devices associated with the user of telecommunication system  is a \u201cpreferred\u201d device. As used herein, a preferred device may be a communication device designated as a preferred communication device for contacting the user. For example, in the instance a communication (e.g., email message, voice message, instant message, etc.) is directed to the user of telecommunication system , the communication will be routed to the preferred communication device of the user. The designation of the preferred device may by determined by the user, telecommunication system , or a combination of the user and system depending on, for example, a status of the user, and\/or a number of applicable rules governing contacting the user. The rules may be modified to suit a user's preferences or may be dictated according to system defaults.","It should be appreciated by those in the art that operation  may not be performed each and every time other aspects of process  (or other embodiments herein) are executed since, a user or telecommunication system  need not associate a communication device with telecommunication system  at every invocation of process . That is, process  may rely on a previous association of the first communication device with telecommunication system . As with other aspects of process , no implied temporal relationships are intended by the order or interconnecting arrows in .","At operation , a first call is established between the first communication device and at least one other communication device. For example, a registered user of telecommunication system  is called or initiates a call to at least one other communication device. In the instance the first call is a conference call, the first communication device may be connected to two or more communication devices. According to the operational capabilities of telecommunication system , the presence and activity of the first communication device and the first call is monitored by the telecommunication system. The telecommunication system  monitors and keeps a record of the communication connections for the first communication device.","At operation , a call is initiated to telecommunication system  from the first communication device using a predetermined number. The predetermined number may be referred to, in some instances, as a pilot number. The pilot number may be associated with certain functions and\/or features of telecommunication system . In particular, a call to the pilot number may invoke a reconnect process by telecommunication system  that reconnects the communication device calling into telecommunication system  using the predetermined pilot number to a previous call. That is, the reconnect process may reconnect the first communication device to the at least one other communication device that was connected thereto during the first call.","In some embodiments herein, a function or feature invoked by a call to the predetermined pilot number may be invoked automatically upon receipt of the call by telecommunication system . That is, the user may not have to perform any action(s) in order to solicit the desired function or feature associated with the pilot number other than initiating a call to telecommunication system  using the predetermined pilot number. In this manner, the need for a user to remember a personal identification number (PIN) and\/or password may be obviated.","At operation , in response to the call to the predetermined number, telecommunication system  may initiate a reconnect call to establish a second call between the first communication device and the at least one other communication device. The reconnect may be automatically invoked upon telecommunication system  receiving a call via the predetermined pilot number.","In some embodiments, the first call between the first communication device and the at least one other communication device (e.g., established at ) is terminated prior to the first communication device initiating the call to telecommunication system  (e.g., operation ).","Furthermore, the reconnect call may be facilitated by telecommunication system  extracting ANI information of the first communication device using information received with the receipt of the call to the predetermined pilot number from the first communication device. The ANI information may be used to identify the user of the first communication device by referencing a data store (e.g., database, lookup table, listing, etc.) of the users of telecommunication system  and ANIs associated with the users.","In some embodiments hereof, the call to telecommunication system  is terminated prior to a charged being incurred and charged to the calling party, the first communication device. Telecommunication system  may extract the ANI information and terminate the call before the call is answered since ANI information is transmitted in the telephone call signals prior to an actual voice connection being established (e.g., typically by the second ring of a call). In this manner, a user may avoid charges (e.g., toll, roaming, and long distance) when accessing the reconnect features disclosed herein. This aspect may provide savings, especially in the instance the first communication device is a cellular telephone operating outside of the cellular telephone's home cellular network.","In some embodiments herein, the predetermined pilot number may be stored in a memory associated with a memory associated with the first communication device. For example, the predetermined pilot number may be stored locally in a memory resident in a cellular telephone. The predetermined number may also be stored in a removable memory connected to the communication device such as, for example, a SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) card. Thus, the predetermined pilot number need not be remembered by a user and can be made portable for easy transport between multiple communication devices.","In some embodiments herein, the reconnect number is invoked to reconnect the first call between the first communication device and the at least one other communication device (e.g., operation ). However, telecommunication system  may be configured such that a reconnect call may selectively reconnect the first communication device to any number of prior calls, not only a most recent call (e.g., the first call). This aspect of the present invention may be implemented by telecommunication system  selectively providing a user the option of connecting to, for example, any one of the last three communication devices or calls connected to the first communication device.","In some embodiments herein, features and functions additional to or in lieu of a reconnect call may be invoked by calling the predetermined pilot number from the first communication device. Other such features may include other telephony features and functions associated with telecommunication system , such as, for example, changing a designation of a user's preferred device.","In the instance the first call is a conference call, telecommunication system  may further include the operation of determining whether the conference call is still in progress prior to initiating a reconnect call to reconnect the first communication device to the conference call, in response to the first communication device calling the predetermined pilot number.","It should be appreciated that process of  may result in a sequence of attempts to reconnect an interrupted call, e.g., a dropped cellular telephone call. In some embodiments, the number of attempts to reconnect may selectively determined to be three or four attempts. There may be a waiting period between each attempt.","It should be understood that an \u201cautomatic\u201d initiation of a reconnect need not necessarily be made immediately. Indeed, in practice, it may be desirable to delay an automatic call for a period of time.","The system described herein has various kinds of multi-media collaboration capabilities in addition to the above-described telephone call management functions. However, the reconnect feature disclosed herein may be included in a telephone system that lacks some, most, or all other collaboration features. Such a system may also lack presence and other features described above.","Although a telecommunication system has been described in detail in the foregoing embodiments, it is to be understood that the descriptions have been provided for purposes of illustration only and that other variations both in form and detail can be made thereupon by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, which is defined solely by the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Further aspects of the instant methods and apparatus will be more readily appreciated upon review of the detailed description included below, in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, of which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
