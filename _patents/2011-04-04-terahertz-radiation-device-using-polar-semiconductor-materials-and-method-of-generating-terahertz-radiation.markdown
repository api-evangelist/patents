No. 13\/042,775 entitled \u201cTerahertz Radiation Device and Method of Generating Terahertz Radiation,\u201d filed Mar. 8, 2011, by Dr. Michael Wraback, et al., and also claims priority of U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/435,797 entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Enhanced Terahertz Radiation from High Stacking Fault Density,\u201d filed May 5, 2009, by Dr. Grace Metcalfe, et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 7,919,764; issue date Apr. 5, 2011) and U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/050,890 filed May 6, 2008. U.S. application Ser. Nos. 13\/042,775, 12\/435,797 and 61\/050,890 are hereby incorporated herein by reference.","This invention relates generally to radiation emitting crystals, and more particularly to crystal structures which provide a source of electromagnetic radiation.","Electromagnetic waves sent at terahertz frequencies, known as terahertz (THz) radiation occur in the region of the electromagnetic spectrum between 100 gigahertz (1\u00d710Hz) and several terahertz, and correspond to the wavelength range of from roughly a single digit millimeter (high-frequency edge of the microwave band) to roughly 100 micrometer (long-wavelength edge of far-infrared light).","THz-rays, which are shorter than microwaves and longer than infrared, have potential usage in biomedical and security applications in that THz-rays are safe, and non-ionizing, and can pass through (and enable viewing through) such materials as clothing, paper, cardboard, wood, masonry, plastic, ceramics, as well as penetrate fog and clouds. THz radiation is safe for biological tissues (unlike X-rays), and images can be formed with terahertz radiation having resolution of less than 1 mm. THz radiation has potential spectroscopic uses in that while many materials are transparent to THz, many materials exhibit unique spectral identifiers when exposed to terahertz radiation, including explosives, pharmaceuticals, and illegal narcotic substances. Accordingly, items of interest can be observed through normally visually opaque intervening layers, such as packaging and clothing. For example, airport security scanners may use terahertz radiation.","To date, THz rays have not yet been widely used, partly because of the difficulty in producing them at sufficient intensity.","Previous approaches to terahertz radiation devices have used photoconductive switches in conjunction with a semiconductor comprising two parallel metal strips on the surface separated by a small distance (hundreds of microns to a few millimeters). A schematic illustration of such a configuration is shown in . These metal strips ac (, ) as electrodes, across which a large voltage (up to kV) is applied, creating electric fields as large as 10 kV\/cm. The semiconductor material is highly resistive, such that virtually no current flows without illumination. When the gap between the electrodes is illuminated with an approximately 100 femtosecond pulse of photon energy larger than the fundamental bandgap of the semiconductor, electron-hole pairs are created and swept out in the high field, producing a transient current that generates a THz pulse with usable bandwidth beyond 1 THz. The energy of the THz pulse is proportional to the square of the bias field. One disadvantage of this approach is that metal electrodes with kV voltages across them must be used to create the THz radiation. Another disadvantage is that the external bias voltage, and therefore the THz pulse energy, is limited by dielectric breakdown in air to less than 30 kV\/cm in theory, but in practice 10 kV\/cm is rarely exceeded.","Terahertz (THz) radiation in conventional devices is commonly generated through in-plane carrier acceleration in electric fields utilizing externally biased photoconductive (PC) switches, a surge-current normal to the surface due to a built-in surface field, or the photo-Dember field. Although the geometry of the biased photoconductive antennas is more favorable for coupling out the THz radiation than that for other semiconductor-based THz sources employing transport normal to the surface, these photoconductive switches require electrode processing and an external bias voltage, which is limited by the dielectric strength of air, to establish an in-plane electric field.","An alternative optical THz generation approach creates narrow band radiation through the mixing of continuous-wave (CW) lasers separated in frequency by the desired terahertz difference frequency in a semiconductor photomixer. Most photomixers use low-temperature grown GaAs thin films as the active layer due to its short carrier lifetime (approximately 0.5 ps), large breakdown-field threshold (>300 kV\/cm) and high carrier mobility (\u02dc200 cm\/V\u00b7s).","THz emission from quantum wells (QWs) (see, for instance, upper half of FIG. 10 in U.S. Pat. No. 7,919,764) has been observed from GaAs\/AlGaAs single QWs and multiple quantum wells (MQWs), InGaAs\/GaAs and GaSb\/AlSb MQWs and superlattices, low indium concentration InGaN\/GaN MQWs. For more information, see Turchinovich, \u201cUltrafast Polarization Dynamics in Biased Quantum Wells Under Strong Femtosecond Optical Excitation;\u201d Physical Review B 68, 241307(R) (2003), Zhang, et al. \u201cOptically Induced Femtosecond Electromagnetic Pulses from GaSb\/AlSb Strained Layer Superlattices\u201d Appl. Phys, Lett 57 (8), 20 Aug. 1990, pp. 753-755, and Zhang, et al. \u201cOptoelectronic Measurement of Semiconductor Surfaces and Interfaces with Femtosecond Optics,\u201d J. Appl. Phys. 71 (I), 1 Jan. 1992, pages 326-338; all three of which are hereby incorporated by reference. While the THz radiation field is proportional to the number of photoexcited carriers under low excitation conditions, one can readily gauge the importance of the enhanced internal electric field by considering the MQW structure as a nanoscale capacitor, with the energy transfer from the excitation pulse to the THz pulse mediated by the partial or complete discharge of the nanocapacitor. Therefore the maximum THz pulse energy is limited by the electrostatic energy stored in the so-called \u201cnanocapacitor,\u201d U=\u00bd \u2208\u2208AdF, where \u2208\u2208is the static permittivity, A is the area, d is the effective width of the capacitor, and F is the electric field inside the capacitor.","Efficient semiconductor THz sources without external processing or metallization are sought for their ease of system insertion relative to photoconductive switches. These sources rely primarily upon vertical hot electron diffusion and the associated transient photo Dember field due to the difference in electron and hole mobilities that provides a time varying real current (\u03b4J\/\u03b4t). As depicted in , when using prior art \u201cbulk\u201d materials, THz amplitude decreases with increasing bulk carrier concentration due to screening by background carriers. The efficiency of THz generation could be greatly improved in such structures if an internal electric field aiding hot electron diffusion were present.","A preferred embodiment provides the generation of broadband THz radiation from contactless semiconductor structures using optical excitation, such as a 100 femtosecond pulse source fs pulses.","A preferred embodiment of the present invention improves the efficiency of THz generation through, inter alia, the creation of an internal electric field which aids electron diffusion. The internal electric field may be created through spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization in the vertical (growth) direction. A preferred embodiment comprises transport and divider layers (or regions) in polar compound semiconductors grown along a polar direction; that is, a direction in which the surface is terminated by all cation or anion atoms. The internal electric field is created when the spontaneous and\/or piezoelectric polarization is terminated at the interfaces of transport\/divider layers (or regions). The interface between the transport and divider layers (or regions) forms boundaries at which the internal electric polarization terminates leading to charges accumulating at the boundaries, and creation of internal electric fields oriented along the polar axis.","The transport layers or regions are formed of a material having a bandgap different from the material forming the divider layers. Because of the difference in band gap, result in the termination of the spontaneous and piezoelectric internal electric polarization along the c-axis of the wurtzite material at the interface between the transport and divider layers (or regions). For example, the divider layers or regions may be made of indium gallium nitride and the transport layers may be made of gallium nitride; both of which materials may be grown by vapor deposition or epitaxy (forming heterojunctions) on a polar or semipolar substrate. The plane of the layers may be perpendicular to the polar axis, although being not parallel to the polar axis is sufficient. When the preferred embodiment is irradiated by a pulsed source of duration less than one picosecond, a time-varying and spatially nonuniform distribution of carriers is created in the growth direction of the polar crystal material within the transport and divider layers (or regions), thereby generating a first time-varying current due to diffusion of the carriers. The internal electric fields accelerate the carriers generated by the pulsed radiation source to produce a second time-varying current that is in addition to the first time-varying current, thereby enhancing the generation of terahertz radiation. The first time-varying current due to diffusion and the second time-varying current that is produced by the internal electric field are in the same direction (parallel to the polar axis) and are additive. When the divider layers (or regions) are formed of a material that has a smaller band gap than the bandgap of the material forming the transport layers, the divider layers operate to collect background carriers thereby enhancing the first time-varying current due to diffusion and the second time-varying current produced by the internal electric field such that terahertz radiation is enhanced. Also, as an additional benefit of the divider layers (or regions), the time-varying Dember field produced by the first time-varying current is not screened by the presence of back ground carriers (from doping, etc.).","The transport and divider layers (or regions) may be formed of wurtzite semiconductor material that is GaN, InN, AlN, or alloys thereof, or ZnO, MgO, ZnS, ZnSe, ZnTe, or alloys thereof. When the divider layers (or regions) are formed of a material that has a smaller band gap than the bandgap of the material forming the transport layers (or regions), the growth of the crystal is terminated on face containing Group II or Group III atoms. When the divider layers (or regions) are formed of a material that has a larger band gap than the bandgap of the material forming the transport layers, the growth of the crystal is terminated on face containing Group V or Group VI atoms.","The orientation of the plurality of layers (or regions) of polar crystal material layer may be polar or semipolar. Pulsed sources that may be used with the preferred embodiments include a pulsed light, electron, or ionizing particle source.","The thickness of each divider layer (or region) is in the range of one monolayer to several nanometers and each of the transport layers (or regions) is at least several nanometers and larger than the thickness of a divider layer (or region).","A preferred method of generating terahertz radiation comprises: growing transport and divider layers (or regions) using a wurtzite polar crystal material such that the c-axis is perpendicular or has a projection perpendicular to the growth plane; the material forming the divider layers (or regions) having a different bandgap than the material forming the transport layers (or regions), the interface between the transport and divider layers (or regions) forming boundaries at which the internal electric polarization terminates leading to charges accumulating at the boundaries, and creation of internal electric fields oriented along the polar axis; and irradiating the surface of the polar crystal material with a pulsed radiation source. The pulsed radiation source operates to create carriers in the polar crystal material thereby generating a first time-varying current due to diffusion; the internal electric field accelerating the carriers to produce a second time-varying current that is additive with the first time-varying current thereby creating terahertz radiation propagated in the plane of incidence. The step of irradiating the surface comprises propagating the pulsed radiation source of pulse duration less than one picosecond in a direction which is not normal to the surface of the device. The internal electric polarization in the growth direction of the polar crystal material of the transport layers (or regions) is terminated by the divider layers, creating interfaces and charge accumulation at the interfaces leading to the occurrence of electric fields parallel to growth direction of the crystal, such that transport of carriers excited by pulsed radiation source proceeds parallel to the electric field, leading to a terahertz radiation. A preferred embodiment may comprise transport and divider layers (or regions) which form heterojunctions within a heterostructure having a thickness of at least one absorption length of the exciting radiation. The heterostructure layers may be grown by vapor deposition or epitaxy on a polar or semipolar substrate.","As described further herein, a preferred embodiment comprises a heterostructure formed of polar crystal material operative to emit terahertz radiation; the heterostructure comprising transport and divider layers (or regions), the transport regions having a different bandgap than that of the divider layers (or regions), the interface between the transport regions and divider layers (or regions) forming boundaries at which the internal electric polarization terminates leading to charges accumulating at the boundaries, and creation of internal electric fields in the transport regions oriented along the polar axis; whereby when irradiated by a pulsed femtosecond light source, a time-varying and spatially nonuniform distribution of photo-carriers is created in the growth direction of the heterostructure thereby generating a first time-varying photo-current due to diffusion of the photo-carriers; the internal electric field accelerating the photo-carriers generated by the pulsed radiation source to produce a second time-varying photo-current that is additive with the first time-varying photo-current thereby enhancing generation of terahertz radiation.","The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which embodiments of the invention are shown. However, this invention should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. In the drawings, the thickness of layers and regions may be exaggerated for clarity. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout. As used herein the term \u201cand\/or\u201d includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.","The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to limit the full scope of the invention. As used herein, the singular forms \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms \u201ccomprises\u201d and\/or \u201ccomprising,\u201d when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and\/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and\/or groups thereof.","It will be understood that when an element such as a layer, region or substrate is referred to as being \u201con\u201d or extending \u201conto\u201d another element, it can be directly on or extend directly onto the other element or intervening elements may also be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being \u201cdirectly on\u201d or extending \u201cdirectly onto\u201d another element, there are no intervening elements present. It will also be understood that when an element is referred to as being \u201cconnected\u201d or \u201ccoupled\u201d to another element, it can be directly connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being \u201cdirectly connected\u201d or \u201cdirectly coupled\u201d to another element, there are no intervening elements present.","It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and\/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and\/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another region, layer or section. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of the present invention. Moreover, as used herein the terminology \u201cfirst\u201d when used in connection with currents does not mean first in time.","Furthermore, relative terms, such as \u201clower\u201d or \u201cbottom\u201d and \u201cupper\u201d or \u201ctop,\u201d may be used herein to describe one element's relationship to other elements as illustrated in the Figures. It will be understood that relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in addition to the orientation depicted in the Figures. For example, if the device in the Figures is turned over, elements described as being on the \u201clower\u201d side of other elements would then be oriented on \u201cupper\u201d sides of the other elements. The exemplary term \u201clower\u201d, can therefore, encompass both an orientation of \u201clower\u201d and \u201cupper,\u201d depending of the particular orientation of the figure. Similarly, if the device in one of the figures is turned over, elements described as \u201cbelow\u201d or \u201cbeneath\u201d other elements would then be oriented \u201cabove\u201d the other elements. The exemplary terms \u201cbelow\u201d or \u201cbeneath\u201d can, therefore, encompass both an orientation of above and below. Furthermore, the term \u201couter\u201d may be used to refer to a surface and\/or layer that is farthest away from a substrate.","Embodiments of the present invention are described herein with reference to cross-section illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized embodiments of the present invention. As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and\/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, embodiments of the present invention should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions or layers illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, an etched region illustrated as a rectangle will, typically, have tapered, rounded or curved features. Thus, the regions or layers illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the precise shape of a region or layer of a device and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.","Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.","It will also be appreciated by those of skill in the art that references to a structure or feature that is disposed \u201cadjacent\u201d another feature may have portions that overlap or underlie the adjacent feature.","The present invention provides, inter alia, a new source of terahertz radiation that will provide significantly more terahertz power when excited by a femtosecond laser pulse than that which can be obtained using state-of-the-art photoconductive switches. This is accomplished by engineering higher internal electric fields into the device. As shown for example in , previous approaches used large, externally applied voltages in conjunction with large aperture photoconductive switches, comprised of a semiconductor with two parallel metal strips on the surface separated by a small distance (hundreds of microns to a few millimeters) that act as electrodes, across which a large voltage (up to a kV) is applied, creating electric fields as large as 10 kV\/cm; subject to dielectric breakdown in air. When the gap between the electrodes is illuminated with a \u02dc100 femtosecond pulse of photon energy larger than the fundamental bandgap of the semiconductor, electron-hole pairs are created and are swept out in the high field, producing a transient current that generates a THz pulse with useable bandwidth beyond 1 THz. The energy of the THz pulse is proportional to the square of the bias field. The semiconductor material is highly resistive, such that virtually no current flows without illumination. Because the present invention does not require metal contacts, fabrication costs are reduced.","The present invention relates to Terahertz (THz) emission by a polar crystal upon excitation by a femtosecond laser source as shown schematically in . As recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art, a femtosecond is 10seconds and a femtosecond laser is a laser that operates in the domain of femtoseconds. The most preferable excitation source, labeled  in , is a low cost, compact, femtosecond fiber laser operating at either 1030 nm or 1560 nm (fundamental), or 515 nm or 780 nm (second harmonic). Preferably the pulsed radiation source has a photon energy greater than the bandgap of the crystal material. During photo excitation, a photo-Dember field can occur at the surface of a semiconductor due to a difference in diffusion coefficients for electrons and holes, and a structural asymmetry. Typically, electrons have a larger diffusion coefficient than holes. Consequently, upon photoexcitation, electrons diffuse more rapidly than the holes. In the absence of a structural asymmetry, no net dipole field is observed, since the center of charge does not change.","The present invention relates to Terahertz (THz) emission by a semiconductor preferred embodiment  upon excitation by a femtosecond laser source , as shown schematically in .  illustrates, inter alia, the directions of the p-polarized components of the terahertz waveform produced by laser excitation of the preferred embodiment semiconductor crystal structure . During photo excitation, a photo-Dember field can occur at the surface of a semiconductor due to a difference in diffusion coefficients for electrons and holes, and a structural asymmetry. Typically, electrons have a larger diffusion coefficient than holes. Consequently, upon photoexcitation, electrons diffuse more rapidly than the holes. In the absence of a structural asymmetry, no net dipole field is observed, since the center of charge does not change.","In order to derive the THz electric field radiated, the first derivative of the net current with respect to time or the second derivative of the polarization, is calculated as a function of time. It acts as the source term in Maxwell's equations when determining the THz emission.","By way of background, the terminology \u201cpolar\u201d semiconductor is repeatedly referenced. A substance which has an unequal sharing of charge among constituent elements in the absence of a field is called a polar material. As used herein, the terminology polar, nonpolar, and semipolar relate to the orientations of the polar material. Specifically,  are illustrations showing three different orientations (polar, nonpolar and semipolar) of the c-axis of a wurtzite crystal's structure (with c-axis being defined as perpendicular to the c-plane) relative to the growth plane, which in these examples is the sample surface. In the polar orientation example shown in , the c-axis is perpendicular to the growth plane. In the nonpolar orientation example, the c-axis is parallel to the growth plane and perpendicular to the growth direction. A semipolar orientation is depicted in  in which the c-axis of the crystal structure has a projection onto the growth plane. As used herein the terminology \u201cprojection onto\u201d refers to a mathematical construct in which a vector diagram can be used to evaluate the intensity of the component projected onto a given plane. As shown in , the projection of the c-axis onto the growth plane results in a vector component labeled as \u201cprojection of c-axis onto growth plane\u201d in . As seen in , the intensity value associated with the projection is non-zero; but may be in the range of from whatever angle that the crystal may be cut to 100%. The orientation of the crystal structure is that represented by the insert in .","A preferred embodiment of the present invention improves the efficiency of THz generation through the creation of an internal electric field which aids electron (carrier) diffusion. The internal electric field is created in the vertical (growth) direction by using transport regions (or layers) and divider regions (or layers) in polar compound semiconductors grown along a polar direction; that is, a direction in which the surface is terminated by all cation or anion atoms. In these materials, an internal electric field is created when the spontaneous and\/or piezoelectric polarization is terminated at the interfaces of transport\/restrictor regions. As shown in , the transport regions  are generally much larger than the divider regions . The divider regions function to create an interface such that the polarization charge which builds in the transport region is effectively stopped at the interface resulting in an electric field. The polarization charge within multiple transport regions  which are terminated by dividers  result in multiple, additive electrical fields being created. Although the terminology \u201cdivider\u201d is used to describe regions or layers , it can be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art that any means which operates to terminate the polarization charge at the boundary of the transport region or layer could be used without departing from the scope of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8"]},"Turning now to a different subject, in zincblende semiconductors such as III-V arsenides, antimonides, or phosphides, the spontaneous polarization is very small, and there is only a piezoelectric field associated with the strain in the structure resulting from the lattice mismatch between the divider and transport materials. The divider regions are regions of smaller bandgap; whereas the transport regions have a larger bandgap. In preferred embodiments using zinc blende materials, advantage is taken of transport of carriers in the larger bandgap aterial.","Since a large field is desirable, and since zinc blende is not as polar as Wurtzite, in order to obtain a large electric field, it is desirable to make the divider regions narrow to get large field, similar to the formation of a quantum well. Normally, in the case of quantum wells, the quantum wells contain excited carriers which are localized in the well. Barrier regions around the well have a larger band gap than the material forming the quantum well. Consequently, the field exists in wells rather than barriers in an effort to maximize the field in the quantum wells. The quantum wells are normally thinner than the barriers and larger electric field exists in the wells, up to a few hundred kV\/cm; with a much smaller (according to the ratio of the well and barrier thicknesses) and opposite field existing in the barrier regions. Because the field in the barriers is much smaller than that in the wells, one optically excites only the wells using the fs pulses to achieve THz generation. However, the photoexcited carriers are confined to the wells and no benefit of hot electron diffusion is attained for THz generation; the THz is generated by photocarrier screening of the in-well dipole moment and is proportional to the second time derivative of the displacement (\u03b4D\/\u03b4t). In zincblende materials, the enhancement of the THz generation from the barriers is limited by a piezoelectric polarization not being large enough; compounded by strain relaxation beyond the critical thickness, and the wide barriers or wells required for significant hot electron transport do not possess sufficient electric field. In other words, optimal performance cannot be obtained when relying only on strain (since the piezoelectric polarization is not large enough) and reliance on quantum wells is undesirable since one cannot obtain sufficient transport in wells since carriers are localized.","A better choice than zinc blende in this regard is wurtzite semiconductors such as III-V nitrides which possess a large spontaneous polarization in addition to the piezoelectric polarization for growth along a polar axis. The combination of these two polarizations can lead to internal electric fields an order of magnitude larger than those attained in polar zincblende structures when terminated at well\/barrier interfaces. Using wurtzite, sufficient field strength is found in what was previously regarded as the barrier regions, by combining drift and diffusion. Instead of exciting carriers in quantum wells, where there is neither drift nor diffusion occurring (as there is simply a localized dipole), in accordance with the principles of the present invention, diffusive transport is obtained using as large concentration gradient as possible. The concentration gradient is developed by exciting material using absorption of light.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 9","FIG. 9","FIG. 9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 9","FIG. 10"]},"As depicted for example in by the dotted line in , the structure oriented concentration gradient creates diffusion and the electric field leads to acceleration of the electrons; as the carriers move faster than by diffusion alone. While others have used nitride semiconductor multiple quantum wells to generate THz radiation using in-well optical pumping to take advantage of the displacement current effect described above, that approach did not achieve the additional benefit of hot electron diffusion, since the carriers are localized in very small (\u02dc2 nm) quantum wells. Using the present invention, advantage is taken of the large electric fields formed in what was previously thought of as barrier regions (herein referred to as transport regions) of nitride semiconductor multiple quantum wells to enhance THz generation through carrier acceleration as the electric field that aids the hot electron diffusive transport. In such a case, because of the very large electric fields in the nitride semiconductor heterostructures, the transport regions, formed of a larger band gap material, can be made an order of magnitude wider than the divider regions of a smaller band gap material (previously referred to as quantum wells) and still achieve electric fields in excess of 100 kV\/cm. Electron drift or acceleration in these fields operates to greatly enhance hot electron diffusive transport, creating a larger \u03b4J\/\u03b4t and therefore enhanced THz emission. The divider regions (formerly referred to as \u201cquantum wells\u201d) operate as \u201cstressors,\u201d i.e., very small \u201cwells\u201d (1-2 nm) with very large transport\/barriers (10-20 nm) wells. These divider regions (shown as  in ) serve the additional purpose of localizing background carriers in non-intrinsic materials that would otherwise screen the Dember field associated with hot electron diffusion and reduce the THz emission efficiency. Basing terahertz radiation upon diffusion (i.e., relying on fact that electrons and holes have different diffusivities and electrons travel further than holes in the Dember field), leads to the consequence of background carriers screening the Dember Field, illustrated in . However, the divider regions or layers operate to contain the background carriers, such that such carriers are not present to screen the Dember Field. In the prior art, it was common to use a bulk material with very low background concentration of carriers for this reason.","Referring now to , the predominant transport regions  separated by divider regions . Referring now to , shown is a band diagram for a GaN structure with 0.5 nm In0.5GaN layers as the dividers and a period of 20.5 nm. The electric field in the barrier region is as high as 150 kV\/cm. The drift of electrons and holes is indicated by the arrows.","The electric field is developed in the transport regions  while the interstitial regions  operate to create a polarization discontinuity at the interfaces with the transport regions . Preferably the regions  are of substantially equal size such that the interstitial regions  are periodically spaced therebetween. For example, for every ten nanometers, one nanometer of the material may contain a divider region . The electric field is maintained at a substantially constant level by periodically inserting divider regions  that create polarization discontinuity. This concept is analogous to the use of stacking faults (described in greater detail in U.S. Pat. No. 7,919,764 ('764 Patent) except stacking faults not evenly spaced. By keeping the regions  substantially constant, the electric field can be kept substantially the same within the transport regions or layers . Consequently, the preferred embodiment of  is more predictable than the stacking fault embodiment in the '764 Patent, wherein zinc blende, which has a lower band gap than wurtzite, was utilized. Similar in some respects to the embodiments disclosed in the '764 Patent, regions  are used as dividers just as the stacking faults are used as dividers between two wurtzite regions. In case of , both the dividers and transport regions may be wurtzite. The divider region  may be, for example, a different wurtzite material such as Indium nitride (smaller bandgap) and the transport region  may be Indium Gallium Nitride (larger bandgap). Regarding the difference in bandgap, it is desirable to have spontaneous polarization, but choose difference to be such that the width of the transport region does not lead to strain relaxation. Although it is not necessary to have the material completely strained; it may be helpful.","As an example, in conjunction with the preferred embodiment of , one may use compounds with a large difference in spontaneous polarization, such as aluminum nitride and gallium nitride. As another example, indium gallium nitride and gallium nitride may be utilized such that the piezoelectric polarization dominates. Care should be taken to avoid exceeding the critical thickness so as to prevent failure and relaxation of the strain. As shown for example in , the difference in indium content is between the indium gallium nitride and gallium nitride need only be 0.5.","In order to derive the THz electric field radiated, the time derivative of the net current,",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2202","mi":"J"},{"mo":"\u2202","mi":"t"}]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["q","i"]},{"mi":["r","i"]}],"mo":"\u2062"}}}}},"br":{}},"Using the appropriate boundary conditions at the interface and Maxwell's equations, the electric field Fin the transport layer can then be expressed as",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["F","T"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mi":"P","msub":{"mi":"\u025b","mn":"0"}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mn":"1","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["\u025b","T"]},"mo":"+","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["\u025b","D"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["d","T"]},{"mi":["d","D"]}],"mo":"\/"}}}}}}}},"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":["T ","D ","T ","D ","o ","THz","wT"],"sup":"2 "},"A substance which has a natural charge separation in the absence of a field is called a polar material. As used herein, the terminology polar, nonpolar, and semipolar relate to the orientations of the polar material. Specifically,  are illustrations showing three different orientations (polar, nonpolar and semipolar) of the c-axis of a crystal's structure with c-axis being defined as perpendicular to the c-plane) relative to the growth plane, which in these examples is the sample surface. In the polar orientation example shown in , the c-axis is perpendicular to the growth plane. In the nonpolar orientation example, the c-axis is parallel to the growth plane and perpendicular to the growth direction. A semipolar orientation is depicted in  in which the c-axis of the crystal structure has a projection onto the growth plane. As used herein the terminology \u201cprojection onto\u201d refers to a mathematical construct in which a vector diagram can be used to evaluate the intensity of the component projected onto a given plane. As shown in , the projection of the c-axis onto the growth plane results in a vector component labeled as \u201cprojection of c-axis onto growth plane\u201d in . As seen in , the intensity value associated with the projection is non-zero; but may be in the range of 30 to 100%. The orientation of the crystal structure is that represented by the insert in .","In addition to non-polar oriented crystal structure configurations where there is a non-zero in-plane electric polarization, the principles of the invention may be utilized with structures in which there is a projection of the c-axis on the growth plane, which is referred to as semi-polar oriented material; a representation of which is shown in .","The present invention enables the generation of broadband THz pulses with higher pulse energy than a conventional photoconductive switch embodiment because it can support higher electric fields. Tests were performed using a coherent regenerative amplifier (RegA) at 800 nm. The typical pulse width is approximately 150 fs with a pump power of approximately 3 mW.  is a schematic illustration showing the orientation of a sample relative to the femtosecond laser excitation. As shown in , the pump beam () is incident on the a-sample , for example GaN, at approximately 45 degrees to the surface normal.","Analysis of the polarization of the terahertz radiation may be conducted when the crystal material is irradiated using a pulsed radiation source with an energy in the approximate range of 1 to 25 nano-joules, a wavelength of 200-1800 nanometer, and a pulse duration in the approximate range of 10 to 300 femtoseconds, a pump beam spot size in the approximate range 0.5 to 2 millimeters, and an angle of incidence in the approximate range of 30 to 60 degrees, and when the subsequent terahertz emission is collected with a pair of parabolic mirrors onto an electro-optic crystal such as ZnTe for electro-optic sampling and wherein the ZnTe-based terahertz electro-optic detection system is polarization sensitive.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":["FIG. 5A","FIG. 5A-D","FIG. 3","FIG. 5A"],"b":["10","2","3","20","10","2","3"]},"The detection is a known electro optic sampling technique for detecting Terahertz emission. The configurations shown in , B and C use both a probe beam and a pump beam. Specifically, a reflector , which may be for example, a pellicle or thin membrane, reflects the probe beam and transmits terahertz radiation. The quarter wave plate  results in the linearly polarized incident probe beam becoming circularly polarized. The circularly polarized probe beam is then split by the Wollaston prism  which breaks up the vertically and horizontally polarized components of the probe beam spatially. The difference signal between the vertically and horizontally polarized components is detected using a balanced detector. When no terahertz emission is present, the balanced detector measures no signal. When terahertz emission is produced, the circularly polarized probe beam becomes elliptically polarized. For an elliptically polarized probe beam, one polarization component has a stronger amplitude and the balanced detector , indicates the difference between each; i.e., the detectors effectively breaks the beam into two orthogonal polarizations, and because the elliptically polarized probe light has two unequal components due to the Terahertz emission, the subtraction results in measurement of the Terahertz emission.
