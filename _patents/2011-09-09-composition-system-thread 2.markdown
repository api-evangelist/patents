title: Composition system thread
abstract: Composition system thread techniques are described. In one or more implementations, a composition system may be configured to compose visual elements received from applications on a thread that is executed separately than a user interface thread of the applications. As such, the composition system may execute asynchronously from a user interface thread of the application. Additionally, the composition system may be configured to expose one or more application programming interfaces (APIs) that are accessible to the applications. The APIs may be used for constructing a tree of objects representing the operations that are to be performed to compose one or more bitmaps. Further, these operations may be controlled by several API visual properties to allow applications to animate content within their windows and use disparate technologies to rasterize such content.

This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Overview","Conventional techniques used to render elements by a computing device employed a distributed system in which each application was assigned a corresponding composition engine. Because of this, the different composition engines were unaware of what was being performed by other composition engines. This could lead to redundancies, unnecessary rending of elements, and so on that could hinder the efficiency of a computing device that implemented the conventional techniques and thus could make these conventional techniques ill suited for use by \u201cthin\u201d computing devices.","Global composition techniques are described herein. In one or more windows, a single composition engine is accessible by a plurality of different applications via one or more APIs. Thus, the composition engine may be made \u201caware\u201d of what is being contributed by the various applications and how those elements relate. This knowledge may then be leveraged to improve efficiency in the rendering of elements of the applications.","In one or more implementations, the composition engine runs asynchronous from threads belonging to those applications, which allows applications to cause content to be animated within their windows and use disparate rendering technologies to rasterize such content. As such, the composition system may execute asynchronously from a user interface thread of the application, further discussion of which may be found in relation to .","Additionally, composition data from each applications in the system may be managed in a single graph (e.g., a global composition tree) which allows the composition engine to perform global optimizations such as occlusion detection, as well as to mix and match content from multiple applications in an efficient and secure fashion, further discussion of which may be found in relation to .","Further, the global composition system may be configured to expose one or more application programming interfaces (APIs) that are accessible to the applications. The APIs may be used for constructing a tree of objects representing the operations that are to be performed to compose one or more bitmaps. Further, these operations may be controlled by several API visual properties to allow applications to animate content within their windows and use disparate technologies to rasterize such content, further description of which may be found in relation to .","In the following discussion, an example environment is first described that may employ the techniques described herein. Example procedures are then described which may be performed in the example environment as well as other environments. Consequently, performance of the example procedures is not limited to the example environment and the example environment is not limited to performance of the example procedures.","Example Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106","102","104"]},"For example, a computing device may be configured as a computer that is capable of communicating over the network , such as a desktop computer, a mobile station, an entertainment appliance, a set-top box communicatively coupled to a display device, a wireless phone, a game console, and so forth. Thus, the computing device  may range from full resource devices with substantial memory and processor resources (e.g., personal computers, game consoles) to a low-resource device with limited memory and\/or processing resources (e.g., traditional set-top boxes, hand-held game consoles). Additionally, although a single computing device  is shown, the computing device  may be representative of a plurality of different devices, such as multiple servers utilized by a business to perform operations such as by the web service , a remote control and set-top box combination, an image capture device and a game console configured to capture gestures, and so on.","Although the network  is illustrated as the Internet, the network may assume a wide variety of configurations. For example, the network  may include a wide area network (WAN), a local area network (LAN), a wireless network, a public telephone network, an intranet, and so on. Further, although a single network  is shown, the network  may be configured to include multiple networks.","The computing device  is further illustrated as including an operating system . The operating system  is configured to abstract underlying functionality of the computing device  to applications  that are executable on the computing device . For example, the operating system  may abstract processing, memory, network, and\/or display functionality of the computing device  such that the applications  may be written without knowing \u201chow\u201d this underlying functionality is implemented. The application , for instance, may provide data to the operating system  to be rendered and displayed by the display device  without understanding how this rendering will be performed.","The operating system  may also represent a variety of other functionality, such as to manage a file system and user interface that is navigable by a user of the computing device . An example of this is illustrated as a desktop that is displayed on the display device  of the computing device .","The operating system  is also illustrated as including a global composition system . The global composition system  may represent a system that includes a direct composition component that is configured to allow applications  to use a single global composition engine  (hereinafter also referred to simply as composition engine ) to draw items on the display device . Although illustrated as part of an operating system , the global composition system  may be implemented in a variety of other ways, such as part of a browser, as a stand-alone module, and so forth. Further, the global composition system  may be distributed across the network , an example of which is illustrated as inclusion of a global composition system  on the web service .","User experiences (e.g., user interfaces generated for applications ) may include a signification number of elements that may interact with each other, such as windows, animations (e.g., text scrolling), and so on. For example, a first window may correspond to an email application and a second window  may correspond to a browser as illustrated on the display device . Thus, a multitude of different rendering components may be involved at any one particular point in time. Further, these different elements may have different refresh rates, such as an animation of a \u201cticker\u201d display along with video and static text.","The global composition system  may be utilized to abstract this functionality such that different applications  may offload this rendering and thus be unaware of how the rendering is performed. For example, applications  may provide data that describe elements to be rendered, placement of the elements, and how the elements interrelate with each other.","Additionally, the global composition system  may support \u201cindependent\u201d animation. An application , for instance, may communicate a declaration description of an animation that describes how an animation is to be rendered. For example, the description may describe what is being animated, a rate at which redraws are to occur, a location at which the animation is to begin, a curve over which the animation is to move, an ending location of the animation, an amount of time the animation is to be rendered, and so forth.","This rendering may then be performed by the global composition system  and continue without further instruction. In this way, the rendering of the animation is independent of the caller (e.g., the application ), such that loss of communication with the application , inconsistent processing of the application , and so on does not have an effect on the rendering of the animation. Thereby, this may be used to improve \u201csmoothness\u201d and \u201cfluidity\u201d of the animation as well as resources of the computing device  (and even network  are further described below) by cutting down on the number of communications by the application  to render the animation.","Conventionally, each of the applications  that were executed by a computing device  interacted with a corresponding composition engine to perform the processing and rendering of a display for the respective application. Therefore, conventional composition engines were often implemented \u201cper process.\u201d Accordingly, conventional techniques may involve execution of a plurality of different composition engines at any one time. Additionally, conventional composition engines were typically \u201cnot aware\u201d of the rendering performed by other composition engines. This could result in inefficient use of resources of the computing device , such as to draw a window even though it may be occluded by another window which could result in unnecessary use of processor, graphical processor, memory, and other resources of the computing device .","In one or more implementations, the global composition system  follows a global architecture such that a plurality of applications  may access the composition engine , e.g., via an application programming interface. For example, a single composition engine  may be responsible for an entire desktop and elements from applications  that are currently being executed. Thus, the single composition engine  may be \u201caware\u201d of the different elements that are to be rendered for the plurality of applications and react accordingly.","Continuing with the previous example, the composition engine  may be aware that an element of an application (e.g., a window) is to be occluded by an element to be rendered for another application, e.g., another window. As shown in , for instance, the application may have a window that is to be displayed behind the window  that corresponds to the email application. Previously, even though the corresponding window of the application was not viewable to a user of the computing device , the window was still rendered. However, the composition engine  may use the present techniques to skip the rendering of the occluded window, thereby conserving resources of the computing device .","The global composition system  may be used to provide a wide variety of functionality. As previously described, the global composition system  may perform global analysis of what is to be rendered by the plurality of applications and efficiently determine which of the elements are to be drawn, such as in the case of occlusion in which rendering of elements may be skipped as previously described. Additionally, resources may be pooled by the global composition system , such as to share intermediate memory by a plurality of applications  instead of fragmented memory as could be consumed by conventional composition engines both by the engines themselves as well as what is being drawn by the engines.","The global composition system  may also support security techniques. For example, the global composition system  may be employed to draw protected video, such as encrypted movies and corresponding licensing. For conventional composition engines, the application composes the content and then transfers the content to a corresponding composition engine. This may result in the content being \u201ctransferred in the clear\u201d (e.g., transfer of uncompressed video frames) without the protections and thus the content could be exposed to malicious parties.","However, in one or more implementations described herein the content may be provided to the global composition system  and may be executed within a protected area that is not touchable directly by the applications . Thus, trust of the composition engine  to not further communicate the content may be used to protect that content. For instance, the composition engine may be relied upon to generate pixels for rendering without exposing those pixels to applications that are executed by the computing device . Thus, this \u201cone way flow\u201d may help ensure that the wrong application (e.g., from a malicious entity) does not receive the unprotected content.","Further, conventional composition engines and corresponding applications \u201cowned\u201d a particular portion of a screen of a display device . Therefore, some display techniques were difficult to support using these conventional techniques. One such technique was transparency for multiple applications because the area of the display device  could be owned by one or the other conventional composition engines, but not both. For instance, a particular area of the display device  may involve windows from at least two different applications and their corresponding conventional composition engines. Conventionally, to support techniques such as transparency each instance of the windows was drawn to memory and then effects were applied to the combination, which was resource intensive.","However, because the global composition system  may be aware of the different windows and react accordingly, the desired result may be achieved without drawing the windows separately to memory beforehand and then applying the visual effects to the windows. For example, the global composition system  may utilize a single hierarchical tree that describes elements to be rendered and thus \u201cknow\u201d how the elements relate. Therefore, the global composition system  may draw directly to memory of the computing device  without the intermediate steps that were performed using conventional techniques. Thus, these techniques may be employed by \u201cthin\u201d computing devices that could not employ conventional composition engines due to memory and\/or processing limitations.","Additionally, conventional composition engines were generally executed asynchronously to support different rendering rates by different applications. Although this did support functionality such that rendering specified an application associated with one composition did not affect the rendering specified by another application, this could result in an inefficient use of computing device  resources.","Further, priorities assigned to the different conventional composition engines may cause errors both to the conventional composition engine as well as an associated application. For instance, conventional composition engines may be given a relatively high priority for execution by a processor of the computing device . However, instances may occur in which the composition engines consume a signification amount of the resources, such as to support multiple animations. Because of this, the composition engines as well as the applications themselves may not have sufficient resources available to execute as intended when confronted with such resource intensive tasks.","In one or more implementations, the composition engine  may be assigned a high priority, e.g., a high thread priority may be assigned to the composition engine  relative to priorities assigned to other threads executed by the computing device . The global composition engine  may then mange priority of how elements from the different sources are rendered by the composition engine , which is given a high priority to ensure that the rendering occurs. For example, the global composition system  may manage which elements are updated, a frequency at which this update occurs (e.g., to switch from 60 Hz to 30 Hz), and so on. Thus, the global composition system  may help promote availability of resources of the computing device  for other uses, such as the applications  that provide the elements for rendering.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","114","116","202","204","202","206","208","210","212","204","116","200","214"]},"Conventional use of a plurality of distributed composition engines protected execution of the engines as well as applications of a computing device from each other. For example, if a first application fails, a first conventional composition engine coupled to the first application may also fail. However, a second composition engine that was coupled to a different conventional composition engine was protected by the failure due to the lack of \u201cknowledge\u201d that the conventional composition engines had of each other.","In one or more implementations, the global composition system  may employ techniques to protect against corruption of state of the composition engine  by applications  that provide elements for rendering. One such technique is to employ the composition engine  within a kernel  of the operating system . Thus, the composition engine  may \u201ctrust\u201d other components that are also executed in the kernel .","In this way, the global composition system  may employ a \u201ctrust boundary\u201d between a user mode  and a kernel mode  such that checks are performed by the kernel. In one or more implementations, applications may be relied upon to determine \u201ccorrectness\u201d provided by the applications such as parameter checking to improve efficiency of processing done by the global composition system .","Another such technique involves tracking such that the global composition system  \u201cknows\u201d which data (e.g., elements for rendering) belongs to which application. Therefore, a failure of one application (e.g., a crash) does not affect the elements of another application. Further, the global composition system  may \u201cclean up\u201d the elements in case of such failure, such as to remove the elements from being rendered after a predetermined amount of time. In this way, the global composition system  may allow an application to fail gracefully and not affect other applications and corresponding elements to be rendered.","As illustrated the composition engine  is executed on a dedicated system process  (in other words, a \u201cthread\u201d), which is different than processes used to execute other code such as other application processes ,  of the computing device . Additionally, this process  may be assigned high levels of trust and priority. This process , for instance, may be trusted from a point of viewing of getting composition data and thus may be used for protected data, such as protected video data, email protected with rights management, and so on.","As illustrated in , the global composition system  may be implemented using three parts. A first part is illustrated as the composition engine , which is representative of functionality to perform the rendering, i.e., \u201cdo the drawing\u201d to the display device . A second part is illustrated as a user-mode library , which is representative of an entity that is called by the applications by exposing application programming interfaces (API) , . For example, the user-mode library  may act as a \u201cmail slot\u201d to receive composition data from the applications, such as through use of a dynamic linked library (DLL).","A third part is illustrated as an object database module  that is illustrated as residing in the kernel . The object database module  is representative of functionality that is responsible for moving data between the user-mode library  and the composition engine .","The object database module  may also perform validation. For example, an application may call the user-mode library  to create an element, such as a bitmap. If the requested element does not meet criteria that are enforced by the object database module  (e.g., less than \u201cN\u201d number of pixels), the object database module  may return a failure message to the application that called the user-mode library . Thus, the object database module  may operate within the kernel  to control what is provided to the composition engine . A variety of other policies may be enforced by the object database module .","Therefore, the composition engine  may rely on data that is provided by the object database module  as complying with policies implemented by the object database module . In other words, the composition engine may assume that the data is valid and correct and thus suitable for rendering. Consequently, the validation may be performed a single time by the object database module  and then utilized by the composition engine  to perform the rendering without further validation.","The object database module  may also be representative of functionality to inform the composition engine  of when data to be rendered has changed. For example, an API implemented via the user-mode library may be configured to consume a graph that describes what is to be rendered, an example of which is shown in . The graph  may include a list of elements to be rendered as well as a description of where to render the elements on the display device , which may include how the elements are to move in an instance of an animation.","Additionally, the elements to be rendered may be formed using sub-elements and thus the graph  may assume a hierarchical structure. Further, the graph  may describe how the elements are to be rendered, e.g., draw text once, render an animation at 60 Hz, and so forth. Thus, the graph  may describe the elements and how the elements relate to each other.","The graph  represents two sets of objects that may be used by the composition engine  to render a scene, bitmaps that are composed together and visuals that define the spatial relationships according to which those bitmaps are composed. In this model, the bitmaps are the \u201cwhat\u201d and the visuals are the \u201chow\u201d of the composition engine . Those objects are arranged in a tree structure and bound to a top-level or child window for composition.","Returning again to , once received by the composition engine , the application does not need to further call the composition engine  to keep rendering the elements. Thus, the composition engine  may conserve resources as compared to conventional techniques that could involve an application making sixty calls per second to render an animation at a refresh rate of the display device . Thus, the application  may call an API of the user-mode library  to construct a structure and an API to construct elements to be rendered by the composition engine.","In order to make a change to the content that is rendered by the composition engine , the application may call another application programming interface of the user-mode library  to update the structure and\/or elements. For example, the application may provide data via an update API to provide information to be used for a stock ticker animation.","In one or more implementations, batching techniques may also be leveraged to define which elements are to be rendered using frames. As previously described, the global composition system  may receive a variety of different elements for rendering at a variety of different rates. Accordingly, the global composition system  may support a structure in which a list of elements to be rendered together is formed. Thus, the global composition system  may implement a definition of begin and end for the elements in which the elements received in between are not rendered until the \u201cend\u201d is received. Thus, the frame may support an \u201call or nothing\u201d approach to the rendering of elements for particular frames and ensure that the elements are rendered together for display when desired.","For example, the object database module  may track two different states for an application. The first state may reference elements that are for current display. The second state may reference elements that are to be displayed subsequent to the first state and that are changed. Thus, the second state may be used to build a list of elements for rendering by the composition engine  once the list is completed, e.g., once an indication is received from the application that the list is complete.","Once complete, the changes may be sent to the composition engine . Further, the timing of the receipt of the indication from the application that the list is complete may be used to determine when those changes are displayed, e.g., which frame. Thus, the composition engine  may receive a batch of changes described in one or more lists that are completed but lists that have not been indicated as complete are not communicated. This batching may thus define frames that are rendered by the composition engine . Further, this may help limit display of erroneous visual artifacts as could occur using conventional techniques that did not support such a definition. As should be readily apparent, an amount of time that corresponds to the frames may be set for a variety of different amounts as desired.","Thus, the object database module  may remember what was previously rendered by the composition engine  (e.g., elements and properties of those elements), as well as know what is going to be rendered. Therefore, the object database module  may determine which elements are changed by comparing this information. Accordingly, the object database module  may communicate information which describes this change without communicating information that is not changed to the composition engine .","Additionally, the use of frames may further improve efficiency. For example, an application may communicate data that describes that an object is to be moved a certain distance and return back to an original position. The object database module  may determine that this movement is to occur within a time period of a single frame. Accordingly, the object database module  may refrain from communicating this data to the composition engine  and rather have the object remain at its previous state. For instance, this movement may occur within a time period used to refresh a display device  and thus would not be viewable by a user, regardless.","In this way, the object database module  may discard intermediate states in the construction of the list that is to be provided to the composition engine  for rendering. This list may then be communicated in a variety of ways, such as an array of commands to be performed by the composition engine  to implement the changes. Further, this technique may also be used to address instances of unbounded data sent by application because a single instance is reported to the composition engine.","The object database module  and the composition engine  may also employ acknowledgement techniques that describe that a change was implemented. For example, the composition engine  may receive a communication from the object database module  that describes a change to be made. While the change is being made, the object database module  may wait to send additional changes until an acknowledgement has been received that the previous change was made. Once the acknowledgment is received by the object database module , the additional changes may then be communicated to the composition engine.","Further, this technique may be used to provide \u201cthrottling\u201d and thus further conserve resources of the computing device . For example, an application may make a number of requests that exceed the rate at which a display device is refreshed. By using the frames and batching the changes the amount of resources that would otherwise be consumed is reduced.","Applications that make changes to what is displayed by calling the API of the user-mode library  may be multithreaded. Accordingly, in one or more implementations the object database module  may employ techniques such that multiple calls from the multiple threads of a single application do not corrupt the state. This may be performed by the application locking its threads together, itself, e.g., one thread may be blocked while another thread of the application completes a task.","The changes from the multiple threads may then be stored in a queue which may be managed by the operating system , such as through interlocked access that may be employed for variables such that different threads may make \u201ccomplete\u201d changes before passing control to another thread. This may support the frame techniques described above to arrive at atomic units of work that are to be processed by the composition engine. Additionally, for frames in which updates are not received, execution of the composition engine may be paused until the next frame thereby further conserving resources of the computing device .","The kernel  may also add a variety of functionality in conjunction with the global composition system . For example, when an application fails (e.g., crashes) the kernel  may inform the composition engine  of this occurrence. The composition engine  may then perform techniques that are to similar to those that would be used if the application ceased execution \u201cnaturally\u201d through a normal exit procedure. In this way, the composition engine  may \u201cclean up\u201d state such that the elements that correspond to the application are removed from display on the display device  of the computing device . Thus, this promotes robustness in the execution of the composition engine .","The execution of the composition engine  may also be secured by implementing a write-only API for the user-mode library . In this way, the composition engine  may generate the pixels but not expose those pixels back to the applications, thereby protecting the images from malicious parties.","As previously described, implementation of these techniques may also involve devices \u201coutside\u201d of the computing device , which may be distributed across one or more entities such as the web service . For example, these techniques may be employed to support terminal services, a remote desktop environment, and so on through communication of the batch of elements and properties (e.g., a composition tree such as a graph  of ) via the network . Thus, the graph  may be generated elsewhere (e.g., through implementation of the user-mode library  and\/or the object database module  on the web service ) and transfer the composition tree for rendering by the composition engine  through execution of the computing device . In this way, the animations may be smoothly displayed even in instances in which the network  is unreliable. Further discussion of these and other techniques may be found in relation to the following procedures.","Generally, any of the functions described herein can be implemented using software, firmware, hardware (e.g., fixed logic circuitry), or a combination of these implementations. The terms \u201cmodule,\u201d \u201cfunctionality,\u201d and \u201cengine\u201d as used herein generally represent software, firmware, hardware, or a combination thereof. In the case of a software implementation, the module, functionality, or engine represents program code that performs specified tasks when executed on a processor (e.g., CPU or CPUs). The program code can be stored in one or more computer readable memory devices. The features of the techniques described below are platform-independent, meaning that the techniques may be implemented on a variety of commercial computing platforms having a variety of processors.","For example, the computing device  may also include an entity (e.g., software) that causes hardware of the computing device  to perform operations, e.g., processors, functional blocks, and so on. For example, the computing device  may include a computer-readable medium that may be configured to maintain instructions that cause the computing device, and more particularly hardware of the computing device  to perform operations. Thus, the instructions function to configure the hardware to perform the operations and in this way result in transformation of the hardware to perform functions. The instructions may be provided by the computer-readable medium to the computing device  through a variety of different configurations.","One such configuration of a computer-readable medium is signal bearing medium and thus is configured to transmit the instructions (e.g., as a carrier wave) to the hardware of the computing device, such as via a network. The computer-readable medium may also be configured as a computer-readable storage medium and thus is not a signal bearing medium. Examples of a computer-readable storage medium include a random-access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), an optical disc, flash memory, hard disk memory, and other memory devices that may use magnetic, optical, and other techniques to store instructions and other data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","402","114","114","402","404","406","408","410"]},"As previously described, the global composition system  may support multiple concurrent applications  in an overlapped windowed environment with a composed desktop, where each application  may contain a combination of static content, animated content and video, and so on. For example, an application  may create two sets of objects to compose a scene for rendering by the global composition system , which may include bitmaps that are composed together and visuals that define the spatial relationships according to which those bitmaps are composed. Bitmaps may also be represented using two objects, such as an NT handle to a kernel object known as a \u201ccomposition surface\u201d and the actual color buffer object, such as a DX swapchain. In this model, the bitmaps are the \u201cwhat\u201d and the visuals are the \u201chow\u201d of the composition engine  of the global composition system .","Those objects may be arranged in a tree structure as described in relation to  and bound to a top-level or child window for composition. In one or more implementations, the global composition system  allows the application  to bind two trees to each window, one that is composed on top of the window itself but behind all of the window's child windows, and another that is composed on top of the window as well as its children.","To avoid the performance overhead of rasterization, global composition system  visuals may represent content as bitmaps which have been rasterized by the consumer. In one or more implementations, the global composition system  does not accept other types of content such as vectors or text, although other examples are also contemplated. For example, the global composition system  may be configured for composition of DirectX bitmaps, GDI, GDI+ bitmaps to be composed via a DX-GDI interoperability model, and so on. The composition engine can automatically detect changes to such bitmaps and trigger a re-composition of the affected window or windows.","Additionally, the global composition system  may allow the application  to add other layered child windows as shown in  as bitmaps in a composition tree. In such a case, the composition engine may automatically access the rasterization of that window and composes the resulting bitmap as it would any other bitmap directly rasterized by the application. Although bitmaps are described, other examples are also contemplated in which formats other than bitmaps are utilized, such as vector graphics, text, and so on.","The global composition system  may be configured to support declarative animations of scalar properties for global composition system  objects. This enables an application  to start an animation or set of animations and then do other work on its threads or even put them to sleep altogether while the composition engine  runs the animations at frame rate. This allows the application to decouple visual animations from unbounded work on its UI thread as described previously.","Further, the global composition system  may expose functionality a set of interfaces to applications  for use by developers to create visuals, bind them to a bitmap and manipulate different visual properties to achieve the desired UI composition and animation scenarios. Examples of global composition system  visual properties include:\n\n","A 2D transformation may be used to modify a coordinate system of a visual relative to its parent. When visuals are deeply nested, the transformations of those visuals may be composed via matrix multiplication. A variety of different 2D transformations may be supported by the global composition system , such as translations, scales, rotations and skews. In addition, the application  may specify arbitrary affine transformations, e.g., by using an explicit 3\u00d72 matrix, build more complex compound transformations using a transform group (which is simply an array of transformations), and so on.","A clip may be used to restrict a set of pixels that a visual sub-tree may affect. In one or more implementations, clips are defined rectangular regions, which may have optionally rounded corners.","The composition engine  may support a variety of different bitmap effects, examples of which include three dimensional perspective transformations, constant-alpha opacity, and Porter-Duff compositional blend modes. A bitmap effect may have a semantic of replacing a visual sub-tree by a single visual referencing an off-screen texture that contains the rasterization of the original sub-tree. The effect may then be applied when the off-screen texture is blended back to a composition target. In practice, the composition engine  may avoid off-screen rasterization in some scenarios, but may also be used for correct rendering. Thus, the effects may not be made available in one or more implementations as a direct property on the visual, e.g., like 2D transformations. Thus, in this implementation a developer sets an effect property first and then may set any of its classes.","Bitmaps may be configured in a variety of ways, such as to have a 32 bpp pixel format, which may include eight bits for per-pixel transparency. However, the application  may also specify how global composition system  is to consume the alpha channel. In particular, the composition engine  may ignore alpha altogether, in which case the bitmap is considered fully opaque, or it can respect the alpha channel assuming the colors are either pre-multiplied or not pre-multiplied.","Example Procedures","The following discussion describes global composition system techniques that may be implemented utilizing the previously described systems and devices. Aspects of each of the procedures may be implemented in hardware, firmware, or software, or a combination thereof.

This may be performed in a variety of ways. For example, the graph may be communicated from a web service via a network for receipt by a computing device that executes the composition system (block ), such as from the global composition system  of the web service  via the network  to the composition engine  of the computing device .

The thread, for instance, may be part of execution of the operating system  and thus the operating system  may expose the APIs to the application. Execution of the thread separately from the application  (e.g., a user interface thread of the application ) may be used to ensure smooth frame-rate animations and video presentation. Further, the thread may be configured such that unbounded locks are not supported. Additionally, execution of the thread may be configured to not block in response to a lock that is owned by an application thread, to not perform callbacks to application-controlled code, and so on to further support asynchronous execution.","Timing information is returned that is usable by the application to synchronize rasterization of bitmaps with one or more animations (block ). The information, for example, may be used by the application  to schedule how and when animations and bitmaps are to be rendered and thus may be used by the application for efficient use of resources of the computing device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0094","num":"0097"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 3"],"b":["700","702"]},"The one or more bitmaps are then composed using the operations represented in the tree of objects (block ).
