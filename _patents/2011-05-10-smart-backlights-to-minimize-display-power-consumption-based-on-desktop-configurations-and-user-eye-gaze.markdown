{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to computing devices, and more particularly to power saving methods for computer devices.","Increasingly, people are using mobile computing devices to consume media. Generally, battery life is limited. Once the battery is depleted, the mobile device will shut down and cannot be restarted until a plug can be found or a new battery is provided. This is very frustrating as a user cannot use the mobile device while the battery is drained. Additionally, there are times where the user is only using a certain portion of the display, yet a large amount of energy is expended to light the entire display, which may result in faster battery depletion.","On modern personal computing systems, the display is a significant power consumer and the power consumed by a liquid crystal display (\u201cLCD\u201d) backlight far exceeds the power consumed by the LCD itself. Additionally, backlight systems using Cold Cathode and Hot Cathode Fluorescent Lamp (CCFL\/HCFL) sources also consume a significant amount of power relative to other components of the computer. Even a small power consumption savings in the backlight may result in the user able to use the mobile device for an extended period of time, which is advantageous.","Methods and devices enable a device having a backlight system to conserve power. A method of conserving power usage for a device includes detecting an active region on a display on which the user is focused. The method also includes detecting a non-active region on the display based on a user's gaze or interaction with the display. The method also includes controlling a brightness of a backlight portion of the display depending on the active and non-active region.","In another aspect, the method includes recognizing a first region where a user's focus of gaze is present and forming a second region where the user's focus of gaze is not present and controlling a backlight in the second region to conserve power. In another aspect, detecting the active region and the non-active region comprises imaging a user of the device and recognizing a feature of the user. The method may include determining a gaze of the user based on the recognized feature, setting a portion of the display encompassing the user's gaze as the active region, and setting a portion outside the active region as the non-active region.","In another aspect, a method conserves power usage for a device by controlling portions of a backlight for the device display. The method includes detecting a user's focus of gaze on an active region and a non-active region on the display based on a user interaction with the display. The method includes controlling a brightness of a backlight of the display depending on the active and non-active region. The method also includes providing a plurality of backlight LEDs and individually controlling each LED of the backlight independently relative to a remainder of the LEDs. In another aspect, the method may include providing a plurality of backlight LEDs in a plurality of banks of LEDs and individually controlling each LED independently of the banks.","The method may individually control each LED independently of the banks by using a timing controller. The timing controller can produce multiple pulse width modulation waveforms. The brightness of a light emitting diode or a group of light emitting diodes may be determined by a pulse width modulation waveform that is applied to the light emitting diode.","The pulse width modulation waveform may include a fraction of time the light emitting diode is kept \u201cON\u201d. The pulse width modulation waveform may be generated by a timing controller circuit (TCON). The timing controller generates multiple pulse width modulation waveforms. The timing controller may control each of the light emitting diodes or may control banks of light emitting diodes. A brightness of multiple light emitting diodes, groups, or banks may be controlled.","In another aspect, a method of conserving power usage for a device includes detecting a user's focus of gaze on a display. The method uses the focus of gaze to define an active region and a non-active region on the display. The method may include controlling a brightness of a backlight of the display depending on the active and non-active region using an algorithm. The algorithm allows the individual control of each of the backlight LEDs by determining a location of the LEDs that are located in the active window and controlling LEDs independently outside of the active window.","In a further aspect, a computing device includes a display and a processor coupled to the display in which the processor is configured with processor-executable instructions to perform operations of the methods described above. In a further aspect, a computing device includes means for accomplishing each of the functions in the methods described above. In a further aspect, a non-transitory computer-readable medium has stored thereon processor-executable instructions configured to cause a processor of a computing device processor to perform operations of the methods described above.","The various aspects will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts. References made to particular examples and implementations are for illustrative purposes, and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention or the claims.","The word \u201cexemplary\u201d is used herein to mean \u201cserving as an example, instance, or illustration.\u201d Any implementation described herein as \u201cexemplary\u201d is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other implementations.","As used herein, the terms \u201cmobile device\u201d and \u201chandheld device\u201d refer to any one or all of cellular telephones, personal data assistants (PDA's), palm-top computers, wireless electronic mail receivers, multimedia Internet enabled cellular telephones, Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers, wireless gaming controllers, tablet computers, notebook computers, net book computers, wireless email devices, and similar personal electronic devices that include a programmable processor and memory, and have display with a backlight. As used herein, the terms \u201ccomponent,\u201d \u201cmodule,\u201d \u201csystem,\u201d and the like are intended to refer to a computer-related entity, either hardware, a combination of hardware and software, software, or software in execution. For example, a component may be, but is not limited to being, a process running on a processor, a processor, an object, an executable, a thread of execution, a program, and\/or a computer. By way of illustration, both an application running on a server and the server can be a component. One or more components may reside within a process and\/or thread of execution and a component may be localized on one computer and\/or distributed between two or more computers.","The various aspects described herein provide methods and systems that enable power saving in mobile devices and other computing devices that are battery powered and include a backlit display. In one aspect, a method of conserving power includes detecting an active region where a user is gazing on a display. The method includes assigning the area where the user's gaze is detected as an active region. The method includes assigning the remainder as non-active regions.","In one aspect, the method may include use of a camera associated with the mobile device to capture images of the user as the user is viewing the display. The method may include utilizing an anatomical model that is applied to the tracked images to determine where the user is looking. If the user is looking at the display, the portion of the display within the person's gaze is determined to be active. The other portions of the display are inferred to be non-active areas. In one aspect, the display may comprise one active area and four non-active areas; however, various configurations are possible and the display may comprise a minimum of one active area and one non-active area. The camera may be integrated within the mobile phone or other computing device, or may be a separate component coupled to the device.","In another aspect suitable for implementation on a computing device not equipped with a camera, the active area may be inferred based on the user's interactions. For example, the user may interact with the computing device using an input device, such as, a mouse, a touch screen, a touchpad, a trackball, a keyboard, an infrared camera, a motion tracking device, or any other input device known in the art. Generally, the user may use the input device to control a graphical user interface pointer and move the graphical user interface pointer on a display screen. A software operating system may have or may obtain a location of a graphical user interface cursor or may obtain a location where a user's touch screen input is located on a touch screen. The software operating system may use this location information to determine active portions of the display.","The active portion may be inferred from a location of the cursor on the screen. The active portion may also be inferred from text that is being added to a displayed document by user inputs on a keyboard or a location on the screen of the inputs. The non-active portion of a display may be determined as those portions not in the active portion.","Once the active and non-active portions of the display are determined, the backlight of the mobile communication device may be controlled to reduce power consumption of the non-active portions. A subset of the light emitting diodes in the backlight can be dimmed on the non-active areas to provide power savings. The aspects provide a method and apparatus for controlling the backlight with a fine granularity based on the active and non-active areas of the display.","The present backlight has a number of light emitting diodes that are operatively connected to a backlight timing controller (TCON). The backlight timing controller may generate multiple pulse width modulation signals. Each of the pulse width modulation signals may include different duty cycles to drive individual LEDs or individual cluster of LEDs present on the backlight. The backlight timing controller includes a fine granularity of control. For example, a common 1080p display includes 1920\u00d71080 pixels and may be illuminated by a backlight with 192\u00d7108 LEDs. Here each LED is responsible for lighting up a square grid of 10\u00d710 pixels. However the timing controller is able to control clusters of 12\u00d712 LEDs. The timing controller may be capable of generating 144 different pulse width modulated signals or the number of LEDs (192\u00d7108)\/clusters (12\u00d712)=(16\u00d79)=144 different pulse width modulation signals.","The aspects enable saving power by dynamically reducing a brightness level of those regions of a computer screen that are not in direct view of the user at any given time using a backlight. A typical user does not look at the entire screen at any point of time, but rather the user's eyes are focused on a smaller region of the screen, or the active region. The region surrounding the active region is deemed the non-active region.","The aspect methods and devices determine a location of the active region or an active window and brighten the active region or window while reducing the brightness of the non-active regions. In another aspect, the active region may maintain a given brightness level while the non-active regions are dimmed after a predetermined interval.","The aspect method may include determining a location of the active region by monitoring the user using the mobile device or peripheral devices with a video camera to actively monitor a user's eye gaze direction. A processor associated with the mobile device may determine a user's eye gaze as focused on a specific point on the display of the mobile device, which is used to estimate where on the mobile device display the active region\/window is located.","In a different aspect, a location of the active region can be inferred or determined using information available to the device operating system. For example, a user may open one or more windows using an input device. The mobile device can obtain coordinates of an active window from a desktop window manager or a display driver corresponding to the opened window. A window of an application into which the user is inputting commands can be used to define the active window, with other regions outside of that window being deemed non-active regions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 4","FIG. 1A"],"b":["10","19","10","17","10","11","12","13","10","14","15","11"]},"The computer device  may also include a number of connector ports coupled to the processor  for establishing data connections or for receiving external memory devices, such as a USB or FireWire\u00ae connector sockets, or other network connection circuits for coupling the processor  to a network. In a notebook configuration, the computer housing includes the touchpad , keyboard , and the display  all coupled to the processor . Other configurations of computing device may include a computer mouse or trackball coupled to the processor  (e.g., via a USB input) as are well known, which may also be use in conjunction with the various aspects. The display  includes a number of light emitting diodes that form a backlight. Each of the light emitting diodes of the backlight may be arranged in banks where each light emitting diode may be controlled by the processor  for power savings. In another aspect, each bank, cluster, or group of LEDs may be controlled by a timing controller instead of the processor . As mentioned, the timing controller may be a specialized integrated circuit which may be located on the display panel, or that may be a separate element relative to the display panel. In each of the aspects, the processor  may be replaced with a timing controller or replaced with an integrated circuit that is located on the display panel. A feature recognition camera  for tracking the user of the laptop computer device  may also be provided as a component of the laptop computer . The camera  may be placed in a location to track the user and capture video images. An anatomical model may be applied to the tracked video images to determine where a focus of gaze of the user on the display  is located for power savings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 1B","b":["100","105","100","100","110","100","115"]},"Mobile devices  typically include a computer platform  having a memory  in communication with a processor , such as via an application programming interface (API)  that enables interaction with any resident.

The number of regions - on the display  can vary depending on the size of the display , battery life, the user's gaze, the power consumption of a backlight, a number of backlight LEDs, or by other parameters. Similarly, the laptop  display  of  may also include a top left region , a top right region , a center region , a bottom left region  and a bottom right region . In another aspect, the center region  may be partitioned further into a center left region and a center right region. In another aspect, although the regions are shown as polygonal shapes, the regions may have other shapes, for example, a circular, triangular, elliptical or irregular shape or a shape to match the user's detected gaze patterns. In a further aspect, the regions - may each be differently shaped; for example a first region  may be circular  while a second region  may be triangular, etc. In another aspect, the regions - may be defined by images rendered by pixels, icons, or a window displayed on the display .","Though power characteristics will vary from device  to device  using the instant system, power is saved when the backlight is dimmed. For example, when a backlight is at full brightness the power consumed by the display  subsystem is about 34%-38% of the total system power consumption, and the back light consumes about 26%-29% of total system power consumption. About 8%-9% of the total system power is consumed by a liquid crystal display panel.","When the backlight is at full brightness, the power consumed by the display  subsystem is about 19% of the total system power consumption. About 7% of total system power is consumed by the backlight and about 12% of the total system power is consumed by the liquid crystal display  panel or the pixels. Thus, the system power consumption may be reduced by about 19%-22% when the processor  dims the backlight fully. If the user chooses to use a smaller region of the display , such as making only a quarter of the entire display  the active region, the processor  may dim three quarters of the backlight to enable reducing system power consumption by about 14% to about 16%. These estimates of power consumption and power savings enabled by the aspects are not intended to limit the present disclosure and many factors may affect the total efficiencies and power savings that may be achieved by implementing the aspects.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A and 3B","FIG. 3A"],"b":["100","301","302","302","100","303","304","110","131","110"]},"For example, a mouse or touchpad may receive an input from a user selecting an icon displayed on the display . For example, a keyboard or virtual keyboard also may provide an input from a user. Inputs can be provided to a specific application window displayed on the display . Inputs may be provided in a window displayed on the display . A top window that is used by the user can be detected while a second window may be unused and detected as unused.","In an implementation with multiple windows presented on the display simultaneously, the processor  may infer that since the user utilizing a top window, this specific region or where the top window is located is the active region. For example, the four corners of a window may be the active region and regions outside this window may be the inactive region. In another aspect, the detector  may receive an input from the operating system  and may supplement the eye gaze detector .","In the various aspects, the mobile device  includes a backlight controller . The backlight controller  may be connected to a number of backlights  within the LCD display . A brightness matrix determination block  may be connected to the backlight controller  to determine a first brightness level for the active region while a second level (e.g., a lower brightness level) for the non-active regions. The brightness levels of the pixels that make up the LCD display  remain unchanged. The brightness matrix determination block  may dim a first subset of the backlight LEDs  and may increase the brightness of a second subset of the backlight LEDs . In another aspect, the brightness matrix determination block  may maintain a brightness level of a first subset of the backlight LEDs  and increase the brightness of a second subset of the backlight LEDs  (which is the active region).","In another aspect, the brightness matrix determination block  may decrease a brightness level of a first subset of the backlight LEDs  based on a distance of the LEDs from the active region and maintain the brightness of a second subset of the backlight LEDs  (which is the active region). The brightness matrix determination block  may dim a first subset of the backlight LEDs  by changing a duty cycle of electrical pulses applied to the first subset of LEDs and maintain the brightness of a second subset of the backlight LEDs  by keeping the duty cycle of the pulses substantially unchanged. In an aspect, each backlight LED  may be independently controlled by a processor . In another aspect, the backlight LEDs  may be controlled by a backlight controller. In yet another aspect, the backlight LEDs  may also be controlled by a timing controller.

The difference is based on the location of the illumination source with respect to the optics. If the illumination is coaxial with the optical path the camera , the eye acts as a retro-reflector as the light reflects off the retina creating a bright pupil effect similar to red eye. If the illumination source is offset from the optical path, the pupil appears dark because the retro-reflection from the retina is directed away from the camera . The camera  may use a sampling rate of at least 30 Hz, or 50\/60 Hz. In another aspect, the camera  may be operable at a sampling rate of at ,  or even 1000\/1250 Hz depending on the processor  used in the mobile device  and other factors. Other eye gaze detectors may be used with the mobile device .","Eye movement can be divided into fixations and saccades, when the eye gaze pauses in a certain position and when it moves to another position, respectively. The resulting series of fixations and saccades is called a scan path. Information from the eye can be made to determine the active region - during a fixation, or when the user's gaze fixates on the region for a display  for a predetermined time period. The detector  can count a time period of the eye's fixation on a certain area and compare that time period to a threshold time period (which may be counted by a counter, processor, or timer) prior to making a determination that the region is deemed the active region. On average, visual fixations may last for around 200 ms during the reading of linguistic text, and 350 ms during the viewing of a scene. For example, the counter  shown in  may start when the eye fixes on a region of the display . The counter  may be a digital or analog device that stores a time when an event occurs in relation to a clock signal.

The active window  is enclosed by pixels (x, y) and (x, y) and k=(H\/P) and t=(V\/Q), wherein (k\u00d7t) is the size of a small rectangular grid of pixels that is illuminated by a single LED or an individually controllable cluster of LEDs.","An LED with coordinates (i, j) is in the active region  if the following two conditions are satisfied:\n\n(<=()<); and\n\n(<=()<).\n","The LED can be expressed as outside of the active region  (or in non-active region ) if the above condition is not met.","The brightness of an LED with coordinates (i, j), bij, is given by the following relation: bij=b(i)\u00d7b(j), where, determining b(i) & b(j) depends on whether the LED (i, j) is located inside or outside the active region .","If the LED is located inside the active region  both b(i) & b(j) are set to 1, or the predetermined brightness level set by a user.","If the LED is located outside the active region, the brightness can be reduced by a constant factor or by a factor that is inversely proportional to the distance of the LED from the active region , or by any other strategy.","If the LEDs are dimmed by a constant factor the following relation may be used to determine b(i) and b(j). For example,\n\n()=1 if \u2266()<;\n\n()=()*factor if >()\u2267;\n\n()=1 if \u2266()<;\n\n()=()*factor if >()\u2267.\n","For example, if the brightness of the LEDs are made to be inversely proportional to the distance of the LED from the active region  b(i) and b(j) may be determined as follows:\n\n()=1 if \u2266()<;\n\n()=()*(()\/) if 0\u2266()<;\n\n()=()*((()\u2212)\/()) if <=()<\n\n()=1 if \u2266()<;\n\n()=()*(()\/) if 0\u2266()<;\n\n()=()*((()\u2212)\/()) if \u2266()<\n","For example, a brightness level of \u201c1\u201d may be any value or level set by the user. Other values or fraction or percentages of the value set by user are also envisioned.","The representation shown in  includes k=(H\/P) pixels, and t=(V\/Q) pixels between consecutive LEDs along the horizontal and vertical axes. An active window has starting and ending pixel coordinates are (x, y) and (x, y). This active window is enclosed within the sub-rectangle of the LED grid between the LEDs at ((x\/k), (y\/t)) and ((x\/k)+1, (y\/t)+1). Similarly the sub-rectangle of the LED grid that is enclosed within the active window is between the LEDs at ((x\/k)+1, (y\/t)+1) and ((x\/k), (y\/t)). LEDs within the active window region  may be set to the desired brightness level (as set by user). The LEDs outside this region  may have brightness levels inversely proportional to a distance from the active window . In this aspect, the processor  may determine the LEDs located in the active window  using the above algorithms to determine the brightness of each LED.","For example, LEDs  and  may be determined to be in the active window . LEDs  and  may be determined to be outside of the active window . A distance that the LED  is located from the active window  may be determined. A second distance that the LED  is located from the active window  may also be determined. The LEDs  and  may not have a brightness level dimmed as the LEDs are located in the active window .

In another aspect, the method  may include a decision block for three, four, five or more regions.","The brightness of a particular light emitting diode may be decreased proportionally relative to distance from the active window. For example, a first backlight LED located close to the active region but in the non-active region may have a first brightness while a second backlight LED located farther away from the first backlight LED may have a second brightness (or may be off) that is half the brightness of the first brightness attributed to the further distance away from the active region. The further distance the LED is located from an active window the higher the amount by which a brightness of the LED that forms the display is decreased. For example, one inch away from the active region, the brightness of an LED of the backlight may fall 50 percent and two inches away the brightness may fall 40 percent to 10 percent brightness. For example, a user may set or program power saving options via an operating systems control setting. In this manner, the user may specify backlight dimming parameters.","Once a region of focus is determined, the algorithm may compute a Target Luminance Matrix (TLM) which may indicates a fraction of a user selected brightness that may be applied to each LED. For each LED, this brightness level may compared with the current brightness level of that LED and if the current brightness is higher than the target, the new brightness level for that LED is set to a one level lower than the current brightness level. For example, the new brightness level may be directly set to the target brightness level. Note that while reducing brightness, the processor  may dim one brightness level at a time, but generally will not increase brightness in the same manner. Generally, the processor  may restore the brightness to a predetermined full brightness level and not in a gradual manner. This may not be favored by the user. For example, if the target brightness for any LED is \u20181\u2019 as referenced above, a brightness level for that LED may be set to the user selected brightness level, for example, 75 percent of full brightness.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0108","num":"0107"},"figref":"FIG. 12B","b":["1200","1200","131","131","131","131","131","131"],"i":["b ","b "]},"Method may be implemented in a computing device having a processor  configured with processor-executable instructions to perform the operations of the illustrated loop. In method , the processor  may commence a loop at block  by awakening the subroutine or loop, and reading in video frame data from the device camera in block . The processor  may determine if the user is present in determination block . For example, if the processor cannot recognize a user feature (e.g., head, face, hand, etc.) in the video frame obtained in block , the processor  may determine that the user is not present. If the processor determines that a user is not present in the obtained video image (i.e., determination block =\u201cno\u201d), the processor may increment a sleep timer in block . In determination block , the processor may determine whether the implemented sleep timer exceeds a sleep threshold. Such a sleep threshold represents an amount of time after a user is no longer detected in a camera image at which the device should turn off the display or shutdown. If the sleep timer does not exceed the sleep threshold (i.e., determination block =\u201cno open\u201d), the subroutine or loop may deactivate or go to sleep in block . On the other hand, if the sleep timer does exceed the sleep threshold (i.e., determination block =\u201cyes\u201d), the processor may turn off the display in block . Reactivation of the display may require some user input, such as the press of a button or movement of the device.","If the processor determines that a user is present in the obtained video image (i.e., determination block =\u201cyes\u201d), in block  the processor  may detect a user's eye gaze, determine an active region based on the user's eye gaze, and determine coordinates of a matrix of LEDs that fall within the user's gaze. These operations in block  may be accomplished using methods described above.","In decision block , the processor  may compare the coordinates of the matrix of LEDs within the user's gaze with the coordinates of a prior LED matrix to determine whether the matrices share characteristics. If the detected LED matrix is not the same as the LED matrix from the previous loop cycle (i.e., decision block =\u201cNo\u201d) this indicates that the user is viewing different portions of the display than in the last loop cycle and thus has not focused on a particular portion, so the processor  may set a presence timer to 0 (i.e., reset the timer) in block . The purpose of the presence timer is to delay dimming portions of the display for a few seconds to avoid flickering when the user's gaze is moving rapidly about on the display (e.g., reading text spanning the width of the display). In block , the processor  may compute a new target luminance matrix as described herein, such as to brighten the entire display or a previously dimmed non-active portion since the user is now focusing on a different portion of the display. In block  the processor may apply the new brightness level (which may involve maintaining the current brightness level if the new target luminance matrix is the same as the current target luminance matrix). In block , the subroutine or loop may deactivate or go to sleep until the next loop iteration is initiated.","If the detected LED matrix is the same as the LED matrix from the previous loop cycle (i.e., decision block =\u201cYes\u201d), which indicates that the user is viewing the same general portion of the display and so the matrix of LEDs within the user's gaze is unchanged from the last loop cycle, the processor  may increment the presence timer in block . In decision block , the processor  may determine whether the timer exceeds a presence threshold value. If so (i.e., decision block =\u201cYes\u201d), which may indicate that the determined LED matrix is the active region because the user's gaze has remained fixed position on the display, the processor  may reduce a brightness level of LEDs located outside the active region in block . In block , the subroutine or loop is terminated, and execution of the thread suspends until the next iteration is invoked. On the other hand, if the threshold is not reached (i.e., decision block =\u201cNo\u201d), the subroutine or loop may deactivate (illustrated as \u201csleep\u201d in the figure) until the next loop iteration is initiated.","Method may be executed periodically (i.e., initiating the loop in block ) by the processor , such as once every 5 seconds, so that the gaze detection process is not performed continuously. The frequency of running the method may be adjusted so as not to consume too much power running the algorithm by the processor . In a particular case, after it is determined that a user is not present and hence the display  is turned off in block , the method may not be activated by the processor  again until the processor  determines by some other method that the user has resumed using the device . For example, a particular button press, mouse\/keyboard activity or motion sensor may be monitored by the processor  to recognize when the user is attending to the device again. Alternatively, the camera may be activated periodically, say once every 5 to 10 seconds, and the user detection algorithm in determination block  performed in order to detect when the user has returned.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0114","num":"0113"},"figref":["FIG. 13A","FIG. 13B","FIG. 13A","FIG. 13B"],"b":["110","1300","1310","110","1300","1300","1311","1312","1311","1310","1300","1310","1311","1310","1312","131","131","131","1313","131","110","1311","1310","110","1311"]},"In a further aspect, a uniform dimming of the non-active regions across the display  may be implemented. In another aspect, the amount of time that the user gazes on the active region before non-active regions are dimmed (referred to as the presence threshold in the description of ) may vary and may be user selectable. For example, the user may program the method to wait for 30 seconds, one minute, or any other value before dimming the non-active regions. In yet another aspect, the device  may capture audio using a microphone to assist with determining whether a user is present at the device. For example, the processor  may determine that if the surroundings are silent, no user is present and the backlight may be dimmed. This determination may be made in combination with analysis of a captured video image, such as described above with respect to block  through  in . Alternatively, if multiple different users are determined to be heard, the display backlight may be set to full brightness as a processor  may determine that many individuals are viewing the display. The amount of processing to determine the active and non-active region does not use more power than dimming the backlight or a portion thereof as too little savings may occur if too much processing is performed.
