Customers are typically ordered in a queue and served on a first come first serve basis. Each customer is typically teamed up with or connected with the next available agent from a pool of agents in order to optimize service and provide the fastest agent response time. However, the customer may be matched with a new agent each time the customer contacts a support center. Such variation in agents may be frustrating for customers who may have to repeat information for each new agent and may also be inefficient for the agents who may have to be updated on issues already resolved by previous agents.","Further variability may be introduced when customers use multiple different channels of communication, such as the Internet and call centers, for customer service. For example, customers often shop online (using one channel of communication to research products), but buy over the phone (using another channel of communication to purchase products). However, if a customer contacts a call center after extensive Internet research, for example, to make a final purchase over the telephone, the call center agent has no information about the customer's Internet sessions. That is, agents contacted via one channel may have no way to track a customer's history across another channel. Therefore, agents remain uninformed or depend on the customer to report their history, a slow and unreliable process.","A device, system and method is provided for monitoring a user's interactions with Internet-based programs or documents. Content may be extracted from Internet server traffic according to predefined rules. Extracted content may be associated with a user's Internet interaction. The user's Internet interaction may be stored and indexed. The user's Internet interaction may be analyzed to generate a recommendation provided to a contact center agent while the contact center agent is communicating with said user, e.g., in real-time, for guiding the user's Internet interaction. Traffic other than Internet server traffic may also be used.","It will be appreciated that for simplicity and clarity of illustration, elements shown in the figures have not necessarily been drawn to scale. For example, the dimensions of some of the elements may be exaggerated relative to other elements for clarity. Further, where considered appropriate, reference numerals may be repeated among the figures to indicate corresponding or analogous elements.","In the following description, various aspects of the present invention will be described. For purposes of explanation, specific configurations and details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will also be apparent to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without the specific details presented herein. Furthermore, well known features may be omitted or simplified in order not to obscure the present invention.","Unless specifically stated otherwise, as apparent from the following discussions, it is appreciated that throughout the specification discussions utilizing terms such as \u201cprocessing,\u201d \u201ccomputing,\u201d \u201ccalculating,\u201d \u201cdetermining,\u201d or the like, refer to the action and\/or processes of a computer or computing system, or similar electronic computing device, that manipulates and\/or transforms data represented as physical, such as electronic, quantities within the computing system's registers and\/or memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computing system's memories, registers or other such information storage, transmission or display devices.","When used herein, a telephone call may include devices and networks beyond the \u201cplain old telephone system\u201d (POTS), such as VOIP telephone calls using personal computers. \u201cCalling\u201d in the context of a person taking action may including using a traditional telephone or other device such as a VOIP telephone, cellular telephone, or other device, to speak with another person. Further, embodiments of the invention may allow for a user to contact an agent via other methods, such as on-line chat. \u201cCalling\u201d in the context of a process or processor taking action may mean, for example, executing a software process, requesting a software process perform some function or return some result, etc.","Embodiments of the invention provide a system and method for tracking and analyzing interactions of each customer over the World Wide Web (\u201cweb\u201d) including the Internet and\/or an Intranet (when used herein, the web may be used interchangeably with the Internet and\/or Intranet, as web is a system of interlinked hypertext documents accessed via the Internet and\/or Intranet). For example, each time a user or customer interacts with the web or Internet, for example, selecting a search term, \u201cbrowsing\u201d or accessing a webpage, viewing a product description via the Internet, etc., such interactions may be recorded. Data may be extracted from each web interaction, for example, according to, matching or corresponding to a set of predefined parameters, features or rules for tracking web interactions, such as, the amount of time a webpage was viewed, a number of times or which different items are selected on a webpage, the order in which the webpage was viewed, the number of repeated viewings over a time span, the presence or frequency of certain key-words, etc. The predefined extracted features may be fixed or designed by a company support team or process optimization (PO) designer and may be adapted on a session-by-session basis. Capturing and extracting web content features may be executed using a passive or server-side web browser sniffer or capture device. A user's interaction with the web or with the Internet may include remote access of web documents, interaction with remote programs via the Internet, interaction with other users or institutions via interaction with remote programs via the Internet, etc.","Embodiments of the invention may analyze interactions and extract web content for each customer or user to build one or more session summaries. A session may include a series of interactions executed by a customer, for example, ending when the customer logs off, closes the browser used for viewing, completes a transaction, or finishes viewing a document. A session may end, for example, after a predetermined session duration of time, after customer inactivity for a predetermined time, or after a maximum number of interactions. Embodiments of the invention provide a session summary which may include, for example, a description of the customer's interactions including title of webpage(s), webpage universal resource locator (URL), date\/time webpage(s) created, product(s) viewed, prices offered, product categories (used vs. new, wholesale vs. retail, etc.), customer search words, customer highlighting or selection of products, etc.","Customer interactions may be tracked using \u201ccross-channel\u201d analysis, e.g., across multiple channels of communication. For example, a web summary of a user's online (e.g., Internet or web) session may be retrieved upon receipt of an incoming call from the same user or when initiating a call session to the same user. Similarly, a call summary of a user's call center session may be retrieved upon the user initiating an online customer service session. In general, an agent providing support to a user may retrieve summaries for all sessions across all communication channels or a subset of a session, for example, within a specified time period, conducted over specific communication channels (such as, only web interactions or only call center interactions), relevant to the current session topic (such as, including key-words in the extracted data that match key-words of the current session), etc. Web browsing on a user's private computer may be captured or recorded by using passive sniffing devices, probes or other capturing modules. The capturing modules may be initiated automatically or after gaining permission from the user. The agent or the support program designer may select which session summaries to review. In some embodiments, a list of session summaries may be provided for selection to an agent that may be ordered according to session relevance, for example, based on the frequency and\/or number of matching key-words in the session compared to the current session.","In some embodiments, each live agent may be provided with an automated agent, for example, to prompt the live agent with dialogue, strategies to resolve issues, and other instructions or recommendations for interacting with a user. The automated agent recommendations may be based on the user's cumulative single-channel or cross-channel web and\/or call center history. Such embodiments may provide a semi-live\/semi-automated agent by providing the live agent with automated tasks. The automated information may include, not only the current customer's history, but also one or more corresponding ideal session histories or summaries for comparison, for example, to predict optimal future session paths to recommend to the customer. The ideal histories may be based on real-life session summaries generated by other satisfied customers or may be modeled sessions generated in a computer-training environment by a computer programmer or trainer. The ideal session histories may be retrieved from a pool of session histories that most closely matches the topics, key-works and\/or other features used in the current customer's session. The ideal session histories may be fixed, e.g., including a linear path of webpages to browse, or dynamic, e.g., including tree-structured or matrix paths, where each chosen webpage path leads to different options, and thus different outcomes.","Customer interactions may be tracked in real-time, for example, while the contact center agent is communicating with the user or during or concurrently with the customer interactions or at a small time delay thereafter (e.g., on the order or a few second or milliseconds).","Agents may include real-life interactive personnel, automated computer agents, avatars, voice or text prompts, etc., or a combination semi-live\/semi-automated agent. In one embodiment, an automated agent may track a user's session in real-time and\/or provide recommendations, for example, from a recommendations database, that may be linked to conditions detected in the user's session. The recommendations may be sent to the agent in real-time or while the contact center agent is communicating with the user, for example, using a telephone, Internet or other user-agent connection. In another embodiment, an automated agent may use one or more ideal session histories, where for each customer webpage interaction, the automated agent may recommend or re-direct (upon user verification) the customer to the next optimal predicted webpage or interaction defined by the ideal session histories.","Embodiments of the invention provides systems and methods for \u201crecording\u201d or tracking customer-specific and\/or session-specific web activity, for example, by capturing Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) web traffic data (e.g., representing user interactions across the Internet with remote documents or programs), extracting information from the data, and filtering, extracting or saving relevant information for analysis and playback. The data may describe the cross-channel customer behavior of the customer and may be used to discern the behavior of customer groups across the different channels in order to optimize channel usage. The analyzed data for a customer may be provided to an agent serving or communicating with the customer. The agent may be connected to the customer via for example a telephone call center (which may include a telephone call via a computer) and may receive the customer's web session data. In some embodiments, the customer's web session data may define the customer's past web interactions. The agent may receive a real-time guidance message (e.g., generated by a PO Client), notifying the agent that the customer has interacted with the web server in the past. The real-time guidance message may offer up-sell or cross-sell options, for example, according to the analysis of the web interaction and business rules in a recommendations database. The real-time guidance message may also offer to play back past web interaction. In some embodiments, the customer's web session data may define the customer's current or ongoing web interactions. For example, a customer interacting with an agent may have been or may begin interacting with a web server, for example, with or without the agent's knowledge or according to the agent's instructions. The agent may receive a real-time guidance message (e.g., generated by the PO Client), notifying the agent that the customer is interacting with the web server. The real-time guidance message may offer to \u201cshadow browse\u201d the customer, for example, simulating the customer's web session for the agent to view. Embodiments of the invention may be used for technical support, selling, \u201cup-selling\u201d or \u201ccross-selling,\u201d filling in surveys, etc., although other applications may be used.","Reference is made to , which schematically illustrates a system  for monitoring a user's web or cross-channel interactions in accordance with an embodiment of the invention.","System  may include one or more user computers  for interacting over the web (e.g. via the Internet), one or more web servers  for hosting or distributing information over the web (e.g. via the Internet), one or more web capture servers , analysis servers  and\/or storage centers  for monitoring user's interactions with Internet-based programs or documents. System  may also include one or more additional user devices , such as telephone, SMS message or text enabled devices, for the user to interact over another network, such as, a telephone or messaging network. User computers  may include for example web browsing software to enable a user to access remote websites via the Internet.","User computer , e.g., controlled by a user, may access documents, websites and web pages provided by web servers  via a network , such as the web or Internet. Web servers  may include applications for retrieving and viewing web content on user computer . In one embodiment, the user may be a customer browsing webpages, which are supported by web servers . Web capture servers  may record, copy, or capture user traffic on web servers , for example, using a passive sniffing device or other device (e.g., probe  of ). An interactions center  may be responsible for recording and managing rules, monitoring and scheduling telephone or web-connections and populating a database  with user interaction data. Interactions center  may be installed on a dedicated server. In one embodiment, analysis server  and interactions center  may be installed on the same server.","A client installed on agent device  (e.g., PO client  of ) may identify \u201cinteresting\u201d or significant content, interactions or information exchanged with Internet accessible programs, documents or webpages from the captured traffic that satisfies, corresponds to or matches predefined rules or criteria. Interesting content may be defined (e.g., by a client at agent device , such as, PO client  of ), for example, as content or information which conforms to or passes certain rules or criteria, is matched to certain patterns, or by other criteria. For example, the rules or criteria may define the web elements to be extracted and\/or the webpages or websites from which the data elements may be extracted. In one embodiment, the rules or criteria may be generated by an agent or system designer (e.g., using a PO designer, such as, PO designer  of ), and may be uploaded via the agent client to analysis servers  to extract the data elements from the web traffic according to those rules.","The client at agent device  may request the interesting information, for example, including information from closed (past) web sessions from database  (e.g., via server  of ) and information from open (ongoing) web sessions from analysis server .","Analysis server  may extract metadata, embedded tags, URLs or other information attached to recorded, copied, or captured webpages or websites for ongoing or current web sessions. Analysis server  may identify which user executed those interactions and may attach user profile data, user identification codes or other user-related data to the extracted or saved interaction content or documents. In this manner or other manners content or interactions may be associated with or linked to a user or customer. Analysis server  may compile or assemble each user's associated content to generate a summary of the user's web-interaction history, for example, which may be sent in real-time to the agent client. Analysis server  may analyze, edit, and index the extracted or saved interaction content, for example, to create an organized and uniform repository of user histories, e.g., in database , that may be easily accessed by customer service agents. In some embodiments, analysis server  may assign indicators or categories to interactions, for example, such as, the user that executes the interaction, topics or key-words in the interaction (e.g., product X, service Y, financial\/billing issues, etc.), the channel of communication for the interaction (e.g., web, telephone, messaging, in person, etc.) and\/or the time of the interaction (e.g., the exact time of the interaction, if the interaction occurred in the past hour\/day\/month\/year, the time difference since the previous interaction for the same topic, etc.). Analysis server  may determine which user interactions are relevant to the current issue by matching their identifiers to relevancy criteria received from the agent client. For example, analysis server  may retrieve all interactions for a specific user, on a specific topic, in any communication channel within the past hour. The relevancy criterion for selecting interactions may be predefined, statistically computed to generate a predetermined number of interactions or \u201chits,\u201d or selected by the agent.","Users may be connected via user computers  (for web connections) and\/or user devices  (for other network connections) with live or automated agents at agent devices . Agents may provide users with customer support, conduct transactions for purchasing products or services, fill out surveys, or provide other products or services. Agent devices  may be connected to database  storing information related to users' interaction histories over the web and\/or other networks. When an agent is connected to a user, the agent may automatically or, after sending a request, gain access to the user's interaction history. Database  may also store recommendations for users. Agent devices  may automatically retrieve the recommendations from database  having a predefined correlation with the user with which the agent is currently communicating. The recommendations may be communicated automatically while the agent is communicating with the user, for example, via an automated agent or to prompt a live agent to manually communicate the recommendations to the user. Agents may be guided through user interactions and prompted with recommendations or scripts, for example, to standardize and optimize agent support.","In some embodiments, agent devices  may \u201cshadow-browse\u201d a user computer, for example, providing agent devices  with real-time playback of user computer  interactions so that the agent may monitor or guide user interactions in real time. The playback may include a simulated screen-shot of user computer , a table or control panel listing interaction details, such as, URLs, product descriptions, user commands, etc., and\/or a user interaction summary. In some embodiments, analysis server  may provide \u201cchannel containment\u201d analysis, for example, describing the reasons that users switch from one communication channel (e.g., Internet) to another (e.g., telephone). Channel containment analysis may allow a company to use the identified problems in each channel to improve customer support (e.g., by re-designing web pages, providing more information on each channel) to keep more customers in their original channel (e.g., Internet). Analysis server  and\/or interactions center  may track end-to-end first contact resolution, for example, to determine if a user's problem or issue is resolved completely (from end-to-end) within a first contact with an agent device , or if the user does not resolve their issue or is transferred or re-connected multiple times to one or more support channels to resolve their issue. Analysis server  may provide \u201cchum prediction,\u201d for example, where by analyzing one or more (e.g., Internet or cellular telephone) interactions, the center may predict whether or not a company or service provider is at risk of losing its customer.","User computer  and agent device  may be personal computers, desktop computers, mobile computers, laptop computers, and notebook computers or any other suitable device such as a cellular telephone, personal digital assistant (PDA), video game console, etc., and may include wired or wireless connections or modems. Although user computer  and agent device  are described to be computer devices with a web connection, they may alternatively be telephone or messaging devices or a combination of telephone, messaging and\/or computer, for example, so that the agent and user may interact via multiple communication networks. User computer  and agent device  may include one or more input devices, for receiving input from a user or agent (e.g., via a pointing device, click-wheel or mouse, keys, touch screen, recorder\/microphone, other input components) and output devices  and  (e.g., a monitor or screen) for displaying data to a user and agent, respectively.","User computer , web capture server , analysis server , agent device  web servers  and interactions center , may each include one or more controller(s) or processor(s) , , , , , and , respectively, for executing operations and one or more memory unit(s) , , , ,  and , respectively, for storing data and\/or instructions (e.g., software) executable by a processor. Processor(s) , , , ,  and  may include, for example, a central processing unit (CPU), a digital signal processor (DSP), a microprocessor, a controller, a chip, a microchip, an integrated circuit (IC), or any other suitable multi-purpose or specific processor or controller. Memory unit(s) , , , ,  and  may include, for example, a random access memory (RAM), a dynamic RAM (DRAM), a flash memory, a volatile memory, a non-volatile memory, a cache memory, a buffer, a short term memory unit, a long term memory unit, or other suitable memory units or storage units.","Web capture server , analysis server , storage centers , agent device , and interactions center , may each be, for example, software executed on one or more processors, and while this software may be in one processing device or server, it is not necessarily executed by the same processor or within the same computing device.","Reference is made to , which schematically illustrates an interface  provided to a customer agent in accordance with an embodiment of the invention.","Interface  may be a prompt or an \u201cautomated agent\u201d provided to a live agent via a device (e.g., agent device  ). Interface  may display a summary  of a history of a current customer's one or more relevant or interesting web or cross-channel interactions. Relevant or interesting interactions may be determined by rule matching or matching identifiers, in which the interactions are selected that are assigned identifiers (e.g., topic, time, product, etc.) that match identifiers associated with the current interaction or that match key-words entered by the agent. The summary of the customer's interactions may include a description of the customer activity and\/or details  of the matching interaction, for example, product or service details. Interface  may also display one or more recommendation(s)  for the agent to communicate with the user, for example, to provide technical support, offer deals, or up-sell the same or similar product or service. Interface  may also include a customer response field  to register the customer's response to the agent recommendations. Interface  may update the recommendations based on the customer response, for example, automatically or when requested by the agent, to provide alternative recommendations if the response was negative or similar recommendations if the response was positive (or tentative). Interface  may include agent options , such as, \u201crebuttal\u201d to retrieve an automated rebuttal to customer inquiries, \u201cfollow-up\u201d to register a follow-up interaction with the customer to reiterate the current interaction or sale offer, \u201csend Info\u201d to automatically send sale or interaction details to the user at a registered contact point (e.g., via email, text or telephone) or \u201cplayback\u201d to play the customer's current or previous relevant web interaction for the agent. Other fields and interfaces may be displayed.","Interface  may be displayed to an agent, for example, as a dedicated window, an embedded window (e.g., using a customer relationship management (CRM) system), a pop-up window, a webpage, an application page, and\/or any combination or variation thereof.","Reference is made to , which schematically illustrates a cross-channel analytics workflow  in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Workflow  may be executed at interactions center  (to manage rules for monitoring agent-user interactions), analysis server  (to extract the data according to the rules), a PO client (to enable real-time guidance) of . Workflow  may include cross-channel sequencing , trend analysis , root cause analysis  and\/or impact reporting .","Cross-channel sequencing  may sequence or index customer cross-channel interactions, for example, according to topics, key-words, communication channel, time, etc., to create an organized and uniform database of customer interactions that may be easily searched to detect relevant interactions.","Trend analysis  may include generating sequence distribution reports, sequence trend analysis, segment analysis, channel deflection analysis, key performance indicators (KPIs) and\/or alerts.","Root cause analysis  may identify a probable root cause of channel-deflection, in which the user switches from one communication channel to another, for example, calling a contact center after viewing the company web site. Root cause analysis  may also include agent comparison analysis and\/or customer segment analysis.","Impact reporting  may include automatically generating marketing, business or technology reports, coaching agents by providing immediate automated tips or by providing follow-up training sessions specifically targeted to improve the agent's areas of weakness, and real-time guidance by providing a real-time prompt or recommendations to agents while they serve or communicate with a customer (e.g., via interface  of ).","Trend analysis , root cause analysis , and impact reporting  may each be, for example, software executed on one or more processors, which may or may not be located in the same computing device.","Reference is made to , which schematically illustrates a system  for monitoring a user's web interactions in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Components and processes of  may be executed using devices and processors of FIG. , such as, for example, web capture server , analysis server , agent device , and interactions center  and their processors , ,  and .","System  may include a web server  (e.g., web server  of ) providing web content or documents (e.g., interactions with programs, documents, or users accessed via the Internet) and a switch  for user computers  (e.g., user computers  of ) to connect and interact with web server . System  may include a network interface card (NIC)  to connect a probe  to switch . Probe  may monitor user computers'  web interactions, for example, by recording, copying, passively sniffing or capturing web pages, scripts and any other web content according to capture criteria. Probe  may execute a targeted search of interactions, for example, in a user or kernel operating system (OS) modes. Probe  may transfer interactions data, for example, including packets of HTML pages and scripts, to internet processing server (IPS) . IPS  may process the interactions packets and sort or extract targeted information, for example, into page data and\/or metadata (e.g., URLs, cookies, etc.). Switch , NIC , probe  and\/or IPS  may be components of or connected to one or more capture servers (e.g., capture servers  of ) and may be operated by one or more processors  thereof. A capture storage  (e.g., storage center  of ) may save the captured page data (e.g., in a storage hierarchy) and a capture database  (e.g., database  of ) may save the captured metadata, although other or additional data elements may also be saved.","A web analyzer  (e.g., analysis server  of ) may retrieve data from capture storage  and\/or capture database  and may analyze the data, identify, filter, save or extract interesting elements, such as, products and products prices, that satisfy, match or correspond to rules set by a rule manager  and create user sessions. Web analyzer  may automatically and passively determine the user identity of web interactions, for example, by passively sniffing metadata (e.g., cookies) or the web pages themselves. A \u201csniffer\u201d or \u201cpacket analyzer\u201d may refer to a device or executable software adapted to capture, intercept and\/or log traffic passing over a digital network, such as, the Internet. \u201cPassive\u201d may refer to an act, such as, sniffing, executed independently of the act. For example, a passive sniffer may intercept and record network traffic independently or separately from the network traffic users (e.g., user computers ) and providers (e.g., web server ). Web analyzer  may also automatically and passively divide the interactions into distinct user sessions for an agent device  (e.g., agent device  ), for example, via a PO client . PO client  may determine when a previous session ends (e.g., when no user feedback is received for a predetermined period of time) and when a new session begins (e.g., when user feedback is received after a delay). PO client  may communicate with web analyzer  via a connection server . PO client  may be installed on any device in system , for example, including user computers , agent devices  and\/or web analyzer .","User computers  interactions with web servers  may be recorded as data, such as, URLs of accessed web pages, metadata of accessed web pages, links selected, etc. PO client  may determine the rules for identifying or extracting information, such as, screen elements, metadata or other web objects, from the interaction data. Web analyzer  may store or save identified, filtered or extracted interaction data (e.g., which match or correspond to rules) in an interactions database  (e.g., database  of ) based on configuration rules or criteria provided to web analyzer , for example, via a configuration loader module or PO client . For example, web analyzer  may include an interface, such as a call server application programming interface (CAPI), to trigger an interaction center  (e.g., interaction center  of ) to populate interactions database  with relevant interactions that satisfy the configuration rules. In one example, a configuration rule may specify interactions where the user browses a page for a description of product X. Configuration rules may be the same or different for each user session, each customer service interaction, and\/or each agent device . In some embodiments, web analyzer  may save all webpages in a web session or may save only the subset of webpages that satisfy the rules defined by rule manager .","A customer resolver  and\/or  may be provided to identify which interactions belong to which customers or users, for example, by matching customer identifiers or extracted data to data in a customer database. Each matched interaction may be assigned a customer identification (ID) defining the associated customer in a mapping table, which may store the interaction ID, customer ID, associated key-words, associated identifiers, etc. Accordingly, when the interaction center connects an agent to a customer, the agent may easily access interactions linked to the customer via the customer ID. The agent may refine a search to access only a subset of the customer's relevant interactions, for example, by specifying interaction criteria or rules, such as, interaction topics, key-words, communication channel, time, etc. For example, a rule may be to access \u201call sessions in the past week for a specific customer\u201d or \u201call sessions that include a product X.\u201d Customer resolver  may be connected to or disposed in interaction center  and alternatively or additionally, customer resolver  may be connected to or disposed in connection server .","A business analyzer (BA)  (e.g., analysis server  of ) may automatically generate marketing, business or technology impact reports, or collect data for such impact analysis, for example, based on completed or past user sessions.","Interaction center  may include a customer resolver module interfacing with agent device  to provide agents with relevant user interactions from interactions database . Agent device  may query BA  via connection server  for closed sessions and web analyzer  for open sessions. BA  and web analyzer  may supply agent device  with a list of closed and open sessions, respectively, for a specified user upon request. In some embodiments, interactions database  may store additional non-web interactions, such as telephone, email or messaging interactions, which may be provided to the agent device for additional cross-channel analysis to improve customer service. Agent device  may be provided with interaction details, including, for example, a history of the user's past web interactions, a summary of those interactions, a playback module to view simulations of those interactions and a guide listing recommendations to optimize those interactions. Interaction details may be provided to agent device  via an interface (e.g., via interface  of ).","Some embodiments of the invention may allow agent device  to track open session interactions on user computer  in real-time using PO client  (installed on agent device ). PO client  may transfer or make data available in real-time from open or current sessions (e.g., as well as past sessions). PO client  may transfer the data from each user computer  to one or more agent device , for example, which are assigned to provide the user support. Agent device  may view a user's past session data as a history of relevant interactions, as a summary report of those interactions, or as a playback simulation of the interactions. In addition or alternatively, agent device  may view the user's current session data as a history or summary report updated in real-time or as a real-time interaction simulation in a shadow browsing interface.

Every product in the list may be found under the list Xpath in the next DIV, TR tag or other an HTML tag element. For example, the first element may be found under DIV[1], the second element may be found under DIV[2], and so on. In some embodiments, a more complex operation may be used to find the elements. For example, if there are two path variables, x and y, the x index may refer to a start location for extracting elements (e.g., the first element, the second element, etc.) and the y index may refer to a \u201cjump\u201d or difference between consecutive start element location (e.g., extract every second element, every third element, etc.).

In another example to extract a product name element from a webpage, the Xpath may be: DIV[2]\/DIV[1]\/DIV[1]\/DIV[4]\/FORM[2]\/DIV[1]\/DIV[4,2]\/DIV[3]\/DIV[1]\/DIV[1]\/DIV[1]\/H3[1]\/A[1], where the first Xpath part, DIV[2]\/DIV [1]\/DIV[1]\/DIV[4]\/FORM[2]\/DIV[1], may define the list container, the second Xpath part, DIV[4,2], may define the language and the third Xpath part, DIV[3]\/DIV[1]\/DIV[1]\/DIV[1]\/H3[1]\/A[1], may define the product name. The language field of the Xpath may define which elements to extract from the container.

Tenants (e.g., users providing system capabilities to other users) may only have visibility and access to their own web interactions.","An agent (e.g., at agent device  of ) may use playback interfaces - to query and play back past web interactions (e.g., from a business analyzer or interactions database). The playback information may be stored in an interaction database (e.g., database  of ) and\/or a capture storage (e.g., storage  of  for storing html files). The agent (e.g., agent device  of ) may use a PO client (e.g., PO client  of ) to select the specific user session to view. Playback interfaces - may play back past and\/or ongoing web interactions, for example, allowing a PO client to send a relevant notification to the agent, including web interaction information. Visibility to ongoing interactions may have a predetermined maximum delay of, for example, 10-30 seconds, from the time the user starts interacting with the website. An agent may be able to play back a past web interaction via a link provided in a real-time guidance message created by the PO client. An agent may able to play back an ongoing web interaction (e.g., by shadow browsing) via a link provided in a real-time guidance message created by the PO client, for example, with a predetermined maximum delay of 5-20 seconds. While playing back ongoing web interactions, the web player may be constantly updated with new user browsing data and may allow showing either all pages browsed by the user or only relevant pages defined in the PO client (e.g., configurable via the web player). An agent may be able to play back a web interaction while browsing the website in real-time to compare system behavior (e.g., by \u201cco-browsing\u201d). The agent may be able to play back multi-website scenarios in one playback window (e.g., by multi-session unified playback).","Other play back interfaces or functionality may be used.","Web interaction capture solutions may include, for example, the following (other or additional solutions may be used):\n\n","Some benefits of web recording solutions include, for example, the following (other or additional benefits may be found):\n\n","Web recording systems may support up to N (e.g., N=5) multiple channel interactions performing web recording. Each multi-channel interactions center may be targeted to support multiple web capture servers and handle usage models (e.g., a model of the target amount or rate of traffic that may be monitored by the system, such as, 100,000 user sessions per day). Up to N multi-channel interactions centers may be supported in a linked web recording system configuration. In one example, web recording systems may support customers with up to 5 million page views per day and 200,000 web interactions per day using 85 GB of data per day (e.g., without images). The Multi-channel Interactions Center handling web recording may also be able to handle voice and text recording in conjunction with the web recording, for example, by re-appropriating and reducing web recording capacity or by increasing system capacity. A maximum of one (or more) storage center (e.g., interaction database  of ) may be used to store all web interactions in the web recording system.","For system security, the user may be able to define, for example, in the PO client, specific screen elements that are not to be extracted from web pages or available for playback. Such screen elements may adhere to privacy standards across industries, such as, financial privacy standards, e.g., payment card industry (PCI) standards, medical information privacy standards, technological privacy standards, etc.","Web recording systems may support one or more of the following resiliency mechanisms (other or additional resiliency mechanisms may also be used):\n\n","Web recording systems may support any usage scenarios when voice interactions are imported using a platform agnostics solution.","Web recording systems may use \u201ccertified server\u201d specifications to support the multi-channel interactions center and\/or web capture server.

The real-time guidance may notify the agent that the user has interacted with a web server in the past or is currently interacting with the web server in the present. The real-time guidance message may offer recommendations for agent to communicate to the user, for example, including up-sell or cross-sell options. The real-time guidance message may also offer to play back past web interactions and\/or shadow-browse current web interactions. Real-time recommendations and\/or playback may be provided, for example, while the contact center agent is communicating with said user or during or concurrently with the customer interactions or at a small time delay thereafter (e.g., on the order or a few second or milliseconds).

Web analytics solutions may include projects created by a PO designer to include a web configuration defining parameters for monitoring, capturing and extracting elements from the user's web sessions.","Components in system  may have, for example, the following functionality.\n\n","Embodiments of the invention may optimize real-time guidance workflow performance for web analytics. In one embodiment, real-time guidance may provide an agent with information on user's web interactions and advice to recommend to the user in real-time, for example, as the user interacts with the web. A customer resolver may may resolve a customer resolving by using a customer data base to translate a user or customer identifier (e.g., extracted by web analyzer  of ) into a customer ID. Customer resolving may be executed by a customer resolver (e.g., customer resolver  and\/or  of ) using stored procedures, which may be invoked at an agent device or interaction center (e.g., agent device  or interaction center  of ) according to a real-time guidance workflow. The stored procedure may return a customer's web login from the identifier that is retrieved by a PO client. The stored procedure may run or execute on a customer database to support, for example, up to 50 million customers. As with other examples discussed herein, other capacities, numbers of customers, limits, etc. may be used. Customers' ongoing sessions may be retrieved, for example, upon demand or automatically after an agent connects e.g., via a telephone call, to the customer. In some embodiments, the ongoing sessions may be retrieved from a single web analyzer which stores the open sessions in a memory.","The web analyzer may support scale out and may store the open sessions, for example, in a distributed cache and\/or interaction center. Scale out may duplicate instances at some servers, for example, to extend the load capabilities of the servers. The connection server may use a DLL provided by web analyzer to access the open sessions repository to retrieve (e.g., and register for events of) specific customer's open sessions.","Customers' past sessions may be retrieved. Customers' past sessions may include connection server queries for the individual customer's web interactions. A business analyzer service may generate the past sessions data for single and\/or multi-site queries. In one embodiment, customers' past sessions may be stored in a cache that may hold, for each customer, the web interactions in a predetermined past time interval (e.g., the past N months). The cache may store session data only for customers that have interacted on the web within a predetermined past time interval (e.g., the last M days). The connection server may access the cache in the real-time guidance workflow. The cache may be configured, for example, as a distributed cache, for example, using a distributed cache wrapper infrastructure, or as a local cache or database in each web analyzer.","The connection server may query a long term data storage to search for the customers' past interactions. Using the long term storage to search for the customers past interactions may free the load from business analyzer services. However, using the long term storage may cause complications, for example, due to a possible wide area network (WAN) between the connection server and long term storage and due to the long term storage missing the most recent past interactions (e.g., occurring in the last hour). In order to include the most recent (e.g., last hour) customer interactions, sessions in a distributed cache may not be immediately cleared once they close, but may only be cleared after a predetermined time delay (e.g., one hour).","Embodiments of the invention may support definitions and deployment for multiple file access servers (FASs). For file access server (FAS) scale out, the load balancer may support routing to the different connect server instances, for example, by \u201csticky\u201d routing. The FAS component may be responsible for streaming extracted data, such as, html files constructed by an IPS. If multiple FAS components are used, for example, in order, to increase processing capabilities, a load balancing mechanism may be implemented between all the FAS instances to evenly distribute the processing load therebetween. \u201cSticky routing\u201d may provide a system in which once a user connects to a FAS instances, the user may continue to connect with this FAS instance until the end of the user's session.","Embodiments of the invention may scale out connection server to support concurrent requests for customer's web sessions. Such embodiments may have implications on the system and recordings infrastructure, which may use a load balancer to route requests to the different connect server instances.","Some embodiments of the invention may correlate an interaction to an account ID rather than to a customer ID. The web recording rules may allow selection of whether to correlate the web interaction to an account or customer ID.","Privacy standards, such as, PCI standards, may identify protected customer information that should not be extracted from posts. To conform to such standards, the PO designer may use a screen element option to \u201chide\u201d such sensitive content in the playback. These protected objects may be \u201cnegative screen elements,\u201d which may define screen elements to be removed from the web player.","Web recording rules in rule manager may be used to manage many system specifics, such as, inserting authenticated sessions, identifying the user (e.g., whether to identify the user using metadata\/cookies or screen elements and\/or the column in the customer entity database with which the extracted values are to be associated), etc. When defining a rule, the rule manager may also need to define the customer mapping for each website (or globally for all websites). A rule scheduler may read voice\/screen recording rules and may send the recording decisions to a recording manager (RCM) (e.g., in the Interaction center) or alternatively, may not refer to the web rules. The rule may support a hosting environment, i.e., the rule may be attached to a specific tenant. In some embodiments, all services may work with new\/modified configurations without restarts.","Embodiments of the invention may support multiple web analyzers operating concurrently or in parallel. A single manager may distribute and divide the work among the multiple web analyzers. Dividing the work may improve the overall scale of the system and also ease the effort of developing the open calls events distribution (e.g., if the distributed cache solution is used).","Embodiments of the invention may optimize the web analyzer-IPS interface. In some embodiments, the interface may include a database and file system interface. However, in order to improve the performance and allow events in open sessions to occur almost immediately, the interface may be replaced by a direct call from the IPS to the web analyzer, where the IPS sends HTML data or each main page event to the web analyzer. In some embodiments, the IPS may have a proprietary implementation of a persistent queue. The queue may be stored in a memory and may point to constructed files. This pointer may provide communication between the IPS and the web analyzer. In other embodiments, the IPS and web analyzer may communicate via a queue based technology style, such as, Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) and\/or RabbitMQ.","Reference is made to , which schematically illustrates a system  for recording a user's web interactions in accordance with an embodiment of the invention.","System  may include a web server  (e.g., web server  of ), a capture server  (e.g., capture server  of ) including a probe  and an NIC  (e.g., probe  and NIC  of ) connecting web server  and capture server .

Web analyzer  may send a single file including the web pages of the session to database  (e.g., as a single zip file) and may save the file path (e.g., in tblRecording).","In operation , rule manager  may insert storage rules into database  to apply to web interactions. Rule manager  may set the storage destination either to file system storage in the network or to an external storage device.","In operation , rule engine  may retrieve web interactions to which the storage rules apply and may update database  with the retrieved web interactions and may inform storage center  to archive those interactions.","In operation , storage center  may search database  for the relevant web interactions (e.g., inserted by rule engine  according to the rules in rule manager ) by the recording path (e.g., as written in tblRecording).","In operation , SC  may send SS  data to locate the relevant web interactions to be archived.","In operation , when a playback request is received, SS  may check if the interactions data is still stored in local storage . If so, a processor or process may proceed to operation ; otherwise a processor or process may proceed to operation .","In operation , playback may be performed streaming data from local storage  using FAS .","In operation , playback may be performed using data from long-term storage .","In operation , SC  may update database .","Other operations or orders of operations may be used.

Components of  may be, for example, software executed on one or more processors.","Playback and storage configurations may be highly coupled since the way in which web page resources are saved may affect the way in which they are played. Playback and storage configurations may include, for example, multipurpose Internet mail extensions (MIME) HTML or MHT files, image files, zipped text, and local files (other or additional playback and\/or storage configurations may also be used).","For an MHT file storage configuration, an MHT file may be stored, for example, for each web page. The IPS may generate the web page file as an MHT file (e.g., instead of using the FileID link in the HTML). The MHT file may be identified, for example, by file ID and\/or special file type. In one example, the web analyzer may set a file field (e.g., tblRecording) with the file ID of the MHT file for each page. In such cases, the SC may simply copy the MHT files of the pages that are analyzed from local storage  to long term storage . Once the MHT file is copied, the SC may modify tblRecording to point to the MHT page in long term storage . For the playback of MHT files, the web player may use SS  to stream the MHT file. SS  may either put the MHT file on a web browser control (e.g., there are no external links to the file so there is no need to set the proxy) or may transform the MHT file to an image on the client side. SS  may reside in multiple servers and may be load balanced. In this solution, there may be no difference between playback of archived and non-archived calls. Like archived calls, non-archived calls may also be in the MHT format and may be streamed using SS  from the local storage.","For an image storage configuration, an image may be created for each web page in the archiving flow (e.g., not by SC  itself but by a dedicated component, such as, a dynamic-link library (DLL) (code library), that SC  uses to create the image). During the archiving flow, web analyzer  may indicate the storage location of the resources and\/or files for each page in the web interaction to SC . The location data may be stored, for example, in the FileEvents\/http and File tables, in a database . SC  may receive HTML data from FAS  after setting the proxy. SC  may then generate an image and save the image in long terms storage , thus updating the file ID field entries (e.g., in tblRecording) to point to the image file location in the long term storage. In one embodiment, the generation of the image may only come after the posts have been inserted into the page. In such embodiments, the images may remain uncompressed (compression may be used for textual resources). Transforming the HTML file to an image file may use client side components at the server side. For an image playback configuration, a different flow may be used to playback archived and non-archived calls, for example, as described in reference to . Non-archived calls may be played through a player service (e.g., playback streaming) using FAS . FAS  may read the file locations from the capture database and may stream the files from their local storage . If the pages have been through retention, e.g., saving recordings for some time period, then they may not be played. Posts may be built by the playback streaming service before displaying the HTML. In another embodiment, the player flow may be operated directly from the client side to FAS . In contrast, archived calls may be played through SS  from their long term storage . In some embodiments, there may be no need to build the posts as they are part of the image. Using images may be problematic for enabling retroactive analysis of web pages. Once an image is created and the original files go through retention, it may be difficult to support capabilities, such as, retroactive\/discovery analysis. To enable retroactive\/discovery analysis, both the images and the original files may be saved. However, such embodiments may increase the storage volume and may also depend on configuring FAS  to work with the current system storage and database .","For a compressed (e.g., \u201czipped\u201d) text storage configuration, SC  may copy all the page resources from their local storage  to long term storage  and may aggregate them to a single folder\/zip file. The compression in this case may be useful since the resources include textual files such as CSS, JS, JSON and HTML, of which the size may be significantly decreased by compression. For playback of the zipped text file, a different flow may be used to playback archived and non-archived calls, for example, as described in reference to . Non-archived calls may be played through a player service (e.g., playback streaming) using FAS . FAS  may read the file locations from the capture database and may stream the files from their local storage . If the pages have been through retention, then they may not be played. Posts may be built by the playback streaming service before displaying the HTML. In another embodiment, the player flow may be operated directly from the client side to FAS . Archived calls may also be played through playback streaming (or directly from the client) against FAS  from their long term storage. If all the original interaction data (e.g., html files, xml files, image files, etc.) is saved in long term storage , to playback the interaction data, the FAS may transform the separated files into a composed HTML. FAS  may be enhanced in order to find resources according to their location in an interaction database (e.g., instead of a capture database). FAS  may include a map from the old fileID to the location of the file in the long term storage . Since the file might be compressed, FAS  may also be able to uncompress and retrieve the file. Posts may be built by the web player and\/or SS  before displaying the HTML. Such embodiments may enable retroactive\/discovery analysis of web pages.","For a local file storage configuration, instead of embedding calls to FAS  in the HTML for downloading resources of the page (e.g., where Href=http:\/\/FASLocation\\FileIDX), a link may locate a file system (Href=localFileLocation:\\FileIDX). Accordingly, the IPS may embed the links using a file system pointer. Similar to the zipped text storage configuration, SC  may copy all the page resources from their local storage  to long term storage  and may aggregate them to a single folder\/zip file. The compression in this case may be useful since the resources include textual files such as CSS, JS, JSON and HTML, of which the size may be significantly decreased by compression. Playback of the local files may be identical for archived and non-archived calls. The only difference is that the files for archived and non-archived calls may be located in different places (e.g., as defined in tblRecording). The SS  may stream all the page files to the web client player local file system, and the player may load the main HTML page into a web browser control, after it will embed the posts.","To store web media, archiving rules may define rules for archiving web. Rule engine  may collect the interactions that match the archiving filter criteria for storage center . If the archiving of an interaction matches the rule definition, all files generated by the IPS for that session may be stored, for example, using one of the four alternatives formats described above.","Reference is made to , which schematically illustrate systems  and  for playback of non-archived and archived web interactions, respectively, in accordance with embodiments of the invention.","Systems  and  may include an interaction center server  (e.g., interaction center  of ), an agent workstation  (e.g., agent device  of ) including a client web player  and a PO client , and an interaction database  (e.g., database  of ) operated by a database server . Interaction center server  in system  may include a web playback client  and a FAS , while interaction center server  in system  may include an SS . System  may include a local storage , while system  may include a long term storage .","In , system  components may execute the following operations to playback non-archived web interactions (other or additional operations may also be used):","In operation , agent workstation  operating a real-time guidance module may select a playback button or functionality, for example, using a PO client .

Web playback client  may transform the retrieved data from interactions database  to a web object (e.g., UnifiedWebData) and may return the web object to client web player  in operation .","In operation , web playback client  may send HTTP data to FAS  using the web object, for example, for the first page URL from tblWebInteractionPagesXX. Web playback client  may redirect the call to the web proxy, which may load the HTML file from their storage location and may load the linked files from their location. The merged HTML may be returned to the web client.","In operation , FAS  may send local storage  the retrieved interaction data for storage.","In operation , web playback client  may process the interaction data, for example, transforming a webpage for playback into an image and sending the processed data to PO client .","In operation , web playback client  may receive the following data for playback:\n\n","In operation , client web player  may load the in-memory HTML to a DOM and may search for elements input by the customer. The search may be based on an events table, where, for example, each post event may include an Xpath of the element, the element may be searched on the DOM, and the element may be set to the value in the events table. Client web player  may then create web browser controls and may populate the web browser with the in-memory reconstructed HTML. Client web player  may then display the web browser control and populate a web page summary pane.","FAS  proxy may be responsible for accessing storage  and constructing the HTML page with embedded links. For example, if there is a link to a java script (JS) file in the HTML, FAS  may read the file ID in the link, find its file path in a capture database, load the JS file, embed the JS file into the HTML file, and download the embedded HTML file back to client web player .","In contrast to , in , system  may play archived calls through SS  from their long term storage . In one embodiment in , client web player  may send an interaction ID of the desired web interaction to SS . SS  may load the interaction metadata associated with the interaction ID.
