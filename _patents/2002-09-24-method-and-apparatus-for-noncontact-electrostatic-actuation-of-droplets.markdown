title: Method and apparatus for non-contact electrostatic actuation of droplets
abstract: An apparatus for actuating a droplet comprises a first conductive layer, a second conductive layer, a conductive elongate element, and a voltage source. The first conductive layer comprises a first hydrophobic surface. The second conductive layer comprises a hydrophilic surface facing the first hydrophobic surface. The second conductive layer is axially spaced from the first conductive layer to define a gap therebetween. The conductive medial element is disposed in the gap between the first and second conductive layers, and comprises a second hydrophobic surface. The voltage source communicates with the second conductive layer and the elongate element. By applying a voltage potential between the elongate element and the second conductive layer, droplets can be electrostatically actuated so as to move from the first conductive layer into contact with the second conductive layer. The apparatus is particularly useful in the synthesis of microarrays of biological, chemical, or biochemical samples.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND ART","DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION","EXPERIMENT"],"p":["This invention was made with Government support under Grant No. F30602-98-2-0140 awarded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention is generally directed to the field of droplet actuation. More specifically, the present invention relates to non-contact, out-of-plane or z-axis, electrostatic actuation of droplets. A particularly advantageous application of the present invention relates to the fabrication of sample-containing microarrays.","Conventional techniques for in situ synthesis and custom microarray manufacturing have been developed in the field of biological, chemical, and biochemical assaying of samples (e.g., nucleic acids, proteins, pharmaceutical compounds, and other analytes of interest), for use in sample detection, monitoring, and analysis. For example, DNA microarray technology is currently being developed for use in genomic research and diagnostic applications in which the ability to simultaneously analyze thousands of DNA sequences is beneficial. While in situ synthesis can provide enormous densities, the technique is not suitable for rapid prototyping. On the other hand, several problematic issues arise with regard to techniques relating to custom microarray printing technologies, including the size of the devices needed for sophisticated robotics, humidity and temperature control, the requirement of clean surroundings, wear and tear of the tips of pins or quills conventionally used, and expense of the equipment needed.","Microarrays are typically fabricated by printing or spotting, which entails dispensing very small volumes (i.e., the nanoliter and picoliter ranges) of sample material onto the surface of a solid substrate such as a glass slide. Both non-contact and contact dispensing techniques are being developed. Non-contact dispensing is performed by ejecting sample droplets from a dispenser onto the substrate. Currently, adaptations of ink-jet printing techniques are popular means for performing non-contact dispensing. Contact printing, on the other hand, requires direct contact of the dispensing device (e.g., capillary tubes, solid pins, split pins, and tweezers) with the substrate.","One example of a contact dispensing technique is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,110,426 to Shalon et al., which describes a method for fabricating microarrays of biological samples by using a capillary reagent dispenser that must contact the microarray surface to dispense its contents. In another example, arrays of pins are dipped into a sample solution and the tips of the pins are then brought into contact with a slide surface, leaving sample spots on the surface. The diameter of each pin primarily determines the size of the sample dispensed onto the surface. In another technique, a ring is dipped into the sample solution to draw sample liquid across its opening. A solid pin is then thrust through the opening and tapped against the substrate to dispense a portion of the sample onto the substrate. When employed to fabricate more than a few microarrays, the use of such contact techniques are undesirably slow processes. Moreover, these techniques have created problems with uniformity in sample volume, equipment durability, and spot reproducibility.","Non-contact dispensing techniques based on ink-jet technology typically entail the use of a piezoelectric crystal or a syringe-solenoid actuating device. For example, a piezoelectric crystal can be placed in contact with a capillary tube containing a sample fluid. By applying a voltage to the crystal is biased to deform at a rapid rate over a small deformation distance. As a result, the capillary is vibrated and ejects droplets from its tip. The high frequency response of the crystal and the small distance through which it vibrates enables thousands of droplets of small volume to be dispensed. On the other hand, the syringe-solenoid device is constructed by connecting a syringe pump between a reservoir and a solenoid valve through tubing. Actuation of the syringe creates liquid pressure in the system, enabling the valve to dispense samples from its outlet. This latter system requires a liquid media such as water. While such non-contact array printing methods address some of the afore-mentioned problems relating to microarray printing, they do not solve all of them and add new problems of their own. Keeping the inkjet orifices free of contaminants is one such problem. Moreover, air bubbles can develop that impair reliability. In addition, the size or footprint of the system can still be a problem.","In another example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,231,177 to Cherukuri et al. discloses a device that uses electrohydrodynamic (EHD) micropumps to dispense fluid from orifices onto textured paper. While the device can be scaled to a small size, it is similar to inkjet devices and burdened by similar problems.","It is therefore acknowledged by persons skilled in the art that ongoing development is needed to provide improved methods for non-contact microarray printing.","In general, the present invention provides an apparatus adapted for electrostatically actuating a droplet, and preferably an array of droplets, out from one plane to another plane (i.e., z-axis actuation). The apparatus generally comprises a first plane on which droplets are initially supplied, an elongate intermediate element spaced from the first plane, and a second plane spaced from the intermediate element that serves as the destination for actuated droplets. The first and second planes and the elongate intermediate element are rendered conductive to bring about and control the actuation of the droplet. Thus, the main structural portion of the intermediate element can be composed of a conductive (or semiconductive) material. Alternatively, the main structural portion of the intermediate element can be plated, coated, or otherwise treated with a conductive layer or film by a conventional process such as thin film deposition, plating, spin-coating, metallization, or the like. The elongate intermediate element is employed primarily to electrically ground the droplet. Thus, depending on droplet size, the axial distance between the first plane and the intermediate element is small enough to ensure that a droplet residing on the first plane contacts the intermediate element as well.","In operation, the droplet is initially placed between the first plane and the elongate intermediate element. A voltage is then applied between the intermediate element and the second plane. The droplet becomes charged and attracted to the second plane. As a result, the droplet moves from the first plane, through or around the elongate intermediate element, and into contact with the second plane. In some embodiments, the first plane is a lower plane, the second plane is an upper plane, and the intermediate element is disposed between the upper and lower plane in terms of elevation. The actuation provided by the invention is strong enough to cause the droplet to move upwards into contact with the upper plane against the opposing gravitational force. An excessively high voltage is not needed to drive the actuation because, in the microscale context in which the invention is preferably implemented, the dominant physical factor is surface tension rather than other factors such as acceleration and gravity.","The invention is particularly advantageous for synthesizing (i.e., \u201cstamping\u201d or \u201cprinting\u201d) a microarray of analyte-containing samples, without the use of conventional instruments that require contacting the droplet and\/or microarray surface such as pens and pipettes. Actuation of one or more droplets results in those droplets contacting precise coordinates on a surface of the second plane. For this purpose, the surface of the second plane to be stamped is preferably hydrophilic so that a droplet, upon contacting the surface, spreads so as to form a spot and stamp its analyte contents on the surface. Moreover, because the droplet contacts the first plane and elongate intermediate element prior to being actuated, it is preferable that the first plane and the intermediate element include hydrophobic surfaces.","In one embodiment, the intermediate element comprises an elongate element such as a wire, or a plurality of such elongate elements. Droplets move around the elongate element during actuation.","Droplets can be supplied to the apparatus by different methods. In one embodiment, the first plane includes an array of electrodes. Using an electrowetting technique, selected electrodes can be sequentially energized and de-energized to cause droplets proximate to such electrodes to move to intended positions on the array prior to being actuated. To cause movement of the droplets by electrowetting, a voltage potential is applied between the elongate intermediate element (which is typically grounded) and one or more selected electrodes of the first plane. As an alternative to electrowetting-based droplet movement, droplets can be positioned on the first plane by more conventional dosing or dispensing methods, and the first plane then moved into position underneath the intermediate element and the second plane.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, an apparatus for actuating a droplet comprises a first conductive layer, a second conductive layer, a conductive elongate medial element, and a voltage source. The first conductive layer comprises a first hydrophobic surface. The second conductive layer comprises a hydrophilic surface facing the first hydrophobic surface. The second conductive layer is axially spaced from the first conductive layer to define a gap therebetween. The conductive elongate medial element is disposed in the gap between the first and second conductive layers, and comprises a second hydrophobic surface. The voltage source communicates with the second conductive layer and the elongate medial element.","The present invention also provides a method for electrostatically actuating a droplet. A droplet is placed on a first conductive layer. The droplet is grounded by contacting the droplet with an elongate grounding element that is axially spaced from the first conductive layer. The droplet is actuated by applying a voltage potential between the grounding element and a second conductive layer axially spaced from the grounding element. The droplet becomes charged and attracted to the second conductive layer. Accordingly, the droplet moves off the first conductive layer into contact with a hydrophilic surface of the second conductive layer.","The present invention further provides a microarray structure synthesized according to the method just described. The resulting structure comprises a surface and a plurality of sample-containing spots disposed on the surface.","It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method arid apparatus for performing non-contact electrostatic actuation of droplets from one plane to another plane.","It is another object of the present invention to perform such actuation in the context of synthesizing a microarray, in which the contents of actuated droplets are stamped or printed onto a surface of the microarray.","It is yet another object of the present invention to perform microarray synthesis or fabrication by z-axis, non-contact electrostatic actuation of droplets, wherein the sizes of the spots produced on the microarray surface are controllable and reproducible.","It is a further object of the present invention to perform z-axis, non-contact electrostatic actuation of droplets using voltages lower than heretofore possible.","It is a yet further object of the present invention to perform microarray synthesis by means of droplet-based, z-axis, non-contact electrostatic actuation, wherein the actuation events do not affect the binding of molecules to the microarray.","Some of the objects of the invention having been stated hereinabove, other objects will become evident as the description proceeds when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings as best described hereinbelow.","For purposes of the present disclosure, the terms \u201clayer\u201d and \u201cfilm\u201d are used interchangeably to denote a structure or body that typically is deposited on, formed on, coats, treats, or is otherwise disposed on another structure.","For purposes of the present disclosure, the term \u201ccommunicate\u201d (e.g., a first component \u201ccommunicates with\u201d or \u201cis in communication with\u201d a second component) is used herein to indicate a structural, functional, mechanical, optical, electrical, or fluidic relationship, or any combination thereof, between two or more components or elements. As such, the fact that one component is said to communicate with a second component is not intended to exclude the possibility that additional components may be present between, and\/or operatively associated or engaged with, the first and second components.","For purposes of the present disclosure, it will be understood that when a given component such as a layer, region or substrate is referred to herein as being disposed or formed \u201con\u201d another component, that given component can be directly on the other component or, alternatively, intervening components (for example, one or more buffer layers, interlayers, electrodes or contacts) can also be present. It will be further understood that the terms \u201cdisposed on\u201d and \u201cformed on\u201d are used interchangeably to describe how a given component is positioned or situated in relation to another component. Hence, the terms \u201cdisposed on\u201d and \u201cformed on\u201d are not intended to introduce any limitations relating to particular methods of material transport, deposition, or fabrication.","For purposes of the present disclosure, it will be understood that when a liquid in any form (e.g., a droplet or a continuous body, whether moving or stationary) is described as being \u201con\u201d, \u201cat\u201d, or \u201cover\u201d an electrode, array, matrix or surface, such liquid could be either in direct contact with the electrode\/array\/matrix\/surface, or could be in contact with one or more layers or films that are interposed between the liquid and the electrode\/array\/matrix\/surface.","Referring now to , one example of a droplet actuating apparatus, generally designated , has a mid-plate configuration and is illustrated for comparison with a more preferred wire traction configuration of the invention described below. Apparatus  comprises a first layer or plane generally designated , an intermediate element generally designated , and a second plane generally designated . First plane , intermediate element , and second plane  are generally arranged along a z-axis Z. First plane  is axially spaced from intermediate element  by a gap g, and intermediate element  is axially spaced from second plane  by a gap g.","First plane  comprises a first planar body  such as a plate or substrate. First planar body  can be composed of a non-conductive material, such as a glass or polymer, or can be a semiconductor. Typically, first planar body  is a dielectric material such as a glass coverslip that is rendered conductive by forming one or more control electrodes E (e.g., E, E, and Eas illustrated in ) thereon, such as by performing a metallization process followed by a suitable masking\/etching technique. A droplet-contacting surface A of first plane  is hydrophobized by providing a hydrophobic film or layer  on first plane. One non-limiting example of a suitable hydrophobic material is PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene). PTFE is commercially available as the series of TEFLON\u00ae materials, such as TEFLON AF\u00ae, commercially available from E. I. duPont deNemours and Company, Wilmington, Del. Hydrophobic layer  also serves to electrically insulate first plane  (in particular, control electrodes E, E, and E) from other components of apparatus . Alternatively, first plane  can be treated with a parylene coating  such as Parylene C coating prior to applying hydrophobic layer  as illustrated in .","A droplet D is shown residing on control electrode Eprior to actuation. Droplet D is electrolytic, polarizable, or otherwise capable of conducting current or being electrically charged. Typically, droplet D ranges in size between approximately 10 \u03bcm to approximately 2 mm in diameter.","In the example illustrated in , intermediate element  is provided in the form of a medial plate  and is spaced along the z-axis from first plane by gap g. The thickness of medial plate  is thin (e.g., 160 microns) in relation to first plane  and second plane . Medial plate  is perforated with an array of apertures, generally designated A (e.g., apertures A, A, and Aas illustrated in ), having respective axes oriented substantially along the z-axis. Apertures A, A, and Acan be formed by any conventional micromachining process suitable for the material used for medial plate , such as microdrilling, acoustic drilling, etching, and the like. To ensure that any droplet D initially provided on first plane  is grounded (i.e., without needing to physically actuate first plane  or intermediate element  toward each other along the z-axis), gap gis small enough that droplet D contacts intermediate element . Otherwise, droplet D might electrically float and not be actuated. Thus, gap gshould be no greater than the size that droplet D would have in an unconstrained state.","Medial plate  of intermediate element  can be composed of a conductive material, a semi-conductive material, or a dielectric material. Preferably, medial plate  is a dielectric material such as a glass coverslip that is rendered conductive by applying a conductive layer  such as sputtered indium tin oxide (ITO). ITO is also preferred for its transparent property. During actuation as described hereinbelow, each droplet D must move through its corresponding aperture A to reach second plane . Therefore, medial plate  is preferably hydrophobized as described above in connection with first plane , and thus  illustrates a hydrophobic layer  covering medial plate . Hydrophobic layer  prevents stiction between droplets D and apertures  during actuation, and also electrically insulates medial plate . Preferably, hydrophobic layer  also covers the inside surfaces A of apertures A through the thickness of medial plate , although for clarity this is not shown in . In addition, as in the case of first plane , an additional insulative coating such as parylene (not specifically shown) can be provided between conductive layer  and hydrophobic layer  of medial plate .","Second plane  comprises a second planar body  such as a plate or substrate. Second planar body  can be composed of a conductive material, a semi-conductive material, or a dielectric material. Preferably, second planar body  comprises a derivativized glass plate. As known in the art, particularly in the field of microarray fabrication, glass plates can be derivatized by applying, for example, a poly-(L)-lysine coating. Thus, the surface of second plane  facing first plane, surface A, is hydrophilic. Second plane  is rendered conductive by applying a conductive layer  such as sputtered ITO. Second plane  at least conceptually comprises an array of target sites T (e.g., T, T, and Tas illustrated in ) defined along surface A that designate precise locations with which actuated droplets D come into contact. In the case where control electrodes E, Eand Eare associated with first plane , it is preferable that one target site T be aligned with one control electrode E and one aperture A. Accordingly, each droplet D provided on first plane  has a linear or substantially linear actuation path generally directed along the z-axis from its corresponding control electrode E of first plane , through its corresponding aperture A of intermediate element , and to its corresponding target site T of second plane . For purposes of multi-sample assaying and\/or detection, each target site T can comprise an analyte-specific binding agent or reagent, as is commonly known in the microarray fabrication art.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A"],"b":["10","40","30","20","30","20"],"sub":["1 ","2 ","1 ","2 ","1 ","2 ","1","2 ","3 "]},"Control electrodes E, Eand Eare useful for controlling the movement and positioning of droplets D prior to or after actuation. Thus, control electrodes E, Eand Ecan be employed to transport one or more droplets D from another portion of the structure of apparatus , such as a sample reservoir or injection site, to predetermined positions on the array of first plane  in alignment with corresponding apertures A, A, and Aof intermediate element  and target sites T, T, and Tof second plane . In a case where the stamping of droplets D results in unneeded, residual liquid masses, the residual material can returned to first plane  and transported away from apparatus  by control electrodes E, Eand Eacross first plane  to an appropriate waste location. Preferably, control electrodes E, Eand Eoperate on the principle of electrowetting, which is described in detail by Pollack et al., \u201cElectrowetting-based actuation of liquid droplets for microfluidic applications\u201d, Appl. Phys. Lett., Vol. 77, p. 1725 (September 2000). Additional disclosures of electrowetting techniques and applications therefor are provided in the two commonly assigned, co-pending U.S. Patent application Ser. Nos. 10\/253,342 and 10\/253,368, both entitled \u201cMETHODS FOR MANIPULATING DROPLETS BY ELECTROWETTING-BASED TECHNIQUES\u201d, filed concurrently herewith, the contents of which are incorporated herein in their entirety.","Briefly, the electrowetting technique involves controlling the surface tension on droplet D, and hence the contact angles droplet D makes with the surfaces it contacts, through application of a voltage potential between intermediate element  (serving as the ground plane) and first plane . The size of droplet D and the distance of gap gare such that the footprint of droplet D overlaps the electrodes (e.g., control electrodes Eand E) adjacent to the electrode (e.g., control electrode E), thereby allowing droplet D to be moved electrode-by-electrode to any point on the array of first plane . Referring to  and considering, as an example, the movement of droplet D from control electrode Eto control electrode E, both control electrodes Eand Eare initially grounded (i.e., switches Sand Sare open as illustrated), and the contact angle everywhere on droplet D is equal to the equilibrium contact angle associated with that droplet D. When an electrical potential is applied to energize control electrodes E, and E, a layer of charge builds up at the interface between droplet D and control electrodes Eand E, resulting in a local reduction of the interfacial energy \u03b3. Surface A of first plane  in effect becomes hydrophilic in the vicinities of control electrodes Eand E, and droplet D spreads over control electrodes Eand E. The meniscus of droplet D is deformed asymmetrically and a pressure gradient is established between the ends of droplet D. Subsequent de-energizing of control electrode Erenders the region of surface A over control electrode Ehydrophobic once again, resulting in bulk flow of droplet D towards the remaining energized electrode E. The voltage potential at control electrode Eis then removed, and droplet D is centered on control electrode Eas shown in .","Referring now to , the electrostatic actuation of droplet D will now be described. As shown in , droplet D is initially positioned between first plane  and intermediate element  in proper alignment with a designated aperture (e.g., A) of intermediate element  and a corresponding target site (e.g., T) of second plane . This positioning is accomplished either by the electrowetting technique using control electrodes E as just described, or by first loading droplet D onto first plane  by conventional means and moving first plane  with droplet D into the proper aligned position. Voltage source Vis then used to apply a voltage between intermediate element  and second plane . Droplet D becomes charged and attracted to second plane . As a result, droplet D moves from first plane , through aperture A, and into contact with surface A of second plane  at target site Tas shown in . Because surface A of second plane  is hydrophilic, or at least is non-hydrophobic, droplet D spreads to form a spot at its designated target site T, as represented by the flattened shape of droplet D shown in . In the case where apparatus  is employed for microarray stamping, an array of droplets D are actuated in this manner, resulting in the synthesis of an array of sample contents onto surface A of second plane . Second plane  can then be removed to interact with an appropriate analytical instrument for detection, measurement, and\/or analysis of the samples of the array. Depending on the nature of target sites T, the analyte constituents of droplet D become bound to target site T by adhesion, adsorption, electrical attraction or polarization, or chemical binding, linking or reaction.","The principle underlying the droplet-based actuation process just described can be explained as follows. From Gauss' law, it is known that:\n\n\u2207or,\u2003\u2003(1)\n\n\u2207\u2207=\u2212\u03c1\/\u03b5.\u2003\u2003(2)\n","The fundamental implication of Gauss' law is that the charge density inside of any closed Gaussian surface containing a conductor can be increased by increasing the divergence of the electric field lines. An increase in surface charge density, \u03c1, will cause an increase in the force exerted on the surface. Hence, for a given electric field, higher forces can be achieved if the field divergence is larger. This means that if electric flux concentration is increased, a higher \u03c1 can be obtained for the same voltage.","The example illustrated in , with its mid-plate system, requires very high voltages for actuation (e.g., 1 kV). This follows because medial plate  with apertures A (see ) shields droplet D. Thus, droplet D itself has relatively lower surface charge density, which again follows from Gauss' law. This means that the net force acting on droplet D is less than what it would be in the case where entire droplet D is exposed to the electric field. One way to increase the electric field lines converging on droplet D is to increase the applied voltage. Another way is exposing more of droplet D to the electric field. This would lead to greater charge densities on the drop. However, any aperture A cannot be larger than droplet D because droplet D would lose contact with medial plate  and thus would electrically float. Thus, there is a conflicting requirement. To increase the surface exposed to the field, aperture A would need to be made larger. However, aperture A cannot be so large that droplet D loses electrical contact with the medial plate .","The problems attending devices such as apparatus  are removed with the wire traction system provided by the present invention. Referring now to , a droplet actuating apparatus, generally designated , is illustrated. Apparatus  is characterized by a wire traction design according to a preferred embodiment of the invention. The structure of apparatus  can represent a portion of a microfluidic chip, as that term is understood by persons skilled in the art, or a portion of such a microfluidic chip. The chip can be fabricated according to known technology. The chip can serve a dedicated purpose that benefits from the droplet-based electrostatic actuation disclosed herein, such as for microarray synthesis. Alternatively, apparatus  can be integrated with conventional microfluidic and\/or microelectronic components that also are fabricated on the same chip. As examples, the chip can also include resistive heating areas or elements, microchannels, micropumps, pressure sensors, optical waveguides, and\/or biosensing or chemosensing elements interfaced with MOS (metal oxide semiconductor) circuitry.","As a principal difference from apparatus  illustrated in , apparatus  provides an intermediate element  in the form of a conductive elongate element  such as a wire or narrow beam, or a parallel series of such elongate elements . Each elongate element  is strung or suspended over first plane  at the distance of gap gand supported by appropriate mounting elements such as spacer blocks A and B. The magnitude of gap gis selected to ensure droplet D contacts elongate element  when droplet D is at a pre-actuation position, and thus depends on the size or volume of droplet D. As one example, gap gis approximately 0.05\u20132 mm. Preferably, the material of elongate element  itself is conductive. In one successful embodiment, a platinum wire is employed. Each elongate element  is hydrophobized in the manner described hereinabove, as represented by hydrophobic layer . Elongate element  serves as a ground line to assist in charging droplet D and thereby effect electrostatic attraction and hence actuation. Thus, elongate element  is similar in function to perforated medial plate  () of apparatus . The operation of apparatus  is also analogous to that of apparatus , except that droplet D when actuated moves around or on one side of elongate element  during its travel to second plane .","By comparison to the mid-plate configuration of apparatus , however, in the wire traction configuration of apparatus  there is a marked increase in the electric field density (and as a consequence, by Gauss' law, higher charge densities) on the surface of droplet D. The electric field strength near the surface of droplet D is nearly an order of magnitude greater than the electric field strength at a similar point in the mid-plate configuration of apparatus . Also, the surface area of droplet D directly under the influence of the electric field is greatly increased. The higher surface charge densities result in a higher electrostatic pressure on the droplet surface which, when integrated over the entire surface of droplet D, results in a much larger force on droplet D as compared to that in the mid-plate system illustrated in .","It will be noted that charge density could also be increased on the droplet surface by: (1) increasing the dielectric permittivity of the dielectric medium surrounding droplet D (i.e., the use of a silicone oil); (2) increasing the electrostatic drive voltage; or (3) changing the geometry of the configuration of apparatus  or  in such a way that the \u2207\u2207 term in Equation (2) hereinabove increases even though the magnitude of the voltage itself is constant. For apparatus , however, the charge density on the droplet surface has been increased without increasing the voltage. The result is a much higher charge density for the same voltage in the wire traction system of apparatus  as compared to the mid-plate system of apparatus .","Referring now to , apparatus  can be encapsulated as part of a fabrication strategy for a microfluidic chip or similar device. Accordingly,  illustrate an encapsulated droplet-based electrostatic actuation apparatus, generally designated . Apparatus  utilizes the wire traction system previously described with respect to apparatus . Thus, elongate element  and second plane  can have essentially the same design as previously described with reference to . , however, illustrates a first plane  having an alternative configuration. First plane  is removable and does not include individual control electrodes. Instead, first plane  comprises a planar body  such as a glass slide, a continuous conductive layer  formed on planar body  such as chromium or ITO, and a hydrophobic layer  formed on conductive layer . As described hereinabove, a dielectric layer  such as parylene could also be disposed between conductive layer  and the hydrophobic layer . This removable design for first plane  could be substituted for first plane  employed in the embodiment described hereinabove with reference to .","As shown in , the features comprising the wire traction system are encapsulated in a container, generally designated . Container  can take any number of forms, depending on the fabrication strategy employed to realize encapsulated apparatus . In the present example, container  is defined primarily by a lower member or base , an upper member or lid , and one or more lateral members A and B extending between lower member  and upper member  as necessary to complete the encapsulation. Lower member  supports first plane  and, preferably, one or more spacer blocks A and B that in turn support elongate member or members . Upper member  serves as a lid. Second plane  is attached to upper member  or, as illustrated, to a spacer member or adapter  that is in turn attached to upper member . First plane  can be loaded into container  prior to full encapsulation and removed after completion of an actuation process. The removability of first plane  is useful in a case where control electrodes or other automated means are not provided for conveying and positioning droplets D. In any case, the removability of first plane  facilitates replacement of first plane  if its hydrophobic surface  becomes degraded through extensive use. In addition, the internal volume of apparatus  encapsulated by container  can be flooded with a filler fluid that is immiscible with droplet D, such as silicone oil.","An encapsulated wire traction system represented by apparatus  was evaluated in the following EXPERIMENT.","Referring to , the variation of actuation voltage as a function of droplet volume is indicated for two different viscosities of oil and gap heights. The droplets used in the experiment contained DNA samples. The actuation voltage is almost independent of the droplet volume in the 250 nl\u2013700 nl range. This is true even when the viscosity of the oil is changed to 2 Cst. The actuation occurs at 40 V in the system with 50 Cst oil and a gap height of 560 \u03bcm while for the same volumes, the actuation voltage is around 50 V in the system containing 2 Cst oil with a gap height of 590 \u03bcm. Thus, the wire traction configuration allows actuation of droplets at voltages about 25 times lower than the mid-plate configuration and prior art devices.","From , it is evident that minimum actuation voltage is almost independent of droplet volume. In the lower ranges (sub 400 nl range), the actuation voltage seemed to drop by 10 V and return to 50 V at 250 nl. This was consistent over many runs. The reason is that the force needed to pull up a smaller volume is less than that required for a larger volume. Hence, the corresponding charge densities needed to actuate a droplet of smaller volume is less than the charge density needed to actuate a droplet of larger volume. This in turn implies lower voltages. The observation that the actuation voltage actually increased for the droplet with a volume of 250 nl could be explained as being an experimental anomaly. However, several trials gave the same result. The reason for this increase in actuation could be attributed to smaller droplet area. The droplet was very small and nearly a third of its surface was covered by the wire (e.g., elongate element  in ). This means that the electric field to which the droplet surface was exposed is less than what it would be were the droplet larger. This could contribute to the slight increase in actuation voltages. Hence, the reason for this slight increase in minimum actuation voltages at 250 nl could be attributed to larger ratio of wire surface area to droplet surface area.","To show that the z-axis actuation voltage itself did not affect the DNA that was being transported, the following experiment was done. Salmon sperm DNA was tagged with Cye5 dye (which emits at 632 nm). This sample was placed in a 1\u00d7SSC buffer solution. 500 nl of this fluid was stamped using the electrostatic actuation method of the present invention, as well as pipetting. The pipetting was done as a control for the experiment. If the DNA stamped using both methods showed similar results when scanned, there would be strong evidence to show that the actuation mechanism itself does not affect the binding of DNA to the substrate receiving the stamped samples.","To keep the environment similar in both cases, the array plate used in pipetting stamping was smeared with silicone oil. A 500 nl droplet containing fluorescently tagged DNA in 1\u00d7SSC buffer was stamped using both the methods on different slides. The droplet was stamped in a 2 Cst oil bath using a gap height of 590 \u03bcm. The slides were allowed to air-dry overnight, and were then scanned using a GENEPRO\u00ae microarray scanner (commercially available from Genyous, Inc., Portland, Oreg.). Scanned images of a spot generated by electrostatic stamping were compared to the scanned images of the control sample. As previously indicated, the stamp of the control sample was done manually with a pipette. The conditions were otherwise identical to the electrostatically stamped array. The footprints of the stamped spots for both the DNA sample and the control sample were nearly circular. Moreover, the respective intensities, sizes, as well as shapes of the spots for the two samples were very similar. It was therefore demonstrated that the present invention in practice had no adverse effect on the DNA sample.","It will be understood that various details of the invention may be changed without departing from the scope of the invention.
