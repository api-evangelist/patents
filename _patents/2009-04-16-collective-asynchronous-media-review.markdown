{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to communications networks, and more particularly, to a system and method for enabling a plurality of members of a group to create annotations corresponding to media content and automatically notify other members of the group who may view the media content asynchronously to enable collaborative commentary among the group members.","Globally interconnected communications networks permit displaced individuals to rapidly share audio, video, documents and images. With the increasing utilization of digital video recorders and video-on-demand services, people are less likely to watch media synchronously, thereby reducing the social aspects of media viewing that were common when programming was only aired and viewed at one time. The ability to time-shift the viewing of a media stream thus presents new challenges for friends, coworkers and\/or family members to discuss aspects of media that is viewed asynchronously.","Advances in computer and networking technologies have only exacerbated this problem as high-quality streaming and downloaded media playback may be performed on essentially any Network Access Device (NAD), including laptop and desktop computers, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) and cellular phones.","It is well-known in the art to provide synchronized media presentations to a user over a communications network. Such media refers to a plurality of media objects that share a common timeline. Audio and video are examples of such media objects, where each component is an independent data stream that is played back in a synchronized fashion on a NAD. Current media codecs such as MPEG2, MPEG4, DV, QuickTime, H.264, 3GPP, 3GPP2 and native OS X encoding of Windows are widely deployed and have facilitated the explosion in multimedia availability in the digital age.","The term \u201cstreaming media\u201d refers to media data that is provided over a communications network on a requested basis as opposed to media that is broadcast such as a live television event or downloaded in its entirety prior to playback. In this regard, a client executing on a network access device is able to render the streaming data as it is received from the network from a server, rather than waiting for the entire download of a media file to be completed.","In order to provide for collaborative discussion of digital media, systems and methodologies have been developed for enabling users to add temporal annotations to the content that correspond to various points in a media stream. Such temporal annotations may include textual or visual comments, gestures (i.e. thumbs up\/thumbs down, smiley face, sad face and the like), audio or video clips, web links and the like. In this connection, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,917,965 and 6,956,593, assigned to Microsoft\u00ae Corporation, disclose a client\/server system and interface for creating, viewing and temporally positioning annotations for media content.","A social network service is a particular type of collaborative computing environment which focuses on building online communities of people who share interests and activities, or who are interested in exploring the interests and activities of others. Most social network services are web based and provide a variety of ways for users to interact, such as e-mail and instant messaging services and others. Examples of popular North American social networking services are MySpace\u2122 and Facebook\u00ae.","Users of a social networking service can chose to interact synchronously, that is to communicate or chat one-on-one or in a specific user group utilizing Instant Messaging (IM), a traditional telephone call, a cellular phone call, email, Short Message Service (SMS), Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) or other messaging standard(s), share favorite links or other acquaintances (\u201cFriends\u201d) in real or near-real time, or interact asynchronously, that is, not in real-time.","It would therefore be advantageous to provide a system and methodology that provides a \u201csocial\u201d collaborative experience for asynchronous media review between members of a group. The group can be registered in a networked environment, and as members thereof create annotations corresponding to media content, other members of the group are automatically notified of the commentary and presented with a plurality of options, such as viewing the annotations, adding additional annotations, responding directly to the previously created annotations, and the like. In this manner, group members who create annotations are always automatically notified of annotations that are subsequently added by the other group members.","In accordance with aspects of the present invention, there is provided a method for sharing annotations corresponding to media content among a plurality of members of a group over a communications network, comprising: receiving at least one annotation from a first group member corresponding to media content from the communications network; adding the at least one annotation to a database; accessing a list of members of the group, each member of the group having a user profile stored in memory; and automatically sending a notification to at least a second member of the group in accordance with preferences contained in the user profiles of the group members.","The annotation comprises annotation content and a temporal identifier that identifies a segment of the media content to which the annotation corresponds, and the notification comprises sending the annotation to at least the second group member.","Alternatively, the annotation comprises annotation content and a temporal identifier that identifies a segment of the media content to which the annotation corresponds, and the notification comprises sending the annotation to at least the second group member and a media stream including at least the segment of the media content with the annotation.","The at least the segment of the media content may be defined by a number of frames of the media content disposed around a plurality of annotations created by members of the group.","The notification may be made via email, SMS, EMS, MMS or the like. Upon receiving the notification, the group member has the option to either respond over the communication channel on which they were contacted and add a new annotation temporally to the media content, visit a web page showing all annotations and attaching a new annotation through a web interface, or log onto the system and jump to a spot in the media to join a \u201cdiscussion\u201d of the media in real time.","In accordance with another aspect of the invention, there is provided at least one machine-readable medium having machine-readable instructions encoded thereon which, when executed by a processor, cause at least one server in a communications network to enable sharing annotations corresponding to media content among a plurality of members of a group by: receiving at least one annotation from a first group member corresponding to media content from a communications network; adding the at least one annotation to a database; accessing a list of members of the group, each member of the group having a user profile stored in memory; and sending a notification to at least a second member of the group in accordance with preferences contained in the user profiles of the group members.","In accordance with yet another aspect of the invention, there is provided a system for sharing annotations corresponding to media content among a plurality of members of a group over a communications network, comprising: at least one server coupled to the communications network and configured for receiving at least one annotation from a first group member corresponding to media content from the communications network; adding the at least one annotation to a database; accessing a list of members of the group, each member of the group having a user profile stored in memory; and sending a notification to at least a second member of the group in accordance with preferences contained in the user profiles of the group members. The annotation comprises annotation content and a temporal identifier that identifies a segment of the media content to which the annotation corresponds, and the at least one server is configured for sending the annotation to at least the second group member and optionally a media stream including at least the segment of the media content with the annotation.","These aspects of the invention and further advantages thereof will become apparent to those skilled in the art as the present invention is described with particular reference to the accompanying drawings.","Embodiments of the invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawing figures wherein like numbers represent like elements throughout. Before embodiments of the invention are explained in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of the examples set forth in the following description or illustrated in the figures. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or carried out in a variety of applications and in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting. The use of \u201cincluding,\u201d \u201ccomprising,\u201d or \u201chaving\u201d and variations thereof herein are meant to encompass the items listed thereafter and equivalents thereof as well as additional items.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","106","108","118","110","110","112","112"]},"The network access devices  may comprise personal computers, laptop computers, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), cellular telephones, Internet Protocol TVs (IPTVs), Digital Video Recorders (DVRs) and the like. The network access devices  communicate with a core network through various access networks (not shown), such as a Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) network, a broadband cable access network, a Local Area Network (LAN), a Wireless Access Network (WAN), a cellular network, etc. The above IP network is described to provide an illustrative environment in which packets for voice and data services are transmitted on networks.","Media server  has access to media content in the form of different media streams. Media streams may be in the form of stored files in a database or other file storage system, such as a movie, or supplied to the server on a \u201clive\u201d basis, such as a sporting event.","There are various standards for streaming media content and composite media streams. Advanced Streaming Format (ASF) by Microsoft\u00ae is an example of one such a standard. ASF specifies the way in which multimedia content is stored, streamed, and presented by the tools, servers, and clients of various multimedia vendors.","Annotation server  is configured to store and provision annotations that are received and communicated to the network access devices . In an exemplary embodiment, the annotation server  manages annotation meta data  and an annotation database  as known in the art. The annotation server  communicates with the network access devices  via any of a wide variety of known packet protocols, such as, for example, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The annotation server  can receive and send annotations through a direct link with a network access device , or alternatively, via messaging server . The message server  is configured to communicate with the network access devices  via email, Short Message Service (SMS), Enhanced Message Service (EMS), Multimedia Message Service (MMS) and the like, as will be explained in more detail below. Although shown as a \u201csingle server\u201d , it will be appreciated that server  may comprise a plurality of servers that implement respective email and\/or messaging functionality. The annotation server  communicates with the message server  via known protocols, such as the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) for email, or other instant messaging protocols such as MMS Protocol, XMPP, SIMPLE and the like. The annotation server  also communicates with a group database  that stores user\/subscriber profiles in accordance with an aspect of the invention as described in further detail below.","The annotation server  receives and sends annotations corresponding to media content, which may be streaming media stored on and accessed from media server , or media stored on any other server or the network access devices  themselves. The annotations are created by users on the network access devices  and uploaded through the communications network  to the annotation server .","A user on a network access device  can access streaming media via a web link through a conventional web browser as is well known in the art. In an exemplary application, the network access device establishes a connection to web server  for a Hyper Text Markup Language HTML page and a request to media server  for streaming media stored on media server . Alternatively, the network access device  is able to display locally stored media, i.e., data stored on magnetic or optical media coupled to or otherwise associated with the network access device. Using a Graphical User Interface (GUI) on the network access device , the user can add annotations having temporal markers that correspond to the media and upload those annotations to annotation server . These stored annotations can be subsequently merged with the media for playback on any of the network access devices  running a client program adapted for providing such functionality as known in the art.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","210","230","232","202","230","234","202","236","236","204","210","210","238","240","238","238","210","240","202","208","202"]},"The annotation server  comprises an annotation web interface module  for implementing the web server functionality of the annotation server . This may include an Internet Services Application Programming Interface plug-in for an Internet Information Server Module of the type known in the art of server design. The annotation server  further includes an HTTP module  for managing networked communications with the network access devices . A messaging module  is coupled to the HTTP module  to enable communication with an external messaging server(s)  that provides email, SMS, EMS, MMS or like functionality. The annotation server further comprises an annotation client  that is programmed to provide the functionality of the annotation server , including storing and retrieving annotations to and from annotation database  and storing received meta data corresponding to annotation content in database . The annotation client  is further configured to access a group database  that stores user profiles of members of defined viewing groups as described in more detail below. The annotation client  is adapted to cooperate with messaging  to automatically send notifications to group members in accordance with user profiles stored in database .","The annotation content and meta data storage is implemented using known methods, such as through SQL relational databases. The storage is shown in the drawings as being split into a plurality of databases, although it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that this data may be part of a single storage system or even disposed at another location on the communications network .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["348","302","202","348","350","302","352","320","354","314","214","356","358"]},"An exemplary annotation entry is shown in , which is generally comprised of several data fields including a user\/group field , temporal range field , creation time field , title field , content field , annotation ID , link ID  and media ID . The term \u201cfield\u201d is intended to be merely exemplary as many different types of data structures may be employed to organize and relate the stored data. In the example shown, the user\/group field  contains data identifying the user who made the annotation and optionally the collaborative viewing group information, i.e., a list of other members of the viewing group who are interested in viewing the annotation. The temporal range field  contains data representing temporal markers corresponding to the media content to which the annotation pertains as identified by the media ID field . The time the annotation is created is contained in the creation time field  and the annotation may be provided with a title by the creator in field . The content of the annotation is stored in field , and represents the actual type of annotation that was authored by the creator and includes text (e.g., alphanumeric characters and\/or symbols), audio (e.g., a recorded audio file), video (e.g., recorded gestures or reactions as captured by a video recording device), avatars and the like. The media ID  may be used to identify different media versions of identical media content. The data may represent a real-time transport protocol (RTP) address of different media streams as taught by the Microsoft '965 Patent discussed above. Alternatively, identifiers may be assigned to the content instead of the individual media streams, or a unique identifier of the media streams can be created by the annotation server  and assigned to the media streams as disclosed in the Microsoft\u00ae '965 Patent. The practice of generating, managing and communicating annotations for media content from a networked server is generally known in the art and thus more details thereof are not discussed further herein.","Users of the system may select their preferences for receiving annotations from other users in a viewing group, including the quantitative and\/or qualitative level of messaging (i.e. to\/from specific users in a group, all users, or annotations only regarding specific content and\/or those directed to be communicated to\/from a particular network access device. For example, a user may only wish to receive annotation notifications on his or her PDA but not on a personal computer or laptop computer. These preferences may be implemented through messaging preferences that are set up by the registration module  shown in .","The present invention may be implemented using hardware, software or a combination thereof and may be implemented in one or more computer systems or other processing systems.  is a schematic of an exemplary computer system  that can be used as a network access device or a server to implement the functionality of the present invention. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that computer system  may operate as a server that is networked to other computers (network access devices) to operate as a client\/server system, as known by those skilled in the art, or computer  may operate as a standalone system. Computer system  includes one or more processors, such as processor . Processor  is connected to a communication infrastructure  (e.g., a communications bus, cross-over bar, or network). Computer system  can include a display interface  (e.g. a graphics card) that allows graphics, text, and other data from the communication infrastructure  (or from a frame buffer not shown) to be displayed on a display unit . Computer system  also includes a main memory , preferably random access memory (RAM), and may also include a secondary memory . The secondary memory  may include, for example, a hard disk drive  and\/or a removable storage drive . The removable storage drive  has read\/write functionality onto removable storage media  having stored therein computer software and\/or data. In alternative embodiments, secondary memory  may include other similar devices for allowing computer programs or other instructions to be loaded into computer system . Such devices may include, for example, a removable storage unit  and an interface . Examples of such may include a program cartridge and cartridge interface (such as that found in video game devices), a removable memory chip (such as an erasable programmable read only memory (EPROM), or programmable read only memory (PROM)) and associated socket, and other removable storage units  and interfaces , which allow software and data to be transferred from the removable storage unit  to computer system . Computer system  may also include a communications interface  allowing software and data to be transferred between computer system  and external devices. Examples of communications interface  may include a modem, a network interface (such as an Ethernet card), a communications port, a Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA) slot and card, etc. Software and data transferred via communications interface  are in the form of signals (not shown), which may be electronic, electromagnetic, optical or other signals capable of being received by communications interface . These signals are provided to communications interface  via a communications path (e.g., channel) . This path  carries the signals and may be implemented using wire or cable, fiber optics, a telephone line, a cellular link, a radio frequency (RF) link and\/or other communications channels. Computer programs (also referred to as computer control logic) are stored in main memory  and\/or secondary memory . Computer programs may also be received via communications interface . Computer programs, when executed, enable the computer system  to perform the features of the present invention, as discussed herein. Accordingly, such computer programs represent controllers of the computer system . In an embodiment where the invention is implemented using software, the software may be stored in a computer program product and loaded into computer system  using removable storage drive , hard drive , or communications interface . The control logic (software), when executed by the processor , causes the processor  to perform the functions of the invention as described herein. In another embodiment, the invention is implemented primarily in hardware using, for example, hardware components, such as application specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Implementation of the hardware state machine so as to perform the functions described herein will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art(s). In one exemplary embodiment, the system for the present invention may be implemented, for example, as a Microsoft.net\u00ae desktop application program (Microsoft.net\u00ae is made by Microsoft\u00ae Corporation of Redmond, Wash.), which may reside on a computer hard drive, database or other repository of data, or be uploaded from the Internet or other network (e.g., from a PC, minicomputer, mainframe computer, microcomputer, telephone device, PDA, or other network access device having a processor and input and\/or output capability). Any available software tool capable of implementing the concepts described herein may be used to implement the system and method of the present invention. The method and system of the present invention may also be implemented as an application-specific add-on to a program, or as a standalone application.","Referring now to , there is depicted an exemplary GUI  on a network access device for viewing an exemplary media stream. The GUI  includes dialog boxes and Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) for entering information and a viewer(s) for playing media content. In the example shown, a dialog box  identifies the user (author\/viewer), group name (e.g., \u201cfriends\u201d in the collaborative viewing environment), and an episode of media content being viewed (e.g., \u201cBats in Flight, Episode \u201d). Box  may contain a plurality of selectable menu items that may be linked in a hierarchal manner to implement various functions on the GUI, the details of which are not relevant here. The user may enter temporal annotations corresponding to the media that are communicated via a communications network and stored on an annotation server as described above. Here, User  makes the comment \u201cToo funny!\u201d with respect to frames - of the media stream in dialog box . Alternatively, the user may make a comment with respect to a single frame  as shown in media playback box . The annotation is stored in annotation server, and in this example, a notification message is automatically communicated to User  and User  of the group \u201cfriends.\u201d These users are provided with a notification based on their preferences stored in their associated user profiles on the annotation server as discussed above. The annotation server automatically sends a message to User  and User  containing the annotation created by User . In one embodiment, the annotation is accompanied by a media stream containing a segment of the media around the temporal markers included with the annotation. That is, the media stream that is provided to Users  and  may range from a single frame () or a plurality of frames (-) around an area of interest. User's  and  may not be watching the media synchronously and thus when they are notified of the existence of the annotation corresponding to the media content that was entered by User , they can join in a real-time discussion and add their own annotations, or can decide to respond at a time of their own choosing. The client application running on the network access device is configured for enabling an on-line discussion via a web interface as is well known in the art. In this manner, once notified, group members (users) can choose to participate in a real-time discussion of the media by adding their own annotations in response to prior comments by other group members regarding a particular segment of the media content or by creating new annotations to other segments of the media content. As subsequent annotations are made by Users ,  and so on, they are added to the annotation database, thereby constantly updating the annotations corresponding to a selected media presentation for subsequent playback and review. As discussed above, the notification may be made using a variety of methods and in accordance with the individual user preferences. Moreover, User  may be viewing a selected portion of media content for comment from a DVR, while Users  and  may be notified and provided with the annotations and relevant segments of the media content on their respective PDAs. In all events, notification to each user is transparent and accomplished automatically by the annotation server upon receipt of each annotation. As more and more users of a group comment on the media, their respective annotations are added to the conversation thread and a \u201ccentroid\u201d of interest may be established to provide a targeted search area in the media stream for other users to select the most commented on area of interest.","Another aspect of the present invention enables a user to define the amount of video content to be presented, for example 1 second, 10 seconds or 2 minutes, around the most heavily annotated area or centroid of annotations. For example, a user may only desire to go directly to the most popular (most annotated) frame(s) of selected media content and view a certain temporal segment of video. In the example shown, a user would be directed to Frame  plus and\/or minus 15 seconds. Alternatively, the system can determine the amount of video content to be displayed, determined in part by the amount of annotations. For example, a default may be 1 minute of content around the centroid, and correspondingly less content around correspondingly less popular (less annotated) areas. Furthermore, individual frame shots, not video content, can be selected for display. This is illustrated in  in box .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","702","704","706","708","710","712","714","716","718","720","722","702"]},"In summary, the present invention facilitates a collaborative computing environment where multimedia content can be consumed asynchronously, with users annotating content, which becomes the content to be presented to subsequent users. Additionally, the annotations can themselves searched utilizing search criteria such as most popular (most annotated), least popular, by user, and by the text of the annotation. Some of the benefits of the present invention are enabling collective awareness to let others know a user has watched multimedia content, providing a user presence in a group, providing a means of determining what content is being consumed and collectively preferred, enabling synchronous and asynchronous consumption of the multimedia content, discussion stimulus and alerting others to interest areas and annotations added to already viewed (consumed) content.","The foregoing detailed description is to be understood as being in every respect illustrative and exemplary, but not restrictive, and the scope of the invention disclosed herein is not to be determined from the description of the invention, but rather from the claims as interpreted according to the full breadth permitted by the patent laws.
