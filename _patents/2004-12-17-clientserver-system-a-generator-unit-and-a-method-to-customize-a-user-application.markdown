title: Client-server system, a generator unit and a method to customize a user application
abstract: A method for setting up a customizable client-server system can include custom selecting search data fields from a proposed variety of selectable search data fields in order to create a user interface search mask and/or custom selecting archive fields from a proposed variety of selectable archive fields of an archive database. The method further includes the step of automatically linking the fields selected during custom selection with the respective other one of the two varieties of selectable fields in order to identify and automatically generate a list of corresponding respective fields. This can also include automatically generating an archive index for use in quickly searching the archive database based on the custom selected fields.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to the field of electronic data processing and digital communications networks, and more particularly to a client-server system, a generator unit and a method to customize a user application.","Priority is claimed to European Patent Application No. 03 029 402.9, filed Dec. 19, 2003, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.","Today, most computers are linked to other computer systems via a computer network. A computer network is basically a collection of computers that are physically and logically connected together to exchange data or \u201cinformation.\u201d The network may be a local area network (LAN) in which computers are geographically close together and connected by short segments of ethernet or to the same network hub or a wide area network (WAN) in which computers are separated by a considerable distance and are connected by telephone lines or radio waves. Often, networks are configured as so-called client-server networks such that each computer on the network is either a client or a server. Servers are computers or processors dedicated to managing shared resources such as storage of electronic data. Any computer that performs a task at the command of another computer is a server.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0004"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","118","117","118","112","118","112","124","124","118","112","126","128","118"]},"In some applications, a client user wants to access archived data that is stored on a database interconnected with the server. If the application is a customizable application in which a user can custom design his (graphical) user interface, consistency and performance problems can occur if the user has designed a search mask with selection fields that are not consistent with an archived index of the archived set of data of the database. Therefore, due to customizing errors and\/or inconsistencies the user might experience problems or the archive search might not work at all.","Consistent with the present invention, a client-server system comprises a server and a client interconnected with the server. The client is set up to use an application that is provided by the server. Further, a database containing a structured set of archive data is interconnected with the server. The system is set up to allow for a customized set-up of the application when the application is used by the client. As one of skill in the art would appreciate, the instructions for such customized set-up can be stored on a computer-readable storage medium, including a memory, but excluding carrier waves.","In one aspect, a generator unit for automatically generating an archive index structure based on the customized set-up of the application as defined via the client is provided so that a search in the structured set of data initiated via the client is performed with the automatically generated archive index structure. This results in the generation of an archive index structure that corresponds exactly to the customized set of selection fields in the application so that inconsistencies between a customized user interface and the archive index structure are eliminated.","It is to be understood that in the context of this invention, the term \u201carchive index structure\u201d defines a structure for a database table and the term \u201cstructured set of data\u201d defines the database table generated on the basis of this archive index structure.","In another aspect of the invention, the client-server system is set up to allow for a customized set-up of an archive index structure for performing searches in the database, and a generator unit for automatically generating a customized set-up of the application according to the customized archive index structure is provided, so that a search in the structured set of archived data initiated via the client's automatically generated customized set-up is performed with said archive index structure. In this embodiment, a user selects fields for a customized archive index structure from a proposed variety of selectable archive fields of the archive database, on the basis of which custom design the application set-up, e.g. the user interface, is automatically generated. Again, this provides for an elimination of any inconsistencies between archive index and selection fields on the user interface and results in enhanced performance of the client-server system.","Thus, a two-fold setting up of a customizable client-server system is provided. First, one of the two steps of custom selecting search data fields from a proposed variety of selectable search data fields in order to create a user interface search mask and of custom selecting archive fields from a proposed variety of selectable archive fields of an archive database is executed. Second, upon the step of custom selecting, an automatic linking procedure is performed between (a) the fields selected during said step of custom selecting from one of the two varieties of selectable fields and (b) the whole of the variety of the respective other one of the two varieties of selectable fields in order to identify and automatically generate a list of corresponding respective fields of the other one of the two varieties.","In one possible embodiment, the application is a web-based application.","The invention also covers a computer program with program coding means which are suitable for carrying out a process according to the invention as described above when the computer program is run on a computer.","Further features and embodiments of the invention will become apparent from the description and the accompanying drawings.","It will be understood that the features mentioned above and those described hereinafter can be used not only in the combination specified but also in other combinations or on their own, without departing from the scope of the present invention.","It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed. The foregoing background and summary are not intended to provide any independent limitations on the claimed invention.","The following description refers to the accompanying drawings in which, in the absence of a contrary representation, the same numbers in different drawings represent similar elements. The implementations in the following description do not represent all implementations consistent with principles of the claimed invention. Instead, they are merely some examples of systems and methods consistent with those principles. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed.","The invention is illustrated by means of one possible embodiment in which a client-server system  comprises a client computer  and a server  (cf. ). The server  further comprises a graphical user interface (GUI) generation module , a generator unit  as well as a database interface unit . The client  is interconnected with the server  by means of a connection line  which could be, for example, the Internet. A database  containing a set of archived data is interconnected with the server  via database interface unit .","The client-server system  is set up to provide one or more applications to the client  via the server . As already outlined above in connection with , the server  communicates with one or more applications via an application programming interface API (not shown) in order to execute any commands from the client  and return results subsequently to the client .","Further, the system is set up in such a manner that a user of the client computer  is able to custom design its user interface UI which in a lot of cases today is a GUI. If the application requires to retrieve data from the database  the custom design or custom set-up of the GUI will comprise the possibility of creating a customized search mask containing the search data fields of interest to the user.","A possible embodiment of such a customizing process is illustrated by the block diagram depicted in .","An icon I depicts a user in front of the client computer , selecting search fields from a proposed variety of selectable search data fields as is illustrated at  and . At , a list of data fields selected by the user are shown, namely process_type, partner_id, date_from and date_to. This custom selection can be performed for example via an appropriate transaction which is a layout of selectable data fields (such as the SAP CRMC_BLUEPRINT transaction). This selection is transferred into a customized screen (search mask) for an archive search in order to retrieve data from the set of archive data in database . This screen with four fill-in fields is shown at .","Further, an automatic generation is effected by generator unit , resulting in the automatic generation of an archive index structure based on the customized set-up as defined in , i.e. corresponding to the data fields selected by the user, which in the example shown in  are the four fields process_type, partner_id, date_from and date_to, thus creating a database index table  with an allocated key indication for data retrieval.","The automatic generation as performed by the generator unit  can be effected by means of a linking procedure between the selected fields  and the whole of the variety of the indexable archive fields in order to determine whether each of the selected fields is a field for data retrieval by means of archive search. For any selected field fulfilling the requirement(s) an according field in the archive index  is then generated. As can be understood by the illustration in , all four of the fields selected at  fulfill the requirement(s), i.e. they are fields for data retrieval, resulting in the generation of the archive index structure at  containing four corresponding archive fields.","Thus, a search by using the custom design search mask screen  can be effected without experiencing inconsistency and\/or performance problems.","As will be understood by any person skilled in the art, the principles according to the invention described hereinabove with reference to the possible embodiment illustrated in the Figures of course also apply to a reverse automatic generation. In this reverse case (which is not illustrated) a user first selects the archive objects or fields of interest to him (i.e. he first creates a custom archive index structure) followed by an automatic generation of a corresponding search field list and according selection screen mask (which could be described with reference to  as turning around the arrow  which depicts the action of the generator unit according to the invention).","In a possible embodiment, the automatic generation is triggered every time a change to the initial custom selection (be it the selection of the search data fields or be it the selection of the archive object fields) occurs. In another possible embodiment, the automatic generation is triggered every time a change to any of the two lists or tables occurs, resulting in a two-fold generation in the one or in the other direction, depending on the table at which a change occurred.","The invention thus provides for an automated method to create a direct relationship between the customizing of the UI side and the archive index.","Other embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the invention disclosed herein. It is intended that the specification and examples be considered as exemplary only, with a true scope and spirit of the invention being indicated by the following claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate several embodiments of the invention and together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the invention.
