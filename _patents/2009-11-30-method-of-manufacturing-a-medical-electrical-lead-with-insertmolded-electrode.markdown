{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/118,606, filed on Nov. 29, 2008. The disclosure of the above application is incorporated herein by reference.","The disclosure relates to implantable medical devices and, more particularly, to implantable medical electrical leads.","The human anatomy includes many types of tissues that can either voluntarily or involuntarily, perform certain functions. After disease, injury, or natural defects, certain tissues may no longer operate within general anatomical norms. For example, after disease, injury, time, or combinations thereof, the heart muscle may begin to experience certain failures or deficiencies. Certain failures or deficiencies can be corrected or treated with implantable medical devices (IMDs), such as implantable pacemakers, implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) devices, cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator devices, or combinations thereof.","IMDs detect and deliver therapy for a variety of medical conditions in patients. IMDs include implantable pulse generators (IPGs) or implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) that deliver electrical stimuli to tissue of a patient. ICDs typically include, inter alia, a control module, a capacitor, and a battery that are housed in a hermetically sealed container with a lead extending therefrom. It is generally known that the hermetically sealed container can be implanted in a selected portion of the anatomical structure, such as in a chest or abdominal wall, and the lead can be inserted through various venous portions so that the tip portion can be positioned at the selected position near or in the muscle group. When therapy is required by a patient, the control module signals the battery to charge the capacitor, which in turn discharges electrical stimuli to tissue of a patient through via electrodes disposed on the lead, e.g., typically near the distal end of the lead. Typically, a medical electrical lead includes a flexible elongated body with one or more insulated elongated conductors. Each conductor electrically couples a sensing and\/or a stimulation electrode of the lead to the control module through a connector module. In the context of implantable defibrillators, most systems include large surface area implantable electrodes to be mounted in or adjacent the heart.","One common approach of providing a large surface area electrode is to employ an elongated exposed coil of biocompatible metal. In the context of an endocardial lead, this is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,161,952 issued to Kinney. In the context of an epicardial lead, this is disclosed in the context of U.S. Pat. No. 4,817,634 issued to Holleman et al.","An elongated coil serving as the electrode is typically mounted around the exterior of an insulative lead body. It is believed desirable in this context to stabilize the electrode coil with respect to the lead body, both to provide mechanical integrity and to prevent fibrous ingrowth around the individual coils of the electrode coil. In the above cited Kinney et al. patent and in U.S. Pat. No. 4,934,049, issued to Keikhafer et al., this is accomplished by sliding the coil over the lead body and backfilling the spaces between the electrode coil with a plastic material. In prior U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,042,143 issued to Holleman, et al. and 5,344,708 issued to Bischoff, et al. alternative methods of producing a lead structure similar to that produced in the Keikhafer patent are disclosed. In these patents a plastic tube is stretched. An electrode coil having a inner is then slid over the stretched tube, after which the tube, after which the tube is released, allowing it to return to its previous length. Thereafter, a mandrel is inserted into the tubing, compressing the tubing between the mandrel and the conductor coil. The assembly is thereafter heated, allowing the tubing to flow into spaces between the electrode coil to a desired depth.","U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/549,284 filed Oct. 13, 2006 by Boser also discloses mechanisms for producing leads employing such electrode","The present disclosure relates to medical electrical leads that include a lead body and at least one tubular electrode sub-assembly positioned over and attached to the external surface of the lead body. The lead body includes at least one elongated conductive element, such as a cable, that is electrically connected to a coiled electrode of the tubular electrode sub-assembly. The tubular electrode sub-assembly includes a tubular liner and an electrode embedded in the outer surface of the liner. In some embodiments, only a portion of the inner surface of the tubular liner is attached to the lead body which may potentially improve flexibility of the medical electrode lead in the area occupied by the tubular electrode sub-assembly.","The tubular electrode sub-assemblies may include an organic polymeric tubular liner comprising an outer surface and a continuous, uninterrupted inner surface that extends from between a proximal end and distal end of the tubular liner, and an electrode embedded in the outer surface of the polymeric tubular liner, wherein at least a portion of an outer surface of the electrode comprises an exposed outer surface proximate an outer surface of the polymeric tubular liner, and wherein the liner extends into interstices of the electrode.","The medical electrical lead may include one or more selected attachment sites at which the tubular electrode sub-assembly is attached to the external surface of the lead body, wherein the one or more selected attachment sites occupy only a portion of the inner surface of the polymeric tubular liner; and an electrical connection within the medical electrode lead between the electrode and the conductive element.","The present disclosure also relates to methods of manufacturing medical electrical leads that include manufacturing a tubular electrode sub-assembly by masking an outer surface of an electrode with a masking structure provided over the outer surface of the electrode, delivering a flowable liner material comprising a hardenable organic polymer into an interior of the electrode while masking the outer surface of the electrode with the masking structure, wherein the flowable liner material fills interstices of the electrode and forms an outer liner surface proximate the masking structure, removing a portion of the flowable liner material from the interior of the electrode by inserting a mandrel into the interior of the electrode; hardening the flowable liner material to form a hardened liner material after inserting the mandrel into the interior of the electrode, removing the mandrel from the interior of the electrode after hardening the flowable liner material, wherein the hardened liner material forms an inner liner surface within the interior of the electrode, and removing the masking structure from the outer surface of the electrode after hardening the flowable liner material, wherein the hardened liner material forms an outer liner surface in the interstices of the electrode, and wherein the masked portion of the outer surface of the electrode is exposed after removing the masking structure.","The method of manufacturing a lead may further include positioning the tubular electrode sub-assembly over an external surface of a lead body after manufacturing the tubular electrode sub-assembly such that the inner liner surface faces the external surface of the lead body, wherein the lead body defines a longitudinal axis extending between a proximal end and a distal end of the lead body, and wherein the longitudinal axis extends through the tubular electrode sub-assembly; attaching the tubular electrode sub-assembly to the external surface of the lead body at one or more selected attachment sites, wherein the one or more selected attachment sites occupy only a portion of an inner liner surface; and electrically connecting a conductive element located within an interior of the lead body to the coiled electrode of the tubular electrode sub-assembly.","The principles described herein are applicable to all types of medical electrical leads. For example, the disclosure applies to cardiovascular leads (e.g. high voltage leads, low voltage leads etc.), neurological leads, or other suitable applications. Also, although described with respect to coiled electrodes, other electrode configurations may alternatively be used.","In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying figures of the drawing which form a part hereof, and in which are shown, by way of illustration, specific embodiments. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","102","105","106","100","106","106","100","100","108","107","106","106","108","100"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["106","106","117","105","107","117","101","112","112","112","112","104","122","112","104","112","107","112","103","106","112","105","118","112","105","120"],"i":["a","d","a","d ","a","d","a","d","a","d ","c ","a,b ","a,b ","d ","c "]},"Electrically conductive elements that extend along the length of the lead  can include coils, wires, coil wound around a filament, cables, conductors or other suitable members. Conductive elements can include platinum, platinum alloys, titanium, titanium alloys, tantalum, tantalum alloys, cobalt alloys (e.g. MP35N, a nickel-cobalt alloy etc.), copper alloys, silver alloys, gold, silver, stainless steel, magnesium-nickel alloys, palladium, palladium alloys or other suitable materials. The electrically conductive elements are typically covered, or substantially covered, longitudinally with a jacket. In yet another embodiment, each conductive element within the lead body  is surrounded by a tubular element within the jacket, which can possess a circular or a non-circular cross-section. Any or all of the components within the lead body  can exhibit a non-circular cross-section.","Typically, the outer surface of electrodes  such as the ring electrode , the tip electrode , and the defibrillation electrodes are exposed or not covered by a jacket or liner so that electrodes  can sense and\/or deliver electrical stimuli to tissue of a patient. A sharpened distal tip (not shown) of tip electrode  may facilitate fixation of the distal end of helically shaped tip electrode  into tissue of a patient.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A and 3B","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3B"],"b":["117","112","112","117","130","140","130","112","112","117","112","112","130","140"],"i":["a ","c ","b ","d ","b ","d "]},"Among the electrodes , some of the electrodes, such as defibrillation electrodes and , may be provided in the form of coiled electrodes that form a helix, while other electrodes may be provided in different forms. Further, some of the electrodes  may be provided in the form of tubular electrode sub-assemblies that can be pre-fabricated and positioned over an existing lead body, where they are attached and where electrical connections with conductive elements within the lead body  can be made.","An example of one such tubular electrode sub-assembly  is depicted in , where the tubular electrode sub-assembly  is positioned over a portion of a lead body . The tubular electrode sub-assembly  includes a tubular liner  and electrode  embedded in the outer surface  of the tubular liner . The electrode  is preferably embedded in the outer surface  of the tubular liner  to a depth that is sufficient to mechanically couple the electrode  to the tubular liner . At least a portion of the outer surface  of the electrode  is exposed proximate the outer surface  of the tubular liner  such that the electrode  can be placed in electrical communication with tissue and\/or fluids surrounding the tubular electrode sub-assembly .","Another optional feature depicted in  is that the lead body  may be constructed with a variable diameter such that the area in which the tubular electrode sub-assembly  is positioned has a reduced size as compared to other portions of the lead body . For example, the lead body  may include a shoulder  as seen in  where the size of the lead body  decreases. The diameter of the lead body  may be increased on the opposite end of the tubular electrode sub-assembly  by optionally including a sleeve  or other structure to increase the size of the lead. Such a construction can be used to provide an isodiametric lead, although other constructions could also be used to compensate for the thickness of the tubular electrode sub-assembly .","The electrode  may, in some embodiments, be formed in the shape of a coil with one or more wraps or coils and using a wire element having a rectangular cross-section as depicted in , although coiled electrodes in other embodiments may be formed using wire elements having any selected shape (e.g., round, oval, elliptical, etc.).","The tubular liner  may be located between the electrode  and the underlying structure of the lead body  over a majority of the inner surface  of the tubular liner . Exceptions to this may occur where, for example, the electrode is connected to a conductive element extending through the lead body . That electrical connection may be made by a variety of techniques, with at least some potentially suitable connection techniques being described in US Patent Application Publication Nos. US 2005\/0240252 (Boser et al.); US 2005\/0113898 (Honeck et al.); etc.","The tubular liner  may alternatively be characterized as preventing contact between the inner surface of the electrode and the underlying structure of the lead body  (except where electrical connections may need to be made as described above).","In yet another manner of characterizing the relationship between the tubular liner  and the electrode  in some embodiments, the tubular liner  can be described as optionally having a liner thickness measured radially from the longitudinal axis  between the inner surface  and the outer surface  of the tubular liner . The electrode  can be described as having an electrode thickness that is measured radially from the longitudinal axis . Further, the liner thickness may be greater than the electrode thickness in some embodiments (as depicted, e.g., in ).","The tubular liner  includes an inner surface  that faces the underlying structure of the lead body . The tubular electrode sub-assembly  is preferably attached to underlying structure of the lead body  at one or more selected attachment sites. As discussed herein, the one or more selected attachment sites preferably occupy only a portion of the inner surface \u2014in some embodiments, the selected attachment sites may be described as occupying no more than about 50% of the inner surface  of the tubular liner . By limiting the surface area of attachment between the tubular electrode sub-assembly  and the underlying structure of the lead body , flexibility of the lead may be improved as compared to a lead in which the entire tubular electrode sub-assembly  was attached to the underlying structure of the lead body .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIGS. 6A-6C","FIGS. 6A-6C"],"b":["250","217"]},"In , the tubular electrode sub-assembly  may be attached at its proximal end  and its distal end  by selected attachment sites  that may be in the form of rings around the tubular electrode sub-assembly . Although the selected attachment sites  at the proximal and distal ends are depicted as continuous rings, they may be provided in any other form, e.g., a group of discrete attachment sites that are arranged around the periphery of the tubular electrode sub-assembly  such that a ring structure is formed, etc.","The set of selected attachment sites depicted in  may also optionally include one or more intermediate selected attachment sites  positioned between the proximal end  and the distal end  of the tubular electrode sub-assembly . Such an intermediate selected attachment site  may be provided in combination with attachment sites  at the ends of the tubular electrode sub-assembly  or one or more intermediate selected attachment sites  may be provided in the absence of attachment sites at the ends of the tubular electrode sub-assembly .","One potential alternative arrangement of selected attachment sites is depicted in  in which a selected attachment site  in the form of a line is depicted in combination with selected attachment sites  at the ends of the tubular electrode sub-assembly . Although depicted as a straight line that extends from the proximal end  to the distal end  of the tubular electrode sub-assembly  and that is aligned with the longitudinal axis , the line  may be shorter and\/or the line  may not be aligned with the longitudinal axis . Further, the attachment site  may be provided in combination with attachment sites  at the ends of the tubular electrode sub-assembly  (as depicted) or one or more such lines may be provided in the absence of attachment sites at the ends of the tubular electrode sub-assembly .","Another potential alternative arrangement of selected attachment sites is depicted in  in which a selected attachment site  is provided in the form of a helix that extends around the tubular electrode sub-assembly  and proceeds along its length between the proximal end  and the distal end . Although the selected attachment site  is depicted as a continuous structure, it may be provided in any other form, e.g., a group of discrete attachment sites that are arranged around and along the tubular electrode sub-assembly  such that a helical structure is formed, etc. Additional selected attachment sites may also be provided in combination with a helical selected attachment site .","In still another alternative, limiting the area occupied by the attachment sites between the tubular electrode sub-assembly  and the underlying structure of the lead body may not be used if, for example, the tubular electrode sub-assembly  is attached to the underlying structure of the lead body by an attachment agent that has a lower modulus than the material used to construct the liner  of the tubular electrode sub-assembly . For example, using a silicone medical adhesive to attach the inner surface of the liner  to the underlying structure of the lead body  may provide sufficient compliance to provide enhanced flexibility in the lead such that the attachment agent (e.g., silicone adhesive, etc.) may occupy more than about 50% of the surface are occupied by the tubular electrode sub-assembly . In some embodiments, the attachment agent may be provided over substantially all of the interface between the inner surface of the liner  and the underlying structure of the lead body .","As discussed herein, the electrode  is embedded in the outer surface  of the tubular liner . One potential method for manufacturing a tubular electrode sub-assembly having such a construction is depicted and will be described in connection with , which are sectional views taken during different stages of the manufacturing process.","The process begins with an electrode  which is located within a masking structure . The masking structure  preferably masks the outer surface of the electrode  such that the flowable liner material is inhibited from coating the outer surface of the electrode . Although the electrode  has a flat outer surface, in some embodiments the electrode may have a more complex outer surface if, e.g., the coils are formed using round wires or wires with other cross-sectional shapes. In such embodiments, it may be helpful if the masking structure can at least partially conform to such surface such that larger portions of the outer surface are masked. The masking structure  may be provided in the form of a tube, although tapes, sheets and other structures could potentially be used. Alternatively, the masking structure may take the form of a mold cavity appropriately shaped to conform to portions of the outer surface.","In one embodiment, the masking structure  may be in the form of a heat-shrinkable tube that is placed over the electrode  and then heated such that the tube diameter decreases to compress the outer surface of the electrode . One example of this is depicted in , where masking structure  may be in the form of a heat-shrinkable tubing that has been shrunk to mask the outer surface of the electrode . In addition to masking the outer surface of the electrode , the masking structure  may also function as a mold or containment structure for the liner material in the interstices  of the coiled electrode . Further, the heat shrink tubing may conform to the shape of the outer surface of the electrode even if that outer surface is not flat, e.g., if the electrode  is constructed with a rounded wire or wire having an outer surface that is not flat.","With the masking structure  in place, a flowable liner material  can be delivered into the interior of the electrode  such that the flowable liner material fills the interstices  of the electrode  (e.g., between adjacent coils of a coiled electrode) and forms an outer liner surface proximate the inner surface  of the masking structure . The flowable liner material may be delivered into the interior of the coiled electrode by any suitable technique, e.g., a syringe, extrusion nozzle, etc.","With the flowable liner material  in place in the coiled electrode , at least a portion of the flowable material may be removed by inserting a mandrel  into the interior of the coiled electrode as depicted in . The mandrel  may be solid or hollow, although one embodiment of the mandrel  may be in the form of a hollow tube. The mandrel may be made of metal, such as annealed copper wire or silver-plated copper wire, for example. A metal-containing mandrel may be coated with an organic polymer to facilitate release from the liner. Such coating materials include PTFE-based coatings, polyimide, or other polymeric coatings such as \u201cPD Slick\u201d coating materials. Alternatively, the mandrel may be made of a polymeric material. In one embodiment of the mandrel  may be in the form of a hollow polymeric tube. Polymers for such a mandrel  may be, e.g., ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), or fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP).","After the mandrel  is in place, the flowable liner material  may be limited to the interstices  between adjacent coils of the electrode  as depicted in , although a portion of the liner material  may remain between the mandrel  and the inner surface of the coiled electrode .","The flowable liner material  may then be hardened (for example, by curing (e.g., crosslinking), removing solvent, or cooling) while the mandrel  is located within the interior of the electrode  such that the liner material forms a liner  that is located at least between the interstices  of the electrode .","After the liner material  hardened, the mandrel  can be removed and excess liner material removed such that the structure depicted in  is provided which includes the electrode  surrounded by the masking structure , with the liner material forming a liner  that fills the interstices  in the electrode  and that may also be found in a relatively thin layer on the inner surface of the electrode .","The mandrel removal may be accomplished by a variety of techniques that may include, e.g., deformation, dissolution, etc. If the mandrel  is, e.g., a structure that necks down when elongated along the axis , then the removal process may involve stretching the mandrel  along the axis  such that it necks down. The mandrel  may be made of material that releases cleanly from the material of the liner .","After the masking structure  is removed from the coiled electrode  and the liner , the finished tubular electrode sub-assembly  is obtained as depicted in . Further processing may potentially be performed to place the tubular electrode sub-assembly  in condition to be placed over a lead body as depicted in  and attached thereto in one or more selected attachment sites as described herein. Such processing to prepare the tubular electrode sub-assembly  for attachment to a lead body  may include, trimming the tubular electrode sub-assembly  to a selected length, preparing the ends or other portions of the coiled electrode for attachment to a conductive element within the lead body , etc.","Attachment of the tubular electrode sub-assembly  to a lead body  may be accomplished using any suitable technique or combination of techniques. In some embodiments, the tubular electrode sub-assembly  may be attached to the lead body  by welding or fusing the material of the liner  to the lead body . Such welding or fusing may be performed using any suitable technique or combination of techniques, e.g., ultrasonically, thermally, chemically (using, e.g., solvents), etc.","Another potential technique for providing the selected attachment sites between the tubular electrode sub-assembly  and the lead body  may be through the use of adhesive. Exemplary adhesive may include silicones, urethanes, fluoropolymers etc. The adhesives could include those activated via thermal, UV light, chemical, moisture, and solvent-based methods.","Another potentially optional additional process that may be used is to backfill or overcoat the tubular electrode sub-assembly  to fill any gaps between the liner and the electrode before and\/or after positioning it on a medical electrical lead with a hardenable organic polymeric material that has a relatively low modulus (i.e., low stiffness, low durometer) for good flexibility of the final assembly, and has a relatively low viscosity (e.g., \u201cpre-cure\u201d viscosity) for good mold-filling properties. The material used to backfill may be a thermoset or a thermoplastic material. Examples include silicones, polyimides, epoxies, polyurethanes, polyurethanes with surface-modifying end groups (SME), polyurethane silicone block copolymers (e.g., a thermoplastic silicone polyether urethane available under the designation PurSil), ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polyvinylidine difluoride (PVDF), Dyneon's THV (a polymer of tetrafluoroethylene, hexafluoropropylene and vinylidene fluoride), Daikin's T-530 fluoroelastomer, and other fluoropolymers and fluoropolymer elastomers, polyethylenes, and polyesters.","The flowable liner materials used to form the liners of the tubular electrode sub-assemblies of the present disclosure may be selected from any suitable hardenable organic polymeric material that has a relatively low modulus (i.e., low stiffness, low durometer) for good flexibility of the final assembly, and has a relatively low viscosity (e.g., \u201cpre-cure\u201d viscosity) for good mold-filling properties. The flowable liner materials may be formed of a thermoset or a thermoplastic material that can be extruded or processed into a tube. Examples include silicones, polyimides, epoxies, polyurethanes, polyurethanes with surface-modifying end groups (SME), polyurethane silicone block copolymers (e.g., a thermoplastic silicone polyether urethane available under the designation PurSil), fluoropolymers and fluoroelastomers (e.g., ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polyvinylidine difluoride (PVDF), Dyneon's THV (a polymer of tetrafluoroethylene, hexafluoropropylene and vinylidene fluoride), Daikin's T-530 fluoroelastomer, and other fluoropolymers and fluoroelastomers), polyethylenes, and polyesters.","In some embodiments, a thermoset material, such as low consistency silicones (e.g., those available under the trade designations MED-4719 or MED-4755 from NuSil), liquid silicone rubber (LSR) (such as Dow Corning's Q7-4850 or NuSil's MED-4850), and \u201cSI polyimide\u201d as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,639,850 and U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2005\/0004643 (para ), can be used for the liner materials. In some embodiments, a thermoplastic material, such as a polyurethane silicone block copolymer (such as PurSil silicone polyether urethane), a polyurethane, a polyurethane with surface-modifying end groups, and ETFE), can be used for the liner materials.","The electrodes used in the tubular electrode assemblies may be selected from a wide variety of electrically conductive biocompatible materials (including, but not limited to, titanium, stainless steel, tantalum, platinum, etc. and combinations thereof (e.g., platinum-iridium clad tantalum, etc.)) that can be formed to take on any selected shape, e.g., a coiled helical shape, etc.","The words \u201cpreferred\u201d and \u201cpreferably\u201d refer to embodiments that may afford certain benefits, under certain circumstances.
