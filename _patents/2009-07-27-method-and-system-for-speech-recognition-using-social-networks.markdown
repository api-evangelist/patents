{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","OVERVIEW OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present disclosure relates generally to speech recognition and more particularly to speech recognition using social networks.","Directories and phonebooks enable users to conveniently locate names and contact information. However, as phonebooks and directories grow larger in size, locating names becomes more time consuming and less convenient. Voice recognition technology has been developed and widely used in the industry to allow users to access and retrieve names from a phonebook or directory more conveniently by speaking a name. The voice recognition technology translates the spoken name to text and uses the text to retrieve the name from the directory.","When audio quality in a voice network is poor, however, results returned by the voice recognition technology may be inaccurate or confusing. Additionally, the results may be inaccurate or confusing if a user has a heavy accent. Spoken relationships, as opposed to spoken names, may also produce inaccurate or confusing results.","The following presents a simplified overview of the example embodiments in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the example embodiments. This overview is not an extensive overview of the example embodiments. It is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of the example embodiments nor delineate the scope of the appended claims. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the example embodiments in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","In accordance with an example embodiment, there is disclosed an apparatus comprising an audio interface configured to receive an audio signal. A data interface is configured to communicate with at least one social graph associated with a calling party. Logic is coupled to the audio interface and the data interface. The logic is configured to identify the calling party. The logic is further configured to acquire data representative of a called party from the audio signal. The logic is further configured to search the at least one social graph associated with the calling party for the data representative of the called party to identify the called party responsive to acquiring the data representative of the called party.","In accordance with an example embodiment, there is disclosed herein, a method comprised of receiving an audio signal. A calling party is identified. Data representative of a called party is acquired from the audio signal. At least one social graph is searched for the data representative of the called party to identify the called party responsive to acquiring the data representative of the called party.","Description of Example Embodiments","This description provides examples not intended to limit the scope of the appended claims. The figures generally indicate the features of the examples, where it is understood and appreciated that like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements. Reference in the specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d or \u201can embodiment\u201d or \u201can example embodiment\u201d means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described is included in at least one embodiment described herein and does not imply that the feature, structure, or characteristic is present in all embodiments described herein.","Social graph, or social network, analysis is used in an example embodiment disclosed herein in conjunction with a speech recognition system to improve accuracy, performance, and usability of a communication system. A social graph is a structure which defines the relationships of individuals with one another. A speech recognition system is used to search for names of individuals in a directory. Using a private or public social graph, the voice recognition system is able to determine a called party more accurately based on relationships of the calling party. For example, John is driving through an area with bad cell phone reception. He has a stomach ache and wants to call his doctor for advice. John only knows the 1-800 number to reach his doctor, Dr. Sheen. When John calls the 1-800 number, he is asked for the doctor's name with whom he wishes to speak. Due to bad reception, a voice recognition system can only interpret a portion of audio spoken by John. However, based on John's social graph which shows a relationship with Dr. Sheen, a communication system is able to interpolate that John wants to talk to Dr. Sheen and is therefore able to place a call to Dr. Sheen.","In another example, Mr. Ling has a heavy accent. When he places a call to his company and is connected to a phone directory, a voice recognition system is not able to accurately interpret his speech. However, if the voice recognition system is able to communicate with the company's social graph, the voice recognition system will use Mr. Ling's relationships with his peers, group, and others within the organization to identify the individual Mr. Ling intended to call. For example, if the voice recognition system partially recognizes the word \u201cJim,\u201d voice recognition system would place a call to Mr. Ling's boss, Jim Olsen. Searching for the name is also optimized since the search is based on the social graph rather then a linear search through the company directory.","In another example, Cindy wants to call her husband Vince. Instead of speaking her husbands name to a voice recognition system, Cindy speaks \u201ccall my husband.\u201d Using Cindy's social graph, a voice recognition system is able to determine that Cindy's husband is Vince and is therefore able to place a call to Vince. In addition, Cindy may speak the name \u201cVince.\u201d However, Cindy may have a husband named Vince and a good friend named Vince. Thus, the voice recognition system may use Cindy's social network to identify both parties. The voice recognition system would then suggest both parties to Cindy and allow Cindy to choose the party she intended to call. Although the voice recognition system was not able to determine the called party, the voice recognition system was able to narrow down a list of suggested individuals presented to Cindy without including individuals named Vince with whom Cindy has no relationships.","In another example, due to a poor voice network and Tommy's heavy accent, a voice recognition system is unable to extrapolate Tommy's speech when Tommy attempts to call his co-worker Jessica. However, based on Tommy's social network, the speech recognition system is able intelligently suggest names for Tommy to chose from.","In another example, Jay attempts to call his friend John Doe by speaking \u201cJohn Doe\u201d to a voice recognition system. However, because John Doe is a popular name, there are many John Does in a directory. By using Jay's social graph, the voice recognition system is able to narrow down the choices presented to Jay by limiting the results to only the John Does with whom Jay has a relationship.","Referring now to the drawings,  illustrates an example apparatus  for speech recognition using social networks configured in accordance with an example embodiment. Audio interface  is configured to receive an audio signal. Logic  is coupled to audio interface and, as will be explained in more detail herein is configured to extract data representative of a called party from an audio signal received by audio interface . \u201cLogic\u201d, as used herein, includes but is not limited to hardware, firmware, and\/or combinations of each to perform a function(s) or an action(s), and\/or to cause a function or action from another component. For example, based on a desired application or need, logic may include a software controlled microprocessor, discrete logic such as an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a programmable and\/or programmed logic device, memory device containing instructions, or the like, or combinational logic embodied in hardware. Data interface  is coupled to logic  and to at least one social graph (not shown, see e.g., ). Data interface  enables logic  to access data from the at least one social graph.","In an example embodiment, data interface  is configured to communicate with a social graph using an Application Programming Interface (API). Social Graphs can be internal or external. GOOGLE's Social Graph API is an example social graph data with an API for retrieving social graph data. Social networks that implement OpenSocial standard, including LINKEDIN and MYSPACE, also have API's for allowing third party connections. Facebook also has an API for enabling a third party to access a social graph within Facebook. In one example embodiment, data interface  forms a connection with a social graph using a markup language. XHTML FRIENDS NETWORK (XFN) and FRIEND OF A FRIEND (FOAF) are both examples of markup languages for describing a social graph.","A social graph, as used herein, refers to a structure which defines relationships of individuals with one another. The structure comprises a plurality of data points, each data point representing an individual. Data points are interconnected within the structure according relationships between the individuals represented by the data points.  illustrates an example social graph . Data point  represents a calling party while data points ,  and  represent first person, second person, and Nth person respectively, each having a direct relationship with the calling party. For example, John has a direct relationship with his father, Bill. Data points  and  represent third person and fourth person respectively, each having an indirect relationship with the calling party. For example, John has an indirect relationship with his father's boss, Mike. It shall be appreciated by those skilled in the art that a data point comprises suitable information for establishing relationships among individuals.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","310","320","330","340","300","300"]},"Social graphs are also known as social networks and may be public or private. GOOGLE's Social Graph is an example of a public social graph. It is freely available without any access restrictions. FACEBOOK is an example of a private social graph. User credentials may be required to access a private social graph. A corporate social graph for identifying relationships within a corporation is also a private social graph.","Logic  is configured to identify a calling party. by identifying the calling party, logic  can determine which social graphs to search. Those skilled in the art shall appreciate that the calling party may be identified using a suitable method. For example, the calling party's identification may be transmitted in combination with the audio signal. Alternatively, the calling party's identification may be transmitted during the call setup, prior to receiving the audio signal. In yet another example, the MAC address of a calling party's telephone may be used to identify the calling party if the telephone is associated with a specific user. The calling party may also be asked to provide identification via a user interface. In particular embodiments, the calling party may log in to the device to provide logic  with the calling party's identity. In yet another example embodiment, the calling party's identity may be pre-programmed.","To initiate a call, an audio signal containing data identifying the called party is received via audio interface . Logic  is configured to acquire data representative of a called party from the audio signal. For example, a calling party speaks \u201cCall John Smith,\u201d intending to call John Smith. Logic  determines that the portion of the audio signal comprising \u201ccall\u201d is not indicative of a called party and is therefore not included in the data representative of a called party. The spoken word \u201ccall\u201d may be identified by logic  as extra speech. Extra speech may be any words spoken by the calling party in addition to the speech representative of the called party. Thus, acquired data representative of the called party comprises \u201cJohn Smith\u201d. In one example embodiment, logic  is configured to distinguish speech indicative of a called party and extra speech. In another example, the calling party may speak \u201ccall my dad.\u201d Logic  determines \u201cdad\u201d to be a spoken relationship. Thus, acquired data representative of the called party comprises \u201cdad\u201d while \u201ccall my\u201d is determined to be extra speech. In on example embodiment, logic  is configured to distinguish a spoken name from a spoken relationship. Not all social graphs, however, may refer to a relationship in the same way. For example, a first social graph may refer to a relationship as dad while a second social graph may refer to such a relationship as father. Thus, in one example embodiment, in acquiring the data representative of the called party, the data is converted to a form compatible with a social graph by logic . For example, in acquiring the data representative of the called party, \u201cdad\u201d is converted to \u201cfather.\u201d","Logic  is configured to initiate a search of the at least one social graph for the data representative of the called party to identify the called party responsive to acquiring the data representative of the called party. The search may be performed by logic , or logic  may send data to the at least one social graph and receive the results of a search performed by the at least one social graph. For example, if the data representative of a called party contains the text \u201cJohn Smith,\u201d logic  is configured to have data points searched in a social graph having a relation to the called party and having a name John Smith. In one example embodiment, logic  is configured to initiate a search the data points having a direct relationship with the calling party. In one example embodiment, logic  is configured to initiate a search data points having both direct and indirect relationships with the calling party. It shall be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the extent to which a relationship is considered direct or indirect may be predefined. For example, a first calling party may consider his father's boss a direct relationship while a second calling party may consider his father's boss an indirect relationship. Similarly, a first calling party may consider his father's boss's brother an indirect relationship while a second calling party may not consider his father's boss's brother a relationship. In one example embodiment, logic  is configured to place a call to the called party.","By searching a social graph, called parties are identified more accurately when audio quality is poor or when speech is difficult to interpret. For example, a calling party may wish to speak to his boss John Smith. The calling party calls into his company's employee directory and speaks the name \u201cJohn Smith\u201d but because of his accent or because of poor audio quality, logic  only interprets the first name \u201cJohn.\u201d There may be several employees at the calling party's company with a first name John. By searching the calling party's social graph however, logic  is able to determine that the calling party intended to call his boss John Smith and eliminate all other employees named John within different divisions of the company since they are not found in the calling party's social graph.","Logic  also identifies called parties more efficiently by eliminating duplicate names which are not part of the calling party's social graph. Referring back to the above example, there may be three John Smiths employed in different divisions at the company. However, logic  is able to determine that the calling party intended to call his boss the John Smith and eliminate all other employees named John Smith within different divisions of the company since they are not found in the calling party's social graph. Logic  also enables called parties to be identified by relationship in addition to name. Referring again to the same example, by examining relationships of a calling party's data point in a social graph, logic  is able to determine that the calling party intended to call his boss John Smith when the calling party speaks \u201cboss.\u201d","In one example embodiment, data interface  is configured to communicate with a plurality of social graphs (see e.g.,  described herein). Thus, in one example, logic  is configured to access a database to select a social graph from the plurality of social graphs to search for the data representative of the called party to identify the called party. For example, a database maps a calling party to an associated social graph. Thus, using the database, a social graph may be selected based on a calling party identification. In one example embodiment, logic  is configured to use one of the group consisting of the calling party's phone number and credentials supplied by the calling party to select a social graph from a plurality of social graphs to search for the data representative of the called party to identify the called party. For example, when prompted, a calling party may provide his user identification as well as a name of a social graph. Logic  then searches the social graph using the calling party's provided identification.","In one example embodiment, logic  is configured to search a plurality of social graphs for the data representative of the called party to identify the called party. For example, logic  may search a calling party's personal social graph and a calling party's professional social graph. In one example embodiment, logic  is configured to search at least on social graph in accordance with a predetermined priority. For example, logic  may be configured to search a calling party's personal social graph before searching the calling party's professional social graph. In one example embodiment, logic  is configured to search one of the plurality of social graphs in accordance with a time of day. For example, logic  may be configured to search a professional social graph during the hours of 8:00 A.M. and 5 P.M. and be configured to search a personal social graph during all other hours of the day. This may help distinguish a business contact from a non-business contact within the calling party's social graph. For example, a calling party may have a relationship with two contacts having identical names, one being a business client and one being a family member. Logic  selects a social graph including the calling party's business client during business hours but selects a social graph including the calling party's family member during non-business hours. It shall be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the plurality of social graphs may be searched in accordance with other suitable configurations.","Referring to , with continue reference to , there is illustrated an example embodiment of an apparatus  comprising a user interface  coupled to logic . Logic  is further configured to search the at least one social graph for the data representative of the called party to identify a plurality of parties. User interface  is configured to present the plurality of parties for selecting the called party and to receive a selection of the called party.","User interface  may be suitably any audio, visual, or touch interface. For example, user interface  may employ an audio interface to output the search results, and wait for an audio (such as a voice command), visual (for example a pointing device) or touch (such as a key press or contact with a point on a touchscreen) to indicate the selection. As another example, user interface  may output the results visually, such as on a display device like a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) and wait for an audio, visual or touch to indicate the selection.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":["410","410","100","410","430","440","450","420","430","440","450","430","440","450","410","430","440","450"]},"For example, apparatus  may suitably comprise a database mapping for calling parties to social graphs. When apparatus  receives an audio signal to initiate a call, e.g. \u201cCall John Smith,\u201d it can use the database to determine which of social graphs ,  and  to search based on who is the calling party. For example, social graph  may be searched, social graph  may be searched, social graph  may be searched, or any combination of social graphs , ,  may be searched based on the mapping of calling party to social graphs. This can eliminate needless searching of social graphs that are not associated with the calling party.","In an example embodiment, searching of social graphs , ,  may be prioritized. For example, if there are multiple matches on multiple social graphs (for example social graphs  and ), the results may be presented in a prioritized list by social graph. In addition, the priority of a social graph may be dynamic. For example social graph  may be given priority over social graph  during work hours and\/or when the user is at the office; otherwise, social graph  has priority over social graph .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","510","520","520","520","530"]},"Data retrieval module  is coupled to the calling party module  and the data interface . Data retrieval module  is configured to receive the calling party's identification from calling party module  and to select at least one social graph associated with the identified calling party via data interface . In one example embodiment, data retrieval module  is configured to access a database (not shown) to select a social graph associated with the identified calling party. The database maps the calling party to at least one social graph. Data retrieval module  uses the calling party's identification to select one or more social graphs mapped to the calling party in the database. Data retrieval module  communicates with the selected social graphs using data interface . In one example embodiment data retrieval module  is configured to map the calling party to a social graph based on the calling party's phone number. For example, a social network may store phone numbers of all associated users. Data retrieval module  may query a social network, via data interface , using a phone number to determine if the calling party is associated with the social network.","Data retrieval module  may query a predetermined number of social networks in a predetermined order. If data retrieval module  determines that a plurality of social networks are associated with the calling party, data retrieval module  may search the plurality of social graphs in a predetermined order. Alternatively, data retrieval module  may be configured to search the plurality of social graphs according to a defined rule or algorithm. For example, data retrieval module  may be configured to search one of the plurality of social graphs in accordance with the time of day. Alternatively, data retrieval module  may be configured to search one of the plurality of social graphs in accordance with a calling party's favorite or most recently used social network. In one example embodiment, data retrieval module  is configured to map a calling party to a social graph based on credentials supplied by the calling party. For example, a calling party may provide the name of a social graph as well as a user ID and password for accessing the calling party's relationships in the social graph.","Audio recognition module  is coupled to audio interface  and configured to acquire data representative of a called party from the audio interface. Audio recognition module  converts the audio signal into a data format suitable for searching in a social graph. For example, audio recognition module may produce a text data string corresponding to the audio signal received by audio interface . In one example, a text data string corresponding to the audio signal may not be compatible with a social graph. Therefore, in one example, audio recognition module  is configured to translate a spoken relationship to a suitable form. For example, a calling party may speak \u201ccall pappa\u201d with the intention to call his father. However, a social graph may only recognize \u201cfather\u201d or \u201cdad\u201d as a relationship. Thus, audio recognition device  may translate \u201cpappa\u201d to \u201cdad.\u201d","Called party module  is coupled to data retrieval module  and audio recognition module . Called party module  is configured to identify the called party by searching the at least one social graph for the data representative of the called party. Called party module  searches the at least one social graph identified by data retrieval module  for the data representative of the called party generated by audio recognition module . In one example, calling party module  searches a social graph for a calling party's relationship. For example, called party module  may search for a calling party's father, best friend, or boss. In another example, called party module  searches for a specific called party name. For example, called party module  may search for \u201cJohn Jones.\u201d","User interface  is coupled to called party module . If called party module  identifies a plurality of parties, user interface  is configured to present the identified plurality of parties to the calling party for selecting the called party. User interface  is configured to receive a selection of the called party from the identified plurality of parties. For example, a calling party may speak \u201cJohn Smith\u201d but because of poor audio quality, audio recognition module  is only able to interpret \u201cJohn.\u201d Called party module  identifies two possible called parties, John Smith and John Jones, both of which are in the calling party's social graph. User Interface  presents both parties to the calling party for selecting the intended called party. User interface  may present the identified plurality of parties to the calling party visually, audibly, or in other suitable means. For example, user interface  may display a list of parties to the calling party. In another example, user interface  may play an audio recording comprising the names of the plurality of parties. Similarly, user interface  may receive, from the calling party, the selection in the form of speech, text, or other suitable means. Thus, even though a calling party is required to identify a called party from a list of potential parties, using a social graph to generate the list results in a less confusing list since parties not having a relationship with the calling party are not included in the list.","In view of the foregoing structural and functional features described above, a methodology in accordance with an example embodiment will be better appreciated with reference to . While, for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the methodology of . is shown and described as executing serially, it is to be understood and appreciated that the example embodiment is not limited by the illustrated order, as some aspects could occur in different orders and\/or concurrently with other aspects from that shown and described herein. Moreover, not all illustrated features may be required to implement a methodology in accordance with an aspect the example embodiment.

The spoken word \u201ccall\u201d may be identified as extra speech. Extra speech may be any words spoken by the calling party in addition to the speech representative of the called party. Thus, acquired data representative of the called party comprises \u201cJohn Smith\u201d. In one example embodiment, speech indicative of a called party is distinguished from extra speech. In another example, the calling party may speak \u201ccall my dad.\u201d Dad is determined to be a spoken relationship. Thus, acquired data representative of the called party comprises \u201cdad\u201d while \u201ccall my\u201d is determined to be extra speech. However, not all social graphs may refer to a relationship as dad. Some social graphs may only refer to such a relationship as father. Thus, in one example embodiment, in acquiring the data representative of the called party, the data is converted to a form compatible with a social graph. For example, in acquiring the data representative of the called party, \u201cdad\u201d is converted to \u201cfather.\u201d","At step , the at least one social graph is searched for the data representative of the called party to identify the called party responsive to acquiring the data representative of the called party. In one example embodiment, only data points having a direct relationship with the calling party are searched in the social graph. In one example embodiment, data points having both direct and indirect relationships with the calling party are searched in the social graph. In one example embodiment, a call is placed to the called party. Communication with the at least one social graph is established using suitable means. In an example embodiment, communication with the at least one social graph is established using an Application Programming Interface (API).
