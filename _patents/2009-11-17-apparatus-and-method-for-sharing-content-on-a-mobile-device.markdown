{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["A mobile computing device such as a combination handheld computer and mobile telephone or smart phone generally may provide voice and data communications functionality, as well as computing and processing capabilities. In addition to supporting telephone and voicemail services, a mobile computing device may support various other methods of sending or sharing content, such as facsimile, e-mail, instant messaging (IM), short message service (SMS) messaging, multimedia message service (MMS) messaging, video conferencing, and so forth. Accordingly, there may be a need for an improved apparatus and method for sharing content via a mobile device.","Various embodiments are directed to providing enhanced content sharing services. Conventionally, when a user of a mobile device wants to share content, the user may need to select the content from an application, copy the content, open a messaging application, paste the content and then finally send the content. Sometimes, however, the content type and the messaging application are not compatible. In one or more embodiments, a mobile computing device may streamline a process for sharing content with a recipient. In an embodiment, the device may receive, from any application, an indication to share content. The device may then prompt for and receive a selection of a recipient, and a transport mechanism to use to send the content. The device may format the content to be shared according to the transport mechanism and send the formatted content to the recipient.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100","100"]},"The mobile computing device  may provide voice communications functionality in accordance with different types of cellular radiotelephone systems.
