In a case of industrial instrumentation M2M may include a context in which a device having a sensor captures an event (such as a temperature, pressure, inventory level, etc.) at a particular location, and the device relays the captured event information through an access network (wireless, wired or hybrid) to an M2M server (or an M2M gateway or an M2M service platform) having an application in an application program that translates the captured event information into meaningful information to be presented to a user or system such as to monitor or control a particular device or system. M2M devices use multiple types of access technologies to communicate with M2M server(s). Some M2M devices may use only a single type of radio access technology (RAT), while other M2M devices may support multiple RATs. Wireless APs and some other network nodes typically have constraints on the number of devices and\/or active sessions they can support. These limitations may exist not only for scenarios where video surveillance cameras are used as M2M devices but even for scenarios in which M2M devices carry a very low amount of data traffic. Efficient procedures are needed in these networks to help M2M devices select a suitable AP dynamically as part of access selection mechanisms.","A method is provided in one example embodiment and includes determining a first resource indicator indicative of a first resource capability of a first network element, determining a second resource indicator indicative of a second resource capability of the first network element, determining a third resource indicator indicative of a third resource capability of the first network element, and sending the first resource indicator, the second resource indicator, and the third resource indicator to a second network element.

Communication system  includes a plurality of machine-to-machine (M2M) devices -, a plurality of wireless access points (APs) -, intermediate network nodes , a plurality of M2M servers -, a plurality of M2M user and a traffic management analytics module . All the M2M servers shown in -could be part of an M2M service platform. Each of M2M devices -are configured to be in wireless communication with one or more of wireless APs -dependent upon the particular access technologies supported by each of M2M devices -and wireless APs -. Each of wireless APs -are in communication with intermediate network nodes . Intermediate network nodes  are in further communication with M2M servers -(and these M2M servers could be part of an M2M service platform). In the particular embodiment illustrated in , traffic management\/analytics module  is in communication with intermediate network nodes . In a particular embodiment, traffic management\/analytics module  may be part of the M2M service platform. In still other embodiments, traffic management\/analytics module  may be a standalone component such as shown in .","Machine-to-Machine (M2M) refers generally to technologies that allow wireless and\/or wired systems to communicate with other devices and may have a wide range of applications in areas such as industrial automation, smart cities, healthcare, transportation, logistics, monitoring and control applications. In a case of industrial instrumentation M2M may include a context in which a device having a sensor captures an event (such as a temperature, pressure, inventory level, etc.) at a particular location, and the device relays the captured event information through an access network (wireless, wired or hybrid) to an M2M server (or an M2M service platform) having an application in an application program that translates the captured event information into meaningful information to be presented to a user or system such as to monitor or control a particular device or system.","In particular embodiments, M2M devices -may use multiple types of access technologies to communicate with M2M server . Some M2M devices may use only a single type of radio access technology (RAT) designated as single mode (SM) M2M devices. For example, M2M devices used for energy metering purpose may use 2G or 3G RAT in some examples. Some M2M devices may support multiple RATs such as video surveillance cameras supporting LTE and WiFi RATs or M2M devices that are configured to support multiple RATs because they convey safety critical information (such as a gas leak detector or a fire alarm). Those M2M devices supporting multiple RATs may be referred to as multimode (MM) M2M devices. In the particular embodiment illustrated in , M2M device is a single mode LTE device, M2M device is a single mode 3G device, M2M device is a single mode WiFi device, M2M device is a 3G single mode device, M2M device is a multimode LTE\/3G\/WiFi device, M2M device is a single mode WiFi device, and M2M device is a multimode LTE\/3G device.","Similarly, wireless APs -may each be configured to communicate using one or more RATs. In the particular embodiment illustrated in , wireless AP is a LTE\/3G\/WiFi AP, wireless AP is a femtocell AP, wireless AP is a WiFi AP, wireless AP is an LTE\/3G AP, wireless AP is an LTE AP, wireless AP is a WiFi AP, and wireless AP is a 3G AP. In still other embodiments, one or more of M2M devices -may support other access technologies such as IEEE802.15.4 or wireline access. Each of M2M servers -may be part of an M2M service platform and be configured to receive communications from one or more of M2M devices -and provide an M2M service via one or more M2M services or M2M applications to one or more of M2M users ","Wireless APs and some other network nodes typically have constraints on the number of (user) devices and\/or active sessions they can support. For example, LTE\/3G small cell APs and even Macro (e)NodeB can support a limited number of sessions\/devices. Very high control plane load may result in the network at certain instants if all M2M requests are sent simultaneously. Control plane mechanisms that create this may limitation include one or more of the following: security procedures such as (re)authentication\u2014e.g. signaling for security purposes (such as AKA including AS-SMC and NAS-SMC for LTE\/3G, 802.1X\/.11i for WiFi); lower layer synchronization procedures between M2M devices and the wireless AP; session establishment\/management for large number of M2M devices; and an M2M device moving from sleep\/idle to active state and associated procedures after the movement to active state. It should be noted that these limitations may exist even for the scenarios in which M2M devices carry very low amounts of data traffic.","Very high data plane load may result in the network at certain time instants if data corresponding to a large number of M2M requests (or responses) is sent simultaneously. Data plane related limitations may exist for the cases where M2M devices produce a large amount of data (such as video cameras used in surveillance applications).","Wireless APs typically also have memory limitations. If large number of M2M requests reach wireless APs and corresponding M2M devices are in sleep mode, the wireless AP may not even be able to buffer those. It should be noted that an M2M request could be a simple request or it could be carrying certain commands for actuators. It could even be carrying firmware to download in M2M devices.","Additional constraints for cellular M2M networks that impact network-wide performance decisions may also exist. Wireless APs can support a limited number of devices or active sessions. Some M2M devices may send a low amount of infrequent data while some M2M devices may send a large amount of data (such as video surveillance cameras). Wireless APs may also have high overhead due to control plane signaling (including security mechanisms). In addition, cellular APs may not hold the context of sessions when those sessions are not active. Further, core network nodes may not be aware of the quality of service (QoS) that can be provided by a particular AP at a given point in time, the sleep schedules of M2M devices, the caching ability of the AP, the number of M2M requests that can be buffered by the AP, or the mobility patterns of M2M devices. In LTE\/3G networks, the random access procedure for network access (i.e., RACH for initial access) may also be a factor that limits the number of simultaneous active M2M devices that a wireless AP can support.","Additional constraints for WiFi M2M networks that impact network-wide performance decisions may also exist. WiFi APs\/wireless LAN controllers (WLCs) can support a limited number of devices or active sessions. Some M2M devices may send a low amount of infrequent data while some M2M devices may send a large amount of data (such as video surveillance cameras). WiFi APs may also have high overhead due to control plane signaling (including security mechanisms). With 802.1x, the security context is kept only for a certain duration of time and may need to be created again when an M2M device wakes up the next time. Further, core network nodes (such as mobility gateways) may not be aware of the sleep schedules of M2M devices, the caching ability of the AP\/WLC, the number of M2M requests that can be buffered by the AP\/WLC, or the mobility patterns of M2M devices.","Efficient methods are needed in wireless networks to avoid such issues in these networks such as LTE\/3G\/2G\/WiFi M2M networks. Existing procedures exist but suffer from a number of limitations. One existing procedure is to randomize M2M requests at M2M servers\/service platforms if possible (such as for delay tolerant M2M requests). However, even if M2M servers randomize requests, it may still result in very high control (or data) plane load in the network at certain instants as M2M service platforms are deployed by different vendors (and they are only doing local randomization). In such situations, additional mechanisms are needed to control traffic peaks in the network.","Another existing procedure is the use of an access network discovery and selection function (ANDSF) as described by 3GPP TS 24.312. The purpose of the ANDSF is to assist user equipment (UE) to discover non-3GPP access networks that can be used for data communications in addition to 3GPP access networks and to provide the UE with rules policing the connection to these networks. However, ANDSF suffers from a number of limitations. ANDSF is meant for cellular-WiFi types of multimode devices and does not work well for single-mode LTE (or 3G) \u201conly\u201d M2M device in which it may be desired for an LTE (3G) M2M device to select the right LTE (3G) AP based on desired criteria as further described herein. In addition, ANDSF is relatively static and doesn't really take into account changing traffic dynamics at different nodes (such as routers, APs) in the network. It is desirable to use more dynamic mechanisms to solve the problems described herein. For example, if a large number of single-mode LTE (or 3G) M2M devices try to establish a session with an LTE (or 3G) AP, that results in increased overhead (such as due to random access procedures, synchronization procedures, signaling for session management and security aspects, data plane overhead once control plane access is granted and other factors). This limits the number of M2M (and non-M2M) devices that can be connected in these networks. Several of these factors depend on dynamic conditions in the network and ANDSF doesn't address this dynamism. In addition, ANDSF uses Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) Device Management (DM) that typically runs over transmission control protocol (TCP). Transport Layer Security (TLS) is used for security purposes between the ANDSF server and the UE. Many M2M devices support lightweight protocols only and may not even support OMA DM in its current form.","Another existing procedure is the current reselection mechanism of the LTE\/3G UE. However, this procedure is based more on signal strength received by the UE (from different APs) and does not consider the issues described herein especially for cases when a large number of M2M devices try to communicate with these APs. In addition, current reselection mechanisms don't consider dynamic load conditions at upstream routers\/gateways (and downstream M2M Gateways) in the network. For example, a 3G M2M device may be able to communicate with different 3G APs and the path from these 3G APs to the M2M service platform may go via different routers. In this case, it is desired to select an appropriate \u201c3G AP-router\/gateway-M2M service platform\u201d path that \u201creselection\u201d mechanisms alone don't provide.","Another existing procedure is the use of handover and load balancing mechanisms when an M2M device is in active state and communicating data with the network. However, these are not used when the M2M device is trying to establish a session with the network (e.g. the random access procedure in 3GPP networks or CSMA\/CA in WiFi networks).","In accordance with various embodiments, traffic management\/analysis module  is configured to receive resource indicators from one or more of wireless APs -indicative of the available resources of the respective wireless AP and utilize the resource indicators to provide network access selection enhancements to assist a particular M2M device -in selecting a particular wireless AP -as will be further described herein.","Referring now to ,  is a simplified block diagram of a communication system  including a traffic management\/analytics module  for providing network assisted access network selection for a machine-to-machine wireless network environment in accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure. Communication system  includes a first wireless AP and a second wireless AP in communication with traffic management module  via intermediate nodes . In particular embodiments, one or more of first wireless AP and second wireless AP may be a LTE\/3G\/WiFi small cell AP or LTE\/3G macro base station.","In accordance with one or more embodiments, each of first wireless AP and second wireless AP is configured to send resource indicators and\/or other contextual information indicative of particular resource capabilities of the particular wireless AP to traffic management\/analytics module . After receiving the resource indicators from each of first wireless AP and second wireless AP , traffic management\/analytics module  may utilize this information to assist M2M devices in selecting a particular wireless AP to utilize for network communication as will be further described herein.","In one or more embodiments, the resource indicators include an indication of the additional number of M2M devices that a wireless AP can support within a predetermined time interval (t, t+T) where T\u22670, from a control plane perspective. This indication may be designated as num_additional_devices (node_id j, t, t+T)=the number of additional M2M devices that the wireless AP having a node ID j can support during the time interval (t, t+T) where T\u22670. In one or more embodiments, the wireless AP may make an assessment of how many more devices that the wireless AP can support within that predetermined time period. For example, assuming a predetermined time period of one minute for a wireless AP that can support sixty (60) devices in total and is already supporting thirty (30) devices, the wireless AP may report a num_additional_devices indicating that the wireless AP can support an additional thirty (30) devices during the next one minute time period.","It should be noted that in a particular embodiment in which T=0 allows a wireless AP to inform of the additional devices that it can support at that time t and does not make it necessary for the wireless AP to provide an estimate for a non-zero time interval. This indicator provides a control plane perspective whereas the data plane perspective is captured indirectly in the QoS violation and CPU load factors further described below.","The resource indicators may further include in some embodiments an indication of the hardware load of the wireless AP at predetermined time t. This indicator may be designated as HW_load_indicator (node_id j, t)=the hardware load at a wireless AP having a node ID j at a time t. The hardware load indicator provides an indication of the current hardware load on the wireless AP (or base station). In particular embodiments, the wireless AP may take into account such factors as the processing power of the CPU of the wireless AP, the bandwidth capabilities of the wireless AP, etc. In particular embodiments, the hardware load indicator, HW_load_indicator (node_id j, t), may be indicated by a value indicative of either a low, medium, or high load upon the wireless AP.","The resource indicators may further include in some embodiments an indication of the fraction of flows for which a quality of service (QoS) requirement was violated considering the flows traversing through that wireless AP belonging to a particular QoS class c. The time interval for QoS violation is indicated as (t,t\u2212\u03b4), 0<\u03b4<t. This indicator may be designated as frac_qos_viol(node_id,qos_class,t,\u03b4)=the fraction of flows for which QoS was violated during time interval (t,t\u2212\u03b4), 0<\u03b4<t, while packets of that flow traversed a wireless AP having a particular node ID. Consider a class of flows that have QoS requirements for data rate of flows traversing the particular AP. A flow, f, is considered to have its QoS requirements violated while passing through an AP if",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mi":["actual_bytes","_served"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":["f","t"],"mo":";"},{"mi":["t","\u03b4"],"mo":"-"}],"mo":","}}},{"mi":["required_bytes","_to","_be","_served"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":["f","t"],"mo":";"},{"mi":["t","\u03b4"],"mo":"-"}],"mo":","}}}]},"mo":"<","mn":"1"}}}},"Here, actual_bytes_served (f; t,t\u2212\u03b4), is the number of bytes served for flow f by that wireless AP during time interval (t,t\u2212\u03b4), 0<\u03b4<t, and required_bytes_to_be_served (f; t,t\u2212\u03b4) is the number of bytes required to be served during time interval (t,t\u2212\u03b4), 0<\u03b4<t as per the rate requirement of that flow. The wireless AP is specifically considered here as that is typically the bottleneck point for an end-to-end traffic flow scenario. It should be noted that it may or may not result in an end-to-end rate violation of that flow as it also depends upon what happens at other nodes that flow f traverses through. However, this measurement indicates whether or not flows with rate requirements are getting their required rate at that specific wireless AP hop. It also indirectly indicates load at that wireless AP and channel conditions experienced by existing user devices (e.g., M2M devices) that are communicating with this wireless AP. If there is rate violation for a high number of flows, it could occur because that wireless AP is heavily loaded and\/or if user devices communicating with that wireless AP are experiencing very bad channel conditions. In particular embodiments, frac_qos_viol, can be computed in a similar manner for 3G and WiFi APs. From the value of frac_qos_viol, the wireless AP may determine a value of the indicator sent to traffic management\/analytics module . Table 1 shows an example 4-step approach for determining frac_qos_viol_indicator (node_id,qos_class,t,\u03b4) from frac_qos_viol(node_id,qos_class,t,\u03b4). In still other embodiments, an n-step approach may be used in which n\u22674.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"frac_qos_viol_indicator from"},{"entry":"frac_qos_viol using 4-step approach"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"105pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"frac_qos_viol","frac_qos_viol_indicator"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"0 \u2266 frac_qos_viol( ) < 25%","1"]},{"entry":[{},"25% \u2266 frac_qos_viol( ) < 50%","2"]},{"entry":[{},"50% \u2266 frac_qos_viol( ) < 75%","3"]},{"entry":[{},"frac_qos_viol( ) \u2267 75%","4"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"It should be noted that Note that frac_qos_viol_indicator may be important even in the presence of HW_load_indicator. For example, a scenario may exist in which HW_load_indicator (indicating utilization of HW resources of a wireless AP such as CPU, memory, bus bandwidth etc.) is \u201cmedium\u201d but frac_qos_viol_indicator could be even \u201chigh\u201d. This may occur because there may be many devices communicating via that wireless AP that may be experiencing quite bad channel conditions. Once channel conditions experienced by these devices improve, the wireless AP may need to provide additional hardware resources to enable these devices to obtain their required QoS over a certain time duration.","Upon receiving the resource indicators, i.e., num_additional_devices, HW_load_indicator, and frac_qos_viol_indicator from one or more wireless APs that provide connectively to M2M devices, traffic management\/analytics module  maintains the resource indicators within a context table.

Similarly, any of the potential processing elements, modules, and machines described in this Specification should be construed as being encompassed within the broad term \u2018processor.\u2019 Each of the network elements and mobile nodes can also include suitable interfaces for receiving, transmitting, and\/or otherwise communicating data or information in a network environment.","Note that in certain example implementations, the functions outlined herein may be implemented by logic encoded in one or more tangible media (e.g., embedded logic provided in an application specific integrated circuit [ASIC], digital signal processor [DSP] instructions, software [potentially inclusive of object code and source code] to be executed by a processor, or other similar machine, etc.). In some of these instances, memory elements can store data used for the operations described herein. This includes the memory elements being able to store software, logic, code, or processor instructions that are executed to carry out the activities described in this Specification. A processor can execute any type of instructions associated with the data to achieve the operations detailed herein in this Specification. In one example, the processors could transform an element or an article (e.g., data) from one state or thing to another state or thing. In another example, the activities outlined herein may be implemented with fixed logic or programmable logic (e.g., software\/computer instructions executed by a processor) and the elements identified herein could be some type of a programmable processor, programmable digital logic (e.g., a field programmable gate array [FPGA], an EPROM, an EEPROM) or an ASIC that includes digital logic, software, code, electronic instructions, or any suitable combination thereof.","Note that with the examples provided above, as well as numerous other examples provided herein, interaction may be described in terms of two, three, or four network elements. However, this has been done for purposes of clarity and example only. In certain cases, it may be easier to describe one or more of the functionalities of a given set of flows by only referencing a limited number of network elements. It should be appreciated that the communication systems described herein are readily scalable and further can accommodate a large number of components, as well as more complicated\/sophisticated arrangements and configurations. Accordingly, the examples provided should not limit the scope or inhibit the broad teachings of the communication systems as potentially applied to a myriad of other architectures.","It is also important to note that the previously described activities illustrate only some of the possible signaling scenarios and patterns that may be executed by, or within, the described communication systems. Some of these steps may be deleted or removed where appropriate, or these steps may be modified or changed considerably without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. In addition, a number of these operations have been described as being executed concurrently with, or in parallel to, one or more additional operations. However, the timing of these operations may be altered considerably. The preceding operational flows have been offered for purposes of example and discussion. Substantial flexibility is provided by various embodiments described herein in that any suitable arrangements, chronologies, configurations, and timing mechanisms may be provided without departing from the teachings of the present disclosure.","Although the present disclosure has been described in detail with reference to particular arrangements and configurations, these example configurations and arrangements may be changed significantly without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. For example, although the present disclosure has been described with reference to particular communication exchanges involving certain network access, and signaling protocols, the teachings described herein may be applicable to other exchanges, routing protocols, or routed protocols. Moreover, although the teachings described herein have been illustrated with reference to particular elements and operations that facilitate the communication process, these elements and operations may be replaced by any suitable architecture or process that achieves the intended functionality of the communication systems described herein.","Particular embodiments have been described with respect to wireless M2M devices within an M2M environment. However, it should be understood that the teachings described herein are applicable to other wireless devices and wireless environment such as peer-to-peer (P2P), mobile user equipment, and any other suitable wireless or wireline communication system.","Numerous other changes, substitutions, variations, alterations, and modifications may be ascertained to one skilled in the art and it is intended that the present disclosure encompass all such changes, substitutions, variations, alterations, and modifications as falling within the scope of the appended claims.
