Then, the first case  and the second case  are bonded by bolts  with the packing  interposed therebetween.","In such a case, as shown in , the packing  is pushed by a protrusion  that is formed to the second case . Note that  illustrates the packing  in a state not pushed by the protrusion  of the second case . Therefore, the dashed line of  is a virtual line of the protrusion .","A large reaction force generated in the packing  when the packing  is compressed, as mentioned above, could raise the second case . For this reason, the packing  is devised to include a protrusion  formed thereto, so that when the packing  is pushed by the protrusion  of the second case , the protrusion  will not deform and generate a large reaction force as shown in .","However, even when the protrusion  is formed to the packing , a large reaction force is still generated in the packing . Therefore, as shown in , a pawl  is formed to the first case , for example. A pawl  is formed also to the second case . Then, the pawl  of the first case  and the pawl  of the second case  are engaged to counter the reaction force and prevent the second case  from rising. Such a configuration causes an increase in the size of the cases due to the pawls formed to the both cases.","Incidentally, patent literature 1 discloses a technique of forming a sealed space by a first case and a second case using a gasket including protrusions on both upper and lower ends with their cross-sectional shapes protruding in the same direction and a middle protrusion on a substantially central part protruding in the same direction as the protrusions.","Moreover, patent literature 2 discloses a technique of forming a sealed space by a first case and a second case using a gasket including a lip part extending obliquely upward from a body with its cross-sectional shape being substantially elliptical.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["Patent literature 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. H10-154750","Patent literature 2: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2006-220229"]}},"The techniques disclosed in patent literatures 1 and 2 are unable to easily determine a position of the gasket when the gasket disposed in a groove in the first case is pushed by the second case. Accordingly, a push by the second case may bend the protrusion and lip part in an unintended direction.","An objective of the present invention is to provide a waterproof structure to solve the abovementioned issue and a method of forming the same.","In an exemplary aspect of the present invention, a waterproof structure includes a first case having a groove formed therein, a packing that is disposed in the groove, and a second case that pushes the packing and forms a sealed space with the first case. The packing includes a bending part, and while the packing is not pushed by the second case, a contact point is disposed offset toward a bending direction of the bending part from a straight line, in which the contact point is between a tip of the bending part and a bottom surface of the groove in the first case, and the straight line passes through a bending point of the bending part and is substantially orthogonal to a contact surface of the second case to be in contact with the packing, and the groove includes a guiding part that guides the tip of the bending part to a predetermined position on the bottom surface of the groove in the first case.","In another exemplary aspect of the present invention, a method of forming a waterproof structure includes disposing a packing in a groove formed in a first case, guiding, by a guiding part of the first case, a tip of a bending part of the packing to a predetermined position on a bottom surface of the groove in the first case, and disposing a contact point offset toward a bending direction of the bending part from a straight line, in which the contact point is between the tip of the bending part of the packing and the bottom surface of the groove in the first case, and the straight line passes through a bending point of the bending part and is substantially orthogonal to a contact surface of the second case to be in contact with the packing, and pushing the packing by the second case, and forming a sealed space with the first case.","According to the present invention, it is possible to provide the waterproof structure that facilitates positioning of the packing and the method of forming the same.","A waterproof structure according to exemplary embodiments of the present invention and a method of forming the same are explained. However, the present invention is not necessarily limited to the following exemplary embodiments. Moreover, following description and drawings are simplified as appropriate for clarity of the explanation. In addition, an up-and-down direction in the following explanation is based on the drawings and changes according to the usages.","[First Exemplary Embodiment]","A waterproof structure according to a first exemplary embodiment and a method of forming the same are explained. The waterproof structure and the method of forming the same according to this exemplary embodiment can be preferably used for a waterproof structure of electronic devices such as cell phones, smartphones, PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants), and tablet PCs (Personal Computers).","This waterproof structure has similar components as a common waterproof structure. Specifically, the waterproof structure includes a first case , a second case , and a packing , as shown in .","The first case  has an opening in an upper surface (may be a lower surface). The first case  has a space  capable of mounting inside an electronic substrate, a display device and the like for realizing functions of the electronic devices, for example. A riser part  is formed to surround the space .","An upper surface  of the riser part  is formed in a plane, as shown in . The riser part  has a sufficient width dimension to form a groove  for fitting the packing . The groove  is formed in the riser part . The groove  is formed annularly in planar view to surround an outer edge of the first case . Note that the specific shape of the groove  is described later. Bolt holes  are formed in four corners of the first case  outward of the riser part .","The second case  is a lid component that covers the opening of the first case  in order to form a sealed space with the first case . As shown in , at least a region  is formed in a plane, which comes into contact with the upper surface  of the riser part  of the first case  when the second case  is disposed to cover the first case . Therefore, as shown in , when the second case  covers the first case , the upper surface  of the riser part  of the first case  and the region  of the second case  come into contact on their surfaces.","The second case  is formed in a planar shape that is substantially equivalent to the first case . As shown in , a protrusion  that pushes the packing  is formed at a position corresponding to the groove  in the first case . The protrusion  is also formed annularly in planar view. A lower surface  of the protrusion  is formed to be a substantially parallel surface to the region .","The width dimension of the protrusion  is set to enable the protrusion  to be inserted into the groove  in the first case . Moreover, although mentioned later for details, the height of the protrusion  is set to enable a bending part  to bend in a bending direction (direction indicated by an arrow Q (outward direction of the first case )) of the bending part  of the packing  from the state of  to the state of .","The packing  is disposed in the groove  in the first case , as shown in ,  and the like. That is, the packing  is formed annularly to conform to the shape of the groove  in the first case . The packing  is a resin molding such as rubber with elasticity. As shown in , the packing  includes the bending part  and a base part .","The base part  is formed to be a substantially rectangular shape when viewed in cross section. The bending part  protrudes from a lower end of the base part . Specifically, the bending part  protrudes at a predetermined angle from a corner inward of the first case  on the lower end of the base part . The thickness of the bending part  on a connection part with the base part  is set in such a manner that the bending part  rotates in the bending direction when pushed from above by the protrusion  of the second case , and the bending part  extends obliquely downward with its thickness. That is, the bending part  protrudes in a tongue shape from the lower end of the base part .","A tip of the bending part  is formed in a roundish shape to slide well on a guiding part  and a bottom surface  of the groove , as described later. Note that a cutout  is formed in the lower end of the base part  so as not to hinder the bending part  from bending.","In regard to the packing  configured as above, as shown in , in the state where the packing  is disposed in the groove  and the packing  is not yet pushed by the protrusion  of the second case , a contact point P, which is between the tip of the bending part  of the packing  and the bottom surface   of the groove  in the first case , is disposed on a straight line N that passes through a bending point O (bottom part of constriction) of the bending part  and is substantially orthogonal to the lower surface  of the protrusion  of the second case , or placed offset from the straight line N toward the bending direction of the bending part .","The shape of the groove  in the first case  is explained here. The groove  is formed in a substantially rectangular shape when viewed in cross section, as shown in . As shown in , the width dimension of the groove  is set to allow the bending part  of the packing  to rotate well in the bending direction. Moreover, the depth of the groove  is set in such a manner that when the packing  disposed in the groove  is pushed by the protrusion  of the second case , the base part  is not substantially compressed, the bending part  rotates in the bending direction, and the amount of push by the protrusion  is absorbed. A bottom part of this groove  includes the guiding part  that guides the tip of the bending part  of the packing  to a predetermined position.","The guiding part  is a sloping surface that continuously slopes downward from an inward surface  of the groove  to the bottom surface  of the groove . As shown in , an intersection C between the guiding part  and the bottom surface  is set to a position in such a manner that when the packing  is disposed in the groove  in a state where the bending direction of the bending part  of the packing  faces outwardly of the first case , and then a surface  (a surface of the base part  inward of the first case  in this exemplary embodiment), which is a surface of the base part  of the packing  opposite to the bending direction of the bending part , comes into contact with the inward surface  of the groove , the tip of the bending part  of the packing  comes into contact with the bottom surface  of the groove . However, the intersection C may be offset outwardly or inwardly of the first case , in short, the intersection C should only be capable of guiding the bending part  of the packing  to bend in the intended bending direction. An inclination angle of the guiding part  is set to allow the tip of the bending part  of the packing  to slide and be guided when the packing  is disposed in the groove .","The first case , the second case , and the packing  configured in this way realize the waterproof structure as stated below.","As shown in , in the state where the bending direction of the bending part  of the packing  faces outwardly of the first case , the packing  is disposed in the groove  in the first case . At this time, the tip of the bending part  of the packing  slide on the guiding part  and is guided to the intersection C. Moreover, the surface  of the base part  of the packing  that is opposite to the bending direction of the bending part  comes into contact with the surface  of the groove  inward of the first case . That is, the packing  is positioned in the state where the packing  leans on the surface  of the groove  inward of the first case .","Although the protrusion  of the second case  pushes the packing  in this state, immediately before the push, the intersection C where the tip of the bending part  is located is placed on the straight line N, which passes through the bending point O of the bending part  and is substantially orthogonal to the lower surface  of the protrusion  of the second case , or placed offset from the straight line N toward the bending direction of the bending part .","The protrusion  of the second case  is disposed above the packing . The protrusion  of the second case  pushes the packing . Then, in the packing , the base part  is hardly compressed, and the bending part  rotates in the bending direction and becomes the state shown in . At this time, the contact point P between the tip of the bending part  of the packing  and the bottom surface  of the groove  moves outwardly of the first case  while a surface  (a surface of the bending part  inward of the first case  in this exemplary embodiment), which is a surface of the bending part  opposite to the bending direction, comes into contact with the guiding part . This therefore can stabilize the packing  in the groove part . This further increases a contact area between the packing  and the groove , thereby improving waterproof performance.","Lastly, bonding the first case  and the second case  by the bolts  realizes the waterproof structure.","In such a waterproof structure, the guiding part  can guide the tip of the bending part  of the packing  to the predetermined position (intersection C) on the bottom surface  of the groove . This therefore facilitates positioning of the packing  in the groove . Thus, when the protrusion  of the second case  pushes the packing , the bending part  of the packing  will not rotate in an unintended direction. This prevents damage to the packing  and improves the productivity of electronic devices with excellent waterproof performance.","Further, as the rotation of the bending part  of the packing  absorbs the amount of push by the protrusion  of the second case , a reaction force is hardly generated in the packing . As it is almost unnecessary for the first case  and the second case  to counter the reaction force of the packing , the size of the first case  and the second case  can be reduced and the first case  and the second case  can be simplified.","Incidentally, in the packing  of this exemplary embodiment, the bending direction of the bending part  faces outwardly of the first case . That is, it is hard for the bending part  to rotate inwardly of the first case . For this reason, in case of water ingress from outside the first case  into the groove , the bending part  functions as a valve to prevent the water ingress.","[Second Exemplary Embodiment]","Although in the packing  of the first exemplary embodiment, the bending direction of the bending part  faces outwardly of the first case , a substantially similar operation can be achieved when the bending direction of the bending part  faces inwardly of the first case .","That is, as shown in , in the state where the bending direction of the bending part  of the packing  faces inwardly of the first case , the packing  is disposed in the groove  in the first case . Also in this case, the guiding part  of the groove  in the first case  is formed in such a manner that the tip of the bending part  of the packing  is disposed at a predetermined position on the bottom surface of the groove  when the packing  is disposed in the groove  in the first case .","Specifically, the guiding part  is a sloping surface that continuously slopes downward from a surface , which is a surface of the groove  outward of the first case , to the bottom surface . As shown in , the intersection C between the guiding part  and the bottom surface  is set to a position in such a manner that when the packing  is disposed in the groove  in a state where the bending part  of the packing  faces inwardly of the first case , and then a surface  (a surface of the base part  inward of the first case  in this exemplary embodiment), which is a surface of the base part  of the packing  on the bending direction of the bending part , comes into contact with the surface  of the groove  inward of the first case , the tip of the bending part  of the packing  comes into contact with the bottom surface  of the groove . However, the intersection C may be offset outwardly or inwardly of the first case , in short, the intersection C should only be capable of guiding the bending part  of the packing  to bend in the intended bending direction.","Then, when the packing  is disposed in the groove  in the first case , the guiding part  can guide the tip of the bending part  of the packing  to the predetermined position (intersection C) on the bottom surface  of the groove . In a similar manner as the first exemplary embodiment, when the protrusion  of the second case  pushes the packing , the base part  is hardly compressed, and the bending part  rotates in the bending direction (direction indicated by an arrow R) and becomes the state shown in . At this time, the contact point P between the tip of the bending part  of the packing  and the bottom surface  of the groove  moves inwardly of the first case  while the surface  (the surface of the bending part  outward of the first case  in this exemplary embodiment), which is the surface of the bending part  opposite to the bending direction, comes into contact with the guiding part . Moreover, the surface  (the surface of the base part  outward of the first case  in this exemplary embodiment), which is the surface of the base part  of the packing  that is opposite to the bending direction of the bending part , comes into contact with the surface  of the groove  outward of the first case I.","Incidentally, when the bending part  of the packing  is disposed facing inwardly of the first case , the bending part  can easily rotate inwardly of the first case . Therefore, in case of water ingress from outside the first case  into the groove , the bending part  is pushed by the water and rotates in the bending direction, thereby resulting in allowing the water ingress inside the first case . For this reason, it is preferable to reinforce the vicinity of the bending point O of the bending part  by padding  and the like. This enables prevention of the water ingress inside the first case .","[Third Exemplary Embodiment]","Although the tip of the bending part  of the packing  according to the first and second exemplary embodiments is formed in a roundish shape, the tip of the bending part  may be formed sharply, as shown in . This reduces a contact area between the tip of the bending part  and the guiding part  and the bottom surface  of the groove , thereby reducing friction when the tip of the bending part  slide.","[Fourth Exemplary Embodiment]","Although in the first to third exemplary embodiments, the protrusion  of the second case  pushes the packing , the protrusion  may be eliminated and the lower surface  of the second case  may push the packing . In such a case, the height of the packing  is set to be greater than the height of the groove . Further, the packing  is set in such a manner that when the packing  is pushed by the lower surface  of the second case , the base part  of the packing  is hardly compressed, and the bending part  rotates in the bending direction to absorb the amount of protrusion from the groove  in the packing , as shown in .","Such a configuration reduces the height of the groove , thereby enabling reduction in the thickness of the waterproof structure and eventually the thickness of the electronic device.","The present invention is not limited to the above exemplary embodiments but can be modified as appropriate without departing from the scope.","In the above exemplary embodiments, the tip of the bending part  is formed in a roundish shape or sharply in order to reduce sliding resistance of the tip of the bending part  of the packing , however, it is not limited to this. Specifically, the vicinity of the tip of the bending part  may be grained. Unevenness is formed on the vicinity of the tip of the bending part  by graining, and this reduces the friction with the guiding part  and the bottom surface  of the groove .","Moreover, a lubricant such as oil may be applied to the vicinity of the tip of the bending part  and the guiding part  and the bottom surface  of the groove .","Further, the vicinity of the tip of the bending part  may be formed of a material including a lubricant.","Incidentally, a following configuration using the above packing  can also realize the waterproof structure.","In the waterproof structure shown in , the packing  of the first exemplary embodiment is disposed upside down. Specifically, as shown in , the bending part  of the packing  is disposed in a state not pushed by the second case  and facing obliquely upward and also outwardly (may be inwardly) of the first case . As shown in , this packing  is pushed by the lower surface  of the second case , in a similar manner as the fourth embodiment. Therefore, the height of the packing  is set to be greater than the height of a groove  in the first case . However, as with the packing  of the first and second exemplary embodiments, the packing  may be pushed by the protrusion  of the second case .","The groove  in the first case  includes a restraining part  and a relief part . The base part  of the packing  is fitted in the restraining part . The width dimension and height of the restraining part  are set to restrain the base part  well. This enables positioning of the packing  only by fitting the packing  in the restraining part  of the groove .","The relief part  is formed in such a manner that the bending part  does not interfere the groove  when the bending part  of the packing  rotates in the bending direction. The relief part  of this exemplary embodiment is formed continuously with a surface  of the restraining part  that is outward of the first case  obliquely upward and also outwardly of the first case . However, the shape of the relief part  is not especially limited, in short, the relief part  should only be formed in such a manner that the bending part  does not interfere the groove  when the bending part  rotates in the bending direction.","The base part  of the packing  is fitted in the restraining part  of the groove  in the first case  with such a configuration in the state that the bending part  of the packing  faces obliquely upward and also outwardly of the first case . When the second case  is disposed to cover the opening of the first case  from above, as shown in , the packing  is pushed by the lower surface  of the second case  and the bending part  of the packing  rotates in a direction indicated by an arrow S, and the vicinity of the tip of the bending part  moves into the relief part  of the groove . Since the base  does not move in the up-and-down direction at this time unlike the packing  of the first to fourth exemplary embodiments, it is possible to prevent the packing  from deteriorating. Additionally, as the width dimension of the restraining part  of the groove  can be substantially equivalent to that of the base part  of the packing , the width dimension of the groove  can be less than that of the groove  according to the first to fourth exemplary embodiments.","Even when the packing  is used upside down in this way, as shown in , the bending part  of the packing  comes into contact with the lower surface  of the second case , and the base part  of the packing  is firmly fitted in the restraining part  of the groove , thereby enabling prevention of water ingress from outside the first case .","Incidentally, as shown in , a configuration can be employed in which a pawl  protrudes from the base part  of the packing , and the pawl  is hooked on a hook piece  formed to the first case  to fix the packing . This enables elimination a part of the riser part  inward of the first case .","The present application claims priority rights of and is based on Japanese Patent Application No. 2010-284625 filed on Dec. 21, 2011 in the Japanese Patent Office, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","Industrial Applicability","The present invention can be preferably used for a waterproof structure of electronic devices such as cell phones, smart phones, PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants), and tablet PCs (Personal Computers).","Reference Signs List",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":[{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0001","num":"0070"},"b":"1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0002","num":"0071"},"b":"2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0003","num":"0072"},"b":"3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0004","num":"0073"},"b":"4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0005","num":"0074"},"b":"5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0006","num":"0075"},"b":"6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0007","num":"0076"},"b":"11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0008","num":"0077"},"b":"12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0009","num":"0078"},"b":"13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0010","num":"0079"},"b":"14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0011","num":"0080"},"b":"15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0012","num":"0081"},"b":"16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0013","num":"0082"},"b":"17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0014","num":"0083"},"b":"18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0015","num":"0084"},"b":"19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0016","num":"0085"},"b":"21"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0017","num":"0086"},"b":"22"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0018","num":"0087"},"b":"23"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0019","num":"0088"},"b":"24"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0020","num":"0089"},"b":"25"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0021","num":"0090"},"b":"31"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0022","num":"0091"},"b":"32"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0023","num":"0092"},"b":"33"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0024","num":"0093"},"b":"34"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0025","num":"0094"},"b":"35"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0026","num":"0095"},"b":"36"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0027","num":"0096"},"b":"37"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0028","num":"0097"},"b":"38"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0029","num":"0098"},"b":"110"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0030","num":"0099"},"b":"111"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0031","num":"0100"},"b":"112"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0032","num":"0101"},"b":"113"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0033","num":"0102"},"b":"120"}]}}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 12"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
