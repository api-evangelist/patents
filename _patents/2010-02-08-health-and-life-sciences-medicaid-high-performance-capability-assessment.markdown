title: Health and life sciences medicaid high performance capability assessment
abstract: A high-performance capability assessment model helps a Medicaid program meet the challenges of the health market. As a result, the Medicaid program can achieve the clarity, consistency, and well-defined execution of core processes that reduce inefficiencies and waste that result from unnecessary process complexity and exceptions. In addition, the high-performance capability assessment model helps the Medicaid program to identify specific areas in which improvements may be made, to understand how to make said improvements, and to establish levels of capability along the way to reaching an ultimate capability goal.

Technical Field","This disclosure concerns a system and method for identifying the performance of an organization on a scale of mastery across representative capabilities of the organization's industry. In particular, this disclosure relates to an efficient and cost effective way to assess the performance level of key capability areas within the processes of a Medicaid program.","2. Background Information","Modern Medicaid programs operate in an increasingly challenging environment. To survive, Medicaid programs must adapt to this environment and execute in a clear, consistent, and efficient manner. Furthermore, the competitive nature, regulatory requirements, low profit margins, and competitive challenges of Medicaid programs greatly increase the complexity and difficulty of surviving on a day-to-day basis.","Despite the need for Medicaid programs to meet the challenges of the health-related market, it is still often the case that the programs lack clarity, consistency, and well-defined execution of its core processes. These shortcomings severely constrain the programs, and lead directly to inefficiencies and waste due to unnecessary complexity, process exceptions, and customer dissatisfaction. At the same time, it can be very difficult to identify specific processes to which improvements may be made, either because the program management itself does not have the expertise to identify the processes or because the complexities of the programs frustrate attempts to clearly delineate the processes to be improved.","Even if the Medicaid programs, on their own, could identify one of the many processes that it needs to improve, the business or management would not necessarily know how to improve the process or be able to identify a concrete and measurable improvement goal. Another difficulty exists in determining whether there are any intermediate goals that should be reached along the way. As Medicaid programs struggle to meet the demands of the modern economic and health landscape, they fail to identify opportunities for maximizing efficiency, category expansion, multi-channel execution, customer satisfaction, and to reach other important goals.","Therefore, a need exists for an efficient and effective system and method to assess the performance level of key assessment areas within the processes of a Medicaid program.","A high-performance capability assessment (HPCA) model helps a Medicaid program meet the challenges of the market segment by defining a scale of performance mastery along which the current practices of the program may be located. The HPCA model accelerates the discovery of process and performance gaps within program operations. In addition, the HPCA model also helps the program to identify specific areas in which improvements may be made, how to make the improvements, and how to establish performance measures during the course of attempting to achieve an ultimate goal. As a result, the programs can achieve the clarity, consistency, and well-defined execution of core processes that maximize the operating budget for optimum outcomes.","The HPCA model includes a key factor dimension and a performance mastery scale dimension. The performance mastery scale dimension defines multiple mastery levels. The performance mastery levels form a scale of increasing organizational performance. The scale includes a \u2018Basic\u2019 mastery level, a \u2018Competitive\u2019 mastery level, and a \u2018Market Leading\u2019 mastery level along a horizontal axis. Each performance mastery level includes criteria specific to a corresponding key assessment area. Each key assessment area identifies some aspect of a capability of a Medicaid program.","A capability can be defined as a bundle of closely integrated skills, knowledge, technologies, and cumulative learning that is exercised through a set of processes and that collectively represents an program's ability to create value by producing outcomes and results. Capability areas do not represent a delineation of organizational responsibilities because the outcomes of a capability may be the result of a number of cross-functional teams. Capabilities of a business may be grouped into areas and\/or platforms, including platforms and sub-platforms, depending on the organizational structure of the business.","For example, the HPCA model groups the capabilities of the Medicaid program into nine main areas or platforms, which may also be thought of as \u201cprogram areas,\u201d namely a program management platform, a care management platform, a contractor management platform, a program integrity management platform, a business relationship management platform, a provider management platform, a member management platform, an operations management platform, and an enterprise platform. Each platform may include multiple sub-platforms. For example, the program integrity management platform may include three sub-platforms, namely an identify candidate case sub-platform, a manage case sub-platform, and a payment integrity sub-platform.","Some of the platforms and sub-platforms may include additional or further levels, while others may not, and may also include capabilities at their lowest level. Examples of capabilities within the program quality management sub-platform include, for example, a manage business performance capability and a manage quality, risk, and performance capability.","The key factor dimension establishes a set of key assessment areas in which to analyze the capabilities of a business. Key assessment areas include performance capability criteria. Performance capability criteria populate the performance capability assessment model. The performance capability criteria may be specific to any one of many different business capabilities. Any number of performance capability assessment models and performance capability criteria may be defined and stored in a capability detail pool for subsequent retrieval and application to a business under examination. Accordingly, the HPCA model provides a flexible and adaptive scale of performance capability against which business practices may be compared to ascertain where the capabilities of a program under examination fall along the scale.","Other systems, methods, features, and advantages will be, or will become, apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following figures and detailed description. All such additional systems, methods, features, and advantages are included within this description, are within the scope of the invention, and are protected by the following claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","102","104","106","108","110","112","114","116","118","102","104","106","108","110","112","114","116","118","100","100","130"]},"The HPCA model  establishes a multidimensional Medicaid program performance reference set that includes multiple key assessment performance levels , further described below in reference Tables 1-3. The performance levels  establish a scale of increasing effectiveness in delivery of each capability. The key assessment performance reference tables include a \u2018Basic\u2019  delivery level, a \u2018Competitive\u2019  delivery level, and a \u2018Market Leading\u2019  delivery level. The performance levels establish a scale of mastery  along which current program practices may be located and identified with respect to any platform and capability within a platform according to an analysis of performance capability criteria (PCC). The capability under evaluation may be assigned the performance level  based on a delivery effectiveness position  along the scale of mastery .","The \u2018Basic\u2019 delivery level  specifies \u2018Basic\u2019 performance assessment criteria, the \u2018Competitive\u2019 delivery level  specifies \u2018Competitive\u2019 performance assessment criteria, and the \u2018Market Leading\u2019 delivery level  specifies \u2018Market Leading\u2019 performance assessment criteria. The HPCA model  receives input data that specifies a Medicaid program platform (e.g., a Medicaid program area) and a Medicaid program key assessment area for analysis. The HPCA model  searches the multidimensional Medicaid program performance reference set for a matching key assessment performance reference table that matches the Medicaid program platform and corresponding program capability within the platform and the Medicaid program key assessment area, and retrieves the matching key assessment performance reference table. The HPCA model  initiates analysis of the matching key assessment performance reference table to obtain a resultant performance assessment level for the Medicaid program key assessment area.","Tables 1-3 below provide an explanation of each of the capability levels , , and .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"\u2018Basic\u2019 Delivery Level"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"133pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Description:","Capability mastery at the basic level is "]},{"entry":[{},{},"competitive on a domestic or local"]},{"entry":[{},{},"level and selectively on a global basis."]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 2"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"\u2018Competitive\u2019 Delivery Level"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Description:","Capability mastery at a competitive level "]},{"entry":[{},"is in the top 50% of performers when compared "]},{"entry":[{},"to domestic and international peer groups."]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 3"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"\u2018Market Leading\u2019 Delivery Level"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"133pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Description:","Capability mastery at a market leading "]},{"entry":[{},{},"level implies that few companies"]},{"entry":[{},{},"globally are performing at this level, "]},{"entry":[{},{},"and can include emerging capabilities"]},{"entry":[{},{},"where companies have committed "]},{"entry":[{},{},"significant levels of investment and"]},{"entry":[{},{},"resources."]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"For  the capability under evaluation may be assigned a level of mastery  based on the program's position along the scale of mastery  (e.g., the \u2018Basic,\u2019 \u2018Competitive,\u2019 or \u2018Market Leading\u2019 delivery level).

The capability detail pool database  stores the capability detail pool , which includes pre-defined performance capability assessment models . The assessment results database  stores determined capability levels for specific capabilities that have been analyzed.","The system  facilitates the review, modification, creation, and application of performance capability assessment models. In that role, performance capability assessment model manipulation logic (\u201cmanipulation logic\u201d)  within the system  creates, retrieves, and stores capability assessment data  in the memory . The manipulation logic  may establish capability assessment data  in the memory , including a capability assessment data structure  with multiple capability levels (\u201cCL\u201d)  organized along a scale of mastery dimension, multiple key assessment areas (\u201cKAA\u201d)  organized along a key factor dimension, and performance criteria (\u201cPCC\u201d)  that populate the performance capability assessment model . The manipulation logic  may vary widely in implementation, and, as one example, may include data storage logic  that saves data in memory and user interface logic that accepts capability level specifications, key assessment area specifications, and performance capability criteria inputs to create new performance capability assessment models, to modify existing performance capability assessment models, to delete performance capability assessment models, or to retrieve performance capability assessment models for review.","In one implementation, the manipulation logic  establishes the capability assessment data structure  to include a multidimensional Medicaid program performance reference set that includes multiple key assessment performance reference tables in which the key assessment performance reference tables include a \u2018Basic\u2019 capability performance level, a \u2018Competitive\u2019 capability performance level, and a \u2018Market Leading\u2019 capability performance level.","The capability assessment data  may also include a capability position specifier .

For example, the data population logic  may include input logic  that accepts input specifying a capability of interest that indicates a particular performance capability assessment model. The data population logic  may include query logic  that executes database queries and prompts a user for input to obtain the corresponding performance capability criteria for the capability of interest.","In another implementation, for example, the query logic  may receive an input specifying a Medicaid program area and a Medicaid program key assessment area with the Medicaid program area for analysis. The query logic  searches the multidimensional Medicaid program performance reference set for a matching key assessment performance reference table that matches the Medicaid program area and the Medicaid program key assessment area, and retrieves the matching key assessment performance reference table.","The data population logic  may further include storage logic that adds the retrieved performance capability criteria to the template performance capability assessment model.

Parameters (e.g., conditions and thresholds) and other data structures may be separately stored and managed, may be incorporated into a single memory or database, or may be logically and physically organized in many different ways. Programs and instructions may be parts of a single program, separate programs, or distributed across several memories and processors.","The HPCA  model provides unexpectedly good results for a performance capability assessment model, particularly in the Medicaid program area. In particular, the combinations of key assessment areas and particular assessment criteria of the HPCA model, including the criteria noted in the Appendix of Tables, provide significant advantages over other assessment models. The unexpectedly good results include clearly identifying and delineating from among multiple related complex processes the specific processes to improve, how to improve the process, and identifying concrete and measurable improvement goals.","While various embodiments of the invention have been described, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that many more embodiments and implementations are possible within the scope of the invention.
