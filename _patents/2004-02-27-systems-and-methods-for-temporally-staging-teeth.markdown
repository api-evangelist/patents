{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention is related generally to the field of orthodontics, and more particularly to a system and a method for gradually repositioning teeth.","A fundamental objective in orthodontics is to realign a patient's teeth to positions where the teeth function optimally and aesthetically. Typically, appliances such as braces are applied to the teeth of the patient by a treating orthodontist. Each appliance exerts continual forces on the teeth which gradually urge the teeth toward their ideal positions. Over a period of time, the orthodontist adjusts the appliances to move the teeth toward their final destination.","The process of attaching the braces to teeth is tedious and painful. Additionally, each visit to the orthodontist is time consuming and expensive. The process is further complicated by uncertainties in determining a final arrangement for each tooth. Generally, the final tooth arrangement is determined by the treating orthodontist who writes a prescription. Traditionally, the prescription is based on the orthodontist's knowledge and expertise in selecting the intended final position of each tooth and without a precise calculation of forces being exerted on the teeth when they contact each other.","In one aspect, systems and methods are disclosed for moving teeth by moving a first tooth; and moving a second tooth while isolating the first tooth at a rest position.","In another aspect, a system to treat teeth includes means for moving a first tooth; and means for moving a second tooth while isolating the first tooth at a rest position.","In another aspect, a system for generating one or more appliances for a patient includes a processor; a display device coupled to the processor; a data storage device coupled to the processor; a scanner coupled to the processor for providing data to model the patient's masticatory system; means for moving a first tooth; means for moving a second tooth while isolating the first tooth at a rest position; and a dental appliance fabrication machine coupled to the processor for generating the appliances in accordance with the moved tooth and the isolated tooth.","Implementations of each of the above aspects may include one or more of the following. The second tooth can be moved for a first duration and immobilized for a second duration. The duration can be on an hourly basis, a daily basis, or a weekly basis. A plurality of appliances can be generated, wherein the appliances comprise polymeric shells having cavities and wherein the cavities of successive shells have different geometries shaped to receive and resiliently reposition the teeth from one arrangement to a successive arrangement. A first cavity isolates the first tooth at the rest position. A second cavity urges the second tooth to one of the successive position. The appliance can be replaced on an intra-day basis, daily basis, multi-day basis, intra-week basis, or weekly basis. Additionally, the system can move a first group of teeth; and move a second group of teeth while isolating the first group of teeth at a rest position. Each group can be contiguous teeth or can be non-contiguous teeth.","Advantages of the invention include one or more of the following. Tooth movement can be achieved quickly. Other advantages include moving the teeth in a manner that is optimum in methodology. The system also provides the ability to stop moving certain teeth that have reached their intended locations while allowing other teeth to move. The prescription may be automatically interpreted in order to generate an image as well as a digital data set representing the final tooth arrangement.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","22","20","20","30","10","30","22","101","20","100"]},"A computer model of the jaws  and  is generated, and a computer simulation models interactions among the teeth on the jaws  and . The computer simulation allows the system to focus on motions involving contacts between teeth mounted on the jaws.","The computer simulation allows the system to render realistic jaw movements which are physically correct when the jaws  and  contact each other. The model of the jaw places the individual teeth in a treated position. Further, the model can be used to simulate jaw movements including protrusive motions, lateral motions, and \u201ctooth guided\u201d motions where the path of the lower jaw  is guided by teeth contacts rather than by anatomical limits of the jaws  and . Motions are applied to one jaw, but may also be applied to both jaws. Based on the occlusion determination, the final position of the teeth can be ascertained.","Referring now to , the lowerjaw  includes a plurality of teeth , for example. At least some of these teeth may be moved from an initial tooth arrangement to a final tooth arrangement. As a frame of reference describing how a tooth may be moved, an arbitrary centerline (CL) may be drawn through the toot . With reference to this centerline (CL), each tooth may be moved in orthogonal directions represented by axes , , and  (where  is the centerline). The tooth  may be rotated about the axis  (root angulation) and the axis  (torque) as indicated by arrows  and , respectively. Additionally, the tooth may be rotated about the axis . Thus, all possible free-form motions of the tooth can be performed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A"],"b":["102","1","1","1","2","2","1","1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 2C","b":"111"},"As set forth in the prior applications, each polymeric shell may be configured so that its tooth receiving cavity has a geometry corresponding to an intermediate or final tooth arrangement intended for the appliance. The patient's teeth are repositioned from their initial tooth arrangement to a final tooth arrangement by placing a series of incremental position adjustment appliances over the patient's teeth. The adjustment appliances are generated at the beginning of the treatment, and the patient wears each appliance until the pressure of each appliance on the teeth can no longer be felt. At that point, the patient replaces the current adjustment appliance with the next adjustment appliance in the series until no more appliances remain. Conveniently, the appliances are generally not affixed to the teeth and the patient may place and replace the appliances at any time during the procedure. The final appliance or several appliances in the series may have a geometry or geometries selected to overcorrect the tooth arrangement, i.e., have a geometry which would (if fully achieved) move individual teeth beyond the tooth arrangement which has been selected as the \u201cfinal.\u201d Such overcorrection may be desirable in order to offset potential relapse after the repositioning method has been terminated, i.e., to permit some movement of individual teeth back toward their precorrected positions. Overcorrection may also be beneficial to speed the rate of correction, i.e., by having an appliance with a geometry that is positioned beyond a desired intermediate or final position; the individual teeth will be shifted toward the position at a greater rate. In such cases, the use of an appliance can be terminated before the teeth reach the positions defined by the appliance.","The polymeric shell  can fit over all teeth present in the upper or lower jaw. Often, only certain one(s) of the teeth will be repositioned while others of the teeth will provide a base or an anchor region for holding the appliance  in place as the appliance  applies a resilient repositioning force against the tooth or teeth to be repositioned. In complex cases, however, multiple teeth may be repositioned at some point during the treatment. In such cases, the teeth which are moved can also serve as a base or anchor region for holding the repositioning appliance.","The polymeric appliance  of  may be formed from a thin sheet of a suitable elastomeric polymer, such as Tru-Tain 0.03 in, thermal forming dental material, available from Tru-Tain Plastics, Rochester, Minn. Usually, no wires or other means will be provided for holding the appliance in place over the teeth. In some cases, however, it will be desirable or necessary to provide individual anchors on teeth with corresponding receptacles or apertures in the appliance  so that the appliance can apply an upward force on the tooth which would not be possible in the absence of such an anchor.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["200","202"]},"The IDDS is then manipulated using a computer having a suitable graphical user interface (GUI) and software appropriate for viewing and modifying the images. More specific aspects of this process will be described in detail below.","Individual tooth and other components may be segmented or isolated in the model to permit their individual repositioning or removal from the digital model. After segmenting or isolating the components, the user will often reposition the tooth in the model by following a prescription or other written specification provided by the treating professional. Alternatively, the user may reposition one or more teeth based on a visual appearance or based on rules and algorithms programmed into the computer. Once the user is satisfied, the final teeth arrangement is incorporated into a final digital data set (FDDS) (). The FDDS is used to generate appliances that move the teeth in a specified sequence. First, the centers of each tooth model may be aligned using a number of methods. One method is a standard arch. Then, the teeth models are rotated until their roots are in the proper vertical position. Next, the teeth models are rotated around their vertical axis into the proper orientation. The teeth models are then observed from the side, and translated vertically into their proper vertical position. Finally, the two arches are placed together, and the teeth models moved slightly to ensure that the upper and lower arches properly mesh together. The meshing of the upper and lower arches together is visualized using a collision detection process to highlight the contacting points of the teeth.","Based on both the IDDS and the FDDS, a plurality of intermediate digital data sets (INTDDSs) are defined to correspond to incrementally adjusted appliances (). Finally, a set of incremental position adjustment appliances are produced based on the INTDDs and the FDDS ().","In , final positions for the upper and lower teeth in a masticatory system of a patient are determined by generating a computer representation of the masticatory system. An occlusion of the upper and lower teeth is computed from the computer representation; and a functional occlusion is computed based on interactions in the computer representation of the masticatory system. The occlusion may be determined by generating a set of ideal models of the teeth. Each ideal model in the set of ideal models is an abstract model of idealized teeth placement which is customized to the patient's teeth, as discussed below. After applying the ideal model to the computer representation, and the position of the teeth is optimized to fit the ideal model. The ideal model may be specified by one or more arch forms, or may be specified using various features associated with the teeth.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["300","300","302","303"]},"From (), the process  positions the model of the teeth in its approximate final position based on a correspondence of features to the ideal model (). In that step, each tooth model is moved so that its features are aligned to the features of a corresponding tooth in the ideal model. The features may be based on cusps, fossae, ridges, distance-based metrics, or shape-based metrics. Shape-based metrics may be expressed as a function of the patient's arches, among others.","For example, cusp features associated with each tooth may be used. Cusps are pointed projections on the chewing surface of a tooth. In a detection stage, a possible cusp is viewed as an \u201cisland\u201d on the surface of the tooth, with the candidate cusp at the highest point on the island. \u201cHighest\u201d is measured with respect to the coordinate system of the model, but could just as easily be measured with respect to the local coordinate system of each tooth. The set of all possible cusps is determined by looking for all local maxima on the tooth model that are within a specified distance of the top of the bounding box of the model. First, the highest point on the model is designated as the first candidate cusp. A plane is passed through this point, perpendicular to the direction along which the height of a point is measured. The plane is then lowered by a small predetermined distance along the Z axis. Next, all vertices connected to the tooth and which are above the plane and on some connected component are associated with the candidate cusp as cusps. This step is also referred to as a flood fill step. From each candidate cusp point, outward flooding is performed, marking each vertex on the model visited in this matter as part of the corresponding candidate cusp. After the flood fill step is complete, every vertex on the model is examined. Any vertex that is above the plane and has not been visited by one of the flood fills is added to the list of candidate cusps. These steps are repeated until the plane is traveled a specified distance.","After the detection stage, the cusp detection process may include a rejection stage where local geometries around each of the cusp candidates are analyzed to determine if they possess non-cusp-like features. Cusp candidates that exhibit non-cusp-like features are removed from the list of cusp candidates. Various criteria may be used to identify non-cusp-like features. According to one test, the local curvature of the surface around the cusp candidate is used to determine whether the candidate possesses non-cusp-like features. Alternatively, a measure of smoothness is computed based on the average normal in an area around the candidate cusp. If the average normal deviates from the normal at the cusp by more than a specified amount, the candidate cusp is rejected.","Next, the process  computes an orthodontic\/occlusion index (). One index which may be used is the PAR (Peer Assessment Rating) index. In addition to PAR, other metrics such as shape-based metrics or distance-based metrics may be used.","The PAR index identifies how far a tooth is from a good occlusion. A score is assigned to various occlusal traits which make up a malocclusion. The individual scores are summed to obtain an overall total, representing the degree a case deviates from normal alignment and occlusion. Normal occlusion and alignment is defined as all anatomical contact points being adjacent, with a good intercuspal mesh between upper and lower buccal teeth, and with nonexcessive overjet and overbite.","In PAR, a score of zero would indicate good alignment, and higher scores would indicate increased levels of irregularity. The overall score is recorded on pre- and posttreatment dental casts. The difference between these scores represents the degree of improvement as a result of orthodontic intervention and active treatment. The eleven components of the PAR Index are: upper right segment; upper anterior segment; upper left segment; lower right segment; lower anterior segment; lower left segment; right buccal occlusion; overjet; overbite; centerline; and left buccal occlusion. In addition to the PAR index, other indices may be based on distances of the features on the tooth from their ideal positions or ideal shapes.","From , the process  determines whether additional index-reducing movements are possible (). Here, all possible movements are attempted, including small movements along each major axis as well as small movements with minor rotations. An index value is computed after each small movement and the movement with the best result is selected. In this context, the best result is the result that minimizes one or more metrics such as PAR-based metrics, shape-based metrics or distance-based metrics. The optimization may use a number of techniques, including simulated annealing technique, hill climbing technique, best-first technique, Powell method, and heuristics technique, among others. Simulated annealing techniques may be used where the index is temporarily increased so that another path in the search space with a lower minimum may be found. However, by starting with the teeth in an almost ideal position, any decrease in the index should converge to the best result.","In , if the index can be optimized by moving the tooth, incremental index-reducing movement inputs are added () and the process loops back to () to continue computing the orthodontic\/occlusion index. Alternatively, in the event that the index cannot be optimized any more, the process  exits ().","Turning now to , a process  for performing functional occlusion is shown. Functional occlusion is a process for determining how well the teeth fit together when the jaws move. The process  first acquires tooth\/arch jaw registration. This may be done using conventional techniques such as X-ray, a computer tomography, or a mechanical device such as a face bow transfer.","After acquiring the registration information (), the process  places digital dental models of the teeth in a digital articulation simulator (). The articulation simulator allows a subset of jaw movements such as bite-movements to be simulated, as described below.","From , the process  simulates jaw motions (). A simplified set of movement physics (kinematics) is applied to the dental models. The process  performs a simulation using a simplified set of interacting forces on the jaws  and  in relation to one another. The simplified physical simulation allows the system to focus on motions involving much contact between the jaws. The physical simulation allows the system to render realistic physically correct jaw movements when the jaws  and  come into contact with each other.","A range of simulated motion may be supplied using a library of motions. One typical motion supplied by the library is a protrusive motion where the lower jaw  is moved forward and backward to bring the front teeth on both jaws into contact with each other. Another motion is a lateral motion found in food chewing. The lateral motion involves moving the jaws  and  side to side. Other motions that may be supplied in the library include motions that are \u201ctooth guided\u201d where the path of the lower jaw  is guided by the teeth in contact with each other.","Next, the process  adjusts the final position based on contacts observed during the simulation of motions in  (). The result of the simulation is analyzed, the position of each tooth can be adjusted if contacts associated with that tooth are deemed excessive.","Finally, based on the contact data generated, the process determines whether additional motion simulations need to be done. The motion simulation may be rerun until the contacts associated with each tooth are acceptable to the treating orthodontist. The tooth model manipulation process can be done subjectively, i.e., the user may simply reposition teeth in an aesthetically and\/or therapeutically desired manner based on observations of the final position or based on the simulation of contacts. Alternatively, rules and algorithms may be used to assist the user in repositioning the teeth based on the contacts. If the simulation needs to be repeated, the process loops back to  (). Alternatively, the process exits ().",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["340","342"]},"Next, the digital model is segmented into one model for each tooth (). Each tooth is then matched against a model associated with a prior scan developed at the beginning of the treatment plan (). The matching process is based on matching corresponding points between the current scan and the prior scan of the teeth. In most cases, the teeth segmented from the current scan retain the shapes determined at the beginning of the treatment plan, and the matching process is easy because the models should be similar to each other.","A final position transform is then applied to the new teeth model (). The final position and specification from the prior model is copied to the current model of the patient, and the final position is adjusted based on the new models, the new X-ray information or a new prescription ().  basically involves rerunning the minimization process  () described previously with the new information, which may be a slight change in the model, a change in the X-ray scan, or a change the prescription. Finally, the process  exits ()",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["400","400"]},"The Six Keys are interdependent elements of the structural system of optimal occlusion and are based on similarities in the patterns of angulation, inclination, shape, and relative size (facial prominence) of tooth types. As such, they serve as a base for evaluating occlusion. The Six Keys are used as treatment objectives for patients. The characteristics of the Six Keys are incorporated into the design of appliance  to enhance precision and consistency in treatment results.","The process  first checks whether optimization is to be done with respect to a molar relationship key (). If so, the process  checks and applies an appropriate molar relationship (). The molar relationship pertains to the occlusion and the interarch relationships of the teeth.  enforces the following seven requirements of the molar relationship key:","1. The mesiobuccal cusp of the permanent maxillary first molar occludes in the groove between the mesial and the middle buccal cusps of the permanent mandibular first molar.","2. The distal marginal ridge of the maxillary first molar occludes with the mesial marginal ridge of the mandibular second molar.","3. The mesiolingual cusp of the maxillary first molar occludes in the central fossa of the mandibular first molar.","4. The buccal cusps of the maxillary premolars have a cusp-embrasure relationship with the mandibular premolars.","5. The lingual cusps of the maxillary premolars have a cusp-fossa relationship with the mandibular premolars.","6. The maxillary canine has a cusp-embrasure relationship with the mandibular canine and first premolar. The tip of its cusp is slightly mesial to the embrasure.","7. The maxillary incisors overlap the mandibular incisors and the midlines of the arches match.","The cusp-groove and the marginal-ridge conditions of the molars, the cusp-embrasure relationship of the premolars and canines, and incisor overjet can be observed directly from the buccal perspective. A facial axis of the clinical crown (FACC) measurement is used to permit assessment of the lingual-cusp occlusion of the molars and premolars when these teeth are viewed from their mesiobuccal aspect, as explained below.","In , Interarch relationship of the posterior teeth of two dentitions can be the same, but the interfacing of the occlusal surfaces of the two dentitions may differ because of differing crown inclinations.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"b":["404","404"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"b":"404"},"From  to , the process  checks whether the occlusion needs to be optimized with respect to a crown angulation key (). If so, the occlusion is optimized with respect to the crown angulation key (). Essentially,  ensures that all crowns should have a positive angulation, and all crowns of each tooth type should be similar in the amount of angulation. Further, the contact-area position for each tooth type should be similar.  determines a distal inclination of a gingival portion of the crown. The distal inclination may be constant within each tooth type. The angulation may be determined between the FACC and a line perpendicular to an occlusal plane.  may minimize the angulation, which may be positive or negative.","From  or , the process  checks whether the occlusion is to be optimized with respect to a crown inclination key (). If so, the crown inclination optimization is performed (). As they do in angulation, consistent patterns also prevail in crown inclination; the following three characteristics for individual teeth are analyzed in :","1. Most maxillary incisors have a positive inclination; mandibular incisors have a slightly negative inclination. In most of the optimal sample, the interincisal crown angle is less than 180\u00b0 degree. The crowns of maxillary incisors are more positively inclined, relative to a line 90\u00b0 degree to the occlusal plane, than the mandibular incisors are negatively inclined to the same line.","2. The inclinations of the maxillary incisor crowns are generally positive\u2014the centrals more positive than the laterals. Canines and premolars are negative and quite similar. The inclinations of the maxillary first and second molars are also similar and negative, but slightly more negative than those of the canines and premolars. The molars are more negative because they are measured from the groove instead of from the prominent facial ridge, from which the canines and premolars are measured.","3. The inclinations of the mandibular crowns are progressively more negative from the incisors through the second molars.","In , the crown inclination can represent an angle formed by a line perpendicular to an occlusal plane and a line tangent to a bracket site. In this step, the crown inclination can be negative when measured from an upper canine through an upper second premolar. The crown inclination may become progressively more negative when measured from a lower canine through a lower second molar. The crown inclination may also be positioned between a line parallel and tangent to the FACC at its midpoint and a line perpendicular to an occlusal plane.","From  or , the process  checks whether the occlusion is to optimized using a rotation key (). If so, the process  checks for undesirable rotations () and corrects the model so that tooth rotations are absent.","From  or , the process  then determines whether the occlusion needs to be optimized with respect to spacing (). If so, the process  checks for tight contacts that is, no spaces should exist between teeth ().  checks that contact points abut unless a discrepancy exists in mesiodistal crown diameter.","From  or , the process  then checks whether the occlusion is to be optimized with respect to an occlusal plane key (). If so, the process  then optimizes the teeth model by analyzing the plane of occlusion (). In , the depth of the curve of Spee ranges from a flat plane to a slightly concave surface. The plane can range between flat to curves of Spee. Moreover, the curve of Spee may be deep, slight, or reversed.

Although the final position of the teeth may be determined using computer-aided techniques, a user may move the teeth into their final positions by independently manipulating one or more teeth while satisfying the constraints of the prescription.","Additionally, the techniques described here may be implemented in hardware or software, or a combination of the two. The techniques may be implemented in computer programs executing on programmable computers that each includes a processor, a storage medium readable by the processor (including volatile and nonvolatile memory and\/or storage elements), and suitable input and output devices. Program code is applied to data entered using an input device to perform the functions described and to generate output information. The output information is applied to one or more output devices.","Each program can be implemented in a high level procedural or object-oriented programming language to operate in conjunction with a computer system. However, the programs can be implemented in assembly or machine language, if desired. In any case, the language may be a compiled or interpreted language.","Each such computer program can be stored on a storage medium or device (e.g., CD-ROM, hard disk or magnetic diskette) that is readable by a general or special purpose programmable computer for configuring and operating the computer when the storage medium or device is read by the computer to perform the procedures described. The system also may be implemented as a computer-readable storage medium, configured with a computer program, where the storage medium so configured causes a computer to operate in a specific and predefined manner.","Further, while the invention has been shown and described with reference to an embodiment thereof, those skilled in the art will understand that the above and other changes in form and detail may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the following claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 2A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 2C","FIG. 2A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIGS. 10A-10D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 11"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
