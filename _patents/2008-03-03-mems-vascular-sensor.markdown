No. 11\/196,849, filed Aug. 4, 2005, entitled \u201cMEMS Vascular Sensor,\u201d now U.S. Pat.

No. 60\/601,101, filed on Aug. 12, 2004, entitled \u201cBackside Wire Bonding For Micro Circuitry.\u201d The entire content of both of these applications is incorporated herein by reference.","This invention was made with government support under Grant No. HL068689-01, awarded by the National Institutes for Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.","Coronary artery disease may be one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the industrialized nations. Vascular parameters, in particular shear stress acting on blood vessel walls, may play an important role in regulating the development of atherosclerosis, because shear stress may intimately modulate the biological activities of vascular endothelial cells (ECs), which line the inner lumen of blood vessels. Shear stress has been directly correlated with the distribution of focal atherosclerotic lesions in the arterial wall. Also, there is growing evidence that disturbed blood flow, or decreased wall shear stress associated with flow separation, favors the formation of arteriosclerosis.","Measurement of shear stress is thus important for the pathogenesis of coronary artery diseases. In addition, shear stress measurement may be important in order to study the durability of prosthetic valves, as well as to monitor platelet aggregation in cardiopulmonary bypass machines, and in artificial heart and left ventricular assist devices (LVADs). Diagnostically, luminal shear stress measurement may predict the development of atherosclerotic plaque in patients at risk for acute coronary syndrome. Further, luminal shear stress measurement may provide clinical information that can predict recurrent plaque formations in patients who have undergone intravascular stent deployment or bypass graft.","Measurement of wall shear stress, in particular near-wall shear stress, remains an engineering challenge, however. The wall shear stress as obtained from a laser Doppler velocimeter or a particle image velocimeter, may have an increased noise level, due to the reflection from the wall. Another challenge is the application of in-situ devices such as heated wires, which have to be employed close to the vessel wall to measure shear stress. Typically, the vessel wall may act as a potential heat sink, diverting the direction of convective heat transfer from the hot wires so that heat is conveyed to the vessel wall, instead of to the working fluid or blood. This causes a decrease in the sensitivity of the measurements.","Measuring temporal and spatial variations in shear stress, both of which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, is especially challenging. Micromachined MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical) sensors may provide possibilities for in-situ shear stress measurement, and for overcoming difficulties in measuring temporal and spatial variations in shear stress. Operating the MEMS sensors in a liquid environment, as may be necessary in many biomedical applications, may affect the sensitivity of the MEMS sensors. For example, MEMS sensors that are driven by front-side wire bonding may require insulation using sealants, which however may undergo expansion after prolonged exposure to the fluidic environment. Also, in MEMS sensors for which wire bonding is established on the front side, the elevation of microcircuitry on the same side of sensing element may disturb the local flow milieu, thus negatively affecting the precision of the shear stress measurement.","For these reasons, there is a need for improved methods and systems for precisely measuring real-time shear stress in microfluidic channels and microcirculation, as well as in large-scale arterial circulation.","A micromachined sensor for measuring fluid shear stress may include a substrate having a front-side surface, and a backside surface opposite the front-side surface. The sensor may include a diaphragm overlying a cavity etched within the substrate. The sensor may include a heat sensing element disposed on the front-side surface of the substrate and on top of the cavity and the diaphragm. The heat sensing element may be electrically couplable to electrode leads formed on the backside surface of the substrate. The sensor may include an electronic system connected to the backside surface and configured to measure a change in heat convection from the sensing element to surrounding fluid when the sensing element is heated by applying an electric current thereto, and further configured to derive from the change in heat convection a shear stress of the surrounding fluid that flows past the sensing element.","A method of fabricating a micromachined shear stress sensor may include depositing a layer of silicon nitride on a substrate having a front-side surface and a backside surface. The method may include etching the substrate to form a cavity having an overlying diaphragm, and performing reactive ion etching on the diaphragm to create a plurality of access slits on the diaphragm.","The method may include conformally depositing a layer of polysilicon on the substrate, then doping the polysilicon layer with phosphorus. The method may include sputtering a layer of aluminum onto the backside surface of the substrate, and patterning the aluminum layer to form a plurality of electrode leads. The method may further include patterning the polysilicon layer on the front-side surface of the substrate to form a strip heat sensing element. The method may further include connecting a plurality of wire bonds between the sensing element on the front-side surface and the electrode leads on the backside surface, by passing the wire bonds through the access slits on the diaphragm.","A method of measuring shear stress on a blood vessel wall may include introducing a backside wire-bonded MEMS sensor into a desired location in a flow field of blood flowing though a blood vessel. The MEMS sensor may include a heat sensing element disposed on a front-side surface of a substrate, the heat sensing element interfacing the flowing blood and coupled to electrode leads formed on a backside surface of the substrate opposite the front-side surface. The method may include applying an electrical current to the sensing element from a driving circuit coupled to the backside surface. The method may further include measuring a change in heat convection from the sensing element to surrounding blood fluid, by measuring a voltage that needs to be applied across the heat sensing element in order to maintain the sensing element at a substantially constant temperature. The method may further include deriving the shear stress at the desired location from the measured change in heat convection.","An apparatus for measuring shear stress from arterial circulation may include a flexible catheter, and a MEMS sensor attached to the distal end of the flexible catheter. The MEMS sensor may include a heat sensing element disposed on a front-side surface of a substrate and interfacing a flow of blood through a vessel. The heat sensing element may be thermally insulated from the substrate through a cavity etched in the substrate. The heat sensing element may be electrically coupled to a backside surface of the substrate by bond wires.","A driving circuit may be electrically coupled to the backside surface of the substrate and configured to drive the MEMS sensor. The driving circuit may be configured to apply an electric current through the sensing element to resistively heat the sensing element. The driving circuit may be further configured to apply a voltage across the sensing element necessary to maintain the sensing element at a substantially constant temperature. The apparatus may further include a processing system configured to determine from the voltage applied by the driving circuit a change in heat convection from the sensing element to blood surrounding the sensing element, and deriving from the change in heat convection a shear stress of blood flowing through the vessel past the sensing element.","A micromachined sensor for measuring one or more vascular parameters may include a substrate having a front-side surface, and a backside surface opposite the front-side surface. The sensor may include a diaphragm overlying a cavity etched within the substrate. The sensor may include a heat sensing element disposed on the front-side surface of the substrate and on top of the cavity and the diaphragm. The heat sensing element may be electrically couplable to electrode leads formed on the backside surface of the substrate. The sensor may include an electronic system connected to the backside surface and configured to measure a change in heat convection from the sensing element to surrounding fluid when the sensing element is heated by applying an electric current thereto, and further configured to derive the vascular parameters from the measured change in heat convection.","A system and method are disclosed for measuring fluid shear stress with a MEMS shear stress sensor, and for fabricating the MEMS sensor. The MEMS sensor may be backside wire bonded, and may operate based on basic heat transfer principles. The backside wire bonding may insulate the micro-circuitry in the MEMS sensor from the fluid. The MEMS sensor may include an etched cavity that may improve the sensitivity of the sensor by minimizing heat conductance loss from the heat sensing component of the sensor.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","112","114","120","130","110","140","112","110","114","150","100","140","100","100"]},"After an electric current is applied through the sensing element , a change in heat convection from the resistively heated sensing element  to the flowing fluid is measured, from which a value for shear stress is inferred using basic heat transfer equations described in further detail below. The electronic system  may thus be configured to measure a change in heat convection from the sensing element  to the surrounding fluid when the sensing element  is heated by applying an electric current thereto. The electronic system  may thus be further configured to derive from the measured change in heat convection a shear stress of the fluid that interfaces and flows past the sensing element .","Changes in heat convection may be measured by determining the changes in voltage across the sensing element. The changes in voltage may be calibrated to the shear stress, as described further below and illustrated in . Further, these changes in voltage may be calibrated to measurements of vascular parameters other than shear stress, including but not limited to pressure, flow rate, and temperature.","The heat sensing element  may be disposed on the front-side surface  of the substrate , and on top of the cavity  and the diaphragm . A number of electrode leads  may be formed on the backside surface  of the substrate . The heat sensing element  on the front-side surface  may be configured to be electrically coupled by bond wires to the electrode leads  on the backside surface  of the substrate , which in turn is coupled to the electronic micro-circuitry in the electronic system . In this way, the sensor  is backside wire bonded, and only the heat sensing element , but not the micro-circuitry, is exposed to the flowing blood fluid.","In one embodiment, the sensing element  may be a polysilicon strip, uniformly doped with phosphorus, and may have a length of about 80 \u03bcm, a width of about 2 \u03bcm, and a depth of about 0.5 \u03bcm. The resistance of the sensing element  may be adjusted by changing the doping concentration. In one embodiment, the doping may be performed at a concentration of about 10cm, which may result in a sheet resistance of 32 \u03a9\/cm, and a resistance value of 2.5 k\u03a9 at room temperature. In general, the resistance of the sensing element  made of polysilicon doped with phosphorus may range from about 1 k\u03a9 to 5 k\u03a9, which is much higher than the resistances typically found in conventional metal sensors (about 5\u03a9 to about 50\u03a9). This may greatly increase the sensitivity of MEMS sensors.","As seen in , the sensing element  may be disposed on the diaphragm  above the cavity . The cavity  may be a formed by anisotropic wet etching by KOH. The cavity  provides effective thermal isolation between the sensing element  and the substrate , by minimizing the heat conduction from the diaphragm  to the substrate , and thus optimizing unidirectional convective heat transfer from the sensing element  to the flowing fluid. The KOH-etched cavity eliminates the need for additional masks and fabrication steps, which were needed in order to obtain thermal isolation in front-side wire bonded MEMS sensors in which the sensing elements are deposited on a surface micromachining-created vacuum cavity on the front side.","The diaphragm  resulting from the KOH-etched cavity  may improve the sensitivity of the sensor  by directing the convective heat transfer from the phosphorous-doped sensing element  to the biological fluids, and minimizing heat transfer to the silicon substrate  by conductive heat loss. The diaphragm  may be formed by a layer of silicon nitride deposited on the substrate, for example using low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD), then etching the cavity . This may be followed by thermal oxidation, which may create a layer  of silicon oxide, as described in further detail in conjunction with .","The diaphragm  may include a pair of access slits , which may be formed by reactive ion etching (RIE), and which may permit passage of bond wires therethrough so that the heat sensing element  can be connected to the electrode leads  on the backside surface  of the substrate  through the bond wires. The diaphragm  thus enables backside wire bonding for the MEMS sensor , by establishing electric contact between the aluminum metallization on the backside surface  and the sensing element  through the RIE-etched slits . The electrode leads  on the backside surface , which allow bond wires to connect to the phosphorous-doped polysilicon sensing element on the front side surface, may be formed by thermal evaporation of a layer of aluminum .","The MEMS sensor  may be placed at a desired location along the blood vessel, for example near an arterial bifurcation. For this purpose, a flexible catheter (not shown) may be used, for example, and the MEMS sensor  may be attached to a distal end of the flexible catheter. Heart disease, i.e. atherosclerosis, preferentially develops at arterial branching points or bifurcations.  illustrates an exemplary 3-D model of an arterial bifurcation , showing the relation between the inlet branch  and two symmetric outlet branches  and .  illustrates a backside wire bonded MEMS sensor  mounted on an inlet branch of an arterial bifurcation. As illustrated in , backside wire bonding may shield the sensor electronic circuitry (connected to the electrode leads on the backside surface of the sensor) from being exposed to biological fluids.
