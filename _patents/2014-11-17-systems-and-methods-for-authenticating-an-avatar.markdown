title: Systems and methods for authenticating an avatar
abstract: Systems and methods for authenticating an avatar are provided. This system is useful with an avatar having an identifier, virtual environments, and a user who uses the avatar in the virtual environments. Transoms are generated, each with a unique identifier configured to exist in a specific location, and registered with an identity provider. The transom initiates a request. An offer is conveyed that includes the transom identifier, the location and the avatar identifier. The avatar is then authenticated by a shared secret. The identity provider then responds to the offer with avatar identification information, including reputation information. Reputation information is for the avatar and the user, and is compiled from external avatar data sources by using a trust matrix. An avatar gallery is generated by linking each avatar owned by each user to the account and compiling avatar profiles from the account, and the reputation information. The avatar profiles are searchable, and include micro formats.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This is a continuation-in-part of co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 11\/560,743, filed on Nov. 16, 2006, pending, and entitled \u201cSystems And Methods For Managing A Persistent Virtual Avatar With Migrational Ability\u201d, which is hereby fully incorporated by reference.","The present invention relates to a system and method for authenticating an avatar, and more particularly authenticating an avatar with reputation information from a centralized identity provider. Such an authentication system is useful in conjunction with security and identification within Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs), virtual worlds, and online social networks. Currently, at best, identification and reputation within virtual environments is highly fragmented among each individual virtual world. More often, however, there is an utter lack of identification and reputation within the virtual environments. The fact that identity and reputation within virtual worlds is so elusive results in heightened risk when sharing important information, such as in financial transactions.","An avatar is a virtual representation of an individual within a virtual environment. Avatars often include physical characteristics, statistical attributes, inventories, social relations, emotional representations, and weblogs (blogs) or other recorded historical data. Avatars may be human in appearance, but are not limited to any appearance constraints. Avatars may be personifications of a real world individual, such as a Player Character (PC) within a MMOG, or may be an artificial personality, such as a Non-Player Character (NPC). Additional artificial personality type avatars include personal assistants, guides, educators, answering servers and information providers. Additionally, some avatars may have the ability to be automated some of the time, and controlled by a human at other times. Such Quasi-Player Characters (QPCs) may perform mundane tasks automatically, but more expensive human agents take over in cases of complex problems.","Avatars, however, exist in virtual worlds that embrace anonymity. An avatar may appear any way the author of the avatar, or end user, desires. Moreover the name, appearance, and statistics of an avatar may often be changed on a whim. An end user may have several avatars for any virtual environment, and connecting an avatar to its end user is difficult at best.","The number of active subscribers to MMOGs is at least 10 million people. Each person pays $15 and up a month to play these games, and maybe and additional 20 million people login occasionally. Estimates are that players spent about $1 billion in real money in 2005 on virtual goods and services for MMOGs combined. Moreover, at least 1.5 million people subscribe to virtual worlds. In January, 2006, inside one such virtual social world, people spent nearly $5 million in some 4.2 million transactions buying or selling clothes, buildings, and the like. Moreover, participants in web communities number in the multiple tens of millions. Everyday, these participants engage in financial transactions. Additionally, access to certain information, subsets of the virtual world, or services may be restricted to certain participants only. Such activities produce a large risk for the parties involved, much of the risk stemming from identity ambiguities.","Currently, when a party wishes to provide sensitive information, transfer goods or allow access to an avatar embodied end user, local reputation of the avatar, if available, is often the only assurances the party has, since there is currently no way to ascertain end user reputation beyond the limited reputation of each individual avatar's local reputation. End users may improperly use received information, misrepresent themselves to gain access, or breach contract since there is usually no repercussions to the end user because, with a simple change in identity, the wrong deed is no longer traceable to the end user. Thus, it would be advantageous to have a system enabled to compile the end user's reputation, rather than a single avatars reputation, in order to dictate online transactions.","Moreover, such a system of authentication may be utilized to provide highly targeted marketing. By compiling users' preferences, highly refined advertisements may be generated for the end user, however, without knowledge of an avatar's identity, such refined advertisements are ineffectual. This further reinforces the need of a system for authenticating an avatar for identity.","Additionally, due to the fragmented multitudes of virtual worlds, it is also important for such an authentication system to be available across multiple platforms. Effectively, by removing the authentication system from any singular virtual world, and enabling a global system, reputation and identity information may be more accurately compiled. Also, such a system enables secure communications between individuals that are inhibiting separate virtual worlds by verifying identity of the individuals within each virtual environment. Systems for authenticating an avatar's end users' identity and supplying reputation information in this manner do not currently exist.","Additionally, due to the frequency of financial transactions, and the regularity of access inquiries, such authentications are preferably performed rapidly, with a minimal interference to the and user and transacting party. As such, it is desirable to have a system for authenticating an avatar's users' identity and supplying reputation information that is integrated into the virtual environment for rapid and efficient authentication.","It is therefore apparent that an urgent need exists for a system and method for authenticating avatars that integrates the ability to provide reputation information of the avatar's user. This system would be able to provide increased security in online transactions, enable targeted marketing and promote heightened accountability for participants in virtual worlds.","To achieve the foregoing and in accordance with the present invention, systems for vetting and authenticating an avatar, and methods for providing identity and reputation information are provided. Such systems and methods are useful for increasing security in online transactions, enabling targeted marketing and promoting heightened accountability for participants in virtual worlds.","Systems and methods for authenticating an avatar, or virtual entity, for identity are useful in conjunction with a virtual entity, virtual environments, and a second user, a first user and an identity registrar. The end user uses the virtual entity in the virtual environments. Transoms are generated. A first user manages the transom. Each transom has a unique identifier and is registered with an identity provider. The transom initiates a request.","The virtual entity has an identifier. An offer is conveyed that includes the transom identifier, the transom location and the virtual entity identifier. The virtual entity is then is then authenticated by utilizing a shared secret. Authenticating the virtual entity includes determining if the virtual entity has been previously authenticated. If the virtual entity has been previously authenticated, then the virtual entity is re-authenticated. Otherwise, the user is redirected to a user agent, who includes a nonce, and a new account is generated for the user, with the identity provider. Redirection by the user agent is done in-world if the virtual environment supports user agent protocol; otherwise the user is redirected out of world. The user is then logged into the account and the virtual entity is then authenticated.","The Identity Registrar then responds to the offer with vetted virtual entity identification information, which may include reputation information. Reputation information is for the virtual entity and the user.","Vetted virtual entity identity information is compiled for the user and each virtual entity from external virtual entity data sources by using a trust matrix. The trust matrix generates a trust rating for the user by analyzing relationships between the user and the First User through at least one intermediate party.","Additionally, a virtual entity gallery may then be generated by linking each virtual entity owned by each end user to the account and compiling virtual entity profiles from the account, the vetted virtual entity information. The virtual entity profiles are searchable, and include micro formats.","Note that the various features of the present invention described above may be practiced alone or in combination. These and other features of the present invention will be described in more detail below in the detailed description of the invention and in conjunction with the following figures.","The present invention will now be described in detail with reference to several embodiments thereof as illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art, that the present invention may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances, well known process steps and\/or structures have not been described in detail in order to not unnecessarily obscure the present invention. The features and advantages of the present invention may be better understood with reference to the drawings and discussions that follow.","The present invention relates to systems and methods for managing persistent virtual avatars, and more particularly persistent virtual avatars that have the ability to migrate, and have cross-membrane capacity. Such avatars are useful in conjunction with Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs), virtual social worlds and online web communities, generically referred to as \u201cvirtual environments\u201d. All virtual environments may be collectively referred to as the \u201cvirtual universe\u201d. A persistent avatar may be a character, non-player character, quasi-player character, agent, personal assistant, personality, guide, representation, educator or any additional virtual entity that requires persistence between virtual environments. In a society of ever increasing reliance and blending between real life and our virtual lives, the ability to migrate seamlessly between virtual environments with a substantially constant set of attributes is highly desirable and advantageous.","To facilitate discussion,  shows a schematic block diagram  illustrating a persistent avatar management system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. A Wide Area Network (WAN)  provides a medium for all other components to communicate and have access to one another. In some embodiments the WAN  may be the Internet, however any WAN may be used as is known by those skilled in the art. Network connections are made through 10\/100\/1000 Megabit\/sec Ethernet cable, although other network wiring technologies, such as high speed optical cable, may also be used. Additionally, Wireless mesh networks may also be used to couple wired networks, network devices, or access points, as is well known by those skilled in the art.","Virtual Universe  is coupled to the WAN  for access by the Customers . The term Customers  includes users who use the persistent avatar, and owners who own the persistent avatars. In some embodiments the user of a particular avatar may also be the Avatar's owner. Alternatively, the owner and the user may be separate individuals. Moreover, the user and owner may include multiple individuals or organizations, such as a corporation. In some embodiments, some or all of these permutations of user and owner may constitute the Customers . The Virtual Universe  may be accessed by the persistent avatars. Once accessed, the persistent avatar may engage in the Virtual Universe  in at least all capacities that a native avatar is able. Additionally, the persistent avatar may communicate with other virtual environments within the Virtual Universe , or with the real world.","In some embodiments, an Availability Monitor  also may couple to the WAN . The Availability Monitor  may provide constant monitoring of critical services for troubleshooting and downtime reduction purposes. In many cases, the Availability Monitor  may be located in many different geographical locations, so that a \u201ctriangulation\u201d of service availability problems may be preformed.","A Network Operation Center (NOC)  includes at least one Public Server  coupled to an Internal Server  through a Firewall . The Internal Server  may couple to a Local Area Network (LAN) . The Firewall  limits assess by Customers  and unauthorized parties into the LAN . Additionally, communication between the Public Server  and the Internal Server  through the Firewall  may utilize Network Address Translation (NAT) as is well known by those skilled in the art. Public Server , Firewall  and Internal Server  may be separate physical entities. Alternatively, the Public Server , Firewall  and Internal Server  may be housed within a single server. Additionally, Database  is coupled to the LAN . The Database  may include customer account information, persistent avatar attribute data and avatar conversational data for data mining. Due to the vast amount of avatar data within the Database  a data management system for infrequently accessed information may be utilized to increase Database  performance. An Identity Registrar  may be coupled to the LAN . Identity Registrar  may form an integral part of identity authentication. Additional components may be coupled to the LAN  that are not shown. These components may include printers, additional databases, additional servers, telephone networks, fax, routers or other network devices.","The NOC  may be in a single location, however in some embodiments the NOC  may be distributed over multiple locations for increased reliability and efficiency, and reduced vulnerability to NOC  disruption and disaster.","The Public Server  couples the NOC  to the WAN . Additionally, in some embodiments, a Merchant Processing  and Offsite Backup  may independently couple to the Public Server . Alternatively, Merchant Processing  and Offsite Backup  may couple to the Public Server  through the WAN . Due to the variability of viable currencies existing within Virtual Universe  Merchant Processing  allows payment through unconventional means, thus increasing the available Customers  base. Examples of unconventional payments available through Merchant Processing  include, but are not limited to, PayPal, Linden Dollars and Google Checkout.","Offsite Backup  provides for operational data to be store in a safe means. In some embodiments, Offsite Backup  may include a third party. Offsite Backup  may include, but is not limited to disk images for each kind of server configuration, source code repositories, customized third-party software on intranet, database contents, email archives and server logs. A server state (web sites, customer services, etc.) may be recovered from Offsite Backup . Offsite Backup  acts as an insurance against disaster or other NOC  disruptions.","In some embodiments, the NOC  may access multiple WAN Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), , through , that may be coupled to the WAN . The WAN APIs , to functionalities may then be integrated into the persistent avatars capabilities.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1"],"b":["170","170","171","172","173","174","175","170","170","170","170","170","170","130","130","170","170","170","170","211"],"i":["a ","a ","a","b ","r ","a","b ","r ","a","b ","r ","a ","b.

The first method is to manually input data, either by typing or using a Graphical User Interface (GUI). This is tedious, but precise, and generally looks quite good. The second method is to use 3D scanning technology to enter data which is fast, precise, looks good, but is often quite expensive since it requires a 3D scanner. The third method is the use of algorithms which generate models from pre-existing formula, position sets, or other data that dictates the position of the geometry, then doing some variable on that, or even creating it from the ground up. This method, once built, is extremely fast, precise, and inexpensive, but may result in distribution of potential errors.

This provides nine templates from which to work from. The nine base templates may be edited so that any small adjustments are made to ensure a high quality model of nearly-perfect appearance. The model may be custom-tailored to specific desires of facial or body features. The user may engage in an editing process with one of the nine templates which, when completed, creates a model that very closely approximates the user's desired appearance.","In some embodiments, an alternate production path may be desired. Many gamers and developers will have already built models of Avatars to that they enjoy, and it is desirous to allow them to use these as they may have an Avatar that looks as they want it to.
