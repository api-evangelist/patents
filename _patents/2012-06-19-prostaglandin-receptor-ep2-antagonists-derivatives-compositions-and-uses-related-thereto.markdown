The government has certain rights in the invention.","Status epilepticus is a condition in which the brain is in a state of persistent seizure. There is evidence that 30-60 minutes of persistent seizure is sufficient to damage neurons and that such a seizure is unlikely to self-terminate. Status epilepticus survivors may die soon after or have severe functional impairments accompanied by neuroinflammation. Longer seizure duration, cerebral insult, and refractory convulsive status epilepticus were strongly associated with poor outcomes suggesting a role for early neuroprotective strategies. See Legriel et al., Critical Care Medicine, 2010, 38 (12):2295-2303. Thus, there is a need to identify improved methods for treating or preventing patients recovering from prolonged seizures.","Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), the inducible isoform of COX, is rapidly upregulated in damaged tissue, for example in the central nervous system (CNS) after a seizure or cerebral ischemia. In the CNS, COX-2 induction overall contributes to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration by producing prostaglandins. In the periphery COX-2 induction has both beneficial and harmful consequences. Pharmacological inhibition of COX can provide relief from the symptoms of inflammation and pain. Current non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen, exert their therapeutic effects via nonselectively inhibiting COX. However, multiple downstream COX-2 signaling pathways that promote and oppose tissue injury are complex, which suggests that modulation of a specific prostaglandin receptor could be a superior therapeutic strategy compared with blocking the entire COX-2 cascade.","Prostaglandin E(PGE), a dominant enzymatic product of COX-2 in CNS, can activate four G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs): EP1, EP2, EP3 and EP4. When activated by PGE, EP2 stimulates adenylate cyclase (AC) resulting in elevation of cytoplasmic cyclic AMP (cAMP) concentration, which triggers multiple downstream events mediated by protein kinase A (PKA) and exchange protein activated by cAMP (Epac).","In periphery, PGE2\/EP2 signaling plays a variety of roles. For example, PGEis a major mediator of inflammation and pain. PGEis observed as one of the major prostanoid species in inflammatory lesions such as arthritic joints and shows pleiotropic proinflammatory actions in vitro. Direct delivery of PGEinto tissues can elicit inflammation and ablation of microsomal PGE synthase or EP2 showed reduced arthritic responses in collagen-induced arthritis. Therefore, the beneficial effect of NSAIDs could be at least partially if not fully, caused by their inhibition of PGEproduction, and the PGE2\/EP2 signaling pathway might induce inflammation actions observed in chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In addition, PGE\/EP2 signaling regulates UV-induced acute skin inflammation by increasing skin microenviromental blood flow, and EP2 activation by oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (OxPAPC) might contribute to vascular inflammation. PGEsignaling through EP2\/EP4 exacerbates symptoms of inflammation by increasing IL-23 expression and reducing IL-12\/IL-27, which together causes T-cells to differentiate to Th17 effectors both in inflammatory bowel disease (colitis) and arthritis. PGE\/EP2 system up-regulates a variety of inflammatory mediators including chemokines, cytokines, nitric oxide, prostaglandins, etc., to develop and maintain the inflammatory response.","In the brain, based on the phenotype of EP2 knockout mice, it appears that EP2 activation in microglia promotes inflammation and neurotoxicity in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Genetic ablation of EP2 receptor reduced oxidative stress and improved cell survival, accompanied by substantial down-regulation of enzymes in glia that produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), COX-2, and NAPDH oxidase. EP2 receptor activation by PGEupregulates iNOS\/NO expression in activated astrocytes by potentiating the response to inflammatory cytokines like TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3.","Because PGE2\/EP2 signaling mediates both peripheral and neural inflammation, pharmacological targeting this pathway can have beneficial implications for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Thus, there is a need to identify agents that can inhibit PGE\/EP2 signaling.","Buchmann et al., (WO\/2008\/152099) report compositions for the treatment of disorders connected with the EP2 receptor. See also WO2010\/012396.","It has been discovered that certain compounds antagonize EP2 signaling.

It is not intended that time of the seizure be of any specific duration, but typically 30-60 minutes is sufficient to damage neurons and that seizures are unlikely to self-terminate by that time. The mortality rate of status epilepticus is high, especially if treatment is not initiated soon after. Examples of why one may experience such a seizure include because they have epilepsy and have stopped taking anticonvulsant medication, a stroke, hemorrhage, or as a result of intoxicants, adverse reactions to drugs, consumption of alcoholic beverages, fasting, trauma to the brain, brain disorders such as, but not limited to, meningitis, encephalitis, brain tumors, abscess.

Taking COX-2 inhibitor drugs regularly may reduce the rates of certain cancers and cancer related deaths. Upregulation of COX-2 in tumor tissues has been reported to be accompanied by high levels of PGE. Moreover, EP2 activation by PGE can promote cancer cell growth and invasion by activating iNOS\/guanylate cyclase (GC) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-ERK1\/2 via PKA-mediated epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor activation. PGE\/EP2 signaling in mammary epithelial cells triggers hyperplasia of mammary glands and EP2 receptor is an important element for PGE2 regulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induction in mouse mammary tumor cells. EP2 signaling directly regulates tumor angiogenesis in endothelium by enhancing endothelial cell motility and cell survival, mediates epidermal hypertrophy and tumor aggression in response to ultraviolet (UV)-irradiation, and induces skin carcinogenesis.","Thus, within certain embodiments, it is contemplated that compounds disclosed herein may be used for the treatment of cancers and tumors of the nervous system including those subjects diagnosed with cancer, including, skin, blood vessel, lung, head and neck, prostate and colon, ovary and breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma.","Within certain embodiments, it is contemplated that compounds disclosed herein may be used for the treatment of inflammation generally and autoimmune diseases, such as, but not limited to, encephalomyelitis, leukoencephalitis, Addison's disease, agammaglobulinemia, alopecia areata, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; ankylosing spondylitis, anti-GBM\/TBM nephritis, antiphospholipid syndrome, antisynthetase syndrome, atopic allergy, atopic dermatitis, aplastic anemia, cardiomyopathy, enteropathy, hemolytic anemia, hepatitis, inner ear disease, lymphoproliferative syndrome, peripheral neuropathy, pancreatitis, polyendocrine syndrome, progesterone dermatitis, thrombocytopenic purpura, urticaria, uveitis, Balo disease\/Balo, concentric sclerosis, Bechets syndrome, Berger's disease, Bickerstaff's encephalitis, Blau syndrome, Bullous pemphigoid, Castleman's disease, celiac disease, inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, multifocal osteomyelitis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, cicatricial pemphigoid, Cogan syndrome, cold agglutinin disease, complement component 2 deficiency, cranial arteritis","CREST syndrome, Crohns Disease, Cushing's Syndrome, cutaneous leukocytoclastic angiitis, Dego's disease, Dercum's disease Suspected, dermatitis herpetiformis, dermatomyositis, diabetes mellitus type 1, diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis, Dressler's syndrome, Discoid lupus, erythematosus, eczema, enthesitis-related arthritis, eosinophilic fasciitis, eosinophilic, gastroenteritis, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, erythema nodosum, cryoglobulinemia, Evan's syndrome, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressive, fibrosing aveolitis, gastritis, gastrointestinal pemphigoid, giant cell arteritis, glomerulonephritis, Goodpasture's syndrome, Graves' disease, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), Hashimoto's encephalitis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, haemolytic anaemia, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, herpes gestationis, hypogammaglobulinemia, demyelinating diseases, pulmonary fibrosis, thrombocytopenic purpura, nephropathy, inclusion body myositis, demyelinating polyneuopathy, interstitial cystitis, Kawasaki's Disease, Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, lichen planus, lichen sclerosus, linear IgA disease (LAD), lupoid hepatitis, lupus erythematosus, Majeed syndrome, Meniere's disease, microscopic polyangiitis, Miller-Fisher syndrome, mixed connective tissue disease, morphea, Mucha-Habermann disease, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, myositis, meuromyelitis optica, neuromyotonia, occular cicatricial pemphigoid, psoclonus myoclonus syndrome, ord thyroiditis, palindromic rheumatism, PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcus), paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), Parry Romberg syndrome, Parsonnage-Turner syndrome, Pars planitis, pemphigus pernicious anaemia, perivenous encephalomyelitis, POEMS syndrome, polyarteritis nodosa, polymyalgia rheumatic, polymyositis, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, progressive inflammatory neuropathy, psoriasis Accepted, psoriatic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, pure red cell aplasia, Rasmussen's encephalitis, Raynaud phenomenon, relapsing polychondritis, Reiter's syndrome, Restless leg syndrome, retroperitoneal fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatoid fever, sarcoidosis, Schmidt syndrome, Schnitzler syndrome, scleritis, scleroderma, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, spondyloarthropathy, Still's disease, stiff person syndrome, subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE), Susac's syndrome, Sweet's syndrome, sydenham chorea, sympathetic ophthalmia, Takayasu's arteritis, temporal arteritis, Tolosa-Hunt syndrome, transverse myelitis, ulcerative colitis, undifferentiated connective tissue disease, undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy, vasculitis, vitiligo, and Wegener's granulomatosis.\n\nFormulations\n","Pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein may be in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts, as generally described below.

Suitable anionic surfactants include, but are not limited to, those containing carboxylate, sulfonate and sulfate ions. Examples of anionic surfactants include sodium, potassium, ammonium of long chain alkyl sulfonates and alkyl aryl sulfonates such as sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate; dialkyl sodium sulfosuccinates, such as sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate; dialkyl sodium sulfosuccinates, such as sodium bis-(2-ethylthioxyl)-sulfosuccinate; and alkyl sulfates such as sodium lauryl sulfate. Cationic surfactants include, but are not limited to, quaternary ammonium compounds such as benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, cetrimonium bromide, stearyl dimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride, polyoxyethylene and coconut amine. Examples of nonionic surfactants include ethylene glycol monostearate, propylene glycol myristate, glyceryl monostearate, glyceryl stearate, polyglyceryl-4-oleate, sorbitan acylate, sucrose acylate, PEG-150 laurate, PEG-400 monolaurate, polyoxyethylene monolaurate, polysorbates, polyoxyethylene octylphenylether, PEG-1000 cetyl ether, polyoxyethylene tridecyl ether, polypropylene glycol butyl ether, Poloxamer\u00ae 401, stearoyl monoisopropanolamide, and polyoxyethylene hydrogenated tallow amide.

For oral use, the pharmaceutical formulation will generally contain from about 5 to about 100% by weight of the active material. For other uses, the pharmaceutical formulation will generally have from about 0.5 to about 50 wt. % of the active material.","The compositions described herein can be formulation for modified or controlled release. Examples of controlled release dosage forms include extended release dosage forms, delayed release dosage forms, pulsatile release dosage forms, and combinations thereof.","The extended release formulations are generally prepared as diffusion or osmotic systems, for example, as described in \u201cRemington\u2014The science and practice of pharmacy\u201d (20th ed., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore, Md., 2000). A diffusion system typically consists of two types of devices, a reservoir and a matrix, and is well known and described in the art. The matrix devices are generally prepared by compressing the drug with a slowly dissolving polymer carrier into a tablet form. The three major types of materials used in the preparation of matrix devices are insoluble plastics, hydrophilic polymers, and fatty compounds. Plastic matrices include, but are not limited to, methyl acrylate-methyl methacrylate, polyvinyl chloride, and polyethylene. Hydrophilic polymers include, but are not limited to, cellulosic polymers such as methyl and ethyl cellulose, hydroxyalkylcelluloses such as hydroxypropyl-cellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and Carbopol\u00ae 934, polyethylene oxides and mixtures thereof. Fatty compounds include, but are not limited to, various waxes such as carnauba wax and glyceryl tristearate and wax-type substances including hydrogenated castor oil or hydrogenated vegetable oil, or mixtures thereof.","In certain preferred embodiments, the plastic material is a pharmaceutically acceptable acrylic polymer, including but not limited to, acrylic acid and methacrylic acid copolymers, methyl methacrylate, methyl methacrylate copolymers, ethoxyethyl methacrylates, cyanoethyl methacrylate, aminoalkyl methacrylate copolymer, poly(acrylic acid), poly(methacrylic acid), methacrylic acid alkylamine copolymer poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(methacrylic acid) (anhydride), polymethacrylate, polyacrylamide, poly(methacrylic acid anhydride), and glycidyl methacrylate copolymers.","In certain preferred embodiments, the acrylic polymer is comprised of one or more ammonio methacrylate copolymers. Ammonio methacrylate copolymers are well known in the art, and are described in NF XVII as fully polymerized copolymers of acrylic and methacrylic acid esters with a low content of quaternary ammonium groups.","In one preferred embodiment, the acrylic polymer is an acrylic resin lacquer such as that which is commercially available from Rohm Pharma under the tradename Eudragit\u00ae. In further preferred embodiments, the acrylic polymer comprises a mixture of two acrylic resin lacquers commercially available from Rohm Pharma under the tradenames Eudragit\u00ae RL30D and Eudragit\u00ae RS30D, respectively. Eudragit\u00ae RL30D and Eudragit\u00ae RS30D are copolymers of acrylic and methacrylic esters with a low content of quaternary ammonium groups, the molar ratio of ammonium groups to the remaining neutral (meth)acrylic esters being 1:20 in Eudragit\u00ae RL30D and 1:40 in Eudragit\u00ae RS30D. The mean molecular weight is about 150,000. Edragit\u00ae S-100 and Eudragit\u00ae L-100 are also preferred. The code designations RL (high permeability) and RS (low permeability) refer to the permeability properties of these agents. Eudragit\u00ae RL\/RS mixtures are insoluble in water and in digestive fluids. However, multiparticulate systems formed to include the same are swellable and permeable in aqueous solutions and digestive fluids.","The polymers described above such as Eudragit\u00ae RL\/RS may be mixed together in any desired ratio in order to ultimately obtain a sustained-release formulation having a desirable dissolution profile. Desirable sustained-release multiparticulate systems may be obtained, for instance, from 100% Eudragit\u00ae RL, 50% Eudragit\u00ae RL and 50% Eudragit\u00ae RS, and 10% Eudragit\u00ae RL and 90% Eudragit\u00ae RS. One skilled in the art will recognize that other acrylic polymers may also be used, such as, for example, Eudragit\u00ae L.","Alternatively, extended release formulations can be prepared using osmotic systems or by applying a semi-permeable coating to the dosage form. In the latter case, the desired drug release profile can be achieved by combining low permeable and high permeable coating materials in suitable proportion.","The devices with different drug release mechanisms described above can be combined in a final dosage form comprising single or multiple units. Examples of multiple units include, but are not limited to, multilayer tablets and capsules containing tablets, beads, or granules. An immediate release portion can be added to the extended release system by means of either applying an immediate release layer on top of the extended release core using a coating or compression process or in a multiple unit system such as a capsule containing extended and immediate release beads.","Extended release tablets containing hydrophilic polymers are prepared by techniques commonly known in the art such as direct compression, wet granulation, or dry granulation. Their formulations usually incorporate polymers, diluents, binders, and lubricants as well as the active pharmaceutical ingredient. The usual diluents include inert powdered substances such as starches, powdered cellulose, especially crystalline and microcrystalline cellulose, sugars such as fructose, mannitol and sucrose, grain flours and similar edible powders. Typical diluents include, for example, various types of starch, lactose, mannitol, kaolin, calcium phosphate or sulfate, inorganic salts such as sodium chloride and powdered sugar. Powdered cellulose derivatives are also useful. Typical tablet binders include substances such as starch, gelatin and sugars such as lactose, fructose, and glucose. Natural and synthetic gums, including acacia, alginates, methylcellulose, and polyvinylpyrrolidone can also be used. Polyethylene glycol, hydrophilic polymers, ethylcellulose and waxes can also serve as binders. A lubricant is necessary in a tablet formulation to prevent the tablet and punches from sticking in the die. The lubricant is chosen from such slippery solids as talc, magnesium and calcium stearate, stearic acid and hydrogenated vegetable oils.","Extended release tablets containing wax materials are generally prepared using methods known in the art such as a direct blend method, a congealing method, and an aqueous dispersion method. In the congealing method, the drug is mixed with a wax material and either spray-congealed or congealed and screened and processed.","Delayed release formulations are created by coating a solid dosage form with a polymer film, which is insoluble in the acidic environment of the stomach, and soluble in the neutral environment of the small intestine.","The delayed release dosage units can be prepared, for example, by coating a drug or a drug-containing composition with a selected coating material. The drug-containing composition may be, e.g., a tablet for incorporation into a capsule, a tablet for use as an inner core in a \u201ccoated core\u201d dosage form, or a plurality of drug-containing beads, particles or granules, for incorporation into either a tablet or capsule. Preferred coating materials include bioerodible, gradually hydrolyzable, gradually water-soluble, and\/or enzymatically degradable polymers, and may be conventional \u201centeric\u201d polymers. Enteric polymers, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, become soluble in the higher pH environment of the lower gastrointestinal tract or slowly erode as the dosage form passes through the gastrointestinal tract, while enzymatically degradable polymers are degraded by bacterial enzymes present in the lower gastrointestinal tract, particularly in the colon. Suitable coating materials for effecting delayed release include, but are not limited to, cellulosic polymers such as hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxymethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose acetate succinate, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate, methylcellulose, ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate phthalate, cellulose acetate trimellitate and carboxymethylcellulose sodium; acrylic acid polymers and copolymers, preferably formed from acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate and\/or ethyl methacrylate, and other methacrylic resins that are commercially available under the tradename Eudragit\u00ae (Rohm Pharma; Westerstadt, Germany), including Eudragit\u00ae L30D-55 and L100-55 (soluble at pH 5.5 and above), Eudragit\u00ae L-100 (soluble at pH 6.0 and above), Eudragit\u00ae S (soluble at pH 7.0 and above, as a result of a higher degree of esterification), and Eudragits\u00ae NE, RL and RS (water-insoluble polymers having different degrees of permeability and expandability); vinyl polymers and copolymers such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone, vinyl acetate, vinylacetate phthalate, vinylacetate crotonic acid copolymer, and ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer; enzymatically degradable polymers such as azo polymers, pectin, chitosan, amylose and guar gum; zein and shellac. Combinations of different coating materials may also be used. Multi-layer coatings using different polymers may also be applied.","The preferred coating weights for particular coating materials may be readily determined by those skilled in the art by evaluating individual release profiles for tablets, beads and granules prepared with different quantities of various coating materials. It is the combination of materials, method and form of application that produce the desired release characteristics, which one can determine only from the clinical studies.","The coating composition may include conventional additives, such as plasticizers, pigments, colorants, stabilizing agents, glidants, etc. A plasticizer is normally present to reduce the fragility of the coating, and will generally represent about 10 wt. % to 50 wt. % relative to the dry weight of the polymer. Examples of typical plasticizers include polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, triacetin, dimethyl phthalate, diethyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, dibutyl sebacate, triethyl citrate, tributyl citrate, triethyl acetyl citrate, castor oil and acetylated monoglycerides. A stabilizing agent is preferably used to stabilize particles in the dispersion. Typical stabilizing agents are nonionic emulsifiers such as sorbitan esters, polysorbates and polyvinylpyrrolidone. Glidants are recommended to reduce sticking effects during film formation and drying, and will generally represent approximately 25 wt. % to 100 wt. % of the polymer weight in the coating solution. One effective glidant is talc. Other glidants such as magnesium stearate and glycerol monostearates may also be used. Pigments such as titanium dioxide may also be used. Small quantities of an anti-foaming agent, such as a silicone (e.g., simethicone), may also be added to the coating composition.","The formulation can provide pulsatile delivery of the one or more inhibitors. By \u201cpulsatile\u201d is meant that a plurality of drug doses are released at spaced apart intervals of time. Generally, upon ingestion of the dosage form, release of the initial dose is substantially immediate, i.e., the first drug release \u201cpulse\u201d occurs within about one hour of ingestion. This initial pulse is followed by a first time interval (lag time) during which very little or no drug is released from the dosage form, after which a second dose is then released. Similarly, a second nearly drug release-free interval between the second and third drug release pulses may be designed. The duration of the nearly drug release-free time interval will vary depending upon the dosage form design e.g., a twice daily dosing profile, a three times daily dosing profile, etc. For dosage forms providing a twice daily dosage profile, the nearly drug release-free interval has a duration of approximately 3 hours to 14 hours between the first and second dose. For dosage forms providing a three times daily profile, the nearly drug release-free interval has a duration of approximately 2 hours to 8 hours between each of the three doses.","In one embodiment, the pulsatile release profile is achieved with dosage forms that are closed and preferably sealed capsules housing at least two drug-containing \u201cdosage units\u201d wherein each dosage unit within the capsule provides a different drug release profile. Control of the delayed release dosage unit(s) is accomplished by a controlled release polymer coating on the dosage unit, or by incorporation of the active agent in a controlled release polymer matrix. Each dosage unit may comprise a compressed or molded tablet, wherein each tablet within the capsule provides a different drug release profile. For dosage forms mimicking a twice a day dosing profile, a first tablet releases drug substantially immediately following ingestion of the dosage form, while a second tablet releases drug approximately 3 hours to less than 14 hours following ingestion of the dosage form. For dosage forms mimicking a three times daily dosing profile, a first tablet releases drug substantially immediately following ingestion of the dosage form, a second tablet releases drug approximately 3 hours to less than 10 hours following ingestion of the dosage form, and the third tablet releases drug at least 5 hours to approximately 18 hours following ingestion of the dosage form. It is possible that the dosage form includes more than three tablets. While the dosage form will not generally include more than a third tablet, dosage forms housing more than three tablets can be utilized.","Alternatively, each dosage unit in the capsule may comprise a plurality of drug-containing beads, granules or particles. As is known in the art, drug-containing \u201cbeads\u201d refer to beads made with drug and one or more excipients or polymers. Drug-containing beads can be produced by applying drug to an inert support, e.g., inert sugar beads coated with drug or by creating a \u201ccore\u201d comprising both drug and one or more excipients. As is also known, drug-containing \u201cgranules\u201d and \u201cparticles\u201d comprise drug particles that may or may not include one or more additional excipients or polymers. In contrast to drug-containing beads, granules and particles do not contain an inert support. Granules generally comprise drug particles and require further processing. Generally, particles are smaller than granules, and are not further processed. Although beads, granules and particles may be formulated to provide immediate release, beads and granules are generally employed to provide delayed release.","In one embodiment, the compound is formulated for topical administration. Suitable topical dosage forms include lotions, creams, ointments, and gels. A \u201cgel\u201d is a semisolid system containing a dispersion of the active agent, i.e., inhibitor, in a liquid vehicle that is rendered semisolid by the action of a thickening agent or polymeric material dissolved or suspended in the liquid vehicle. The liquid may include a lipophilic component, an aqueous component or both. Some emulsions may be gels or otherwise include a gel component. Some gels, however, are not emulsions because they do not contain a homogenized blend of immiscible components. Methods for preparing lotions, creams, ointments, and gels are well known in the art.","The compounds described herein can be administered adjunctively with other active compounds. These compounds include but are not limited to analgesics, anti-inflammatory drugs, antipyretics, antidepressants, antiepileptics, antihistamines, antimigraine drugs, antimuscarinics, anxioltyics, sedatives, hypnotics, antipsychotics, bronchodilators, anti-asthma drugs, cardiovascular drugs, corticosteroids, dopaminergics, electrolytes, gastro-intestinal drugs, muscle relaxants, nutritional agents, vitamins, parasympathomimetics, stimulants, anorectics and anti-narcoleptics. \u201cAdjunctive administration\u201d, as used herein, means the inhibitors can be administered in the same dosage form or in separate dosage forms with one or more other active agents.","Specific examples of compounds that can be adjunctively administered with the compounds include, but are not limited to, aceclofenac, acetaminophen, adomexetine, almotriptan, alprazolam, amantadine, amcinonide, aminocyclopropane, am itriptyline, amolodipine, amoxapine, amphetamine, aripiprazole, aspirin, atomoxetine, azasetron, azatadine, beclomethasone, benactyzine, benoxaprofen, bermoprofen, betamethasone, bicifadine, bromocriptine, budesonide, buprenorphine, bupropion, buspirone, butorphanol, butriptyline, caffeine, carbamazepine, carbidopa, carisoprodol, celecoxib, chlordiazepoxide, chlorpromazine, choline salicylate, citalopram, clomipramine, clonazepam, clonidine, clonitazene, clorazepate, clotiazepam, cloxazolam, clozapine, codeine, corticosterone, cortisone, cyclobenzaprine, cyproheptadine, demexiptiline, desipramine, desomorphine, dexamethasone, dexanabinol, dextroamphetamine sulfate, dextromoramide, dextropropoxyphene, dezocine, diazepam, dibenzepin, diclofenac sodium, diflunisal, dihydrocodeine, dihydroergotamine, dihydromorphine, dimetacrine, divalproxex, dizatriptan, dolasetron, donepezil, dothiepin, doxepin, duloxetine, ergotamine, escitalopram, estazolam, ethosuximide, etodolac, femoxetine, fenamates, fenoprofen, fentanyl, fludiazepam, fluoxetine, fluphenazine, flurazepam, flurbiprofen, flutazolam, fluvoxamine, frovatriptan, gabapentin, galantamine, gepirone, ginko bilboa, granisetron, haloperidol, huperzine A, hydrocodone, hydrocortisone, hydromorphone, hydroxyzine, ibuprofen, imipramine, indiplon, indomethacin, indoprofen, iprindole, ipsapirone, ketaserin, ketoprofen, ketorolac, lesopitron, levodopa, lipase, lofepramine, lorazepam, loxapine, maprotiline, mazindol, mefenamic acid, melatonin, melitracen, memantine, meperidine, meprobamate, mesalamine, metapramine, metaxalone, methadone, methadone, methamphetamine, methocarbamol, methyldopa, methylphenidate, methylsalicylate, methysergid(e), metoclopramide, mianserin, mifepristone, milnacipran, minaprine, mirtazapine, moclobemide, modafinil (an anti-narcoleptic), molindone, morphine, morphine hydrochloride, nabumetone, nadolol, naproxen, naratriptan, nefazodone, neurontin, nomifensine, nortriptyline, olanzapine, olsalazine, ondansetron, opipramol, orphenadrine, oxaflozane, oxaprazin, oxazepam, oxitriptan, oxycodone, oxymorphone, pancrelipase, parecoxib, paroxetine, pemoline, pentazocine, pepsin, perphenazine, phenacetin, phendimetrazine, phenmetrazine, phenylbutazone, phenyloin, phosphatidylserine, pimozide, pirlindole, piroxicam, pizotifen, pizotyline, pramipexole, prednisolone, prednisone, pregabalin, propanolol, propizepine, propoxyphene, protriptyline, quazepam, quinupramine, reboxitine, reserpine, risperidone, ritanserin, rivastigmine, rizatriptan, rofecoxib, ropinirole, rotigotine, salsalate, sertraline, sibutramine, sildenafil, sulfasalazine, sulindac, sumatriptan, tacrine, temazepam, tetrabenozine, thiazides, thioridazine, thiothixene, tiapride, tiasipirone, tizanidine, tofenacin, tolmetin, toloxatone, topiramate, tramadol, trazodone, triazolam, trifluoperazine, trimethobenzamide, trimipramine, tropisetron, valdecoxib, valproic acid, venlafaxine, viloxazine, vitamin E, zimeldine, ziprasidone, zolmitriptan, zolpidem, zopiclone and isomers, salts, and combinations thereof.","The additional active agent(s) can be formulated for immediate release, controlled release, or combinations thereof.","As used herein, \u201calkyl\u201d means a noncyclic straight chain or branched, unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon such as those containing from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, typically 1 to 6 carbon atoms.

In preferred embodiment the salts are conventional nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable salts including the quaternary ammonium salts of the parent compound formed, and non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. Preferred salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric, nitric and the like; and the salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, pamoic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicylic, sulfanilic, 2-acetoxybenzoic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, isethionic, and the like.","\u201cSubject\u201d refers any animal, preferably a human patient, livestock, or domestic pet.","The term \u201cprodrug\u201d refers to an agent that is converted into a biologically active form in vivo. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to administer than the parent compound. They may, for instance, be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent compound is not. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. A prodrug may be converted into the parent drug by various mechanisms, including enzymatic processes and metabolic hydrolysis.","As used herein, the terms \u201cprevent\u201d and \u201cpreventing\u201d include the prevention of the recurrence, spread or onset. It is not intended that the present disclosure be limited to complete prevention.

Typically an indole or substituted indole derivative was treated with 2-bromoacetonitrile in the presence of sodium hydride base. The resulting nitrile intermediates were reduced to amine using lithium aluminium hydride. These amines were coupled either to 3-aryl substituted acrylic acids in the presence of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochlroide (EDCI), dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) in dichloromethane or coupled to 3-aryl substituted acrylyl chlorides in the presence of bases such triethylamine and potassium or sodium carbonates to furnish final products in good to excellent yields.

In the equation, dose ratio (dr)=fold shift in EC, X=[antagonist], K=equilibrium dissociation constant for the antagonist-receptor complex. A linear regression of log(dr\u22121) on log Xwith a slope of unity characterizes a competitive antagonism and the Kvalue indicates the antagonist concentration required for 2-fold rightward shift in the dose-response curve. Thus, a lower Kvalue indicates a higher inhibitory potency.","To perform the Schild regression, C6G-EP2 cells were incubated first with vehicle, 0.01, 0.1 or 1 \u03bcM of test compound for 5 minutes, then with increasing concentrations of PGE, to activate the EP2 receptor. Hit compounds A1 and A2, and analog compound 1v induced a concentration-dependent rightward shift in the PGEdose-response curve. The Schild regression analyses demonstrated that certain test compounds displayed a competitive antagonism in PGE-induced EP2 activation with Ks: 2.4, 4.6, 1.8 nM and slopes: 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 for A1, A2, 1v, respectively. Analog compound 1v showed an improved potency in EP2 receptor inhibition and only 1.8 nM 1v is required to yield 2-fold rightward shift in the PGEdose-response curve in C6G-EP2 cells.

A fluorine attached to the methylindol ring (1f and 1g) did not significantly affect the compound potency. If a methoxy was replaced by ethoxy (1p), the inhibition was not significantly affected. However, if the methoxy was replaced by an isobutyl (10, the inhibition was reduced, compared to 1m. Interestingly, if the methoxy was replaced by fluorine, the potency from difluorophenyl (1r and 1s) is higher than that from trifluorophenyl (1t and 1u). In addition, replacement of methoxy by other halogens such as bromine in 1v, or chlorine in 1w and 1x, also increased the compound potency. Compounds with methylindol or fluoro-methylindol ring, ethyl linker, acrylamide, and methoxyphenyl or halogenphenyl displayed robust potency in EP2 inhibition.","DP1 Assay","Both DP1 and EP2 receptors are positively coupled through Gas to cAMP production and conduct very similar physiological and pathological events. Among the eight canonical prostanoid receptors, DP1 has similarities to EP2 at both protein and DNA level. C6G cells that stably expressing human DP1 receptors were seeded into 384-well plates in 30 \u03bcL complete medium (4,000 cells per well) and grown overnight. The medium was thoroughly withdrawn and 10 \u03bcL HBSS (HyClone) plus 20 \u03bcM rolipram were added into the wells to block phosphodiesterase. The cells were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and then treated with vehicle or test compound for 5 min before addition of increasing concentrations of DP1 selective agonist-BW245C for 40 min. The cells were lysed in 10 \u03bcL lysis buffer containing the FRET acceptor cAMP-d2 and 1 min later another 10 \u03bcL lysis buffer with anti-cAMP-Cryptate was added. After 60-90 min incubation at room temperature, the TR-FRET signal was detected by an Envision 2103 Multilabel Plate Reader (PerkinElmer) with a laser excitation at 337 nm and dual emissions at 665 nm and 590 nm for d2 and Cryptate, respectively.

progression and tumor-associated angiogenesis. Western blot analysis revealed that prostate cancer cell lines DU145, LNCap, and PC3, express a low basal level of COX-2, but substantial amount of EP2. Compound A1 showed a competitive inhibition of butaprost-induced EP2 receptor activation in a concentration dependent manner in PC3 cells. Butaprost-induced EP2 activation promoted PC3 cell growth, measured by MTT cell proliferation assay, in concentration-dependent manner with a maximal response being obtained at 1 \u03bcM. Moreover, the butaprost-induced cell growth was attenuated by pretreatment with compound A1 also in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, EP2 activation by 1 \u03bcM butaprost in PC3 cells promoted cell invasion, measured by counting cells that moved across a filter coated with Matrigel. Again, cotreatment with compound A1 (1 \u03bcM) also inhibited the EP2 activation-induced cell invasion.","Certain Compounds are Neuroprotective","Excitotoxicity caused by NMDA receptor activation is recognized to induce neuronal apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo in cortical neurons. NMDA receptor activation can, via COX-2, cause prostaglandin production, including PGE. Activation of the EP2 receptor by PGEin microglia can promote neuroinflammation in several models of neurodegenerative diseases. The effect of EP2 antagonist compounds were examined on NMDA-induced excitotoxicity. Rat primary hippocampal cultures (DIV 13-15) were preincubated with vehicle or increasing concentrations of test compound for 15-20 min, followed by treatment with NMDA (30 \u03bcM) plus glycine (10 \u03bcM) overnight in continued presence of the test compound. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release was used as the measure of neuronal injury. NMDA treatment induced a significant increase of LDH release in the rat hippocampal cultures, which was attenuated in a concentration-dependent manner by preincubation with these EP2 antagonist compounds. The NMDA-induced LDH release was reduced to 94.0, 87.8, 73.9, and 50.8% by 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 \u03bcM compound A1, respectively.","In addition, compounds A2, 1f, 1h, 1v, 1w and B1 were selected for this in vitro neuroprotection because of their low Ks, high therapeutic and selectivity indexes, or desirable pharmacokinetics (PK) profile. The NMDA-induced LDH release was also reduced to 77.8, 38.5, 72.0, 49.9, 78.4, and 84.7% by compounds A2, 1f, 1h, 1v, 1w, and B1 at 10 \u03bcM, respectively. Consistently, the EP2-inactive analog 1e did not show any effect on NMDA-induced LDH release. Interestingly, compound A1 ECfor the reduction of NMDA-induced LDH release was 0.80 \u03bcM, so about 450-fold rightward shift in the PGEconcentration-response curve was required to yield half-maximal neuroprotection by the EP2 inhibition.","Microglia are the initial and major mediators of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in various models of neurological disorders. EP2 receptor has been reported to regulate microglial activation and subsequent neurotoxicity in several animal models. The effects of EP2 activation in microglia were investigated. Rat microglia-enriched cultures were incubated with vehicle, butaprost, or compound A 1 overnight. The cellular viability was evaluated by measuring Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Butaprost (10 \u03bcM) significantly increased LDH release to 138% in rat microglia-enriched cultures. On the contrary, EP2 antagonist compound A1 (10 \u03bcM) had no significant effect on basal LDH release in rat microglia-enriched cultures.","Certain Compounds Block EP2-Regulated Inflammation in Microglia","Nitric oxide (NO) synthesized by iNOS and prostaglandins produced by COX-2 are effectors of neurotoxicity and neuroinflammation, thus, these two inducible enzymes have been recognized as inflammatory mediators produced in activated microglia. As the dominant enzymatic product of COX-2, PGEtherefore might play a role in microglia-mediated neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. To investigate this possibility, rat microgliaenriched cultures were preincubated with vehicle or increasing concentrations of compound A1, followed by treatment with 1 \u03bcM butaprost. Gene expression of a number of inflammatory mediators and cytokines were measured by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). EP2 activation by butaprost increased iNOS, COX-2, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 expression by 3.4-, 16.3-, 1.8- and 11.1-fold, respectively, without affecting expression of the EP2 receptor itself. The upregulation of these inflammatory genes by butaprost was inhibited by preincubation with EP2 antagonist compound A 1 in a concentration-dependent manner. These data suggest that EP2 activation in microglia contributes to neuroinflammation possibly via upregulating inflammatory mediators including iNOS and COX-2.","Certain Compounds Reduce Weight Loss, Prevent Blood-Brain Barrier Destruction, and Reduce Neuroinflammation and Neurodegeneration in Hippocampus after Status Epilepticus.","COX-2 induction in CNS overall contributes to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration by producing prostaglandins. However, the detailed downstream COX-2 signaling pathways involved in brain injury are not fully understood mainly because of the lack of selective small-molecule modulators for some prostaglandin receptors. Three doses of compound 1h were administered (5 mg\/kg, IP) at 3, 10 and 30 hours after 1 hour of pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus. Status epilepticus caused a substantial weight loss of the animals, which was reduced by compound 1h by day 4 (P<0.001). Animals received 1h gained weight from day 1 to day 4 compared to animals received vehicle after status epileptics (P<0.01). The SE-induced mortality rate by day 4 was also reduced by compound 1h (p=0.034). Neuronal COX-2 induction after SE was demonstrated to regulate breakdown of the blood brain barrier (BBB). Compound 1h significantly prevented leakage of plasma albumin into the cortex four days after SE, measured by Western blot analysis (P<0.05), which suggests that EP2 activation might be involved in SE-induced BBB destruction.","Neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration are two prominent features following seizure-promoted COX-2 induction. The mRNA levels of cytokines\u2014IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF\u03b1 and chemokines\u2014CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CXCL10 in hippocampi from mice received vehicle or compound 1h four days after SE were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). All seven cytokines and chemokines were substantially induced by SE and administration of 1h largely blunted the induction by an average of 54% (P<0.05). Pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus caused substantial neurodegeneration in hippocampus four days after status epilepticus. Administration of compound 1h significantly reduced the status epilepticus-induced neurodegeneration by 66% (P<0.05) in CA1, by 52% in CA3, and by 55% (P<0.01) in hilus. These results suggest the EP2 receptor is involved in COX-2-regulated neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration following a seizure."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 1","sub":["2 ","2","2 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 3","sub":["50","50"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 4","sub":["2","B","B","B","2 ","50","B","B","B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 5","sub":"B "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 6","sub":["50 ","2 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 8A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 10"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
