{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION","INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY","LIST OF DRAWING ELEMENTS"],"p":["This invention was in part made with government support under contract No. 2008-33610-18889 awarded by the United States Department of Agriculture. The government has certain rights in the invention.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates in general to the conversion of wind energy to electrical energy and, more particularly, to an orbital track wind turbine which provides a highly efficient method and apparatus for the conversion of wind energy to electrical energy.","2. Description of Related Art","It has become increasingly important due to environmental and economic considerations for the United States to transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. Unless wind power is cost competitive, no amount of political action can make it successful in the long term. The primary and overriding issue in transition to wind power is the cost per kilowatt-hour of electrical power produced by wind in comparison to more conventional electric power generation systems.","Windmills have been used to pump water for literally thousands of years. In the United States, two and three-bladed, horizontal axis wind turbines are currently in use in California. A large number of such wind farms are currently located on certain mountain ranges and passes in California which have substantial wind velocities. High-speed, two-bladed, horizontal axis wind turbines can achieve power coefficients slightly greater than 45% at tip speed ratios approximating 6. Due to its high performance, this general approach, whether using two blades or three, has therefore been the primary focus of wind energy research and development.","A vertical type wind rotor design is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 1,766,765 to Savonius. The Savonius turbine is primarily a drag-type wind turbine. The rotor in Savonius comprises two oppositely curved vanes overlapping each other in the center, there being a gap between insides of the vanes. Savonius solved the problem of improperly designed turbines which create a partial vacuum behind the rotors. Savonius' solution was to allow a pathway for ram air from the downwind (power stroke side) to bleed over the upwind (power robbing side). However, it has been demonstrated that in the turbines of Savonius the tip speed of the turbines is never faster than the wind, resulting in lower efficiencies. State of the art wind turbines are lift devices with airfoils that move at a velocity that is faster than that of the wind.","Engineers have continued to design larger turbines, on ever taller towers. However, there may be limits to this approach. The Department of Energy recently indicated in a 2008 report that, \u201cMany turbine designers do not expect the rotors of land-based turbines to become much larger than about 100 meters in diameter, with corresponding outputs of about 3 MW-5 MW\u201d.","The nature of multiple turbine interference and incentives for larger swept areas at greater heights inspired the evolution of a cylinder shaped swept area, resembling that of a traditional H-rotor (VAWT) design shown in . One of the problems with the H-rotor is the long radial supports, which create drag and interfere with the turbine's efficiency. Therefore, engineers have realized that there is a major issue of wind interference in H-rotor designs involving the use of long radial arms to connect the blades to a central axis. As a result, it has been found that the H-rotor wind turbines are typically about one-third less efficient than wind turbines employing a horizontal rotor.","The metamorphosis of a pyramid design, first into a steeper sided shape, eventually led to the realization that a simple cylindrical geometry would provide the best blend of both aerodynamic and mechanical optimization. In addition, the wind industry desires to move from multiple turbines on one tower to a single large turbine. This approach eliminates interference associated with multiple towers, while still allowing for a large swept area.","It is therefore the principal object of the present invention to provide a wind turbine which can utilize large blades without the use of long radial arms connecting the blades to a central axis.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a wind turbine capable of achieving efficiency of wind conversion much higher than the efficiency achieved with conventional horizontal and vertical rotor wind turbines currently in use.","It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a wind turbine which can be scaled to much larger sizes and with greater efficiency than the conventional horizontal axis wind turbines currently in use.","It is still another object of the present invention to provide a new and improved wind turbine which is insensitive to wind direction, requires no long cantilevered rotor blades, and which uses low-cost and lightweight airfoils of constant cross-section. These airfoils are much lower cost to manufacture as compared to complex horizontal axis wind turbine airfoils.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a wind turbine that produces electric power at a lower cost per megawatt hour than the current wind turbine in use and which has a lower tower and footing cost than the current wind turbines in use, and in which the high maintenance items such as gear boxes and generators are located nearer the ground for convenience of maintenance.","The present inventor through extensive analysis of prior art wind turbines and further research and development unexpectedly discovered that an orbital track wind turbine would overcome the problems discussed above concerning the prior art, while at the same time achieving the stated objects of the present invention.","The orbital track wind turbine of the present invention employs a plurality of spaced vertical supports with at least two parallel spaced circular tracks fixedly secured to these vertical supports. Preferably, the circular tracks are coaxial and are positioned in parallel horizontal planes. A plurality of trucks extend between the circular tracks and have at least two grooved rollers which partially surround said circular track and operate in rolling engagement therewith. These grooved rollers on the truck facilitate rotation of the trucks around the circular track while at the same time securing and holding the truck on the circular tracks. The tracks are held on to the circular track mechanically and by means of the centripetal acceleration of the airfoil assembly.","Preferably the circular parallel tracks are formed from steel pipe. However, in another preferred embodiment, the orbital track rail can employ a conventional magnetic levitation (Maglev) type of track.","A circular power takeoff ring is provided which is coaxial with the circular tracks. The circular power takeoff ring is attached to said trucks and is rotatable in a horizontal plane. A plurality of vertical airfoils extend around the circular track, and each of these airfoils are attached to the truck and the power takeoff ring.","Preferably, a plurality of generators are connected to the power takeoff ring whereby to convert wind generated rotation of the power takeoff ring to electrical energy. In a preferred embodiment generators are used which can be converted to dynamotors. These dynamotors can be used to initiate rotation of the power takeoff ring at low wind velocities.","In a preferred embodiment, the wind turbine of the present invention is mounted on a surface of the earth where a solid foundation can be provided for vertical supports upon which the wind turbine rests. However, in another preferred embodiment, the wind turbine of the present invention can be mounted on a floating platform which is preferably anchored to the sea or lake bed.","In a first preferred embodiment, there is provided an orbital track wind turbine for generation of electrical energy from wind power, said wind turbine comprising:\n\n","In a second preferred embodiment, there is provided in connection with the first preferred embodiment, an improvement wherein the circular tracks and power takeoff ring are formed from round steel pipe.","In a third preferred embodiment, there is provided in connection with the first preferred embodiment, an improvement wherein said spaced circular tracks have approximately the same diameter, and the circular power takeoff ring is rotatable in a substantially horizontal plane between the spaced circular tracks.","In a fourth preferred embodiment, there is provided in connection with the first preferred embodiment, an improvement wherein said grooved rollers on the truck are formed of steel and have chamfered walls of between about 30-60 degrees, whereby to transmit both gravitational loads of the mass of the truck and airfoil, and the centripetal loads of the airfoil, truck and power takeoff ring.","In a fifth preferred embodiment, there is provided in connection with the fourth preferred embodiment, an improvement wherein each truck has attached thereto a pair of vertically extending airfoils.","In a sixth preferred embodiment, there is provided in connection with the fifth preferred embodiment, an improvement wherein said pair of vertical airfoils are pivotal along their vertical axis, whereby adjustment of the pitch of the airfoils can be made to facilitate the most efficient capture of wind power by the airfoils.","In a seventh preferred embodiment, there is provided in connection with the sixth preferred embodiment, an improvement wherein each pair of vertical airfoils are pivotal along their vertical axis until the leading edges thereof approach one another, and the cross-section of these airfoils form a V-shape to facilitate initiation of rotation.","In an eighth preferred embodiment, there is provided in connection with the first preferred embodiment, an improvement wherein said generator is a dynamotor which can be operated as a motor to initiate rotation of the power takeoff ring when there is insufficient wind to initiate operation of the wind turbine.","In a ninth preferred embodiment, there is provided in connection with the first preferred embodiment, an improvement wherein the diameter of the spaced circular tracks is larger than the diameter of the vertical supports, and there is an annular space between the circular tracks and the vertical supports.","In a tenth preferred embodiment, there is provided in connection with the ninth preferred embodiment, an improvement wherein the diameter of the circular power takeoff ring is smaller than the diameter of the circular tracks, and said power takeoff ring rotates in said annular space between the circular tracks and the vertical supports.","In an eleventh preferred embodiment, there is provided in connection with the ninth preferred embodiment, an improvement wherein the diameter of the circular power takeoff ring is larger than the diameter of the circular tracks.","In a twelfth preferred embodiment, there is provided in connection with the first preferred embodiment, an improvement wherein the vertical airfoils extend vertically above an uppermost circular track and vertically below a lowermost circular track.","In a thirteenth preferred embodiment, there is provided in connection with the first preferred embodiment, an improvement wherein said generators have a power takeoff roller positioned in rolling communication with the rotatable circular power takeoff ring.","In a fourteenth preferred embodiment, there is provided in connection with the thirteenth preferred embodiment, an improvement wherein the power takeoff roller on the generator is formed of steel.","In a fifteenth preferred embodiment, there is provided in connection with the fourth preferred embodiment, an improvement wherein the grooved rollers on the trucks are formed of 4130 chrome alloy steel, whereby to minimize rotational friction with the truck while matching material hardness to its mating surface to decrease cyclical wear and tear.","In a sixteenth preferred embodiment, there is provided in connection with the first preferred embodiment, an improvement wherein the vertical airfoils have a constant cross-section over their length.","In a seventeenth preferred embodiment, there is provided in connection with the sixteenth preferred embodiment, an improvement wherein the vertical airfoils have profile cut foam core which are first covered with carbon fiber unidirectional doublers to combat bending stresses followed by an outer layer of woven fabric to resist tortional loading, followed by a layer of mylar to provide a smooth finish.","In an eighteenth preferred embodiment, there is provided in connection with the seventeenth preferred embodiment, an improvement wherein the vertical airfoil is vacuum bagged to evenly squeeze excess epoxy resin from the impregnated fabric.","In a nineteenth preferred embodiment, there is provided in connection with the seventeenth preferred embodiment, an improvement wherein plywood or metal inserts are incorporated into the foam cores to reinforce attachment points of the airfoils to the trucks.","In a twentieth preferred embodiment, there is provided in connection with the first preferred embodiment, an improvement wherein individual generators are vertically movably mounted, whereby to facilitate lowering and raising of the generator for maintenance, repair and replacement.","In the orbital track turbine of the present invention operating in the Savonius mode, the double airfoils are in a \u201cV\u201d shape but there is a gap left at the vertex of the \u201cV\u201d. This gap allows air to trickle in and relieve the vacuum, but does not substantially reduce performance. Large amounts of air (which would rob performance) cannot move through this gap rapidly because of viscous effects. However, the small amounts of air needed to negate a partial vacuum can get through, which results in a substantial improvement in efficiency. In the orbital track turbine of the present invention, it is possible to transition from the \u201cV\u201d\/Savonius configuration to the parallel\/biplane configuration once the wind conditions are high enough and the turbine has achieved a sufficiently high Tip Speed Ratio (TSR).","An orbital track wind turbine according to the present invention is shown generally at  in perspective view . The entire wind turbine is supported by a plurality of vertical supports  which are normally anchored to the ground by a solid foundation (not shown). The number and spacing of vertical supports varies depending upon the diameter and height of the wind turbine , the only limitation being that a sufficient number of vertical supports be used to hold the orbital track turbine solidly in place.","Fixedly mounted on vertical supports  are at least two parallel spaced circular tracks, an upper circular track  and a lower circular track . Circular tracks  and  are coaxial with one another and are positioned on the vertical supports  in parallel horizontal planes (not shown). Although the circular tracks  and  can be of any suitable material and have any suitable cross-sectional shape, it is preferred that the tracks be formed from round steel pipe.","Any suitable material of construction can be used in forming the orbital tracks and rollers in the orbital track turbine of the present invention. For example, the tracks could be formed of titanium or any other suitable metal, and the rollers on the trucks can be formed of polymeric materials, such as nylon in order to reduce the mechanical noise of the turbine. Additionally, the turbine blades can be formed of metals such as aluminum or from a combination of glass fibers and carbon fibers embedded in a polymeric matrix.","A plurality of trucks shown generally at  extend between circular tracks  and  (). Each of trucks  preferably have at least two grooved rollers  and  which have grooves formed with chamfered walls (). Rollers  are required to carry the rotating mass of the wind turbine while riding on the orbital tracks  and . Rollers ,  also carry both the gravitational loads of the mass as well as centripetal loading associated with rotational motion.","In a preferred embodiment, roller  incorporates a groove with a 45-degree chamfered wall  (). This wall  acts as a load carrying face since the weight of the truck and attachments thereto is carried on wall or face  ().","A circular power takeoff ring  which is coaxial with circular tracks  and  is attached to truck  (, and ). Power takeoff ring  is rotatable in a horizontal plane about its central axis (not shown).","A plurality of vertical airfoils  extend around circular tracks , , with each of airfoils  being attached to a truck  and in turn to power takeoff ring . ( and )","One or more generators or dynamotors  are mounted so that a power takeoff roller  thereon is in rolling engagement with a surface of power takeoff ring  (, , , ). In a preferred embodiment, power takeoff ring  is fabricated from round steel pipe, and power takeoff ring  is rotatable in a substantially horizontal plane between spaced circular tracks ,  ().","In the conventional horizontal axis wind turbines it is necessary to move the heavy mass of the generator and accelerate this mass before any power can be generated. Another idea discussed in the prior art is to use a linear generator. In the present invention, the generator itself is held in a fixed position and only the rotor is moved along with the airfoils.","In another preferred embodiment, a pair of vertical airfoils ,  are pivotal along their vertical axis () to facilitate adjustment of the pitch of the airfoils , , thereby facilitating the most efficient capture of wind power by the airfoils , . In a preferred embodiment, airfoils ,  are pivoted until their leading edges approach one another so that the airfoils form a V-shape as shown in ,  and . This configuration of airfoils facilitates initiation of rotation of the wind turbine of the present invention when the wind is blowing at relatively low speeds, i.e., 1-8 miles per hour.","A key object of the present invention is to keep bending stresses in the airfoils low, thus facilitating the use of lightweight and low cost airfoils. An additional orbital track can also be used any time the bending stresses in the airfoils rise above a certain level. This can be seen in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0089"},"figref":["FIGS. 2 and 24","FIGS. 3 and 25","FIGS. 3","FIGS. 4 and 5","FIG. 24","FIG. 25","FIG. 26"],"b":["51","53","15","16"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0090"},"figref":"FIGS. 17","b":["18","19","57"]},"In another preferred embodiment, generator  (, , ,  and ) can be a dynamotor which powers initial rotation of the power takeoff ring and wind turbine at low air speeds. In another preferred embodiment, the diameter of spaced circular tracks , , is larger than the diameter (spacing from a central axis) of vertical supports . This configuration leaves an annular space between circular tracks ,  and vertical supports .","It is still another preferred embodiment shown in , the diameter of the circular power takeoff ring  is larger than the diameter of circular tracks , . Preferably, vertical airfoils , , ,  and  extend vertically above an uppermost circular track  and below a lowermost circular track . In a preferred embodiment, the power takeoff roller  on generator  is formed of steel, more preferably of 4130 chrome alloy steel. (, )","Vertical airfoils , , , , and  preferably have a constant cross-section over their entire length, and have their profile core cut from foam which is covered with carbon fiber unidirectional doublers, with wood or metal inserts in the foam cores at points of attachment to trucks .","Preferably, each of generators  can be raised from the ground to their operable mounted positions in contact with the power takeoff ring, and also lowered to the ground by means of a cable or line, whereby to facilitate ease of maintenance.","In yet another preferred embodiment of the orbital track turbine of the present invention, the airfoils are positioned inside of the orbital tracks as illustrated in . Additionally, the power takeoff ring employed in the orbital track turbine of the present invention can be located on the outside of the airfoil as shown in .","In the horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT), the monopole needs to counteract the tip over moment from the wind by having a large, deep footing. The orbital track turbine of the present invention employs a broad base and hence the footing is lower cost and designed to keep the turbine from sinking into the ground. The HAWT has its high mass items (rotors, gear boxes, generators) all at the top of a very high tower. In contrast, the orbital track turbine of the present invention has the center of gravity of the high mass items positioned low on the tower. Also, the tower is more like a broadly based truss and hence more structurally efficient than a monopole.","In a HAWT wind turbine, the majority of the power is produced in the outer one-third of the rotor, since the inner two-thirds are at a lower velocity. An advantage of the orbital track turbine of the present invention is that the entire airfoil sees the maximum tangential velocity of the wind turbine, hence, each part of the airfoil produces the same amount of power. Another advantage of the orbital track turbine of the present invention is that the airfoils can be transported easily and brought to the field in sections and assembled into one long airfoil. This is possible because the airfoil has a constant cross-section shape from top to bottom.","Preferably a power takeoff system employed in the orbital track turbine of the present invention employs a generator which can be raised or lowered to the ground for ease of servicing. The generator can be mounted between springs to allow tolerance for up and down travel of the power takeoff ring during operation. Preferably, a radial tensioning system including the use of springs (not shown) can be used to hold the generator  against the power takeoff ring .","In a preferred embodiment, the power takeoff ring  can be supported by rollers (not shown) underneath it so that a lighter weight power takeoff ring can be used.","Preferably, the power takeoff ring can be formed from a round steel pipe. In another preferred embodiment, the power takeoff ring  can be replaced by either a chain, gear, or notched belt such as used in automotive applications.","The orbital track turbine of the present invention has little or no cantilever in the airfoils which minimizes stresses on the airfoils. As a consequence, such airfoils experiencing low stress can be lighter weight, made from low-cost materials, and made longer to capture more energy with the same mass.","Another aspect of the invention is that of wind regeneration. One of the reasons that Vertical Access Wind Turbines (VAWT) usually have a lower efficiency than HAWT is that on the VAWT the windward side of the turbine sees the full strength of the wind while the leeward side of the turbine sees wind that has had its energy reduced by the windward side. Orbital track turbine technology is concerned with making very large turbines. If an orbital track turbine has a diameter of 3 to 5 times the highest point reached by the airfoil, then the leeward side of the orbital track turbine will see fresh, regenerated wind. This regenerated wind will allow the turbine to generate more power and allow the turbine to close the gap in performance efficiency between HAWTs and VAWTs (i.e., the OTT). This concept is illustrated in . The large arrow  on the left represents the full strength wind. The small arrow  represents the reduced strength wind. The second big arrow  is meant to show that the wind energy is coming from the free streamflow above the turbine to regenerate the wind in the plane of the turbine.","In a preferred embodiment, an additional orbital track , ,  and  can be used to keep stress\/loads in airfoils low (see ). These tracks remove the need for a horizontal support arm that is used in a H-rotor wind turbine. The use of the orbital tracks eliminates the major source of parasite drag as well as the inertia associated with the mass of this arm. Also, the use of an orbital track allows an easier startup in light winds, and more power can be used in producing electricity rather than accelerating dead weight of a long arm as in the H-rotor.","The trucks  supporting the airfoil uses rollers designed to handle gravity of the weight of the airfoil assembly as well as the centripetal load resulting from spinning of the airfoils. Preferably, these rollers are formed of steel with an hourglass shape (not shown).","Minimizing the stresses on the airfoil facilitates the use of thinner airfoils having lower mass and lower drag. In contrast, horizontal axis wind turbines normally have constantly changing cross-sections and twist in the blades, and only about one-third of the rotor provides most of the power. In the orbital track turbine of the present invention, every inch of the blade is at maximum tangential velocity and provides the same power as every other inch.","The orbital track turbine of the present invention can be installed around a city as well as on the top of mountains, mountain passes, and around circular pivot agricultural fields. Additionally, the orbital track wind turbines of the present invention are well suited to be used on floating ocean platforms because they can be distributed around a broad base.","An important aspect of the present invention is the optimum use of real estate in a wind farm. Traditional Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines must be positioned so that they do not aerodynamically interfere with one another. Wind turbines typically must have the spacing of 3 to 5 rotor diameters between them to avoid aerodynamic interference.  shows an embodiment of the present invention where orbital track turbines are concentric. They have the perfect orientation no matter which direction the wind comes from.  provides a wind farm in which traditional HAWTs are placed in concentric circles. The orbital track turbine in  and the HAWT in  are the same height, and have the same size airfoils and are spaced using the same rules of separating the turbines.  shows the exclusion zones around each turbine as shaded to make it more clear how they are spaced. The bottom line is that all other factors being equal, the Orbital Track Turbine technology can generate 25% more power on the same size field.","An important advantage of the orbital track turbine of the present invention is that it does not need to vector into the wind and, therefore, doesn't suffer reduced output while it is changing direction. Also, the orbital track turbine can operate at higher wind speeds, because it is not cantilevered and hence experiences less bending stresses. As the tip speed ratio increases, the relative wind seen by the airfoils is different from the actual direction of the free wind. This eliminates blade stalling at a sufficiently high TSR.","An advantage of the large diameter power takeoff ring on a large orbital track turbine is that the power takeoff ring has a large tangential velocity that allows it to act like a gear that spins the generators at high rpm as is preferred for highly efficient power generation.","Preferably, it is desired to employ conventional active airfoil pitch control (not shown) to increase efficiency at low wind speed\/low tip speed ratio. Pitch control allows self starting by pitching downwind blades to assume the position of a flat plate relative to the wind. The airfoils preferably are positioned in a \u201cV\u201d configuration if the system is a double airfoil\/biplane design. The \u201cV\u201d configuration provides a real advantage since the airfoil does not need to change pitch\/configuration when moving upwind or downwind. Active pitch control is more feasible as the diameter of the orbital track turbine is increased.","An advantage of the orbital track turbine of the present invention is the reduction in cost in having constant cross-section airfoils. Since these airfoils experience lower bending loads, they can be extruded from aluminum or formed from composite materials. These efficiencies are illustrated in  showing the power coefficient at various ratios of blade tip speed to wind speed for various conventional rotor systems and for the orbital track turbine of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0107","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":[{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0001","num":"0112"},"b":"1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0002","num":"0113"},"b":"5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0003","num":"0114"},"b":"8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0004","num":"0115"},"b":"11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0005","num":"0116"},"b":"15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0006","num":"0117"},"b":"18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0007","num":"0118"},"b":"21"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0008","num":"0119"},"b":"23"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0009","num":"0120"},"b":"27"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0010","num":"0121"},"b":"31"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0011","num":"0122"},"b":"33"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0012","num":"0123"},"b":["39","41"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0013","num":"0124"},"b":["41","39"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0014","num":"0125"},"b":"51"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0015","num":"0126"},"b":"53"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0016","num":"0127"},"b":"57"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0017","num":"0128"},"b":"63"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0018","num":"0129"},"b":"65"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0019","num":"0130"},"b":["67","71"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0020","num":"0131"},"b":["73","75","77"]}]}}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIG. 21"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0070"},"figref":["FIG. 22","FIG. 28"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0071"},"figref":"FIG. 23"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0072"},"figref":"FIG. 24"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0073"},"figref":"FIG. 25"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0074"},"figref":"FIG. 26"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0075"},"figref":"FIG. 27"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0076"},"figref":"FIG. 28"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0077"},"figref":"FIG. 29"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
