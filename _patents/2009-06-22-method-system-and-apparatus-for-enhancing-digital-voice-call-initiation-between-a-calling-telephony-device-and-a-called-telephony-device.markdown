Such information is often not enough to determine whether the call warrants answering, which can lead to wasted bandwidth within the communication network, and inefficient use of resources at both telephony devices in processing voice data conveyed despite the call being generally undesired. Furthermore, if the call is not completed, and voice message data stored, it is often difficult to retrieve a specific saved voice message out of a number of saved messages associated with a particular caller. A similar issue exists with Historical Call Logs (or Call History) provided at telephony device phones. While it is possible to find the date and time of call, as well as information from the CLID, there is no way to distinguish between calls.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","101","102","101","111","113","114","115","116","117","118","119","111","102","121","123","124","125","126","127","128","129","121","101","130","135","101","102","136","135","130","137","117","101","130","102","136","135","135","102","135"]},"In some embodiments, each of calling telephony device  and called telephony device  comprises a telephony device, such as a personal computer, a communications device, a digital telephone, a smart phone, a computing device, PDA, a portable communications device, a portable computing device, a mobile telephone, a cell phone and the like, or a combination thereof.","Processing unit  and processing unit  can comprise any suitable processor, including but not limited to a central processing unit (CPU).","Memory  and memory  can each comprise any suitable memory including but not limited to volatile memory, non-volatile memory, read-only memory (ROM), random access memory (RAM), flash memory, removable memory, a hard disk, and the like.","Display device  and display device  can each comprise any suitable display device, including, but not limited to, any suitable combination of CRT and\/or flat panel displays (e.g. LCD, plasma and the like).

Circuitry  and circuitry  can each include any suitable combination of circuitry for controlling a CRT and\/or flat panel displays etc., including but not limited to display buffers, transistors, electron beam controllers, LCD cells, plasmas cells, phosphors etc. Display device  and circuitry  can be controlled by processing unit  to generate representation , and similarly display device  and circuitry  can be controlled by processing unit  to generate representation . In particular, processing unit  can control display device  and circuitry  to generate representation  including a representation of text data , synchronous with controlling annunciator  to provide an announcement of digital voice data .","Input device  and input device  can each comprise any suitable input device for accepting input data including but not limited to button(s), a keyboard, a track ball, a scroll wheel and\/or a combination. In particular, in some embodiments, the input device  enables the receipt of input data . In some embodiments, input data  comprises text data . In other embodiments, input data  is received at input device  in a T9 format (e.g. input device  comprises a keypad) and processing unit  is enabled to convert input data  into text data . Input device  can be configured in a manner similar to input device  such that input data can be received at input device  and converted to text.","Interface  and interface  can each comprise any suitable combination of wired or wireless interface as desired. In particular, the interface  and interface  enables communication between calling telephony device  and called telephony device  via communication network . Communication network  can be wireless, wired or a combination, as desired. Each of interface  and interface  is generally compatible with communication network . That is, if communication network  comprises a wireless network, interface  and\/or interface  are enabled to communicate wirelessly, using any suitable protocol; and\/or if communication network  comprises a wired network, then and\/or interface  are enabled to communicate via a wired link, using any suitable wired protocol. In some embodiments, one of interface  and interface  can be enabled to communicate wirelessly while the other of interface  and interface  can be enabled for wired communications.","In some embodiments, communication network  can comprise at least one network element  for managing calls between calling telephony device  and called telephony device . In particular, network element  can comprise a database of telephony devices in communication with communications network , and their functionality: for example whether or not a given telephony device, such as called telephony device , can process text data . Network element  can comprise at least one of a switch, a PBX, a VoIP central call controller, and the like.","Annunciator  and annunciator  can each comprise any suitable annunciator, including but not limited to a speaker, and bell, a buzzer, a synthesizer, a visual annunciator (e.g. a display, a light etc.) and the like, and\/or a combination. In some embodiments, annunciator  and display device , and annunciator  and display device  can respectively be combined in single respective display\/annunciator modules.","Each of microphones ,  and speakers ,  can comprise any suitable combination of microphones and speakers, respectively, to enable receipt and deliver of voice communications at calling telephony device  and called telephony device . In some embodiments, microphone  and speaker  can be combined in a handset and\/or a headset, which can further include an actuator for indicating that a voice connection is to be completed (i.e. to \u201cpick up the phone\u201d). Similarly, microphone  and speaker  can be combined in a handset and\/or a headset\/cradle combination, which can also further include an actuator for indicating that a voice connection is to be completed.","In general, system  provides communication between calling telephony device  and called telephony device  that is a hybrid between text messaging and voice communications, which can generally be referred to as a \u201ctext call\u201d, in which a phone call associated text message or text data (e.g. text data ) can be delivered via a digital phone system (e.g. via a packetized protocol such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), or any other suitable protocol). A text call can also be classified as a text message that is delivered to a phone display (e.g. display device ) concurrent with an announcement of a phone call at the phone (e.g. telephony device ). The text message (i.e. text data ) is displayed on the phone along with the presentation of the call to the phone (e.g. while it is ringing) along with any Caller Line Identification (CLID) information. The text message can be delivered with an outgoing call to the called party's phone (e.g. telephony device ). Alternatively, a pre-stored text message can be delivered to a caller's phone (e.g. telephony device ) by the called party's phone (e.g. telephony device ) on an incoming call to the called party's phone (for example, when telephony device  calls telephony device , telephony device  can cause a text message to be transmitted to telephony device ; in some of these embodiments, the text message that is transmitted is dependent on identifying information, such as CLID, delivered to telephony device  along with the call, e.g. from a specific incoming caller). This comprises a text message in the reverse direction (i.e. from called party to caller) while a call is presented to a called party's phone. This can be useful when a user needs to leave their office but would like to deliver a message to someone and they are expecting that someone to call. When the caller calls, the caller they would see the text message appear on their phone (i.e. telephony device ) while they hear the far end phone ringing.","In any event, the text message delivered to telephony device  can provide topical information to telephony device  and the called party's phone can be enabled to respond to the text call in various ways. For example, in response to a text call, the voice call can be completed between the phones, or a text response to the text call can be transmitted from the called phone to the calling phone, as will be described below. A text response can comprise either text data received at the called phone (e.g. called telephony device ) from an input device (e.g. input device ), or a pre-configured text data that can be retrieved from a memory (e.g. memory ) based on input data received from the input device. In any event, the text response can be transmitted back to the calling party's phone (e.g. calling telephony device ) in response to receiving the text call. An example of such a text response is depicted in , as TR .","In general, system  provides a number of features that result in reduced bandwidth usage within a communication network and reduced use of resources at calling telephony device  and called telephony device . Furthermore, the combination of text and voice enables better management of voice communications and more effective text messaging by making it part of a phone call delivered via a digital phone system (e.g. VoIP). For example, in general, a text message (i.e. text data ) in a text call is provided at a display device of the phone at the same time the call is presented to the phone (i.e. while the phone is ringing). In some embodiments, text message delivery to called telephony device  can follow the called telephony device  call forwarding\/routing rules for digital voice data  (i.e. a digital telephone call) including but limited to extending a call nominally destined for a desk phone out to a cellular phone to ensure that it arrives at a telephony device where a called party wants to receive calls. In other embodiments, text messages (e.g. text data ) can be stored in association with call records within call log and voice mail listings for called telephony device .","Attention is now directed to  which depicts a method  for enhancing digital voice call initiation between a calling telephony device and a called telephony device. In order to assist in the explanation of the method , it will be assumed that the method  is performed using the system . Furthermore, the following discussion of the method  will lead to a further understanding of the system  and its various components. However, it is to be understood that the system  and\/or the method  can be varied, and need not work exactly as discussed herein in conjunction with each other, and that such variations are within the scope of present embodiments.","At step , at calling telephony device , an identifier of called telephony device  is received, for example via input device . Such an identifier can comprise a network address, a telephone number, a MAC address, an IP address, and the like.","At an optional step , it can be determined whether called telephony device  can process text calls and\/or process text data . For example, network element  can be queried by calling telephony device  as to the functionality of called telephony device , and specifically whether called telephony device  can process text calls and\/or text data . Network element  can return a positive or negative response to the query. If the response is negative, a standard voice connection can be completed at step .","However, if the response is positive, at step , processing unit  can control display device  to provide a representation (e.g. within representation ) indicative that a text call can be made to called telephony device  and a determination made as to whether a text call is to be initiated. For example, input device  can receive input data indicative that a text call is to be made. A non-limiting example is provided in , described below. If a text call is not to be made, a standard voice connection can be completed at step , otherwise at step  text data  is determined, text data  based on input data  received via input device . In some embodiments, input data  comprises text data , text data  entered via a keyboard or keypad (e.g. via the T9 protocol). In other embodiments, input data comprises data for retrieving text data  from memory ; in these embodiments, memory  can store a set of pre-configured text data, text data  chosen from the set. For example, once it is determined that a text call is to be initiated, processing unit  can retrieve the set and control display device  to provide a representation (e.g. within representation ) of the set, such that one of the set of pre-configured text data can be designated as text data  (e.g. text data  can be selected via input device  from a menu provided at display device ).","At step  digital voice data  is determined and\/or assembled. For example, digital voice data  can comprise data for initiating a voice call to called telephony device , such as the identifier received at step  and any other data that can be processed within communication network  to connect the call, including but not limited to network element . Step  can occur concurrently with any of steps -. Furthermore, it is understood that once a voice call is initiated, digital voice data  can further comprise voice data received from microphone . It is further understood that digital voice data  can be packetized for transmission to called telephony device , each packet routed to called telephony device  via communications network . It is yet further understood that digital voice data  can initially be transmitted along a control path in communications network , and once a voice connection is completed, transmitted along a media\/voice path, as will be described below with reference to .","At step , text data  is associated with digital voice data , the associating occurring prior to initiating transmission of digital voice data . In some embodiments, text data  is incorporated into digital voice data , for example in a field designated for text data . In other embodiments, digital voice data  is updated with an identifier of text data  and\/or an indication that text data  is associated with digital voice data .","At step , text data  is transmitted to called telephony device  in conjunction with transmitting digital voice data , text data  to be provided synchronously at called telephony device  with an announcement of digital voice data , as in step .","Furthermore, it is understood that text data  and digital voice data can be transmitted via the same or different paths within communication network . For example, voice data  can be transmitted via a voice path and text data  can be transmitted via a text path.","At step , text data  and digital voice data  are received at called telephony device . It is understood that text data  and digital voice data  can be received at approximately the same time (e.g. if digital voice data  comprises text data ), or at different times. It is furthermore understood that one of text data  and digital voice data  can be received before the other of digital voice data  and text data , for example in embodiments where text data  and digital voice data  are transmitted via different paths within communication network .","At step , display device  and annunciator  are synchronously controlled by processing unit  to provide, respectively, a representation of text data  and to announce reception of digital voice data . In embodiments where one of text data  and digital voice data  are received before the other of digital voice data  and text data , called telephony device  can enter a waiting mode until the other of digital voice data  and text data  is received. Hence, in general, a voice call is announced (e.g. annunciator  \u201crings\u201d) and text data  is synchronously provided at display device  to convey, for example, a purpose of the voice call.","In some embodiments, telephony device  can be enabled for text to speech conversion and at step  \u201creads\u201d text data  in place of ringing (e.g. telephony device  could \u201cring\u201d once and then text data  could be played via annunciator  and\/or through speaker ).","At step , a determination can be made as to whether or not a voice connection is to be completed. For example, input data can be received indicative that the voice connection is to be completed, including but not limited to receiving input data from at least one of input device  and an actuator (e.g. via a handset and\/or headset\/cradle combination). If so, then the voice connection is completed at step .","At step , a determination can be made as to whether or not a text response to the text call is to be transmitted. Such a determination can be made whether or not the voice connection is completed at step . In any event, if so, text response  is determined and transmitted at step . Text response  can be determined in a manner similar to the determination of text data  at step , and based on input data received at input device . In some embodiments, the input data received at input device  can comprise the text response , while in other embodiments, the input data received at input device  can enable the selection of one of a pre-configured set of text response stored in memory . It is understood that text response  is subsequently received at calling telephony device  and display device  can be controlled to provide a representation of text response  (e.g. within representation ). It is furthermore understood that further text data can be determined and transmitted to called telephony device , in response to receipt of text response . Furthermore, it is understood that an exchange of text data and text responses between calling telephony device  and called telephony device  can continue indefinitely, in the manner of instant messaging.","In some embodiments, after step , a determination can be made at calling telephony device  as to whether text data  was delivered and\/or provided at called telephony device . For example, in some embodiments, step  does not occur and hence there is possibility that text data  cannot be provided at called telephony device . In these embodiments, called telephony device  can respond with an error when text data  is received. Alternatively, delivery of text data  can fail. In any of these embodiments, network element  can monitor delivery of text data  and transmit an indication that text data  was not delivered and\/or that delivery of text data  failed in general. Hence, calling telephony device  receives an indication that text data  was at least one of not delivered and not provided at called telephony device . In response, processing unit  can control display device  to provide a representation of the indication, for example, within representation .","In some embodiments, steps , ,  and  can be completed via respective voice communication applications and respective instant message messaging applications at each of calling telephony device  and called telephony device . For example, each of calling telephony device  and called telephony device  can comprise a respective voice communication application and a respective instant message messaging application, each respective instant messaging application under control by the respective voice communication application, in a slave mode. Hence, once text data  is received, text data  is exchanged between the respective instant message messaging applications via communications network .","In some embodiments, method  can further comprise storing text data  in association with CLID data and\/or digital voice data  and\/or a voice message in a call history storage device and\/or a voicemail system. In some embodiments, text data  can be used as the subject line in a Unified Messaging application (e.g. i.e. a voicemail system that forwards voicemails to an email account as an email attachment; in some of these embodiments text data  can be truncated with a remainder of text data  located in the body of the e-mail; alternatively, text data  could also be included in the body of an email where the full text can be displayed). In some embodiments, network element  comprises a voicemail system and\/or a call history storage device, while in other embodiments called telephony device  comprises a voicemail system and\/or a call history storage device. However, when text data  is stored centrally at network element , system  is enabled to provide text data  and associated with CLID data and\/or digital voice data  and\/or a voice message to different devices connected to network element , for example in hot desking scenarios. In some of these embodiments, method  can further comprise purging stored data according to pre-configured rules (e.g. when memory usage reaches a threshold level) in order to manage the storage requirements.","Various architectures and embodiments will now be described for: 1) text entry for a text call on various types of devices; 2) delivery and routing of text data in text calls; and 3) display and storage of text calls\/text data on various types of devices.","1. Text Entry for Text Calls","How text data is received for a text call can be dependant on the device being used to initiate the call. The following describes how a text call would be initiated on various devices.","Initiating Personal Computer\/Smart Phone Text Calls","There are two common types of Personal Computer (PC) applications that can be used to initiate phone calls: softphone application calls and desk phone companion application calls. A softphone operates independently of any physical desk phone and can use the PC's speakers and microphone (or attached headset) for the phone call audio. A desk phone companion generally works in conjunction with a physical desk phone by causing the audio for a PC application initiated call to go through the desk phone. Each of these two PC Application types can be extended to offer an option of initiating a text call via the following steps, described with reference to , which depicts a representation  of desktop of a display device of a PC, similar to display device , according to non-limiting embodiments:\n\n","In some embodiments, a text call can be initiated by receiving input data indicative that a phone number within an email, webpage or document has been highlighted, and receiving further input data indicative that a right-click has occurred on the highlighted text. In response, a menu, similar to menu\/pop-up box , can be provided providing an option to place a text call to the highlighted number, resulting in a text entry box and call button being provided, as described above.","Once text data is received, the text data can be transmitted with digital voice data to a called phone (e.g. the phone number can be \u201cdialled\u201d in the standard manner offered by the application, before, after or synchronous with transmission of the text data) via, for example, a LAN (local area network) connection using the particular VoIP protocol that the softphone or desk phone companion was developed to use (including but limited to standard and proprietary VoIP protocols, proprietary VoIP protocols specific to a VoIP PBX vendor's product). In some embodiments, existing protocols can be extended to facilitate transmission of text data along with the phone call.","A smart phone initiated text call can proceed in manner similar to the above described PC application initiated text call. The smart phone can comprise a VoIP client that enables communication with a VoIP phone system. The functionality of such a VoIP client can be extended in much the same way as with the PC based application to allow entry of text for a text call.","In some embodiments of a PC or smart phone initiated text call, picture data (e.g. picture ID) can be transmitted along with the text data, as can be indicated via a check box  in text entry box . In some embodiments picture data can then be selected (e.g. a JPEG, GIF, TIFF file, and the like) via a menu (not depicted), while in other embodiments, picture data can be pre-selected such that a check in check box  is indicative that the pre-selected picture data is to be transmitted along with text data. In some embodiments, the pre-selected picture data can be used as a picture ID for all text calls originating from the PC or smartphone. Indeed, the pre-selected picture data can be transmitted or not on a call by call basis. The picture data can then be displayed on the called party's phone along with the text data. In some embodiments, the picture data is not subsequently stored on the called party's phone along with the text message (i.e. within their call log or voicemail listings).","Desk Phone Initiated Text Calls","A text call can be initiated via desk phone , as depicted in , according to non-limiting embodiments. Desk phone  comprises a handset , a display device , a plurality of buttons , and a keypad . In some embodiments, calling desk phone  is similar to telephony device , with handset  analogous to microphone  and speaker , a display device  analogous to display device , and plurality of buttons  and keypad  analogous to input device . While not depicted, it is understood that desk phone  further comprises a processing unit similar to processing unit , a memory similar to memory  and a communication interface similar to communication interface . It is further understood that representations of data, such as menu items, provided at display device  can be selected via receipt of input data indicating that a button  adjacent to menu item has been actuated. A text call can be initiated via the following steps, according to non-limiting embodiments:\n\n","2. Delivery and Routing of Text Data in a Text Call","Generally, text data can be attached to the voice call portion of a text call and can follow the same path through a communication network taken by the packetized voice data for that phone call much in the same way CLID information can be transmitted to a called device.","Device Capability Identification","In some embodiments, the central call control capability is resident in a VoIP Controller that sets up the call routing (e.g. as depicted in , described below), the VoIP controller having access to data of whether a called party's phone is capable of receiving a text call or not. This data enables an endpoint to transmit data to the calling party's phone indicative of whether the called party's phone is able to process text calls or not, prior to text data being received at the calling party's phone, which generally prevents the text data from being entered\/received, saving resources at the calling party's phone. In embodiments where this data is accessible to the VoIP Controller, it can be processed in conjunction with data indicative of what physical phone the called party is logged into or forwarded to. When input data indicative that a text call is to be initiated is received at the calling party's phone, the phone number is received, the calling party's phone can initiate a communication with the central call control capability at the VoIP controller to inquire if the called party's phone (e.g. the phone where data for the called party is currently routed to) is capable of accepting text calls. If it is, then a text entry window will be displayed as described above. If it isn't, a message will be displayed at the calling party's phone indicating that the called party is not able to receive text calls at this time and the call will be placed without presenting the text entry window. Alternatively, an option can be presented whereby a text message can be conveyed to a device associated with the called party via an Instant Messaging (IM) or e-mail client. If selected, text data can be received and transmitted with or without placing a phone call.","In any event, once the text call is initiated, in some embodiments, the called party whose phone was capable of receiving a text call at the time the text call option was selected, will no longer be able to receive a text call at a current phone: for example, the called party can forward their calls to a new phone during the time interval between when the text call option is selected and the time the text call is initiated. In these embodiments, the calling party's phone can provide an error message indicating that the text data was not delivered.","In some embodiments, routing of text data (and\/or digital voice data) and\/or completing a voice connection and\/or controlling an annunciator to announce the arrival of digital voice data, can be determined based on the content of the text data. For example, when text data is routed through a central call controller (e.g. network element  and\/or central call controllers described below with reference to ), the text data can be processed to determine if text data comprises keywords, such as an account number, a password, or any other suitable keywords. Suitable routing of text data (and\/or digital voice data) and\/or completing a voice connection and\/or controlling an annunciator to announce the arrival of digital voice data can then be determined based on the keywords. For example, a salesperson who wishes to be contacted concerning only certain accounts can instruct his customers to include their account numbers in text data; their calls can then be routed accordingly. Similarly, an executive who wishes to be contacted only by given individuals can provide the individuals with a password; the password can be entered as text data into a calling telephony device, and a text call from the calling telephony device routed accordingly (e.g. forwarded to a cell phone of the executive and\/or causing a processing unit at a called telephony device to control an annunciator announcing the text call). In general, it is understood that, in these embodiments, method  further comprises the steps of: determining if text data comprises a given keyword; and at least one of routing text data (and\/or digital voice data), completing a voice connection, and controlling an annunciator to announce the arrival of digital voice data based on the given keyword. It is further understood that a copy of the given keyword (or given keywords) are stored at network element  and\/or called telephony device .","Call Set-Up for a Text Call","Call set-up for a text call will now be described for various call scenarios.","Desk Phone Initiated Text Call","Attention is directed to , which depicts a system  for enhancing digital voice call initiation between a calling telephony device and a called telephony device, according to non-limiting embodiments.

For example, text data can be sent via a GPRS link (a data link that is defined within the GSM cellular network protocol), and the like, to smartphone  while voice can be transmitted via a standard cellular link. The GPRS link can be accessible by a 3party application thus enabling call controller  to send text data via link  whereas the voice data is setup via the PSTN as with cellular phone calls in general. Central call controller  can be similar to network element . In non-limiting exemplary embodiments, described below, a text call is initiated at smartphone  to telephony device . The following steps occur:\n\n","Display and Storage of Text Calls on Various Devices","The provision of the text annotation for a text call will vary by the capabilities of a device providing the text data, and the available real estate of a display device at the device. For example, when text data is being displayed on display device of a personal computer, e.g. via a desk phone companion or soft phone application, a lot more text can be displayed at a time versus at a display device of a desk or mobile phone.  depicts non-limiting exemplary embodiments of a display device  of a deskphone, display device  comprising a display screen  and buttons . It is understood that display device  is controlled by a processing unit, similar to processing unit , which is further connected to any suitable number of speakers, microphones, input devices, communication interfaces, annunciator etc., at the desk phone.","When a text call is initiated, display screen  can be controlled to provide a pop-up window  within which text data associated with the text call is provided (e.g. \u201cMessage\u201d), along with CLID data (e.g. \u201cName\u201d). A similar pop-up window can be displayed from within a PC based desk phone companion or soft phone application. Given the available screen real estate at a PC, the amount of text data viewable without having to scroll could be much greater than on a desk or mobile phone.","When an incoming text call is received, a send response soft button  can be actuated via an adjacent button , and display screen  can be controlled to present a set of pre-configured text responses that can be invoked and transmitted back to a calling telephony device while the call is still ringing. For, example, as depicted in , the set of pre-configured text responses can include, but is not limited to, text responses such as, \u201cI will call you right back\u201d, or \u201cI will call you tomorrow\u201d or \u201cHang on, I will be right with you\u201d. When input data received indicating that a given pre-configured text response has been selected (e.g. an adjacent button  has been actuated) the selected pre-configured text response can be transmitted back to the calling device and displayed thereupon. In some embodiments, when input data is received indicating that the \u201cHang on, I will be right with you\u201d (or the equivalent) has been selected, the processing unit can cause the voice call to be answered automatically and placed on hold until the called party picks it up.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that in some embodiments, the functionality of telephony device , telephony device , deskphone , telephony devices , , , , deskphone comprising display device , call controllers , , , , computing devices ,  and smartphone  can be implemented using pre-programmed hardware or firmware elements (e.g., application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), electrically erasable programmable read-only memories (EEPROMs), etc.), or other related components. In other embodiments, the functionality of telephony device , telephony device , desk phone , telephony devices , , , , deskphone comprising display device , call controllers , , , , computing devices ,  and smartphone  can be achieved using a computing apparatus that has access to a code memory (not shown) which stores computer-readable program code for operation of the computing apparatus. The computer-readable program code could be stored on a computer readable storage medium which is fixed, tangible and readable directly by these components, (e.g., removable diskette, CD-ROM, ROM, fixed disk, USB drive). Alternatively, the computer-readable program code could be stored remotely but transmittable to these components via a modem or other interface device connected to a network (including, without limitation, the Internet) over a transmission medium. The transmission medium can be either a non-wireless medium (e.g., optical and\/or digital and\/or analog communications lines) or a wireless medium (e.g., microwave, infrared, free-space optical or other transmission schemes) or a combination thereof.","Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that there are yet more alternative implementations and modifications possible for implementing the embodiments, and that the above implementations and examples are only illustrations of one or more embodiments. The scope, therefore, is only to be limited by the claims appended hereto."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTIONS OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Embodiments are described with reference to the following figures, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0004"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIGS. 4 and 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIGS. 6 to 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIGS. 10 and 11"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
