The Government has certain rights in the invention.","This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e) to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/365,114 filed Jul. 16, 2010, which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.","The invention relates to thin, hydrogen-permeable, sulfur-resistant membranes formed from multi-layers of palladium or palladium-alloy coatings on porous, ceramic or metal supports, methods of making these membranes, methods of repairing layers of these membranes and devices that incorporate these membranes.","Inexpensive sources of purified hydrogen are sought after for many industrial chemical production processes and in the production of energy in fuel cell power systems. Similarly, inexpensive methods of purifying hydrogen could significantly expand the applicability of hydrocarbon reforming, reforming reactors and the water gas shift reaction. Other applications are high temperature hydrogen separations, fuel cell power systems, hydrogen fueling stations, hydrocarbon reforming, and use in membrane reactors, devices that can simultaneously form a product and separate the reaction products.","Palladium and its alloys, as well as nickel, platinum and the metals in Groups III-V of the Periodic Table are all permeable to hydrogen. Hydrogen-permeable metal membranes made of palladium and its alloys are the most widely studied due to their high hydrogen permeability, their chemical compatibility with many carbon containing gas streams, and their theoretically infinite hydrogen selectivity. Hydrogen molecules (H) present in steam of mixed gas molecules will dissociate into hydrogen atoms, which dissolve into the palladium and diffuse across a palladium metal barrier to recombine into hydrogen molecules and dissociate from the opposite surface of the palladium barrier as a purified hydrogen gas. Thus, a gas stream formed in different industrial processes that contains many different molecular components including hydrogen can be directed to a palladium membrane to selectively recover the hydrogen present in the gas, thereby producing a purified hydrogen gas stream without significant additional energy input.","Unfortunately, pure palladium membranes are themselves expensive when used in such purification processes due to their rapid degeneration and limited life. Atomic hydrogen is so soluble in palladium that it forms a separate hydride phase (\u03b2), which has a much larger lattice constant, causing swelling, warping and cracking of the palladium membrane. This \u03b1\u03b2 phase transition takes place at the critical temperature of 295\u00b0 C., making it difficult to avoid premature breakdown during prolonged industrial use. Additionally, sources of sulfur, present in many industrial process gasses, produce hydrogen sulfide when they contact palladium membranes at high temperature. Hydrogen sulfide is a potent poison of the hydrogen dissociation catalysts including palladium metal membranes, and exposure to sulfur-bearing gasses rapidly lowers the permeability of a palladium membrane to hydrogen requiring the replacement of the relatively expensive membrane structure.","In an attempt to overcome these problems with pure palladium membranes, alloys of palladium have been tested that display a comparable hydrogen permeability with superior physical strength and greater resistance to thermal degradation and sulfur poisoning. As early as 1963, McKinley (U.S. Pat. No. 3,350,845) formulated alloys of palladium with copper, silver and gold and showed that palladium-gold alloys containing about 55 weight percent gold had improved resistance to poisoning by sulfur-containing gases, albeit with about a 10-fold decrease in hydrogen permeability. Alternatively, palladium-silver membranes and palladium-copper membranes containing about 10 weight percent silver and about 40 weight percent copper, respectively, showed an increased permeability to hydrogen but were equally or more sensitive to sulfur poisoning compared to pure palladium membranes.","The palladium-gold membranes disclosed by Mckinley were relatively thick and prepared by conventional metallurgy techniques. Such membranes are still prohibitively expensive for most industrial applications. Therefore, there has been a long-felt need for a fabrication method capable of inexpensively and efficiently producing palladium alloy membranes having high thermal stability, durability and resistance to sulfide poisoning.","Recent research efforts have focused on the development of composite metal membranes consisting of a relatively thin Pd or Pd-alloy coatings on hydrogen permeable base metals, or on porous ceramic or stainless steel supports.","Many palladium alloys such as PdAg, PdAu, and PdCupossess higher hydrogen permeability than pure palladium. In the 1969, McKinley and co-workers (U.S. Pat. No. 3,439,474) reported that binary alloys of Pd with Au and Cu had pure hydrogen permeabilities greater than Pd and PdAg, were unaffected by thermal cycling, and had some resistance to sulfur poisoning by hydrogen sulfide. The inhibition or reduction of the pure hydrogen flux due to exposure to 4 ppm hydrogen sulfide through the 40 mass percent Au alloy was the least compared to pure Pd, PdAg and PdCu alloys.","The sulfur resistance of PdCu foil membranes was investigated by researchers at the DOE NETL laboratory (B. D. Morreale, B. D, et al., 241:219 (2004)). They reported the best sulfur resistance with a 20% Cu in Pd binary alloy having an FCC crystal structure. But this PdCualloy has only 20% of the hydrogen permeability of pure Pd and about 2 times less than 40% Au.","Further relating to unsupported Pd or Pd alloy foil membranes, U.S. Pat. No. 6,152,995 describes a process to increase the flux of hydrogen through a metal foil membrane by chemical etching using a mineral acid such as HNOor mixtures of HNOand HCl. This patent also describes methods for finding leaks on metal foil membranes and techniques to repair such leaks.","Thus, there is still a need for sulfur resistant, composite metal membranes and improved methods of designing and making these membranes. There is also a need for a repair technique for the Pd or Pd alloy supported membranes.","The present invention provides methods of fabricating a sulfur-resistant composite metal membranes including seeding a substrate with palladium crystallites, decomposing any organic ligands present on the substrate, reducing the palladium crystallites on the substrate to the metallic form, depositing a film of palladium metal on the substrate, repairing the palladium metal, and depositing a second alloying film on the palladium film. A multilayer film of Pd and the alloying metal is created by adding additional layers of palladium and\/or the alloying metal. This multilayer film is then dried at a temperature between about 130\u00b0 C. and about 275\u00b0 C. to form a sulfur-resistant, composite multilayered Pd-metal alloy membrane. A Pd-metal alloy multilayer film formed by this method preferably have total thickness of at least about 3 \u03bcm and the substrate is preferably a stainless steel support having a porous ZrOcoating that may optionally be sealed so as to render one or more portions of the substrate impermeable to hydrogen gas.","The substrate may be seeded by airbrushing a palladium salt solution onto the surface of the substrate. Preferably, a palladium salt solution containing palladium (II) acetate and chloroform is used for this technique.","The substrate in one embodiment may be fired to eliminate any organic ligands present. The substrate may also be reduced by immersion in a reducing solution such as a solution containing water, NHOH and hydrazine.","The first film of palladium metal is deposited on the substrate by electroless plating. In one embodiment, a palladium plating bath solution is pumped over the surface of the substrate, preferably until a palladium layer having a thickness of between about 0.7 \u03bcm and about 1.5 \u03bcm is formed. The palladium plating bath may be a solution containing water, NHOH, HCl, Palladium (II) chloride and hydrazine. Similarly, the deposition of a second film of an alloying material, preferably gold, is performed by pumping a gold plating bath, such as a solution containing water, NaOH and gold (III) chloride, over the surface of the substrate. This is continued until a gold layer having a preferred thickness of between about 0.2 \u03bcm and about 0.4 \u03bcm is formed on the palladium layer.","The invention in one embodiment also provides a method for repairing the metal layers, which is particularly applicable to the palladium layers of the coating. Following the palladium plating, the lumen of the membrane is filled with reducing solution and sealed. The membrane is put into the palladium plating bath. This process reduces holes on and in the palladium metal film layer of the coating.","Further metal layers of palladium, gold or other metals, such as silver, may be formed on the second, gold layer. Alternatively, palladium and silver layers or palladium and ruthenium layers may be co-deposited on the substrate, followed by a layer of a metal alloy, preferably gold. Alternatively, the layers may be applied to the surface of the substrate by electroless plating. The layers may be applied sequentially, though this is not required. Furthermore, multiple metals may be applied to the activated surface, preferably palladium and ruthenium and gold.","The invention in another embodiment also provides a sulfur-resistant PdAu composite membranes made by seeding a substrate with palladium crystallites, optionally decomposing any organic ligands present on the substrate, reducing the palladium crystallites to the metallic form, depositing a first film of palladium metal on the substrate, repairing the first film layer of palladium metal on the substrate, depositing a second film of gold on the palladium film, adding additional layers of palladium, followed by the repair of the palladium film layer, adding additional layers of gold and repeating the addition of the added layers, and repair, until the desired thickness of the multilayered film is obtained. The metal multilayer film may be dried or annealed.","In the deposition of the metal membranes on the substrate during the fabrication methods of the present invention, the depositing steps are preferably conducted in the absence of both organic complexing agents, such as EDTA, and tin.","The invention also provides hydrogen-permeable and sulfur poisoning-resistant composite membranes. These composite membranes are composed of a porous substrate having a PdAu alloy layer on at least one surface. The PdAu alloy preferably has a mass percent Au between 5 and 50 mass percent and wherein the PdAu alloy is non-homogenous.","The present invention provides metal alloy membranes having high hydrogen permeability and good resistance to sulphide poisoning. The invention also provides optimal methods to fabricate sulfur resistant, high flux composite membranes that can be applied to high temperature hydrogen separations. The invention also provides added support for the membranes to increase the durability of the membranes.","One aspect of the invention provides composite membranes composed of a multilayered palladium alloy film supported on a substrate that display higher Hflux from a multicomponent gas mixture containing hydrogen sulfide and other sulphurous constituents than the Hflux for previously reported palladium alloy composite membranes. These membranes are formed on porous supports by electroless plating methods.","The composite membranes include a thin multilayered palladium alloy layer on a porous substrate. The porous substrate may be any porous, inorganic support including oxide ceramics (e.g., alumina, titania and zirconia), non-oxide ceramics (e.g., SiC and SiN), sintered or porous metals (e.g., stainless steel and nickel), sintered or porous metals with ceramic surfaces, and porous vycor glass. The substrate may be either tubular or planar or any geometry such that the surfaces that bear the Pd alloy film are adequately exposed.","A permeable diffusion barrier separating the substrate from the Pd alloy film is desirable. For example, a stainless steel support coated with porous ZrOhaving a pore diameter of about 80 nm has been extensively tested and shown to work well.","Substrates that are symmetric or asymmetric, have pores of different sizes, or have a gradient of pore sizes, may be used. While symmetric substrates are typically less expensive, asymmetric substrates have a lower resistance to flow and therefore minimize the pressure drop experienced in the support. Thus, given a similar thickness of Pd alloy deposited on the substrate, greater fluxes can be achieved with an asymmetric support. A small pore size in the substrate is needed to minimize surface roughness and therefore the corresponding Pd film thickness. Alternatively, at pore sizes of about 5 nm in diameter or less, the adhesion of the film to the substrate is reduced. Good results have been obtained with asymmetric substrates with a pore size gradient that extends over an about 20-200 nm diameter pore size range.","Certain surfaces of the substrate may be sealed as desired to prevent Hfrom flowing through those regions of the membrane. Typically, a low temperature glaze (e.g., potter's glaze) is utilized as the sealant because many substrates are subject to damage if exposed to high temperatures.","The hydrogen flux through these Pd alloy membranes is inversely proportional to the thickness of the membrane and therefore, thinner Pd alloy membranes are more desirable for their increased rate of hydrogen flux and lower cost for the palladium and alloy metal components. The hydrogen flux is also dependent upon the number and size of holes within the Pd alloy membranes. When a support with small pores is used, a thinner film may be used and still produce a leak-free membrane, because it is easier to cap small pores by plugging them with metal. Very thin, defect-free Pd alloy membranes however, are difficult to form and the inherent defects lead to losses in selective permeability of the membrane to hydrogen and more rapid physical deterioration of the membrane, requiring more frequent membrane replacement. Thin metal films are sufficient to prevent leaking at low temperatures, but when heated, the metal crystallites may rearrange, opening slightly covered pores in the ceramic support, leading to the formation of pores or outright rupture of the palladium alloy membrane and loss of selective hydrogen permeability. Pd alloy membranes having a thickness in the range of between about 1 micron and about 10 micron are preferred as striking a balance between good hydrogen diffusion rates, relatively easy defect-free production and physical durability. Pd alloy membranes having a thickness in the range of between about 2 microns and 5 microns are the most preferred.","The weight percent content of the palladium alloy is formulated to maximize hydrogen permeability while achieving resistance to sulfur poisoning and physical durability. With PdCu alloys, the hydrogen permeability increases through a maximum around 40 wt. % Cu (PdCu). This high percentage of Cu significantly reduces membrane cost relative to pure Pd, and the PdCualloy exhibits increased resistance to hydrogen sulfide poisoning. Further, a PdCumembrane can withstand repeated temperature cycling with less distortion than pure Pd because at about 40 wt. % Cu, the critical temperature for \u03b2-hydride phase formation is below room temperature. Similarly, PdAghas a higher hydrogen permeability than pure palladium membranes. Surprisingly, and in contrast to the PdAu membranes disclosed by Mckinley (U.S. Pat. No. 3,350,845), PdAu membranes having a lower weight percent Au in the range of PdAuto PdAuhave a higher hydrogen flux than pure palladium and a much greater resistance to sulfide poisoning than comparable PdCu or PdAg membranes. For example, an approximately 5 micrometer PdAumembrane shows only about a 38% drop in hydrogen flux in the presence of about 5 ppm HS compared to an about 71% drop for a comparable PdCuand the PdAumembrane had a higher hydrogen flux in the presence of HS than the PdCumembrane in the absence of HS. A PdAumembrane having a thickness of about 2.5 microns and formed on a stainless steel substrate with a ZrOcoating has a hydrogen permeability approaching that of pure palladium and a hydrogen\/nitrogen separation factor of greater than the ideal value of about 400 when tested at about 400\u00b0 C. Similarly, a PdAumembrane having a thickness of about 3 microns and formed on a stainless steel substrate with a ZrOcoating had a hydrogen permeability approaching that of pure palladium and a hydrogen\/nitrogen separation factor of greater than about 10,000 when tested at about 400\u00b0 C. A PdAumembrane formed on a stainless steel substrate with a ZrOcoating exposed to a water gas shift gas mixture (about 51% H, about 26% CO, about 21% HO, about 2% CO) at about 400\u00b0 C. operated at an about 76% Hrecovery which is nearly the same as the hydrogen flux seen with exposure to a pure gas flux having a similar Hpartial pressure, indicating a hydrogen selectivity with only minor reductions in the presence of a mixed molecular gas feed stream.","One aspect of the invention provides a method of making these multilayer alloy and pure palladium composite membranes. Both planar and tubular Pd\/Au membranes can be fabricated using the improved, sequential, electroless plating processes described here. In a preferred embodiment, tubular membranes are formed on stainless steel supports. The membranes are deposited onto ZrO\/stainless steel substrates by a sequential electroless plating process. Although other deposition methods may be used, electroless plating offers advantages over other deposition techniques because it can deposit uniform films on complex shapes and large substrate areas with sufficient hardness, using simple equipment. PdAu alloy membranes are fabricated by sequential plating of first Pd and then Au. The target thickness for the PdAu alloy films is between about 2 \u03bcm and about 5 \u03bcm to maximize the hydrogen permeance.","This method advantageously eliminates tin (Sn) and carbon impurities in the Pd films, which can cause structural instability, particularly at high temperature, and reduced H\/Nseparation ratio (pure gas permeability ratio). These methods are particularly suited for alloy compositions with about 5-50 mass % Au, which the present inventors have shown to have the highest permeability and best resistance to sulfur. Importantly, no organic complexing agent, such as EDTA, is used in the Pd plating solution to minimize contamination by carbon. When pure gases are used, they are preferably nominally about 99.999% pure (UHP grade). The process includes depositing a layer of Pd, repairing the layer of Pd, depositing a layer of an alloying metal, such as Ag, Ru, Au or Cu, using electroless plating, repeating the steps of depositing layers of Pd, repairing the Pd and depositing a layer of the allowing metal, followed by a low temperature drying step. The drying step forms the Pd-metal alloy at a much lower temperature than traditional annealing.","Initially, a substrate is provided. If needed, the provided substrate is subjected to a pre-processing step in which the substrate is subjected to one or more operations that are needed to place the substrate in condition for plating related operations and\/or one or more operations that are more readily accomplished prior to plating related operations. If the substrate that is provided is not clean or becomes dirty before a plating operation, the substrate must be cleaned to remove any salts or other materials that could interfere with the subsequent plating processes. Typically, cleaning is carried out with isopropanol and deionized water but other cleaning procedures that remove the undesirable material or materials are also feasible. Further, if the substrate that is provided does not have the appropriate dimensions, appropriate sizing operations are undertaken. Typically, this involves cutting the substrate but other form- or shape-altering methods are also feasible. It is also feasible to perform sizing operations at different points in the composite membrane production process.","In these substrate preparation processes, the surfaces of the substrate may be sealed in places where it is undesirable to have Hflow in the finished membrane. Typically, a low temperature glaze (e.g., potter's glaze) is utilized because many substrates are subject to damage if exposed to high temperatures. For example, if the U.S. Filter T1-70 5 nm filter, an asymmetric ceramic filter, is exposed to temperatures above about 600\u00b0 C., the thin top layer of the filter is subject to damage. Certain substrates do not require sealant to be used. For example, some metallic supports may have dense metal tubes welded to each end. Regardless of the sealant utilized, the sealant applied in any suitable manner, including but not limited to, painting the sealant onto the surface to be sealed or the surface is dipped in sealant. Other application methods, such as spraying, are also feasible. In a preferred embodiment, the ends of a tubular substrate are each dipped into the sealant. Preferably, the sealant is applied prior to the alloy film being applied. With the ends sealed and assuming that the Pd alloy film is applied to the outer wall of the substrate, Hand other materials that are in a stream that is passing through the tubular substrate are constrained to traveling through the inner wall of the substrate to the outer wall of the substrate, and then through the Pd alloy film on the outer wall of the substrate to the appropriate collection on the outside of the tubular composite membrane. Because of the sealant, the Hand other materials are prevented from exiting the substrate via the end walls. It is also feasible to perform sealing operations at a different point in the production process. For instance, in the case of a metal substrate, sealing by brazing, silver soldering or welding are feasible at any point in the production process.","After pre-processing of the substrate, the surface of the substrate where the Pd alloy film is to be deposited is \u201cseeded\u201d with Pd crystallites to catalyze the rate of film growth (i.e. heterogeneous nucleation as opposed to homogenous nucleation) on the substrate and achieve good adhesion of the palladium \u201cseeds\u201d to the substrate by employing palladium seeds that are smaller than the grains on the surface of the substrate that is being plated. This process can be performed using a variety of methods including impregnation with an organic solution of Pd acetate. In a preferred embodiment, the membrane supports are seeded with palladium nanocrystallites by airbrushing a solution of palladium salt onto the surface of the chosen support. In the case of a metal substrate, the seeding of the surface with Pd crystallites may be accomplished using an organic Pd solution in which the solvent is a light, polar, organic solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), ethyl acetate, acetonitrile, diethyl ether, methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), or acetone. Preferably, the solvent is chloroform. The composition of a preferred solution or \u201cactivation bath\u201d for seeding substrates with palladium nanocrystals is shown in Table 1.

The activation process may be performed more than once and is preferably performed twice.","Prior to any plating process, the activated membrane is reduced in order to convert the palladium crystallites to the metallic form.

Though the total thickness will vary depending upon the number of layers used, it is preferred that the total thickness be between about 3 to about 10 microns. An SEM image of a five layer, \u02dc10 micron multilayer film is illustrated in .","In another embodiment, the multilayer film is made and no repair step is performed. In another embodiment, the repair is performed only during select stages, for example, after a Pd layer is added to the multilayer film.","Because a multilayer film is used, an annealing step is not required to form the palladium alloy. Rather, following the application of the multilayered film, the membranes are dried at approximately 130\u00b0 C. for approximately 5 hours. The drying step may take place at the conclusion of the application of the multilayer films, or may occur intermittently during the film application process. In a preferred embodiment, the membranes are heated at a rate of approximately 60\u00b0 C.\/hour. In some embodiments, the membranes are also cooled at a controlled rate, however, the cooling rate may be controlled by the cooling rate of the environment.","In another embodiment, the multilayered palladium alloy film is reduced using the repair step described above. In a further embodiment, additional layers of film are applied to the repaired multilayered film as described above, followed by an additional drying step as described above.","This multilayer film is more beneficial than a binary layer of palladium and gold because it increases the hydrogen flux measurements through the membrane without a sufficient increase in the amount of palladium used on the membrane. It is believed that the repair step may clean the plated material, which can be plated in a subsequent step to fill the holes. The multilayer films are also beneficial over a binary film layer. The multilayer film is believed to be beneficial because any defects that may exist in each film layer would likely not overlap leading to greater durability in mixed gas streams. Additionally, the palladium alloy forms at a much lower temperature than required by a binary layer of palladium and gold.","In still another embodiment, the multilayered system is created using palladium and at least two additional alloying materials. For example, a multilayer film is created using palladium, the first alloying metal and a second alloying metal.","In one embodiment, palladium is applied to a substrate using an electroless plating process described above. The palladium layer is repaired using the repair step disclosed above. A first alloying metal layer is applied to the palladium layer as described above. Then, rather than adding another layer of palladium, a second alloying metal, including silver, gold, copper or ruthenium, is applied using an electroless plating process. The thickness of the second alloying metal layer should be between about 0.1 \u03bcm to 0.5 \u03bcm thick. Preferably, each second alloying material layer is between about 0.2 \u03bcm thick and about 0.3 \u03bcm thick. Additional layers of the palladium, the first alloying material and the second alloying material are added to create a multilayer film on the substrate. Though the film is preferably arranged such that each layer is alternating between the palladium, the first alloying material and the second alloying material, this is not necessary. Additionally, an equal number of each film layer need not be used. Furthermore, the repair step described above may occur after each layer is applied, after certain layers are applied or after just the palladium layers are applied.","In one embodiment, the alloying metal (either first or second) is silver. The silver layer is also added using any of the electroless plating methods noted above. A preferred silver plating bath is described in Table 5.

Approximately 0.3 g RuClwas dissolved in about 19 mL HO and about 1 mL approximately 37 wt % HCl and sonicated for about 5 min. Approximately 80 ml standard Pd plating solution and approximately 1 mL hydrazine solution was added to finalize the plating bath. The membrane was plated for approximately 20 min at approximately 55\u00b0 C. Any suitable bath parameter for ruthenium may be used. For example, see Gade, S. K., Keeling, M. K., Davidson, A. P. Hatlevik, \u00d8., and J. D. Way, \u201cPalladium-ruthenium membranes for hydrogen separation fabricated by electroless co-deposition,\u201d International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 34, 6484-6491 (2009), Table 1, describing the fabrication of PdRu membranes by electroless codeposition, which is incorporated by reference. Following the application of the palladium-ruthenium layer, the repair step may be performed on the membrane. An additional layer of an alloying material may be layered with the palladium-ruthenium layer using the method described above. In a preferred embodiment, the alloying material is gold. Because ruthenium adds strength to the film, the amount of alloying material added to the multilayered system is less than if ruthenium is not used. Thus, at least one layer of palladium-ruthenium and the alloying material may be sufficient to provide hydrogen separation, however, additional layers of Pd, Ru and\/or the alloying material, in any combination, may be added. Following the layering steps, the multilayered membrane is dried as described above.","In an embodiment, ruthenium is used as the first alloying material. In an embodiment, the palladium is applied to the activated substrate as described above. In certain embodiments, the palladium film is repaired using the repair technique discussed above. In an embodiment, ruthenium is applied to the palladium substrate using electroless plating. As discussed above, any suitable bath parameter for ruthenium may be used. Ruthenium provides added strength to the layered films applied to the substrate. By increasing the strength, fewer layers may be used, thereby increasing the hydrogen flux while decreasing the nitrogen flux through the membrane. Ruthenium can also reduce the number of layers and the thickness of layers used in either a binary layer system (Pd\u2014Ru) or in a multilayer film (Pd\u2014Ru-alloying metal(s)). Though ruthenium film layers may be dried, it is not necessary to anneal these layers.","In one embodiment, the palladium-ruthenium layers are further layered with a second alloying material as described above. The second alloying material can be gold, copper or silver and the second alloying material may be applied to the palladium-ruthenium system using an electroless plating process described above. A multilayer film of palladium-ruthenium-second alloying material can be created. As described above, the multilayer film may be dried intermittently throughout the layering process or at the completion of the layering process using the drying process described above.","One way to achieve Pd and other metal layers of approximately equal thickness is by performing the metal plating operations under substantially the same thermodynamic conditions and for appropriate periods, which has a large range of approximately 10 min to approximately 16 hours. It is also possible to perform the plating operations under different thermodynamic conditions and\/or over different periods of time and achieve layers of substantially equal thickness. As noted above, the maximum hydrogen flux for Pd alloys is achieved with different weight percentages of different metal constituents. Consequently, the conditions under which weight percentages are achieved that are at, or near, the weight percentages for maximum hydrogen flux are typically different than those for the PdAu alloy.","An optional further step may increase the hydrogen flux of the membrane. Namely, the composite membrane may be subjected to air oxidation and reduction to activate the metal surface. This step is believed to roughen the surface of the film, thereby increasing the surface area of the film. The increased surface area is believed to provide a greater hydrogen flux. The increased surface is believed to be responsible for the greater hydrogen flux. In an embodiment, a short duration (about 5 to about 30 minutes) air oxidation at temperatures above about 300\u00b0 C. followed by exposure to Hand subsequent reduction. Rather than air reduction and oxidation, the composite membrane can be subjected to O, O, acids, steam, SO, or a combination of HS\/steam to disturb the surface of the palladium alloy film.","There are many possible applications of the invention. For example, there is great interest in using high temperature membranes in devices to separate and produce high purity hydrogen from a variety of sources including the reforming of hydrocarbon fuels and gasification of coal and biomass. For example, coal can be gasified to produce synthesis gas containing mostly carbon monoxide (CO), steam, N, and hydrogen. This synthesis gas is usually sent to a water gas shift (WGS) reactor to convert carbon monoxide and steam to carbon dioxide and hydrogen. The hydrogen can be separated using a Pd membrane, leaving the non-permeating COproduct at pressure.","Even more interesting is the case where the WGS reaction is performed within the hydrogen permeable membrane, where a membrane reactor will simultaneously produce pure hydrogen and a highly enriched COstream, still at high pressure, that could be used for tertiary oil and gas production and\/or sequestered.","Another possible application of the invention is for the U.S. Military. The Military may use fuels like light alcohols (e.g. methanol and ethanol) as a hydrogen storage fluids for portable power needs. These alcohols can be easily reformed to make synthesis gas, which can be further processed to maximize the yield of hydrogen. This hydrogen can power fuel cells to produce electricity. A portable device like this would significantly reduce the weight of the batteries a soldier would have to carry into the field.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"sub":["96","4 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"sub":["95","5 "]},"The hydrogen flux through these Pd alloy membranes is inversely proportional to the thickness of the membrane and therefore, thinner Pd alloy membranes are more desirable for their increased rate of hydrogen flux and lower cost for the palladium and alloy metal components.  illustrates the effect of the thickness of the membrane and the relationship with flux.
