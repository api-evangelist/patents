{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","ADDITIONAL EXAMPLES","Exemplary Operating Environment","Appendix A","Appendix B","Description of Terms","Appendix C"],"p":["Thermal strain is a leading cause of discomfort in clothing. Different materials provide different thermal comfort characteristics for a wearer of the materials in a particular environment. Further, changes in material properties result in discernible differences to the wearer. Typically, an actual product use test is required to determine whether a particular change to one of the material properties results in a meaningful difference to the wearer.","Some existing systems attempt to model human thermal comfort. These existing models, however, are limited to a single garment on a human subject or fail to account for various factors such as environmental conditions (e.g., work conditions), garment use scenarios, or physiological data for the specific human subject evaluating the garment. Methods exist that attempt to describe the thermal strain of a human, clothing, environment system. This type of model places emphasis on describing the physiological changes to the subject and characterizes clothing ensembles and fabric layers as a single barrier to heat and moisture movement. This ignores the significance of fabric and air layers as places where heat and moisture may be stored or produced. Other models focus on characterizing heat and moisture movement in fabric layer systems but simplify or ignore the interaction with the subject.","Existing software packages incorporate subject physical properties, their activity level, environmental conditions and clothing characteristics. While these types of models provide insight into thermal stress and thermal comfort for particular clothing ensembles, these existing models do not provide for the calculation of the moisture and thermal insulation properties of these ensembles nor do they account for the dynamics of the fabric properties such as heat of sorption. Additionally they ignore the thermal and moisture capacity of the fabric and air layers and are generally designed only for determining long-term, steady state conditions. Further, the existing models fail to consider the dynamics of the clothing ensemble during usage conditions that are relatively short in duration.","Embodiments of the invention predict thermal strain by computer modeling a plurality of fabric layers on a subject. At least one gap exists between the layers. Data corresponding to input parameters is received from a user. Output data is generated by the computer model as a function of the received input data. The output data indicates the thermal strain. The user evaluates the fabric layers based on the indicated thermal strain.","This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the drawings.","Embodiments of the invention predict thermal strain on a subject such as shown in . In an embodiment, the thermal strain is a function of subject data, fabric data, and environmental condition data. The fabric data corresponds to a plurality of fabric layers such as an inner layer and an outer layer separated by a gap. In an embodiment, the thermal strain is represented by a visual representation of the subject with the fabric layers. Other aspects of the invention provide an interactive model enabling users to provide and adjust input data to compare and evaluate fabric layers. Users may provide input data corresponding to particular garments to predict and compare the thermal strain resulting from the garments being worn by the subject. For example, aspects of the invention predict the physiological response by the subject to a particular user activity level, external environment conditions, and clothing layers including protective garments.","It will be appreciated that the exemplary thermal comfort model illustrated and described herein is applicable to any combination of fabric layers on a subject. The fabric layers may be woven materials, knit materials, films, and nonwoven webs including, but not limited to spunbond, meltblown, spunbond\/meltblown\/spunbond, hydroentangled materials, air laid and wet laid structures. Without undue experimentation, the model is applicable to any fabric, garment, or article of clothing that comes into contact with any portion of the subject. For example, the applicable garments include coveralls, surgical gowns, outdoor apparel, and the like. Further, the subject may be any object that interacts with its environment in the form of heat and moisture. As an example, the subject may be a human or any other animal.","Referring again to , an exemplary flow chart illustrates the prediction of thermal strain based on an exemplary thermal comfort model. The model provides a technical basis for understanding thermal comfort in various fabrics including coveralls, surgical gowns, outdoor apparel, or other garments or articles of clothing. The applicable garments may be disposable, semi-durable, or durable. The prediction of thermal strain estimates the impact of fabric changes without requiring a use test. At , a computerized model of a plurality of fabric layers on a subject is defined. The fabric layers have at least one gap between them. The process loops at  until data is received from a user. Data is received at  from the user. The received data includes, for example, data corresponding to one or more input parameters for the defined model. Alternatively or in addition, the received data may be a command to execute the model based on default inputs, or data relating to one or more characteristics of the subject, garment, or environmental conditions (e.g., work situations). The model executes based on the received data to predict thermal strain. Output parameter data is generated at  as a function of the defined model and the received data. The generated output parameter data is provided to the user at . The user evaluates the fabric layers based on the output parameter data.","The term \u2018fabric\u2019 refers to woven, knitted, nonwoven, and film materials such as spunbond, meltblown, spunbond\/meltblown\/spunbond, film laminates, and other like materials. The outer fabric layer may represent for example Coveralls, surgical gowns, etc. These fabric layers can be designed to be disposable, semi-durable, or durable.","For example, aspects of the invention enable the user to compare different combinations of fabric layers for product development. Further, the compared combinations of fabric layers may be used to market one of the combinations over another of the combinations. For example, the user is able to identify differences in fabric performance in a particular work condition represented by the input data and to market the fabric layers based on the identified differences. Another example includes determining optimal work-rest cycles for workers wearing the garments based on the predicted thermal strain to which the workers will be subjected.","In an alternative embodiment, the input parameters are identified to the user (e.g., via an application programming interface) and provided to the user along with the defined model for execution. Further, defined data relating to the subject, garment, or environmental conditions is provided to the user (e.g., in one or more databases or files).","Referring next to , an exemplary block diagram illustrates a user  interacting with a computing device  via a user interface . The computing device  includes a memory area  and a processor . The memory area  includes one or more computer-readable media. While illustrated as part of the computing device , the computer-readable media may be external to the computing device  yet connected (e.g., via a network). Further, any combination of the elements illustrated as being stored on the computer-readable media may be stored on separate media.","The memory area  stores a computerized model  of one or more garments on a subject wherein the garments have at least one gap between them. While the gap is described in examples herein as being an air gap, other gaps such as a liquid gap or a solid barrier between the garments is contemplated. The model  includes equations for simulating the garments on the subject, and includes logic for solving the equations in an embodiment. The memory area  further stores environmental condition data , subject data , and garment data . The environmental condition data  includes, for example, ambient air temperature, humidity, and -ambient air speed. The environmental condition data  may also include one or more predefined work environments such as indoor or outdoor construction or a laboratory. In such an embodiment, the processor  is configured to receive a selection of one of the predefined work environments and to execute the model  based on the selected work environment. In some embodiments, the user  is able to modify the predefined work environments or define a new work environment.","The subject data  includes, for example, the height, weight, age, gender, metabolic rate, and activity level of the subject. The garment data  includes data describing the fabric layers to be modeled on the subject. The garment data  includes, for example, fiber type, basis weight, and moisture content, moisture permeability and thermal insulation. Additional examples of the environmental condition data , subject data , and garment data  are listed in Appendix A.","Generally, embodiments of the invention receive data from the user  to modify one or more of the environmental condition data , subject data , and garment data  stored in the memory area . As an example, at least a portion of the data for the model  stored in the memory area  is provided to the user  for display on the user interface . The user  selects (e.g., via a user interface selection device), a portion of the displayed model data for modification or provides new model data (e.g., to define a new garment). The model  is then executed based on the data received from the user .","In general, aspects of the invention are embodied as application programs executing on the computing device , applications executing in a networked environment, and\/or applications executing as a web service. In the example of , the memory area  stores one or more computer-executable components for implementing aspects of the invention. The computer-executable components include a memory component , a simulation component , and a user interface component . The memory component  stores the environmental condition data , subject data , and garment data  (e.g., as received from the user  or another data source such as a manufacturer of the garment). The simulation component  provides the logic for executing the model . The user interface component  executes in an embodiment of the invention in which the user  interacts with the user interface .","In operation, the processor  is configured to communicate with the memory area  and to execute the computer-executable components or instructions. As an example, the user interface component  receives input data from the user  for the simulation component . The input data corresponds to one or more of the data stored by the memory component . The simulation component  executes based on the input data received by the user interface component  to generate output data. The user interface component  provides the output data from the simulation component  to the user interface  for dispay to the user  as an indication of the physiological response by the subject to the input data. In an embodiment, the response by the subject corresponds to the degree of strain on the subject due to the stress (e.g., the stress corresponds to the input data such as the temperature).","In an embodiment, the user interface component  provides the output data on a visual representation  of the fabric layers or garments on the subject. For example, the visual representation  includes a torso of a human subject wearing the garments. Some or all of the output data may be included in the visual representation . In some embodiments, the user  selects the output data for inclusion in the visual representation .","Referring next to , an exemplary flow chart illustrates operation of an exemplary thermal comfort model according to an embodiment of the invention. The process begins at . At , data is input to the model as extensible markup language (XML) data. Initial values and boundary conditions are set for the model at . Model equations (e.g., for mass and heat conservation) are solved at  based on the set initial values and boundary conditions. The distribution of heat and water in the fabric layers is calculated at . The changes in subject physiology due to thermoregulation processes are calculated at . The state of the model is stored or recorded at . At , if the model has completed (e.g., based on the boundary conditions set at ), the process stops at . Otherwise, a time value is incremented at  and processing continues at .","Referring next to , an exemplary block diagram illustrates heat and moisture movement  in an exemplary thermal comfort model. The exemplary thermal comfort model illustrated in  accounts for thermal regulation. The thermal regulation of the body is due to both the conduction of heat and the evaporation of moisture. The schematic of the moisture movement is nearly identical to heat movement. The chambers represent the locations where heat can accumulate. This includes an inner fabric layer for the undergarments  (e.g., t-shirt), an outer fabric layer for the product  (e.g., a coverall), and a layer for an air gap between the inner fabric layer and the outer fabric layer (microclimate ). The rate at which heat transfers from each representative chamber is dependent on the difference in heat (as indicated by water level on the schematic) and how open the valve is between each chamber.","It will be appreciated that the individual layers described and illustrated herein differ from a laminate garment fabric.","The person produces heat in proportion to the work their body is doing. Physical work done  by the body is typically at or below 10% of the energy consumed. The large knob on the metabolic rate tube indicates the consumption of energy by the body. The efficiency of the body to convert energy consumed into energy that accomplishes work is represented by the adjacent \u2018work efficiency\u2019 knob. Energy used to do work is removed at this location. The remaining energy is heat energy and fills the body core chamber changing the core temperature.","Heat leaves the body core chamber  either through respiration  or through loss to the skin layer as heat is transferred by the blood. The rate of loss through respiration depends on the respiration (breaths per minute) and vapor and temperature difference  between the lungs and outside air. The rate heat transferred by blood movement depends on the heart rate and the vasodilatation of the capillaries in the skin. Several empirical relationships have been published in the literature that characterize these terms.","The body core chamber has a measuring stick with level markers. If the body temperature rises above the upper mark, the body starts producing sweat as a function of the difference in temperature from the nominal body temperature (33.7\u00b0 C. for skin, 36.8\u00b0 C. for body core). Below the lowest mark the body will start shivering to increase metabolic rate. The rate that heat transfers from the skin to the undergarment is dependent on the difference in the two water levels and how open the valve  \u2018V\u2019 is. The rate heat increases the temperature in the undergarment chamber (represented by height of fluid) depends on the specific heat of the undergarment fabric (represented by the size of that chamber). Similarly the rate vapor pressure (represented by height of fluid) in the undergarment increases depends on the volume of air in the fabric (represented by size of that chamber). The rate the fluid level rises is dependent on how fast water flows in, and the size of the chamber. The rate temperature increases depends not only on the increase in heat energy, but also the heat capacity of the layer. In the same way heat is transferred to the microclimate from the undergarment. The difference in fluid height (temperature) and the setting of \u2018V\u2019 knob will drive the rate at which the heat is transferred. And similarly heat into the product \u2018V\u2019 and heat loss from product into the outside \u2018V\u2019. If the garment blocks or slows the transfer of moisture to the outside (as with protective clothing designed to keep dangerous fluids out), the core temperature will continue to rise, and the body will suffer heat stress. The proper design of protective clothing requires taking the flow of heat and moisture through each layer into account.","The \u2018V\u2019, \u2018V\u2019, \u2018V\u2019, and \u2018V\u2019 knobs determining the rates of heat flux from one chamber to another are related to but not identical to those driving moisture flux from one chamber to another. The \u201cLewis Relation\u201d for example relates the moisture transfer coefficient to the heat transfer coefficient for the case of air convection driven transfer.","Thermal radiation coming from either sunlight or other sources of radiated heat adds to the product temperature. The large knob indicates the magnitude of the heat source. Direct sunlight for example can average more than 100 W\/mand can be the predominant heat flux in the system. The small knob on the radiation tube indicates that the heat rate from radiation that enters the fabric depends on the fabric. Reflective fabrics for example reduce the absorption of thermal radiation.","Referring next to , an exemplary block diagram illustrates heat and moisture movement  among the layers in an exemplary thermal comfort model. The model is constructed such that at each time step heat energy and water mass are conserved as they move from one layer or portion of one layer to another. Transport mechanisms such as convection, conduction, diffusion, and radiation are considered when calculating the magnitude of the various heat and moisture fluxes. This exemplary model is constructed with one undergarment fabric layer  at some average internal temperature of \u2018Tu\u2019 and average internal vapor pressure of \u2018Vu\u2019 adjacent the subjects skin  at some average skin temperature of \u2018Tsk\u2019. Additionally the model has one microclimate air layer  at some average air temperature \u2018Tm\u2019 and some average water vapor pressure of \u2018Vm\u2019 between fabric layer  and outer garment fabric layer . The outer garment fabric layer has an internal temperature of \u2018Tc\u2019 and an internal water vapor pressure of \u2018Vc\u2019. The outside air layer  is adjacent the outer garment fabric layer  and is represented by an average air temperature \u2018Tout\u2019 and an average water vapor pressure \u2018Vout\u2019 as well as a radiant surface temperature \u2018Trad\u2019. The boundary between the undergarment fabric  and the microclimate air layer  is at some average temperature \u2018Tum\u2019 and average water vapor pressure \u2018Vum\u2019. The boundary between the microclimate air layer  and the outer garment fabric layer  is at an average temperature of \u2018Tmc\u2019 and average water vapor pressure of \u2018Vmc\u2019. Similarly, the boundary between the outer garment fabric layer  and the outside air layer  has an average temperature of \u2018Tco\u2019, and average water vapor pressure of \u2018Vco\u2019. The surface area of each of the layers is not necessarily the same and increases as you move outward from the skin. The skin surface area \u2018Ask\u2019 is smaller than the undergarment surface area \u2018Au\u2019. The microclimate surface area \u2018Am\u2019 is taken to be the average of \u2018Au\u2019 and the outer garment surface area \u2018Ac\u2019. It should be recognized that the inside surface of one fabric layer does not necessarily have the same surface area as the outside surface of the same fabric layer. In the case of some thick outer garments the difference is meaningful and should be incorporated into the model. The heat and moisture fluxes into the fabric and air layers in the model are not necessarily the same as the fluxes out of these layers. The difference between the fluxes going in and coming out is accumulation or depletion of moisture and or heat in that layer. Any such accumulation or depletion of heat and moisture change the temperature and moisture content of that layer respectively. The arrows represent heat and moisture fluxes at a particular point in time. The terms starting with QC represent heat fluxes due to convection. Terms starting with M are moisture fluxes due to convection. Terms starting with QR represent heat fluxes caused by thermal radiation. Terms starting with QE are heat fluxes from either evaporation or condensation of liquid. The ME terms represent moisture fluxes caused by evaporation or condensation. A detailed description of these terms is provided in Appendix C.","The term \u2018MEst\u2019 represents moisture lost through the skin from diffusion. This transepidermal water loss (TEWL) is proportional to the gradient of moisture in the stratum corneum layer. The moisture content of the outside surface of the skin depends on the relative humidity of the air in contact with the skin. The relative humidity of the air is further dependent on the temperature and vapor pressure of that air which is in turn dependent on the transepidermal water loss. It is possible to include the calculations for transepidermal water loss as part of the thermal comfort model. A natural consequence of the calculation of TEWL is an estimate of the moisture content of the stratum corneum. Various physical properties of the skin, for example permeability to chemicals, can therefore be estimated.","Referring to , an exemplary block diagram illustrates heat and moisture movement among the layers in an exemplary thermal comfort model. The boundary  between the fabric layer  and the air gap layer  has convective heat transfer from the fabric  into the adjacent air . Heat transfer from radiation at boundary  leaves fabric  and enters fabric  at boundary . Radiation of heat from the outside fabric layer  is exchanged with an outside radiant surface  that is not necessarily at the same temperature as the surrounding air layer . Heat can also be lost or gained by evaporation or condensation of water at boundaries between fabric and air layers. Fluid layers  at these boundaries can increase or decrease in size as water is added or removed. Liquid water in these fluid layers  can also move by capillary forces in the adjacent fabric layers. The capillary forces are dependent on the contact angle between the liquid and fiber surfaces and is therefore dependent on the material making up the fiber as well as any surface treatments. In an exemplary thermal comfort model any fluid layer  at a fabric air boundary is assumed to be absorbed into the fabric when the fiber making up that fabric layer is hydrophilic. Alternate thermal comfort models make use of models of fluid flow in porous structures to calculate the dynamic motion of fluid in the fabric layers. Additionally, transfer of moisture vapor from one layer to another can occur by convection.","Layers of air captured between fabric layers or between fabric and skin are typically in motion due either to natural convection or from forced convection due to bulk air movement. In an embodiment of this invention, the model optionally includes air exchange between the air layer  and the outside air . This exchange of air  can bring in or remove heat and or moisture. Such exchange occurs as air escapes from the microclimate spaces through gaps in the clothing such as those that occur at the cuffs and collar, in such cases air moves around the fabric and not through the fabric. Air exchange through the garment may also be incorporated.","Radiant heat exchange between inner garments  and outer garments  has been found to be as much as 25% of the overall heat loss from the body. Radiant heat from sunlight can be well over 100 watts per square meter or more in direct sunlight. Radiant heat exchange with the outside environment can be a dominant factor in determining the thermal stress to which the subject is exposed.","The heat and moisture fluxes are balanced in such a way that both heat and moisture are conserved throughout the entire system at any point in time. Any appropriate mathematical procedure may be employed to solve the conservation equations such as the Newton-Raphson method.","Referring to , an exemplary diagram illustrates heat and moisture transfer within a fabric layer. Heat and moisture transfer into our out of the fabric layer at any point in time will cause redistribution of heat and moisture within the fabric layer. The fabric layer  is made up of a mass of fibers  and interstitial air . In one embodiment of the thermal comfort model changes in heat and moisture are redistributed between fiber, air and liquid water zones such that they are in local equilibrium. In this approach the total fiber  moisture content is such that the relative humidity of the air  are in equilibrium as determined by sorption isotherm curves representing the specific type of material making up the fiber. The existence of liquid water held in the capillary structure  between fibers can occur only when the fibers have reached 100% saturation equivalent to the moisture content on the sorption isotherm curve when the relative humidity is 100%. Liquid at the interfaces  will be incorporated into the fabric when the material making up the fibers is hydrophilic. This water is distributed into the fibers  as absorbed water and into the interstitial air  as humidity. In the case where the air and fibers are saturated or become saturated by incoming water, the additional water is added to water adsorbed onto the fiber surfaces . In the case where water is leaving the fabric, the adsorbed water  is removed first, and then if needed removed from water absorbed in the fibers and the surrounding air in a proportion determined by the sorption isotherm curve. When water changes state as in the case of absorption into the fiber, or condensation\/evaporation from liquid water, heat is generated or absorbed in accordance with latent heat of vaporization or heat of sorption as appropriate.","Referring next to  and , exemplary equations that govern the computational portion of the exemplary thermal comfort model represented in , A, and B.  illustrates exemplary equations  for conservation of energy while  illustrates exemplary equations  for conservation of mass. In an embodiment, the illustrated equations ,  are solved simultaneously based on the input parameter data. Appendix C provides a detailed description of the terms and meaning of each term in the equations.","The accuracy of the exemplary model was confirmed via a comfort study for individuals. The study was designed to cover a range of environmental and use conditions as well as undergarment and outer garment fabrics and styles. The outer garments were disposable protective coveralls with hoods. The coverall fabric did not cover face, hands, or feet. The study conditions were chosen using a Placket-Burman design to maximize orthogonality of the independent variables. Test subjects ingested a temperature probe that provided a continuous measure of core body temperature. Skin temperature was measured in five separate locations. An electrocardiogram was taken throughout the study to indicate heart rate. Chest expansion was measured to quantify breath rate and tidal volume. Sweat loss and evaporation was quantified gravimetrically. Temperature and relative humidity was measured in the air space between the undergarments and coverall. Good correlation was found between the model's predicted values and the results of the comfort study.","Referring next to , exemplary comfort levels are illustrated in a graph  of water vapor pressure to temperature. The plotted set of points represents the temperature and vapor pressure of the air layer between undergarment and coveralls. The state of the microclimate when the subject dons a coverall is shown at point . The subject then acclimates to a new temperature for  minutes to point . During this time, the temperature increases, but the water vapor pressure stays relatively constant because the subject has not yet begun to sweat to attempt to regulate temperature. The garment is breathable enough to let the sensible perspiration (moisture that transpires through the stratum corneum) pass through. At point , the subject begins light stepping exercise for 30 minutes to point . Here, the subject begins to sweat to help remove the internal heat generated by the exercise. The water vapor pressure increases, but the temperature stays constant because the air within the garment is not yet saturated and the sweat can evaporate and remove heat at a constant temperature. Even though the temperature remains constant, this subject moves into the uncomfortable range (e.g., point ) because the increasing humidity makes it more difficult to remove heat efficiently. This figure represents one approach to characterizing thermal comfort of individuals based on the temperature and humidity of the air surrounding a subject's body. Other empirical models exist that provide a PMV or \u201cPredicted Mean Vote\u201d for thermal comfort based on physiological stress indicators like core and skin temperature.","Referring next to , example output results describing the temperature and percent relative humidity of the air layer between the undergarment fabric and the outer garment are illustrated in a graph . This graph illustrates the dynamic nature of the air layer as it accommodates heat and moisture coming and going through the adjacent fabric layers.","Referring next to , estimated core body temperature values are graphed as a function of time. In addition, this chart includes the estimated thermal comfort level for this subject. There are many empirical models of thermal comfort, some of which are known in the art. For example, existing literature provides equations relating physiological and environmental state with thermal comfort. This graph  illustrates the change in comfort level as the core body temperature increases over time.","Referring next to  and , in an embodiment of the thermal comfort model, any of the input parameters to the model are represented not by a single value but by a distribution of values. These graphs serve as examples of the types of comparisons that may be made using the thermal comfort model and distributions of input parameters. The Monte-Carlo type simulation may be employed as a method for estimating any of the output parameters such as thermal strain for a population of input parameters. The graph  provides an example of the predicted fractions of users wearing a t-shirt and jeans who were at a comfort level of six or less on a ten-point scale, with zero being \u201cthe coldest you've ever been\u201d, five being \u201cneutral, neither cold nor warm\u201d, and ten being \u201cthe hottest you've ever been\u201d. In this graph, the various plotted curves represent different level of cooling applied directly to the skin in watts per square meter. Input parameters for subject weight and height and age were selected randomly from a distribution of subjects.","Referring next to , using the same Monte Carlo method and pulling from the same distribution of subjects, graph  represents the estimated percentage of subjects that were comfortable wearing undergarments and a coverall. When compared with graph  in  it is possible to estimate the percentage increase in uncomfortable subjects when they wear a coverall over T-shirt and Jeans.","Referring next to , an exemplary flow chart illustrates user interaction with an exemplary thermal comfort model. The process begins at . At , a visual representation of the subject is provided to a user for dispay on a user interface. The visual representation includes a plurality of fabric layers on the subject where the fabric layers have at least one gap between them. User input is received at  (e.g., via a user interface selection device such as a pointing device or keyboard) and converted into, for example, XML data at . The thermal comfort model corresponding to the provided visual representation is accessed and executed at  based on the XML data. The model simulates the thermal comfort of the subject wearing the plurality of fabric layers and generates output XML data at . For example, the output XML data indicates a core temperature and hydration level of the subject over a user-defined time period. The hydration may be used as an indication of the skin health of the subject. Alternatively or in addition, the output XML data indicates the permeability of the subject's skin to polar materials and\/or non-polar materials such as toxins.","The visual representation of the subject is modified at  based on the generated output XML data to indicate the thermal comfort of the subject. For example, the visual representation of the subject is modified to reflect the core temperature and hydration level of the subject over the user-defined time period. In embodiments, data corresponding to the modified visual representation is provided to the user for dispay on the user interface. If the user wants to alter the input data at , the process continues at . Otherwise, the process stops at .","Referring next to , an exemplary user interface  shows a side-by-side comparison of different garments modeled on a human subject. A portion of the user interface  identifies the particular garments modeled, the duration for model execution, ambient air temperature, air speed, a work environment, user information, and user activity level. The gap between the fabric layers is exposed on the visual representation of the human subject. The visual representation includes any representation capable of indicating thermal comfort anywhere on the spectrum of representation from photo-realistic representations to cartoon (e.g., anthropomorthic). A chart on the user interface  is used to indicate the predicted thermal comfort level of each garment. In an embodiment, chart is color-coded corresponding to the comfort levels such as \u201ccomfortable,\u201d \u201cwarning,\u201d and \u201cdanger\u201d over time. The thermal strain is also reflected in the visual representation of the human subject. In an embodiment, the visual representation of the subject is updated to refer to the thermal strain of the subject at a user specified time. In an embodiment, an alert such as a visual or audio alert is provided to the user when the comfort level exceeds a predefined (e.g., user-defined) threshold.","In the example of , the air temperature is represented by the background color, the temperature of any radiant heat\/cool source is represented by the bar above the head of each subject represents, the microclimate temperature (e.g., temperature of the space between the subject and the outer garment) is represented by the color of the air gap, the temperature of the subject is represented by skin color, and the overall thermal comfort is represented by the facial expression on the subject (e.g., smile, frown, grimace, and the like). Further, the predicted perspiration rate of the subject is indicated graphically as perspiration (e.g., a quantity of beads of sweat) on the subject or the garment. The microclimate area is shown as a \u201ccutaway\u201d view of the garment on the subject. If the thermal strain determination yields a value that exceeds a particular threshold (e.g., pre-defined or user-defined), the eyes of the subject are shown as crossed-out. Exemplary thresholds include a high temperature (e.g., greater than 38 degrees Celsius) or dehydration (e.g., greater than 5% body mass has been lost).","With the first and second visual representations of the human subject in , the user interface  enables the user to compare different garment combinations exposed to the same conditions (e.g., subject data and environmental or working conditions). Aspects of the invention enable the user to identify differences between garments and market one particular garment over the other based on the identified differences.","For example, in , a user conducts a side-by-side comparison of the KLEENGUARD\u00ae A10 Coveralls to the KLEENGUARD\u00ae A40 Coveralls, both available from the Kimberly-Clark Corporation, Roswell, Ga.","Referring next to , an exemplary user interface  shows fields for entry of subject data by a user. The user interface  includes fields for entry of height and weight of the subjects along with a basal metabolic rate. In an embodiment, the height and weight are used to determine the basal metabolic rate and skin surface areas. Other user-specific parameters are within the scope of the invention such as gender and whether the user is acclimated to the heat.

description of the input parameters.","Exemplary input and output parameters and data are shown in Appendix A. In particular, an output file from a model according to an embodiment of the invention includes all the information from an input file, but adds time dependent data. In the example in Appendix A, the element Static_Vars includes all the basic properties of the model that do not change with time and includes sub-nodes for Subject, Environment, and Clothing. The element Dynamic_Vars includes all the time nodes (e.g., the state of the model at specific times). The Dynamic_Vars element contains a set of TimeData nodes. The first TimeData node has a Type attribute set to \u2018Initial\u2019 and indicates the initial values for each of the dynamic parameters in the model. Subsequent TimeData nodes with Type attributes set to \u2018Run\u2019 are output results from the model and represent the state of the model at a time indicated by the ModelTime subnode.","Alternately, input parameters may be time dependent. Such input data sets would change one or more of the model parameters to represent for example changes occurring in work environment, clothing type, or activity level. One method for implementing this type of input flexibility uses a single data format for input and output data sets. The resulting output data from running the model can be used as input data for a subsequent model input data set. Changes can be made to a single input parameter or set of input parameters model an instantaneous change in the state of the model. Concatenation of the outputs of each model run then simulates the condition when a model parameter changes.","The Summary element includes result calculations from the end of the model. The element Limit_ represents the time it took for the subject to lose 50% of the acceptable water loss value. The element Limit_ represents the time it took to lose 95% of the water value. The element Limit_Tre represents the time it took for the subject to reach 38\u00b0 C. core body temperature. The element Limit_Comf represents the time it took for the subject to reach \u201c2\u201d (e.g., Very Hot) on the thermal comfort scale. It will be appreciated that data for some or all of these elements may be represented in the user interfaces illustrated herein.","A computing device such as computing device  in  or a computer has one or more processors or processing units and a system memory.
