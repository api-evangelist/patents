{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This invention relates to smoking articles in general and more particularly, to a smoking article having enhanced flavor delivery.","In recent years there has been a tendency in the tobacco industry to produce tobacco products, particularly cigarettes, having filters with greater filtering efficiency and higher levels of dilution. This high filter efficiency and greater dilution reduces the total particulate matter or tar level of the cigarette and hence reduces the flavor to some extent.","Traditional, lit-end cigarettes comprise a cylindrical tobacco rod portion that is between 7.0 and 10.0 mm in diameter and 60 mm and 125 mm in length. The tobacco rod portion, which is composed of one or more selected types of cut tobacco, is wrapped in cigarette paper along its outer circumference. A filter, preferably of cellulose acetate or some other cellulosic material, is attached, in end-to-end relation, to the mouth end of the tobacco rod by a filter wrap. During puffs, smoke from the lit end of the cigarette travels the length of the tobacco rod and through the filter to the smoker.","U.S. Pat. No. 3,356,094 to Ellis et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,340,072 to Bolt et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 4,732,168 to Resce et al. describe examples of smoking articles having a tobacco column with a tubular member therethrough, wherein the tube is filled with an aerosol releasing material. In these patents, smoke from the burning tobacco is mixed with the aerosol.","U.S. Pat. No. 4,924,886 to Litzinger discloses a smoking article having a central tube of an impermeable material located within a tobacco column, wherein the central tube contains a heat absorbing, porous non-tobacco substrate including a flavor releasing material. The flavor releasing material is mixed with the porous substrate and the flavor is volatile at the smoldering temperature of the tobacco in the tobacco column. An aerosol generating material also impregnates the porous substrate and becomes aerosolized by the heat generated by the smoldering tobacco.","In U.S. Pat. No. 4,984,588 to Stewart and U.S. Pat. No. 3,756,249 to Selke et al., a longitudinally extending tube is provided within the cigarette, surrounded by the tobacco filler material and an outer cigarette wrapper, with the longitudinally extending tube serving as an internal air passageway within the cigarette. In these known smoking articles, the central longitudinally extending tube is impermeable to air flow, and therefore serves to control the amount of dilution of the mainstream smoke depending on whether the impermeable tube is open to air flow or closed.","In U.S. Pat. No. 4,984,588 to Stewart, a smoking article is provided with a hollow, elongated tube of a combustible, heat fusible and air impermeable material that extends from approximately 5 mm from the mouth end of the filter to approximately 10 mm short of the end of the tobacco segment. As the cigarette is smoked, relatively undiluted smoke enters the tube during the initial several puffs and is delivered in a virtually unfiltered condition. After the first several puffs, the tube is melted shut and normal dilution occurs.","In view of the tendency for cigarettes to have greater filtering efficiency and higher levels of dilution, a cigarette structure that provides improved flavor delivery would be desirable. Furthermore, in the existing cigarettes provided with longitudinally extending tubes that remain open at an end to air flow through the tube, ambient air flows through the tube with very little resistance to the flow, and therefore any transfer of heat through the tube from the burning coal at the end of the cigarette would be negligible.","A cigarette according to an embodiment of the invention comprises a cylinder of smoking material or tobacco rod and a filter attached in end-to-end relationship to the cylinder of smoking material. The cylinder of smoking material has a hollow central tube of porous paper or other suitable material and tobacco filler between the hollow tube and an outer layer of cigarette wrapper paper. The filter element, which is cylindrical in shape and substantially conforms to the cross-sectional size and shape of the cylinder of smoking material can be constructed with several segments. One segment of the filter element can comprise a hollow tube of material such as cellulose acetate material, which is aligned with and connected end-to-end with the cylinder of smoking material. A further segment of the filter element can comprise capsules of a flavor material, wherein the flavor material is released by thermal energy. The filter element can also include a solid cylindrical segment of a filtering material, such as cellulose acetate at the mouth (buccal) end of the filter element.","The hollow central tube of porous or perforated material within the cylinder of smoking material is constructed to have the property of collapsing closed at one end when that end is heated by the burning coal of the cigarette. The tube extends within the cylinder of smoking material all the way from the filter element to the end of the cigarette opposite from the filter. When the cigarette is lit at the end opposite from the filter, the tobacco will combust as in a normal cigarette, generating smoke components and heat energy.","During a draw upon the cigarette, the flow in the cigarette takes place in two regions, one through the tobacco bed contained between the hollow tube and the outer cigarette wrapper paper, and the other through the burning coal and the hollow tube. Because the pressure drop in the hollow tube is extremely low compared to the pressure drop through the tobacco bed, hot air coming out of the burning coal into the hollow tube flows to the segment of the filter containing flavor capsules and delivers significant heat energy to the flavor capsules. When the end of the hollow tube near the burning coal is closed by the heat of the coal, the remaining portion of the tube toward the filter remains open and allows the flow of air into the tube as a result of its porosity and\/or perforations. Heat is transferred through the hollow tube by convection from the burning coal at one end of the cigarette to the flavor capsule segment of the filter. The flavorant released by the application of this thermal energy to the flavor capsules is delivered through the remaining portion of the filter.","Referring initially to , a longitudinal cross-section of an embodiment of the invention is shown wherein a smoking article  includes a filter portion  and a cylinder of smoking material or tobacco rod . The cylinder of smoking material  can include a central hollow tube , surrounded by tobacco filler material , and an outer layer of cigarette wrapper (paper)  that extends from the cylinder of smoking material over the filter section and joins the filter section  to the cylinder of smoking material  in end-to-end relationship.","The central tube  within the cylinder of smoking material  preferably extends all the way to the end of the cigarette opposite from the filter end of the cigarette. The end of the tube  is preferably aligned with and abuts a hollow segment  of the filter portion .","The hollow segment  of the filter  provides a central air passageway leading from the hollow tube  of the cylinder of smoking material to a segment  of the filter that preferably includes flavorant adapted to be released by exposure to thermal energy. The filter portion  also includes a mouthpiece filter portion  of filtering material such as cellulose acetate tow.","As illustrated in , the central hollow tube  of the cylinder smoking material  can be constructed such that heat applied to an end of the tube will cause the end portion of the tube to collapse upon itself and seal off (or close) the end of the tube. The collapsing feature can be achieved by a number of different embodiments of the hollow tube. In one alternative, such as shown in , the tube  can be constructed in a layered arrangement such that an outer or top layer  is made from a material having a higher thermal expansion coefficient than an inner or bottom layer . As a result, when the end of the tube is heated, the difference in thermal expansion coefficient between the two layers will result in the end portion of the tube collapsing upon itself and sealing off the end. The layers of the hollow tube can be constructed from different types of paper having the different thermal expansion coefficients. The difference in thermal expansion coefficients of the layers can be a result of the types of paper having different proportions of cellulose and\/or different binders.","In the alternative, the tube is made of an axially oriented polymer structure, which when heated will collapse. One of the materials that could be used is carboxymethylcellulose (CMC). Another material that could be used is starch based film which has the property of collapsing when heated or burning.","Another arrangement includes two layers of material having the same or different thermal expansion coefficient, with a coating applied to either or both layers, or an intermediate layer of an encapsulated material between the layers wherein the coating material or intermediate layer of encapsulated material will vaporize upon exposure to thermal energy from the burning coal, and the expanding vapor will cause the inner layer to collapse on itself and seal off the end of the hollow tube.","The material from which the hollow tube is constructed can be selected not only for the feature of collapsing on itself upon exposure to the heat from the burning coal, but also such that is has a desired porosity to air. The porosity to air is preferably measured in CORESTA units (defined as the amount of air, measured in cubic centimeters, that passes through one square centimeter of material in one minute at a pressure drop of 1.0 kilopascals) as is known in the cigarette making industry, with the porosity preferably being greater than 10 CORESTA and less than 100 CORESTA. Alternatively, the material of the hollow tube can be perforated to achieve the desired CORESTA, allowing the flow of air through the wall of the tube as well as through the center, hollow portion of the tube.","Thermal energy from the burning coal  can enter into the hollow tube  at or near the end that collapses closed as a result of the heat from the burning coal. When the cigarette is lit and a puff up is drawn upon the cigarette, air flow in the cigarette takes place in two regions, one through the annular bed of tobacco filler material  contained between the tube  and the outer cigarette wrapper , and the other through the burning coal  and the hollow tube . This air flow is illustrated by arrows  in FIG. .","Because the resistance to flow and therefore pressure drop in the hollow portion of the tube  is extremely low compared to the pressure drop through the tobacco bed , the hot air coming out of the burning coal  flows most readily through the tube  and to the flavorant adapted to be released by exposure to thermal energy contained within segment  of the filter portion . As the cigarette is smoked the heat from the burning coal  progressively shrinks the end of the central tube  and ensures that air entering the tube  is heated by the burning coal  rather than allowing cooler ambient air to enter the tube  through end . Heat from the burning coal  is transferred through the tube  to the flavorant adapted to be released by exposure to thermal energy segment , thereby delivering significant thermal heat energy to the flavorant adapted to be released by exposure to thermal energy. Accordingly, a cigarette according to the invention enhances delivery of flavorants from the flavor capsules contained within segment  of the filter as a result of the convective heat transfer of thermal energy from the burning coal  through the central tube .","It will be understood that the foregoing description is of the preferred embodiments of the invention only and is, therefore, merely representative. Many variations and modifications of the present invention in light of the above teachings will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. For example, the heat drawn from the burning coal  may be used to release or activate thermal-activated agents other than encapsulated flavors, such as thermally activated catalysts or absorbants. Accordingly, the exemplary embodiment of the invention, as well as alternative embodiments, may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the attached claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["A more complete appreciation of the invention and the advantages of the invention will be readily apparent by reference to the following detailed description, when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
