Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to the field of surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices, and specifically to improvements to in their manufacturing which then provides additional applications for use.","2. Description of the Prior Art","Acoustic wave sensors use a detection arrangement that is based on perturbations to mechanical or acoustic waves. As an acoustic wave propagates through or on the surface of the acoustive wave sensor material, any changes to the physical or chemical characteristics of the wave path may affect the velocity and\/or amplitude of the acoustic wave. These changes may be correlated to the corresponding physical, chemical, or biological quantities being measured to provide sensing.","There may be various biological and chemical sensors, using fiber optics, chemical interactions, and various fluorescence approaches. Such sensors may, however, have various weaknesses, such as, for example, low sensitivity, selectivity, or an inability to be hybridized or integrated into sensing chip technology. Acoustic wave (AW) sensors, however, may be better suited for use in biological and chemical detection. As discussed in D. S. Ballantine, R. M. White, S. J. Martin, A. J. Ricco, E. T. Zellers, G. C. Frye, H. Wohltjen, \u201cAcoustic Wave Sensor\u2014Theory, Design, and Physico-Chemical Applications\u201d, Academic Press, (1997), acoustic wave sensors may use piezoelectric crystals, which may allow transduction between electrical and acoustic energies. The AW sensor may use piezoelectric material to convert a high frequency signal into an acoustic wave, and the higher frequency may enable the sensor to be more sensitive to surface perturbations.","Piezoelectric materials used for acoustic wave sensors may include quartz (SiO), lithium niobate (LiNbO), zinc oxide (ZnO), and others. Each of these materials may possess specific advantages and disadvantages, which may relate to, for example, cost, temperature dependence, attenuation, and propagation velocity. Such materials may, however, have varying transverse acoustic wave velocities, low electromechanical coupling coefficients, non-linear temperature coefficients, and may react chemically with the environment.

Pronounced see-moss, CMOS is a widely used type of semiconductor. CMOS semiconductors use both NMOS (negative polarity) and PMOS (positive polarity) circuits. Since only one of the circuit types is on at any given time, CMOS chips require less power than chips using just one type of transistor. This makes them particularly attractive for use in battery-powered devices, such as portable computers. Personal computers also contain a small amount of battery-powered CMOS memory to hold the date, time, and system setup parameters.","SAW (surface acoustic wave) devices are widely used as electronic filters, delay lines, resonators in today's communication systems. Although telecommunication industry is the largest user of these devices, SAW based sensors have many attractive features to be explored for emerging technologies in automotive (torque, pressure), medical (biosensor) and commercial (vapor, gas, humidity) applications.","Surface acoustic waves (both Rayleigh and pseudo-SAW) are generated at the free surface of a piezoelectric material. An application of a varying voltage to the metal IDT (interdigital transducer) generates the acoustic wave on the input side. In the basic configuration there is an input IDT and an output IDT. The acoustic wave generated by the input IDT travels through the region called the delay line and reaches the output IDT where the mechanical displacements due to the acoustic waves create a voltage difference between the output IDT fingers. One of the most widely used and interesting sensing mechanism that acoustic wave sensors employ is mass loading. Prominent applications are in film thickness monitoring, gas, liquid phase chemical sensing and biosensing. The delay lines of SAW devices are coated with some bio\/chemical coating which selectively reacts with the entity under analysis. This interaction produces a shift in the resonant frequency of the SAW device. By measuring this shift in frequency domain, a detailed analysis of the entity being sensed can be completed.  depicts the basic principle of SAW based bio\/chemical sensors employing the mass loading scheme.","Using a combination of IC compatible technologies, such as Si micromachining, thin film deposition, bio\/chemical layer growth, integrated electronics, smart structures and systems can be realized. Considering the advantages that CMOS technology provides along with the ever-developing CMOS compatible MEMS processes, the SAW technology performance can be improved significantly. Therefore, an array of SAW delay lines were designed and fabricated through a regular CMOS process sequence, characterized and post-processed using widely used MEMS techniques.","The mass sensitivities of different acoustic devices are related to structure geometry, resonant center frequency, and electromechanical coupling. In order to explore all of these design parameters, an array of SAW devices were designed.  depicts the important dimensions of the devices that were fabricated. Four devices on the dies were tested with finger width of 2.40 \u03bcm, finger spacing of 2.40 \u03bcm and a period of 9.60 \u03bcm. The apertures were picked to be 54.80 \u03bcm (device 1 and 2), 502.80 \u03bcm and 244.80 \u03bcm. 24 and 32 finger pairs were used with delay line lengths of 288 \u03bcm and 384 \u03bcm. Note that all of these devices were designed on the same die which is a 2.2 mm by 2.2 mm tiny chip. The design was fabricated in AMI 1.5 \u03bcm 2 metal, 2 poly process through MOSIS. In order to comply with the design rules for this technology, the minimum finger spacing for the IDTs is limited to 2.4 \u03bcm. This limitation is due to the minimum metal to metal spacing for the aforementioned technology.","The most important specification for SAW device design is the center frequency, which is determined by the period of the IDT fingers and the acoustic velocity of the piezoelectric material.","The governing equation that determines the operation frequency is\n\nSAW=\u03bb\u00d7\u2003\u2003(1)\n\n\u03bb: the wavelength at fc, determined by the periodicity of the IDT.\n\nfc: the center frequency of the device\n\nvSAW: the velocity of the SAW\n","For the case of devices that were tested\n\n\u03bb==finger width\u00d74=2.4 \u03bcm\u00d74=9.6 \u03bcm\u2003\u2003(2)\n","Based on tabulated data and calculations for the corresponding design dimensions vSAW for ZnO is 3820 m\/s. This translates into a center frequency of\n\n3820 m\/s\/9.6 \u03bcm=397.916 MHz\u2003\u2003(3)\n","The conventional SAW devices are typically built by depositing a piezoelectric material (quartz, lithium tantalite, lithium niobate, zinc oxide) on a substrate and patterning the IDTs on top of the piezoelectric film as depicted in . This sequence of fabrication does not comply with any commercially available CMOS process as it requires an extra step to deposit the piezoelectric material. It has been reported that enhanced electromechanical coupling is theoretically possible using piezoelectric films overlaying interdigital metal electrodes. Therefore, IDT under the piezoelectric material idea is employed for this work. By depositing the piezoelectric material on top of the IDTs as a post processing step, the CMOS process is not disturbed.","For device stability as a function of temperature it is essential that the temperature coefficient of delay (TCD) be as small as possible. The slope of the TCD as a function of temperature for SAW substrates is mainly negative, so that an increase in temperature will cause a downward shift in IDT center frequency and vice-versa. Due to this strong temperature dependence of the device performance and for precise control of the temperature to study the effects of temperature on the mass sensitive layer and the analyte of interest, a novel heater design is developed. For the heater elements n-well was picked as the resistive layer. The n-well layer has a TCR of 0.5-0.75%\/K, which is the highest among various CMOS process layers. Moreover, n-well provides an embedded heater structure that can directly control the temperature of the substrate and the mass sensitive area without causing any disturbance on the SAW delay line path or the IDT finger design as in the case of other candidate layers (e.g. polysilicon, metal) for resistive heating.","The major distortions in the transfer characteristics of SAW devices occur due to interference of the reflected waves and the triple transit effect. In Rayleigh wave devices, acoustic absorbers were shown to be effective against the reflections. They consist of soft materials located on the surface, at the edges of the device. In order to investigate the performance of the SiO2 in reflecting or attenuating acoustic waves, an absorber structure was designed from stacking CMOS layers of metal1, metal2 and polysilicon. By stacking these dummy strips, a surface higher than the IDT level was created which is investigated for attenuating or reflecting the acoustic waves.  depicts the side view of the design after CMOS process was completed and before any post processing was carried out.","A. Step 1: Removal of Oxides","After the chips are fabricated, they are covered with the overglass protection and the dielectrics (SiO2) over and underneath the metal and poly layers. The first step in the fabrication is RIE (Reactive Ion Etch). This step has been developed, examined, and characterized previously. Note that AMI 1.5 \u03bcm process contains only two metal layers, one of which is already being used as IDTs in this run and the second metal layer will be used in the absorber structures for two main purposes. 1) To increase the height of the absorber compared to the height of the IDTs 2) To act as a mask layer that protects the oxide, which is built up under this layer. The RIE etches the dielectric that is not covered with aluminum, including field oxide, overglass, and intermetal dielectrics. The dies that were fabricated through MOSIS were RIE etched through MEMS-Exchange. The etching was carried out in a Plasma Therm 72 RIE equipment under 40 mTorr pressure.","The etch rate is 250 \u212b\/min. The depth of the total oxide removed by the etch process is 1.5 \u03bcm. After the RIE step is completed, three major areas are defined on the surface. The absorbers, the IDTS (both of which are expected to retain their dielectric layers underneath) and exposed Si, which lay between the IDTs and the area that will define the delay line. FIG. .. depicts the side-view of the die after the RIE and FIG. .. is an SEM of the device after RIE.","B. Step 2: Sputtering of ZnO","ZnO finds wide applications in SAW devices due to its strong piezoelectric effect among non ferroelectric materials. A variety of deposition techniques were used for the growth of ZnO on various substrates. Among them sputtering is considered to be the most favorable one as it is possible to obtain well oriented and uniform ZnO films. Therefore, RF magnetron sputtering was the choice of deposition in our work.","By maskless sputtering from the front, the ZnO covers the entire surface including the IDT fingers and the exposed Si. This inevitably creates bulks of ZnO layers between the IDT fingers. FIG. .shows the side-view of the die after the ZnO deposition. Sputter deposition of zinc oxide shows superior properties over other deposition methods, but the quality of the sputtered film and the growth constitutes a major interest in SAW related applications. The ZnO was deposited on the previously etched dies through MEMS-Exchange. The targeted thickness was 3.0 \u03bcm and the measured film thickness variation was (+\/\u2212%) 13.1. Argon and oxygen were used with a set-up time of 180 min in an MRC Sputter at 200\u00b0 C.","The surface morphology, roughness and the crystal orientation of the sputtered ZnO are subject of interest. Therefore, a thorough characterization of the sputtered films is required. The ZnO covered samples are analyzed for the crystal orientation in Scintag XRD 1000. For comparative analysis, 2\u03b8i scans of a dummy die (Si\u2014ZnO) and a patterned die (Si\u2014SiO2-Al\u2014ZnO) were carried out. As it can be seen from FIG. ., the ZnO shows its peak at 2\u03b8i=","34.721, which agrees with the tabulated data in the literature for (002) 2\u03b8i=34.421. It also has","a peak at 2\u03b8i=73, which corresponds to its listed peak at 2\u03b8i=72.560 for (004). In order to obtain information regarding the surface roughness and grain size JOEL High Vacuum Integrated STM\/AFM\/JSPM-5200 was utilized. The multilayered (Si\u2014SiO2-Al\u2014ZnO) dies were characterized. FIG. .shows the results.","C. Step 3: Patterning of the Pad Frame\/ZnO Etching","After the ZnO deposition the entire die is covered with the sputtered ZnO. In order to access the pads for bonding a last step of lithography and etching are required. The entire die area is 2.2 mm\u00d72.2 mm and the pads are 100 \u03bcm\u00d7100 \u03bcm. A simple shadow mask idea was employed for the etching step. The mask was constructed by using a square Si piece of size 2\u00d72 mm. The major problem encountered during the patterning was the photoresist build up on the edges of the die. Thickness measurements showed a 2-4 \u03bcm photoresist buildup on the pad frame region when the thickness on the areas closer to the center of dies were measured to be 1 \u03bcm. In order to completely remove the photoresist build up covering the pad frame, a two step process was carried out. In the first step, Shipley 1818 2:1 thinner was spun for 40 sec at 5000 rpm and the samples were exposed for 20 sec. Then a 2 min development in 5:1 Developer was applied. In the second step, the same exposure time and development time was used to remove the excessive photoresist.","In general, ZnO is attacked by all common acids and bases. In order to achieve smooth etch profiles and minimize the undercutting, the etching process should be slowed. Therefore, a very dilute solution of two acids was used. The most common acids that are listed in the literature are acetic, hydrochloric and phosphoric acids. A solution of HPO:CHCOOH:DI-HO with 1:1:150 was used for the etching.","2.6 \u03bcm thick ZnO was etched completely in 4 min, which translates into 648 \u212b\/min etch rate. Once the final step of post processing was completed, the dies were bonded on a DIP-40 package for electrical testing. The major subjects of interest for performance analysis of SAW devices are the transmission coefficient and the reflection coefficient versus frequency. HP 8712ET, 300 kHz-1300 MHz, RF Network Analyzer was used for this purpose. A through-cable calibration was carried out in order to measure and compensate for the losses and errors due to the connector and cable irregularities. S11 (reflection) and S21 (transmission) coefficient versus frequency is shown in FIGS. .and .respectively. The center frequency of the delay line agrees closely with the calculated value.","Thus, a test chip that contains an array of SAW delay lines were designed and fabricated in AMI 1.5 \u03bcm 2 metal, 2 poly process. A unique, three step, maskless post processing sequence was developed. Complete characterization of the two etching steps and piezoelectric film was carried out. The transfer characteristics show a maximum transmission and minimum reflection at 392.5 MHz with an insertion loss of \u22124.83 dB. The 3 dB bandwidth was measured to be 19.25 MHz which agrees closely with the calculated value of 14.575 MHz. The results demonstrate that it is possible to design and fabricate SAW based sensors with comparable performance to conventional devices by using any commercially available CMOS technology.","CMOS Process Sequence","CMOS fabrication technology is well established and requires that both n-channel (nMOS) and p-channel (pMOS) transistors be built on the same chip substrate. To accommodate both nMOS and pMOS devices, special regions must be created in which the semiconductor type is opposite to the substrate type. These regions are called wells or tubs. A p-well is created in an n-type substrate or, alternatively, an n-well is created in a p-type substrate. In the simple n-well CMOS fabrication technology presented, the nMOS transistor is created in the p-type substrate, and the pMOS transistor is created in the n-well, which is built-in into the p-type substrate. In the twin-tub CMOS technology, additional tubs of the same type as the substrate can also be created for device optimization.","The simplified process sequence for the fabrication of CMOS integrated circuits on a p-type silicon substrate starts with the creation of the n-well regions for pMOS transistors, by impurity implantation into the substrate. Then, a thick oxide is grown in the regions surrounding the nMOS and pMOS active regions. The thin gate oxide is subsequently grown on the surface through thermal oxidation. These steps are followed by the creation of n+ and p+ regions (source, drain and channel-stop implants) and by final metallization (creation of metal interconnects).","An integrated circuit (IC) is a circuit comprised of elements such as transistors, resistors and capacitors fabricated in a single piece of semiconducting material, usually silicon or gallium arsenide. As used herein, \u201cintegrated circuit\u201d not only refers to the common definition but also to highly integrated structures including, for example:","1) multichip modules where several IC's and other circuit elements including molecular target probes may be combined compactly on a polymer, quartz, glass, sliver, ceramic or other substrates. In some cases, one IC may be the substrate with other components, such as photodiodes or LEDs mounted on it;\n\n2) Hybrid microcircuits where one or more IC's and other circuit elements are mounted on or several substrate(s); and,\n\n3) Other compact electromechanical arrangements of a circuit comprising primarily one but possibly more IC's and other electronic components and microelectromechanised systems (MEMs).\n\nSurface Acoustic Wave Resonators\n","There has always been motivation to fully integrate the wireless transceiver. Surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonators have commonly been used as the local oscillator (LO) which is one of the basic building blocks of the RF receiver heterodyne architecture and is currently the major stumbling block for complete integration of RF receivers. Due to the structure of the SAW devices that require fabrication of metallized interdigital transducers on piezoelectric crystals, the SAW resonators are difficult to implement in CMOS and are usually realized as discrete off-chip components. Efforts to integrate surface acoustic wave filters on silicon substrates have been previously implemented by Visser, Vellekoop and Zeijl while the monolithic integration of SAW devices on GaAs has been implemented by Baca of Sandia National Labs. The operating frequency of a surface acoustic wave resonator is determined by the periodic distance of its interdigitated transducer (IDT) fingers, \u03bb, which are placed on piezoelectric material. Unlike bulk-wave crystal resonators, whose frequency of operation is determined by the thickness of the piezoelectric material, surface acoustic wave resonators have a more area efficient structure since its frequency of operation is determined by the spacing between the IDTs and thus is only limited by the resolution of the fabrication process. The utilization of surface waves, instead of bulk-waves, makes the process of integration with the present integrated circuit fabrication techniques more feasible since it eliminates the necessity of having a thick piezoelectric layer sandwiched between two metal layers.","In the present invention, implementation of surface acoustic wave resonators using the standard CMOS fabrication technology with additional post-processing techniques is provided. The fact that the fabrication process of this SAW resonator is highly compatible with current integrated circuit processing techniques makes it extremely desirable since it is not only cost-effective, but also allows the resonator features to be less prone to manufacturing defects due to the maturity of CMOS technology. In this design, the SAW resonator utilized the minimum feature sizes possible in the available 0.6 micron AMI CMOS process to realize a 1.15 GHz surface acoustic wave resonator.","The fabricated CMOS resonators were measured, and modeled as a two-port electrical network through analog circuit synthesis. This model was used as a basis for simulation in Cadence to design a Pierce oscillator. The Pierce amplifier was designed on a separate CMOS chip. When connected together, the Pierce amplifier and SAW resonator realize an oscillator capable of synthesizing a frequency of 1.15 GHz. By having both the resonator and the oscillator integrated on the same CMOS chip, a fully monolithic frequency synthesizer is realized.","II. CMOS Surface Acoustic Wave Resonators: Design and Equivalent Circuit Model","1A. SAW Resonator Design","The SAW resonator design consists of input or output IDTs flanked by a bank of reflectors on both sides. Refer to ) which illustrates the important design parameters of a 1-port resonator. The key design parameter is \u03bb, or the periodic distance between two interdigitated fingers, which determines the frequency of the resonator, using v=f\u03bb, where v is the velocity of the acoustic wave in the piezoelectric material and f is the resonant frequency. In this design run, \u03bb was chosen to be four times the minimum metal2 size of this technology or 3.6 micron. The modeling equations for SAW resonators, which involve rigorous computations of transmission matrices, will not be discussed in detail in this paper but the basic methodology of designing the SAW resonators and its accompanying oscillator circuit is outlined here.","The main design parameter that needs to be chosen is M or the number of reflectors. An array of reflectors is required since each electrode only produces reflectivity, r of approximately 0.08. The equation for reflectivity was derived based on the theory of reflection in transmission lines, and is given in (1A), where \u03b7 is the metallization ratio of the IDT, Z is the characteristic impedance of the region under the reflector, \u0394Z is the difference of characteristic impedance between the free region and the region under the reflector, and finally, fis the resonance frequency.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0092","num":"0091"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"r","mo":"=","mrow":{"mi":"j","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mfrac":{"mrow":{"mi":["\u0394","Z"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},"mi":"Z"},"mrow":{"mi":"sin","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"\u03b7\u03c0","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mfrac":{"mi":"f","msub":{"mi":["f","r"]}}}}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"\u2062","mi":"A"}}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"\u0393","mo":"~","mrow":{"mi":"tanh","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"M"}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":"\u2062","mi":"A"}}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"L","mo":"=","mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"\/","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"4","mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mi":"r"}}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"3","mo":"\u2062","mi":"A"}}}]}]}}}},"The array reflectivity, \u0393 can also be approximated as (2A) and the number of reflectors was chosen to optimize area while maintaining array reflectivity to be close to 1. The effective center of reflection, or the line where the surface waves are assumed to be totally reflected is denoted by L is expressed as (3A) where r is the reflectivity of each electrode. MATLAB simulations of (1A), (2A) and (3A) using ZnO thin film material properties were performed to obtain the optimum number of reflectors which was found to be 125 for this design. The total effective length of a round trip in the cavity must be an integer number of \u03bb. Other important design parameters are the distance between the reflectors and the input transducers Lg, the number of IDTs or Nand the width of the transducers or W. Thirty-two different designs of SAW resonators were first fabricated on piezoelectric substrates such as lithium niobium substrates to evaluate the performance of the fabricated designs. Four resonators with the best performance characteristics were then chosen and scaled to fit the 0.6 um CMOS in this design run.","1B. Equivalent Circuit Model","The equivalent circuit model of a two-port SAW resonator was developed using analog circuit synthesis based on the S21 frequency measurements made on the fabricated CMOS resonators. The SAW resonator has transmission characteristics similar to a series LCR circuit, where the series resonant frequency is generated by both Land CThe initial values for the LCR circuit were calculated using the resonator design equations based on the reflectivity of each metal strip and number of reflectors. This basic LCR circuit was then modified based on curve fitting, where the simulated values were compared with the experimental measurements. Several circuit topologies were implemented an least squares method was used to choose the circuit, which produced the best fit. The final circuit topology that produced the best fit is shown in ), where it consists of Rx, Cx and Lx which are motional resistance, capacitance and inductance connected in parallel with Lp and Rp. The input and output ports are connected with parasitic capacitances Cp to ground. The circuit's S21 scattering parameters analysis simulations were performed using Cadence SpectreRF where the input and output ports were terminated with 50 Ohms. Comparison between the measured and simulated equivalent circuit model is shown in ). The best fitting curve was found to have the values of Lx=1 uH, Rx=120 Ohms, Cx=19 fF, Lp=132.8 nH, and Cp=10 fF.","III. Fabrication","Perhaps the most important highlight of this SAW resonator design is that the SAW resonator IDT's can be implemented using standard CMOS technology. This allows the resonator features to be realized in the minimum sizes available in the AMI 0.6 micron CMOS process, making them not only less susceptible to manufacturing defects but also less expensive compared to when fabricated as micromachined MEMS structures. The resonator features were implemented as 0.9 micron wide metal2 lines which are able to realize ultra-high frequency, 1.15 GHz resonators.","The SAW CMOS post fabrication sequence is similar to the CMOS SAW delay line, with several important distinctions, namely the presence of the aluminum ground metal1 shield which was placed to eliminate electromagnetic feed-through. The other major difference is the presence of the oscillator circuit which is also placed on the same die and protected by a grounded metal layer as shown in Chip B shown in ) and ).","Once the standard CMOS fabrication sequence is completed, the first post-processing step involves releasing the SAW IDTs from the insulating SiO2 layer using reactive ion etch (RIE). The next step is ZnO deposition, which was sputtered on the resonators. The final post-processing step involves wet-etching the ZnO to uncover the resonators' pads.","Two separate CMOS chips had been designed. The first chip shown in ) (Chip A) consists of four CMOS SAW resonators was fabricated and characterized prior to the design of the second chip. Chip B which consists of three resonators and the Pierce oscillator circuit is shown in ). Chip A was designed to characterize the ultra high frequency resonator of frequencies in the range of 900 MHz to 1.2 GHz. Chip B was implemented as a proof of concept that the post-processing techniques of the SAW resonator do not adversely affect the amplifier circuit.","IV. Experimental Results and Discussion","Once the post-processing steps have been completed, the die was bonded and packaged in a DIP40 chip package to facilitate measurements. The bonded device was measured using a HP8712 network analyzer and its experimental setup is shown in ). The S21 measurements made on the 0.6 micron CMOS SAW resonators produced the parallel resonance frequency, fp of 1.084 GHz and the series resonance frequency, fs of 1.156 GHz as shown in ). Based on the measurements, the parallel Q was calculated to be 90.33 and series Q was calculated to be 36.125. The measured Q was not as high as expected since the die was overetched and some parts of the resonator was not completely covered as shown in the bonded die image of ). The acoustic wave velocity of ZnO calculated from the measured curve was found to be 4140 m\/s.","V. Oscillator Design and Simulation","To operate as a local oscillator, the SAW resonator is connected to a Pierce oscillator at the gate and drain of M1 as shown in ). This three-point oscillator topology was previously implemented using an FBAR oscillator by Otis, and was chosen firstly since it utilizes the current source, M2 to provide the necessary biasing current to M1, as the SAW resonator does not pass any DC current. Secondly, it also provides excellent phase noise characteristics. Mfb, operates as a resistor which provides bias to the gate of M1.\n\n()\u2003\u2003(4A)\n","To ensure oscillation, the loop gain, Ahas to be greater than 1 and the phase shift should be equal to 0. Based on (4A), the size of M1 is adjusted to provide the necessary transconductance to counteract R, where Ris the parallel reflected motional resistance at the gate of M1. For this design Cp1=Cp2 which also maximizes the open loop gain. The transistors were sized as follows, M1=4.8 m\/1.6 u, M=4 u\/872 u, M2=9.6 m\/1.2 u. The phase noise performance and steady-state analysis of the oscillator circuit was simulated using Cadence SpectreRF to obtain its fundamental beat frequency of 1.154 GHz are shown in  ","Accordingly, the design, implementation and measurements of a CMOS SAW resonator is provided. The SAW resonators were fabricated using standard AMI 0.6 micron CMOS technology with some additional post-processing steps. Upon completion, the SAW resonators were characterized and found to have a resonant frequency of 1.15 GHz and its equivalent circuit model was developed based on these measurements. This model was used to design and simulate a Pierce 1 GHz oscillator.","Chemical Sensors","During the manufacture of analyte detection chips, a sensor material is placed on the substrate. This sensor material may be deposited, coated, or otherwise applied on the substrate. In one embodiment, the sensor material is any material which provides an electrical response to an analyte. For example, an electrical response may be quantified in terms of impedance (Z), resistance (R), inductance (L), capacitance (C), or other electrical property. In an embodiment, the sensor material may be a polymer. The material may be organic, or inorganic in other embodiments. Further, the sensor material may consist of regions of a nonconductive organic material and a conductive material. In other embodiments, the sensor material may be insulating organic films that act as capacitors or composite films that act as inductors. A more detailed description of some sensor materials and their properties is discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,571,401. However, the present invention is not limited to the sensor materials in U.S. Pat. No. 5,571,401 since other materials may also be used.","In a specific embodiment of the present invention, the sensor technology may involve a series of conductive polymeric composite vapor sensors. The presence of an analyte may be detected through a change in, for example, the electrical resistance of a chemically sensitive carbon-based resistor. As discussed above, changes in electrical properties other than resistance may also be used; these include the evaluation of capacitive and inductance changes.","Further, the sensor material may be composed of conductor and insulator composites. This material may be placed on the substrate in a film. The organic nonconducting polymer of the composite absorbs the analyte (which may be a vapor). This induces a change in the electrical properties of the sensor material. The sensor material may also undergo physical changes such as swelling. When the analyte is removed, any changes in the electrical properties reverse. For example, the resistance, capacitance, and inductance may return to their original value. Any physical changes would also reverse. The response of these types of sensors are reversible over multiple analyte exposures as well as reproducible over a large number of trials under a variety of ambient atmospheric conditions. Therefore, a device fabricated using these types of sensor materials would have a relatively long service life.","In the case of using a composite such a nonconducting polymer and carbon black, the sensor material will be temperature sensitive. When using temperature-sensitive sensors, the sensor should be kept at a relatively constant temperature to provide relatively consistent results. For example, a temperature such as about 5 degrees C. above the ambient should provide good results. Further, extremely high temperatures, say, above about 100 degrees C., should be avoided since these temperatures would destroy the polymer sensor material or rapidly decrease its service life. For this reason, it is not expected that nonconducting polymer materials are to be used in the specialized environment of extreme high temperatures, say, from about 300 degrees C. to about 400 degrees C. or even higher. The polymer sensor materials will be usable in the normal temperature ranges from about 0 degrees C. to about 100 degrees C.","Using a conductor and insulator composite for the sensor material permits a very broad, diverse collection of sensor materials. For example, any conducting element including carbon blacks, metallic colloids, or organic conducting polymers, and combinations of these, may be used as the conductive phase of the sensors. Any organic material may be used as the insulating phase of the sensors. Furthermore, an advantage of these types of sensor materials is that they do not have the stability limitations of conducting organic polymeric materials. A conductor and insulator composite also does not suffer the limitations from the types of substituents or restrictions on the ranges of swelling variations that can be obtained from backbone modification of pure organic conducting polymers.","After processing of a substrate or wafer is complete, the wafer is tested to determine the number and location of the \u201cgood die.\u201d The percentage of good die on one wafer compared to the total number of die on the wafer is referred to as the \u201cyield.\u201d Individual analyte detection dies are separated by sawing along the scribe lines. The analyte detection dies are then packaged, and may be further tested to ensure their proper operation. These dies may be packaged in a variety of packaging material including ceramic, epoxy, plastic, glass, and many others. Packaged analyte detection die may very much resemble packaged integrated circuit chips. For some types of applications, nonporous, nonreactive materials like ceramic may be used.","In one embodiment, the sensor material is deposited or applied at the wafer level, before individual dies are separated. In other embodiments, the sensor material is applied after the dies are separated.","Biological Sensors","Surface acoustic wave devices as biosensors are also well suited for the detection of biological agents. Positioning a receptor between IDT fingers to induce a phase shift or within IDT fingers to induce a frequency shift allows for electronic detection of bioagents. These devices have the dual advantages of high sensitivity, down to picograms\/cm2, and high specificity, conferred by biological receptors such as antibodies, peptides, and nucleic acids. Detection of bacteria, viral particles, and proteins has been shown with these types of sensors. Handheld biodetection systems incorporating these microsensors are contemplated as within the scope of the invention.","The surface acoustic wave biosensor arrangements may be used for real time sensing and for quantifying the levels of bacteria, e.g. ","Many monoclonal antibodies with high affinity and specificity for particular bacteria are available from commercial sources as well as the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). For example, one of these antibodies, the ATCC HB-8178 antibody, may bind with the pilus with high specificity and affinity. Any known coupling chemistry may be used for binding the monoclonal antibody to the sensor chip surface.","It may also important to optimize the chemical linking of the antibody, as well as the loading density. Independent fluorescence assays of the antibody density on the chip may be done using fluorescence labeled anti-IgG. The chip may be incubated in phosphate buffered saline with fluorescein labeled anti-IgG, and may then be washed with a buffer solution of increasing ionic strength to dislodge unbound antibody. The chip may then be scanned using a Perkin Elmer LS50B fluorescence spectrophotometer, and the bound antibody density may be calculated using FL-Winlab software, which may also calculate various parameters (such as, for example, the statistical variability observed in the surface loading between regions on the chip sample surface). This technique may be used to determine which of the coupling chemistries yields the best loading of antibodies.","Biological detection may include detecting of smaller molecular weight molecules as well as larger protein molecules, amino acids, and nucleic acids.","Current generated per analyte molecule bound to the biosensor surface may be compared to the response obtained from control. Analyzing the differences in the biosensor response may be useful for improving the chemistry and spatial properties of the biosensor arrangement to enhance its performance against the analyte of interest.","There are a number of U.S. patents which describe integration of a biosensor chip into a biosensor device, including U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,937,052, 6,743,581, 6,657,269, and 6,448,064, all incorporated herein in their entirety. Other U.S. patents describe the use for detection of a chemical, including U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,627,154, and 6,495,892, incorporated herein in their entirety.","SAW-Based Chemical Sensors","SAW devices are extremely sensitive to tiny mass changes, detecting 100 pg\/cm\u2014less than 1% of a monolayer of carbon atoms. When coated with a chemically selective thin film, the SAW device is rendered sensitive to chemicals that interact with the film. Sensors based on surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices are being developed to detect a wide range of chemicals. The SAW device is an extremely sensitive gravimetric detector that can be coated with a film to collect chemical species of interest. Based on these devices, sensor systems have been developed that can detect trace (ppm to ppb) levels of airborne contaminants. Applications include weapon state-of-health, environ-mental, and non-proliferation monitoring.","Chemical species that have been distinguished as capable of detection up to 96% accuracy include the general categories of organophosphonate (DIMP, DMMP); chlorinated hydrocarbon (CCl, TCE); ketone (acetone, MEK); alcohol (methanol, n-propanol, pinacolyl alcohol); aromatic hydrocarbon (benzene, toluene), saturated hydrocarbon (n-hexane, cyclohexane, i-octane); and water.","In these example implementations, one deposition step is eliminated since standard CMOS metal layers are used to implement the transducers' structures. The maturity and precision of the standard 0.6 \u03bcm CMOS technology enables us to manufacture very well-defined metal features to implement the transducers, with minimum widths of 0.9 \u03bcm, resulting in very high frequency resonators of 1.02 GHz.","These examples present the design, fabrication, equivalent circuit model and characterization measurements of three two-port resonators. The design of the CMOS SAW resonators is described first, where the key design factors that affect the resonant frequency and quality factor are highlighted. Next, the fabrication sequence of implementing the surface acoustic wave resonators in CMOS with three additional post-processing steps is illustrated in detail. Characterization of the piezoelectric zinc oxide layer using x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy is also reported. The fabricated resonators were measured to obtain its Sand Stransmission and reflection characteristics. To verify the resonant frequency of the device, finite element modeling of the device was also done using CoventorWare\u00ae. Based on the measurement results and the fabrication layers of the CMOS resonators, an equivalent circuit model specifically for two-port CMOS surface acoustic wave resonators was developed. Simulations using the","developed equivalent circuit were compared with the experimental measurements of the fabricated device.","A. Resonator Structure","The structure of a two-port CMOS SAW resonator consists of input and output interdigital transducers, which are flanked by a bank of shorted reflectors on each side. Shorted reflectors have been shown to have less","spurious effects compared to unconnected reflectors [5] and have been used in all our designs. When a sinusoidal signal is injected at the input port, acoustic waves propagating in both directions are generated in the piezoelectric zinc oxide layer. The acoustic waves are detected and translated back into an electrical signal at the output port. The reflectors minimize the losses by containing the acoustic waves within the cavity, to create standing waves or resonance.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0123","num":"0122"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 10"],"i":["a","b"]},"B.

In this work, 0.6 \u03bcm American Microsystems Incorporated (AMI) CMOS 3-metal, 2-poly process was used. Standard CMOS layers were used to implement the resonator's interdigital transducers, reflectors and the ground shield, which are implemented using metal1 and metal2 CMOS, respectively. The ground shield is crucial for elimination of electromagnetic feed-through and isolation from substrate noise [7]. For future integration with circuits, all post-processing steps were carefully selected such that no process will require temperatures greater than 400\u00b0 C. to ensure compatibility with the integrated circuitry. Circuits can be implemented using metal 1 and metal 2 with metal 3 as protection against the adverse effects of the post-processing.","A. Reactive-Ion-Etching","The first post-processing step requires releasing the SAW electrodes from the insulating SiO2 layer. It was reported in [14] that reactive-ion-etching (RIE) can be used to remove oxide between interdigital transducer fingers. Timed RIE process was used to etch the 2.5 \u03bcm thick oxide layer.

For our designs of 3.6 \u03bcm<\u03bb<6 \u03bcm, the optimum thickness of zinc oxide was calculated to be 2.4 \u03bcm.","Zinc oxide deposition was performed using radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering, where the 2.4 \u03bcm thick ZnO layer was deposited at a rate of 0.297 \u03bcm\/hr over the entire die area. Sputtered ZnO films are preferred since these layers are highly oriented and dense [15]. The temperature of the sample was kept below 400\u00b0 C. to ensure compatibility with the integrated circuitry. The sputtering was conducted with 50\/50 gas flow","mixture of Ar\/O2 with power of 150 W.","To evaluate the quality of the ZnO, the X-ray diffraction 2\u03b8\u03b9-scan was performed on the deposited ZnO on CMOS SAW resonator samples to determine the ZnO's crystal orientation. Highly oriented ZnO films produce high reflection intensity from the (002) planes and have been reported to have good piezoelectric coupling coefficient \u03ba [15].  illustrates the results of the X-ray diffraction test performed on the 0.6 \u03bcm CMOS SAW resonator sample.

The surface morphology of the zinc oxide layer was also investigated using atomic force microscopy, where the root mean-square roughness of the layer was measured to be 0.05 \u03bcm.","C. Zinc Oxide Etching","The ZnO covered die was wet-etched to enable access to the resonator's pads for probing [10]. The resonator area is masked using standard lithography process using 1.8 \u03bcm thick liquid photoresist. The small size (1.5 mm\u00d71.5 mm) of the samples creates a tendency of photoresist buildup at its edges. To solve this, the small die is first glued at the far edge of a large circular wafer before photoresist spinning. The die and wafer are spun at 4000 rpm. This method produces uniform photoresist throughout the sample. The sample is then patterned by placing the sample in a mask aligner and exposed to ultraviolet light for 18 s. The mask is a set of three squares, which only covers the resonators. The sample is placed in developer solution for 60 s to develop the pattern. Once the protective photoresist has covered the resonator, the sample is immersed in an etching solution, which is selective to the photoresist as shown in . (c). To etch the zinc oxide, an etching solution that does not adversely affect the piezoelectric properties of ZnO is required. The H3PO4:C6H8O7:H2O solution have been reported to produce very steep etch slopes in [16]. This etching solution with concentrations 1:1:80 was used to etch the sample for 158 s. The calculated etch rate was 1.4 \u03bcm min. The SEM image of the etched ZnO shown in  () and () illustrates very well defined etched edges of the piezoelectric ZnO layer.","A. Equivalent Circuit Model","Based on the fabrication layers of the device and the equations derived by Morgan [11], Zeijl [12] and Datta [5], the equivalent circuit model tailored specifically for standard CMOS two-port resonator was developed. The equivalent circuit for the resonator can be divided into two distinct parts,","namely the acoustic and the parasitic components.","The acoustic component describes the propagation of the acoustic wave within the cavity. The acoustic waves, generated by the interdigital fingers propagate in the piezoelectric layer and act as a resonator and consist of Cx, Rx, Lx and Cf.","The parasitic component consisting of Rs, Cox and Ct exist due to the structure and the layers of the resonator. As shown in  (), the interdigital fingers were constructed using metal 2 layer on top of SiO2. Underneath the oxide is the ground metal 1 shield. This structure creates two parasitic capacitances namely Ct and Cox. The electrostatic capacitance (Ct) is the capacitance of the parallel plates of the interdigital","transducers and is described in (2). Ct is proportional to the width of the aperture (W) and the number of transducer pairs (Nt). Since the capacitive parallel plates of the interdigital transducers are placed within the piezoelectric material, the relevant permittivity constant (\u2208) is the effective dielectric permittivity of zinc oxide, \u2208=135 pF\/m [12].\n\n=W\u2208N\u2003\u2003(1)\n","Cox is the oxide capacitance between the input and output port and the ground shield and is calculated using (2).

The incident acoustic waves will induce current Iout in the output port. The ratio Iout\/Vin is known as the admittance (Yt). The real part of the admittance is known as radiation conductance, which represents electrical-to-acoustic energy conversion.

Harmonic analysis provides the structure's response to a continuous harmonic excitation. For resonator 1, harmonic excitation was applied as a sinusoidal waveform of 3 V amplitude with frequencies between 1 GHz to 1.3 GHz at the resonator's interdigital","transducers. Due to the piezoelectric properties of the zinc oxide layer, the induced electrical excitation will produce mechanical displacement, which in turn generates the surface acoustic wave in the ZnO layer. As shown in , the maximum displacement in all directions occurs at 1.13 GHz for resonator 1 with \u03bb=3.6 \u03bcm and can be compared to its design series resonant frequency of 1.0320 GHz as shown in Table 2. The propagating acoustic wave in the piezoelectric layer has maximum displacement of 0.004 \u03bcm.","The designed chip consisting of three resonators is shown in . To obtain S21 and S11 measurements, each resonator was probed using two coplanar G-S-G probes in the Cascade Microtech 9500 Parametric Probe Station connected to the HP8712 network analyzer. The coplanar probes were connected to the network analyzer using cables, SMA and N connectors. The experimental setup is shown in .","A Thru calibration structure was also included in the design to improve measurement accuracy. Both metal 2 and metal 1 in CMOS was used to implement the Thru structure. To avoid the probes crashing and damaging one another, the distance between the two probes was set to be 200 \u03bcm [19].","A. Analysis of Measurement Results","The S21 measurements provide the insertion loss (IL), series resonant frequency (fs) and parallel resonant frequency (fp). The S21 transmission magnitude and phase measurements as well as the S11 reflection measurements of resonators 1, 2 and 3 are shown in  and  respectively. Resonator 3 shown in  () exhibited the best transmission characteristics, having the highest parallel quality factor of 284.98. The high quality factor of this resonator is due to its structure, where an additional layer metal 3 of reflector was implemented as shown in  (). Based on Morgan [11], the maximum energy of the propagating acoustic wave is within \u03bb thickness of the piezoelectric layer. For our design, the thickness of ZnO was 2.4 \u03bcm and it is assumed that the energy of the acoustic wave is contained within the entire thickness of the piezoelectric layer. The first layer of reflector structure constructed using metal 1 has a total height of 1.9 \u03bcm which is insufficient to reflect all the propagating acoustic waves. Stacking an additional metal 3 layer of 1.6 \u03bcm with additional 0.3 \u03bcm layer of SiO2 will result in a total height of 3.8 \u03bcm of for the reflector structure. This height is greater than the thickness of the sputtered ZnO layer and is sufficient to reflect all the energy of the propagating acoustic wave. This results in suppression of harmonics, having a single parallel and series resonant frequency as shown in  ().","Resonator 1 shown in  () exhibits transmission characteristics which are not well-defined, having very low Qs and Qp of 33.32 and 44.43 respectively. The low Q can be attributed to both the insufficient height of the reflectors as well as the design. With reference to Table 1 where both Lg and Lc of Resonator 1 was set to 7.2 \u03bcm or 2\u03bb. This results in a distorted wave since L\/\u03bb=17 is not an odd multiple of \u03bb\/2. Much improved resonant characteristics are seen in both Resonator 2 and Resonator 3 where L\/\u03bb=10.5 for both resonators as shown in  () and () respectively.","B. Measurement of Surface Acoustic Wave Velocity","In comparison to Table 1, the resonators were designed to have series resonant frequencies of 1 GHz, 857 MHz and 600 MHz respectively. The measured resonators had series resonant frequencies of 1.032 GHz, 930 MHz and 602 MHz respectively. The difference between the design and measured resonant frequencies can be attributed to the deviation of the acoustic wave velocity value from the assumed 3600 m\/s. The acoustic wave velocity of the device can be extracted from the measured fs based on v=fs\u03bb. Table 4 shows the variation of surface acoustic wave velocity at different \u03bb. The acoustic wave velocity is a function of khZnO where k=2\u03c0\/\u03bb and hZnO is the thickness of the ZnO layer. For this chip hZnO=2.4 \u03bcm. It has been shown in [7] that both the acoustic wave velocity and the piezoelectric coupling coefficient (\u03ba) is a function of khZnO, where the optimum is between 2 and 4.2. It can be seen from the Table 4 that at khZnO=3.5904, the extracted acoustic wave velocity is at its highest, indicating the maximum piezoelectric coefficient. This indicates that to obtain maximum coupling, each design with different \u03bb should have different thickness of zinc oxide. This however, is impractical for this chip since all the resonators with different \u03bb were placed on the same chip and had to have a constant hZnO for all three designs. This resulted in different \u03ba and different acoustic wave velocity for each resonator.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0157","num":"0156"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 4 "}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"EXTRACTED SURFACE ACOUSTIC WAVE"},{"entry":"VELOCITY AT DIFFERENT \u03bb"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"77pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["\u03bb","(2\u03c0\/\u03bb) \u00b7 h","Measured f","Extracted SAW velocity"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["3.6 \u03bcm","4.1888","1.03275 GHz","3717.9 m\/s"]},{"entry":["4.2 \u03bcm","3.5904","0.93094 GHz","3909.9 m\/s"]},{"entry":["\u2002\u20096 \u03bcm","2.5133","0.60256 GHz","3615.4 m\/s"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}},"br":{}},"The S21 measurements can also be used to extract the equivalent RLC circuit parameters of the resonators [20], [21].

The extracted Rx=10 kOhms was close to the design Rx=7.56 kOhms. The measured quality factor of Qp=285 is the highest compared to the other designs. This high quality factor is due to the increase in height for the reflector structure, greatly reducing the losses of the propagating acoustic waves. This measurement result indicates that a high quality factor can be achieved even with minimum number of reflectors, where N=33 for this design. It also serves to prove that the quality factor and the array reflectivity are highly dependent on the height of the resonator structure rather than the number of reflectors used. This is in comparison with Resonator 2 which had a lower reflector height but a large number of reflectors and produced a low Q.","This work provides both the implementation of an integrated CMOS surface acoustic wave resonator and the development of its equivalent circuit model to support it. This is significant since it demonstrates that the frequency of surface acoustic waves can controlled using interdigital fingers implemented using inexpensive standard CMOS technology with minimum number of additional post-CMOS micromachining processes. Previous implementations [7], [8] or [9] did not utilize standard CMOS process to implement the resonator's interdigital fingers but implemented the fingers using separate deposition steps, resulting in a very high fabrication cost due to the necessity of having very thin and precise interdigital fingers to achieve very high resonant frequencies. The maturity of standard integrated circuit processing technology such as CMOS is very reliable in manufacturing very precise thin metal lines, and for this 0.6 \u03bcm CMOS technology used, the minimum metal widths were 0.9 \u03bcm, generating a resonant frequency of 1 GHz. Higher frequency resonators can be achieved when smaller CMOS technology feature sizes are used. Currently, the minimum possible CMOS metal feature size is 135 nm and can theoretically create CMOS SAW resonators operating at 7 GHz. Three different resonator designs, operating at different frequencies, 1.02 GHz, 941 MHz and 605 MHz were presented to illustrate the feasibility and the performance of these devices. The measurement results indicate minimum insertion losses in the range \u221233 dB to \u221236 dB. The measured quality factor ranged from 33 to 285. Based on the measurement results and the fabrication layers of the device, an equivalent circuit model, tailored specifically to describe the two-port CMOS SAW resonator was developed.","Comparison of the design, extracted and measurement S21 transmission characteristics were presented. It can be seen from these graphs that when losses of the propagating acoustic wave is reduced by increasing the reflector height, the design, extracted and measured results are in accordance with each other. Although the resonators exhibited much lower quality factors than commercial discrete devices which have Qs in the order of 10 000, the quality factors of these devices are much higher than the Qs of integrated LC CMOS resonators which are typically less than 50. LC CMOS resonators are typically used when integrated resonators are required for circuits. The measurement results have also indicated that when the reflector height is increased using stacked metals available in CMOS technology, the quality factor of the device is improved greatly. These designs, although not exhibiting the maximum possible quality factor of the device, was intended as a proof of concept that surface acoustic wave resonators can be implemented using CMOS with the minimum number of post-processes. Further development of this work indicates promising devices such as oscillators and filters for integration with circuits. The quality factor of the device can be further improved by increasing the number of reflectors and implementing methods to improve the piezoelectric coupling coefficient of the device.","The following references are incorporated herein in their entirety.
