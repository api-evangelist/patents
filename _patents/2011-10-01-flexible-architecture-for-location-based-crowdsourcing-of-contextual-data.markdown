{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Location based crowdsourcing is important for a real time understanding of the physical environment. Real time indexing, analysis and dissemination of the physical world is possible due to the prevalence of mobile platforms with advanced computing and connectivity, such as cellular telephones, smart phones, tablets or other portable communication devises. Crowdsourcing using sensor data from mobile platforms is useful as it provides real samples from the physical environment, which may not be possible (or extremely difficult, costly and time consuming) to obtain using brute force survey techniques.","Current applications of location based crowdsourcing include, for example, gathering knowledge with respect to real time venue visitations or geographic WiFi signatures, or to understand a location based on conversations around the location. Additional applications of location based crowdsourcing are possible, but are generally not pursued to the difficulty associated with obtaining the necessary and specific crowdsourcing information.","A system for the collection, aggregation and analysis of location based crowdsourcing data includes a server that controls the distribution of crowdsourcing requests and workloads to a plurality of external mobile platforms. The server receives crowdsourcing queries from multiple parties and provides measurement requests to the mobile platforms, e.g., based on the location of the mobile platforms. Upon receipt of the measured contextual data from the mobile platforms, the server may distribute information, such as the raw measured contextual data or an analysis of the measured contextual data, to the appropriate requesting parties in a secure manner. The mobile platform may receive a plurality of measurement requests from a remote server, wherein the plurality of measurement requests are based on crowdsourcing queries from a plurality of parties. The mobile platform may measure and provide to the remote server contextual data in response to the plurality of measurement requests.","In one implementation, a method includes receiving crowdsourcing queries from a plurality of parties; distributing a plurality of measurement requests to a plurality of mobile platforms based on the crowdsourcing queries; receiving measured contextual data from the plurality of mobile platforms in response to the plurality of measurement requests; and providing information to the plurality of parties based on the measured contextual data.","In another implementation, an apparatus includes an external interface capable of interfacing with a plurality of parties and a plurality of mobile platforms and a processor coupled to the external interface. The processor is adapted to receive a crowdsourcing queries from the plurality of parties via the external interface, distribute a plurality of measurement requests to the plurality of mobile platforms based on the crowdsourcing queries via the external interface, receive measured contextual data from the plurality of mobile platforms in response to the plurality of measurement requests via the external interface, and provide information to the plurality of parties based on the measured contextual data via the external interface.","In another implementation, an apparatus includes means for receiving crowdsourcing queries from a plurality of parties; means for distributing a plurality of measurement requests to a plurality of mobile platforms based on the crowdsourcing queries; means for receiving measured contextual data from the plurality of mobile platforms in response to the plurality of measurement requests; and means for providing information to the plurality of parties based on the measured contextual data.","In yet another implementation, a non-transitory computer-readable medium including program code stored thereon includes program code to cause a processor to receive crowdsourcing queries from a plurality of parties; program code to distribute a plurality of measurement requests to a plurality of mobile platforms based on the crowdsourcing queries; program code to cause a processor to receive measured contextual data from the plurality of mobile platforms in response to the plurality of measurement requests; and program code to provide information to the plurality of parties based on the measured contextual data.","In another embodiment, a method includes receiving a plurality of measurement requests from a remote server, wherein the plurality of measurement requests are based on crowdsourcing queries from a plurality of parties; measuring contextual data in response to the plurality of measurement requests; and providing the contextual data to the remote server.","In another embodiment, a mobile platform includes a wireless transceiver for wirelessly receiving and transmitting data to a remote server; and a processor coupled to the wireless transceiver, the processor being configured to cause the wireless transceiver to receive a plurality of measurement requests from a server, wherein the plurality of measurement requests are based on crowdsourcing queries from a plurality of parties, to measure contextual data in response to the plurality of measurement requests, and to cause the wireless transceiver to provide the contextual data to the remote server.","In another embodiment, an apparatus includes means for receiving a plurality of measurement requests from a remote server, wherein the plurality of measurement requests are based on crowdsourcing queries from a plurality of parties; means for measuring contextual data in response to the plurality of measurement requests; and means for providing the contextual data to the remote server.","In yet another embodiment, a non-transitory computer-readable medium including program code stored thereon includes program code to cause a wireless receiver to receive a plurality of measurement requests from a remote server, wherein the plurality of measurement requests are based on crowdsourcing queries from a plurality of parties; program code to measure contextual data in response to the plurality of measurement requests; and program code to cause a wireless transmitter to provide the contextual data to the remote server.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","106","102","104","106","100","106","100","104","100"]},"As illustrated in , multiple parties , identified as party A, party B, and party C (which are sometimes referred to herein as parties  or party ) may individually communicate with a server  to provide individual desired queries, identified as Desired Query A, Desired Query B, and Desired Query C, respectively. Of course, there is no limitation on the number of entities that may be included in parties . The different parties may be third parties, e.g., external entities such as customers, as well as entity that controls and operates the server . Additionally, it should be understood that while a single server  is illustrated in  for simplicity, the server  may be a network of servers that collectively perform the function of server .","The desired queries provided by the parties  are generally related to contextual information for specific locations. Contextual information as used herein refers to the physical properties of the specific location, e.g., noise level, temperature, or any other information that may be measured using sensors on a mobile platform. Contextual information may also refer to description of the behavior of a user of a mobile platform while at the specific location, e.g., whether the user is standing, sitting, walking, talking, etc. Contextual information may also refers to a description of the mobile platform itself, and more particularly, how the mobile platform is being used, e.g., what specific applications are being run or what web sites are being visited.","The content of the desired queries, except for location, may be pre-generated and made available by server  based on the types of contextual data that can be measured by mobile platforms . For example, sensors on the mobile platform that may be used to measure contextual data for crowdsourcing include cameras, wireless transceivers (e.g., to measure WiFi Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) or Round Trip Time (RTT)), microphones, thermometers, motion and\/or position sensors (e.g., accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, etc.), ambient light detectors, etc. . . . Thus, for example, desired queries may include a request for information related to the noise levels or temperatures at a specific location, such as a store, or across multiple locations, e.g., a chain of stores. More specifically, the request may be related to variations in noise level or temperature within locations, such as a mall. A query may be related to information with respect to WiFi access points at a location, such as new access points in a specific mall.","Contextual data related to the mobile platform may be obtained based on the type of application that is being run on the mobile platform, e.g., whether the mobile platform is being used as a cellular telephone, an SMS messenger, email client, internet access, etc., as well as specifics of the use, e.g., the internet sites being accessed, such as social network sites. Contextual data related to the behavior of the user may be obtained based on sensors, such as motion and\/or position sensors, ambient light detectors, etc., as well as the type of application that is being run on the mobile platform. Thus, for example, queries may be related to the number or demographic of people at a specific location or that pass a specific location and at what times. Queries may also be related to contextual information about the behavior of people, such as the context in which people tend to use social networking.","The server  processes the desired queries from the parties  and generates specific measurement requests for contextual data, which are provided to the mobile platforms , labeled as mobile platforms A, B, C, and D. The measurement requests generated by the server  are provided to the mobile platforms  so that the resources of the mobile platforms are used efficiently. In other words, the same measurement requests may not be sent to every mobile platform simultaneously. Crowdsourcing is a location driven activity, and thus, the location of a particular mobile platform, as well as other relevant factors, may be used to determine if a measurement request is transmitted to (or accepted by) a particular mobile platform.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"sub":["A ","B ","A ","B ","A ","B ","A ","B "],"b":["106","106","106","106","106","102","102","102","102","106","106","106","106","106","106","106","106","106"]},"As illustrated in , once the mobile platforms  collect the requested contextual data, the mobile platforms  return the contextual data to the server , which stores the data, e.g., in database . The mobile platforms  may provide the raw contextual data, or if desired, the mobile platforms  may appropriately process the contextual data, e.g., at the request of the server , or strip the data of any information that may be considered private, before sending the contextual data to the server .
