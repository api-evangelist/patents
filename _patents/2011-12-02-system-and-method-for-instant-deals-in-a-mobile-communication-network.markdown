Such information includes, among other things, directory information and information relating to products and services such as, for example, advertisements of various types. Many mobile communications networks are additionally aware of end-users' geospatial location in real-time, as well as users' demographic information and online activities.","The following description and drawings are illustrative and are not to be construed as limiting. Numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding. However, in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order to avoid obscuring the description. References to one or an embodiment in the present disclosure are not necessarily references to the same embodiment; and, such references mean at least one.","Reference in this specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d or \u201can embodiment\u201d means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the disclosure. The appearances of the phrase \u201cin one embodiment\u201d in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment, nor are separate or alternative embodiments mutually exclusive of other embodiments. Moreover, various features are described which may be exhibited by some embodiments and not by others. Similarly, various requirements are described which may be requirements for some embodiments but not other embodiments.","Various embodiments of the systems and methods provide information relating to businesses' deals and promotions to users of a mobile communication network, such that such deals and promotions are relevant to, inter alia, users' current geospatial location. In an embodiment, the systems and methods disclosed herein provide the capability for businesses to create \u201cinstant deals\u201d\u2014e.g. an offer created on a moments notice in real-time\u2014based on, inter alia, users' current location and time. Instant deals are used, inter alia, to motivate buyer to come in to a business' location for an instant deal. An instant deal motivates a buyer to make a purchase within a short time frame, for example, in the next hour or two, as opposed to a coupon that expires in a month.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"100"},"Two users  and  are linked to a mobile communications network  via their respective mobile devices  and . The mobile communications network  can be any type of mobile communications network such as, without limitation, CDMA, GSM and satellite-based networks. The mobile devices  and  can be any type of portable device capable of communicating with the mobile network such as, without limitation, cell phones, smart phones, PDAs, tablet PC's laptop PCs and PDAs. In various embodiments, the mobile communications network  provides voice and messaging capabilities and may provide access to other networks such as, for example, other mobile communications networks and\/or the Internet.","The mobile communications network  tracks the geospatial location of the users' mobile devices  and  in real-time or near-time as the devices move with their respective users  and  from point to point. In various embodiments, the location of the mobile devices is determined using any technique now known, or later to be developed, in the art. For example, in an embodiment, the mobile devices  and  themselves automatically determine their own geospatial location via built in GPS capabilities and communicate their location to the mobile communications network  periodically or continuously. Additionally or alternatively, in an embodiment, the mobile communications network  determines the location of user mobile devices  and  using capabilities inherent in the network such as by triangulation or by determining the nearest transmission tower to the devices.","In the illustrated example, the users  and  are at geospatial positions within the coverage area of the mobile communications network . The mobile communications network  is aware of, and actively tracks, the geospatial position of the users'  and  mobile devices  and . The users  and  interact with their mobile devices  and  in a variety of ways including, without limitation, sending and receiving voice and text messages, sending and receiving emails, searching for subject matter using Internet based search and\/or directory services and a variety of mobile apps hosted by their client devices.","In so interacting with their mobile devices, the users  and  broadcast data relating to their intent over the mobile communications network . The term \u201cintent\u201d should be understood to refer to, without limitation, the user's intent in engaging in activities on their mobile device, and in particular, provides information suggesting actions the user currently intends to take, for example, purchase a product, eat a meal or purchase a service. In the illustrated example, the users  and  are broadcasting their intent relating to, among other things, having their hair styled or cut, purchasing golf clubs and finding a nearby restaurant.","In the illustrated example, the user  is not currently within close geospatial proximity of any businesses that relate to the user's intent and, therefore, the user  does not receive any offers relating to the user's intent. On the other hand, the user  is currently in close geospatial proximity (e.g. within 0.25 miles) of a variety of businesses that relate to the user's intent, including retail stores , personal services  and restaurants . In response to the user's  broadcast intent and current geospatial position, the user's mobile device  receives, via the mobile communication network , a set of offers  relating to the user's intent for nearby businesses.","Thus, for example, if the user  enters a search query on an Internet search service for \u201chairstyling,\u201d \u201chair cuts\u201d or \u201cbeauty parlor,\u201d the user receives a offer  from a nearby hairstyling business (i.e. a personal service ), offering the next 10 customers 30% off for the next two hours. In another example, if the user  browses a service directory (e.g. online YELLOW PAGES) and looks at listings for golf equipment, the user receives a offer  from a nearby golf equipment store (i.e. a retail store ) offering $10 off a brand of drivers sold by the store for the day to customers receiving the offer. In yet another example, if the user  sends a text message to a friend inviting the friend to lunch, the user receives a offer  from a nearby sandwich shop (i.e. a restaurant ) offering a $2.00 coupon that expires at 4:30 PM.","In an embodiment, the offers and promotions originate from a mobile advertising service provider (not shown in ) that broadcasts the offers  to the user via the mobile communications network .  illustrates an embodiment of a high-level overview  of mobile advertising service provider  and a network configuration through which the provider interacts with users  and service and product providers .","In the illustrated embodiment, a number of businesses offering products and\/or services  wish to provide offers to users  via a mobile communications network  when such users meet user selection criteria relating to the users' current geospatial position and intent. For example, such selection criteria can select users  intending to purchase a particular product or service when such users are within a predefined distance of a business  offering such products or services. Offer criteria could additionally include any other data relevant to the offer such as, without limitation, user interests, user demographics, the product or service, the date and\/or the time-of-day. In various embodiments, the user selection criteria can specify offers sent immediately to qualifying users  or can specify offers sent qualifying users  at a future point in time.","In an embodiment, the businesses  utilize the services of a mobile advertising service provider  to deliver offers to users  that meet the businesses' offer user selection criteria. In an embodiment, the businesses  communicate information defining offers, including offer details and user selection criteria, to the mobile advertising service provider . In various embodiments, businesses  communicate information defining offers to the mobile advertising service provider  by any conventional means such as, without limitation, the Internet  via email or a website provided by the mobile advertising service provider, by voice message or text message and so forth.","In an embodiment, data relating to offers and user selection criteria are stored and updated on one or more mobile advertising databases  maintained by the mobile advertising service provider  via facilities hosted on one or more mobile advertising servers. In various embodiments, offer details can specify any type of advertisement, promotion or offer that can be delivered to users  mobile devices. Such advertisements, promotions and offers could take the form of, without limitation, text objects, HTML objects, media objects, voice messages and text messages, and could be communicated to users  mobile devices via any available means such as, for example, via the Internet  or via any other facilities provided by the mobile communications network .","In an embodiment, facilities hosted on the mobile advertising servers  obtain data relating to the location of users  and the users' interactions with their mobile devices via the mobile communications network . In an embodiment, the mobile advertising servers  archive historical information on the mobile advertising databases  relating to users' geospatial locations over time. In an embodiment, the mobile advertising servers  archive historical information on the mobile advertising databases  relating to historical information relating to users' interactions with their mobile device over time. In an embodiment, the mobile advertising servers  maintain various other types of information on the mobile advertising databases  relating to users that may be relevant to businesses  such as, without limitation, user profile information, user demographics and user interests. In an embodiment, such information is obtained from any available source such as, for example, the mobile communications network , user profile or interest information on third party websites (not shown) or directly from the users  via the Internet .","In an embodiment, the mobile network  provides data relating to all users  of the mobile network to the mobile advertising service provider  on a periodic or continuous basis. In an embodiment, users  explicitly register with the mobile advertising service provider  and the mobile network  only provide data relating to registered users to the mobile advertising service provider . In an embodiment, users  register with the mobile advertising service provider  and maintain various types of profile and preference information stored on the mobile advertising databases  via facilities provided by the mobile advertising servers  such as, for example, a website.","In an embodiment, the facilities hosted on the mobile advertising servers  identify data relating to users'  intent from the data relating to the users' interactions with their mobile devices. In an embodiment, intent is inferred from text entered by users  into messages and\/or search queries sent from the users' mobile devices using any textual, linguistic or semantic technique known in the art, for example, parsing and identifying keywords, key phrases and other textual signals within such text. Intent can also be inferred from other any other user  actions that do not relate to text entry, such as, for example, user selection of specific websites or directory entries. In an embodiment, historical and informational data relating to users is used to infer user intent.","In an embodiment, the facilities hosted on the mobile advertising servers  utilize data relating to the location of users  to track the current location of individual users. In an embodiment, periodically or continuously, facilities hosted on the mobile advertising servers  matches users  whose current geospatial location is known against the user selection criteria of active offers (e.g. not expired, and within any active time period specified for the offer, if applicable). In an embodiment, for at least some offers, such user selection criteria comprise solely geospatial criteria. In an embodiment, for at least some offers, such user selection criteria additionally comprise user intent criteria. In an embodiment, for at least some offers, such additionally comprise other user selection criteria such as, for example, user interests and\/or demographics. In an embodiment, for at least some offers, additionally comprise temporal criteria such, for example, as date and time ranges.","In an embodiment, when the facilities hosted on the mobile advertising servers  match users  to offer selection criteria for specific offers stored on the mobile advertising databases , facilities on the mobile advertising servers transmit such offers to the selected users'  mobile devices via any available communications channels suitable for transmitting the offer to the mobile devices. In an embodiment, such channels include the Internet  and\/or the mobile communications network .","In an embodiment, user  devices may provide facilities to filter such offers via offer selection criteria (e.g. specific categories, products, vendors and so forth), such that the user  devices automatically delete any offer that does not meet offer selection criteria. In an embodiment, user  devices may provide facilities to filter such offers via offer rejection criteria (e.g. specific categories, products, vendors and so forth), such that the user  devices automatically delete any offer that meets offer rejection criteria. In an embodiment, the mobile advertising service provider  provides facilities, via the mobile advertising servers,  to maintain preferences for individual users  that include offer filtration criteria (e.g. offer selection and\/or rejection criteria) such that the mobile advertising servers  filter offers initially selected for individual users using the individual user's filtration criteria.","In an embodiment, businesses  can, using facilities hosted on the mobile advertising servers , issue user location queries to determine if any users  known to the system are currently in a specific geographic location or area. In an embodiment, such queries may additionally include query criteria relating to users'  intent. In an embodiment, such queries may additionally include query criteria relating to any other data relating to users  that may be relevant such as, for example, user interests or demographics. In an embodiment, certain demographics or other user attributes cannot be used in queries where such attributes specifically identify a group at potentially at risk for exploitation or abuse, for example, gender, age or a combination of gender and age.","In an embodiment, the results of user location queries by businesses  simply return a count of users  meeting user location query criteria. For example, a if a sushi restaurant in a mall issues a user location query for users  in the mall that intend to eat and like sushi, the system returns a count of the users meeting such criteria. In an embodiment, due to privacy concerns, the system does not reveal the identity of specific users meeting user location query criteria or any other details relating to such users as individuals, nor, in some embodiments, their precise geospatial location.","In an embodiment, if the results of a user location query by a business  indicate one or more users  meet query criteria, the business can, using facilities hosted on the mobile advertising servers , send one or more offers to the mobile advertising service provider  that are immediately delivered to the selected users.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"]},"In , the system  includes an inter-connect  (e.g., bus and system core logic), which interconnects a microprocessor(s)  and memory .

Thus, the techniques are neither limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software nor to any particular source for the instructions executed by the data processing system.","Although some of the drawings illustrate a number of operations in a particular order, operations which are not order dependent may be reordered and other operations may be combined or broken out. While some reordering or other groupings are specifically mentioned, others will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art and so do not present an exhaustive list of alternatives. Moreover, it should be recognized that the stages could be implemented in hardware, firmware, software or any combination thereof.","In the foregoing specification, the disclosure has been described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments thereof. It will be evident that various modifications may be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit and scope as set forth in the following claims. The specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative sense rather than a restrictive sense."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The embodiments are illustrated by way of example and not limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings in which like references indicate similar elements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0004"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 7"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
