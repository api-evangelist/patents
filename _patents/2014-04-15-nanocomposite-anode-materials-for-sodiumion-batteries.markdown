No. 61\/812,409 filed Apr. 16, 2013. The contents of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","The present invention was developed using funding from the United States government through Department of Energy Grant No. DE-SC005397. The United States government has certain rights to the invention.","The current invention relates to materials usable as anodes in batteries, particularly lithium-ion secondary (rechargeable) batteries. The invention also relates to anodes and batteries containing such materials. The invention further relates to methods of making the materials and anodes and batteries using such materials.","Basic Principles of Batteries and Electrochemical Cells","Batteries may be divided into two principal types, primary batteries and secondary batteries. Primary batteries may be used once and are then exhausted. Secondary batteries are also often called rechargeable batteries because after use they may be connected to an electricity supply, such as a wall socket, and recharged and used again. In secondary batteries, each charge\/discharge process is called a cycle. Secondary batteries eventually reach an end of their usable life, but typically only after many charge\/discharge cycles.","Secondary batteries are made up of an electrochemical cell and optionally other materials, such as a casing to protect the cell and wires or other connectors to allow the battery to interface with the outside world. An electrochemical cell includes two electrodes, the positive electrode or cathode and the negative electrode or anode, an insulator separating the electrodes so the battery does not short out, and an electrolyte that chemically connects the electrodes.","In operation the secondary battery exchanges chemical energy and electrical energy. During discharge of the battery, electrons, which have a negative charge, leave the anode and travel through outside electrical conductors, such as wires in a cell phone or computer, to the cathode. In the process of traveling through these outside electrical conductors, the electrons generate an electrical current, which provides electrical energy.","At the same time, in order to keep the electrical charge of the anode and cathode neutral, an ion having a positive charge leaves the anode and enters the electrolyte and a positive ion also leaves the electrolyte and enters the cathode. In order for this ion movement to work, typically the same type of ion leaves the anode and joins the cathode. Additionally, the electrolyte typically also contains this same type of ion. In order to recharge the battery, the same process happens in reverse. By supplying energy to the cell, electrons are induced to leave the cathode and join the anode. At the same time a positive ion, such as Na, leaves the cathode and enters the electrolyte and a Na leaves the electrolyte and joins the anode to keep the overall electrode charge neutral.","In addition to containing an active material that exchanges electrons and ions, anodes and cathodes often contain other materials, such as a metal backing to which a slurry is applied and dried. The slurry often contains the active material as well as a binder to help it adhere to the backing and conductive materials, such as carbon particles. Once the slurry dries it forms a coating on the metal backing.","Unless additional materials are specified, batteries as described herein include systems that are merely electrochemical cells as well as more complex systems.","Anodes in Sodium-Ion Batteries","In order for a battery to function properly, the materials used in the anode, cathode and electrolyte are typically selected to have compatible electrical, chemical, and electrochemical properties. For instance, the materials may be selected to operate at compatible voltages. A variety of anodes have been developed for lithium-ion batteries and many varieties of such batteries have been commercially successful. The same is not true, however, of sodium-ion batteries, which often require a different anode or cathode than lithium-ion batteries due to a variety of differences between the lithium ion (Li) and the sodium ion (Na). In particular, the larger radius of Na makes it difficult to find an electrode material that can reversibly contain Na. This had resulted in the development of very few commercially available sodium-ion batteries.","Examples of commercially available sodium-ion batteries include the Na\/S battery and the Na\/NiClbattery (also called the ZEBRA battery). These batteries require the use of molten materials that are difficult to maintain. The use of simpler materials, such as carbon-based anodes, has been investigated, but has not resulted in a commercially viable product. For instance, a great deal of research has focused on hard carbon anodes (e.g. non-graphitizable carbon), which can deliver a reversible capacity of 200-300 mAh\/g, but which suffer from poor reversibility. Similarly, graphite has proven to be unsuitable anode material because the large sodium ions cannot enter and intercalate properly. Due to the voltages at which sodium-ion batteries must operate, which is close to the voltage at which sodium ions convert to metallic sodium, all sodium ion batteries with a carbon anode also suffer from sodium plating, resulting in the formation of a solid-electrolyte interfacial (SEI) layer, which impede sodium ion movement, or dendrites, which may cause dangerous short circuits in the battery. Carbon anodes suffer from the further drawback of manganese poisoning when used with manganese-containing cathodes, which limits battery life.","Recently, in lithium-ion batteries, a new type of anode in which metallic and intermetallic materials that react with Li to form an alloy have showed promise, but like other anodes, these materials must allow passage of the ion in order to function. Accordingly, this type of material has not previously been investigated for the much larger Na, which, as discussed above, does not readily function with most lithium-ion battery anodes.","In one embodiment, the disclosure relates to an anode material for a sodium-ion battery. The anode material contains a matrix having the general formula AO\u2014C, where A is aluminum (Al), magnesium (Mg), titanium (Ti), vanadium (V), chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), zirconium (Zr), molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W), niobium (Nb), tantalum (Ta), silicon (Si), or any combinations thereof. The anode material also contains an electrochemically active nanoparticles within the matrix. The nanoparticle may react with sodium ion (Na) when placed in the anode of a sodium-ion battery.","In a more specific embodiment, the anode material has the general formula MSb-M\u2032O\u2014C, where M is selected iron (Fe), copper (Cu), molybdenum (Mo), nickel (Ni), titanium (Ti), tin (Sn), or any combinations thereof, and M\u2032 is aluminum (Al), magnesium (Mg), titanium (Ti), vanadium (V), chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), zirconium (Zr), molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W), niobium (Nb), tantalum (Ta), or any combinations thereof.","In another more specific embodiment, the anode material has the general formula Sb-MO\u2014C, where M is aluminum (Al), magnesium (Mg), titanium (Ti), vanadium (V), chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), zirconium (Zr), molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W), niobium (Nb), or tantalum (Ta), or any combinations thereof.","In another embodiment, the disclosure relates to an anode material for a sodium-ion battery. The anode material contains a matrix having the general formula AC\u2014C, where A is aluminum (Al), magnesium (Mg), titanium (Ti), vanadium (V), chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), zirconium (Zr), molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W), niobium (Nb), tantalum (Ta), silicon (Si), or any combinations thereof. The anode material also contains an electrochemically active nanoparticles within the matrix. The nanoparticle may react with sodium ion (Na) when placed in the anode of a sodium-ion battery.","In a more specific embodiment, the anode material has the general formula MSn-M\u2032C\u2014C, where M is copper (Cu), molybdenum (Mo), nickel (Ni), titanium (Ti), zinc (Zn), or antimony (Sb), or any combinations thereof, and M\u2032 is titanium (Ti), vanadium (V), chromium (Cr), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W), silicon (Si), or any combinations thereof.","In another more specific embodiment, the anode material has the general formula Sn-MC\u2014C, where M is titanium (Ti), vanadium (V), chromium (Cr), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W), silicon (Si), or any combinations thereof.","Other embodiments relate to anodes or rechargeable batteries containing these materials as well as methods of making these materials using ball-milling techniques.","In the general formulas used herein, hyphens \u201c-\u201d indicate chemical compositions that are intermingled to form a nanocomposite material. Chemical bonds may or may not be present between these components of a nanocomposite material.","The following abbreviations are commonly used throughout the specification:\n\n","The current disclosure relates to nanocomposite anode materials for sodium-ion batteries, anodes and batteries containing such materials, and methods of making these materials. Although the anode materials are typically described herein in their desodiated forms, when used in a rechargeable sodium-ion battery, they will additionally contain sodium ions (Na) in amounts that will vary as the battery cycles through its charged and discharged states. The number of Na that may be in any general chemical formula will depend on the number of elections gained by the anode material when that battery is in a fully charged state as compared to a fully discharged state.","All embodiments of the present disclosure contain a carbon-inactive material matrix that contains nanoparticles of an electrochemically active material. This matrix acts as a buffer to accommodate volume changes in the electrochemically active material as sodium ions enter and leave the electrochemically active material during battery cycling.","The matrix material has the general formula AO\u2014C or AC\u2014C, wherein A is a metal such as aluminum (Al), magnesium (Mg), titanium (Ti), vanadium (V), chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), zirconium (Zr), molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W), niobium (Nb), or tantalum (Ta), or combinations thereof, or similar metals and combinations thereof, or even a non-metal such as silicon (Si), or a similar non-metal, which may be used in combination with any of the above metals. The AOor ACmay be amorphous or partially amorphous and may form a conductive carbon matrix with the C. The electrochemically active material may be dispersed within this matrix.","Nanocomposite anode materials with a matrix of the general formula AO\u2014C or AC\u2014C, particularly those materials described in further detail below, may have a capacity of 200-400 mAh\/g at C\/3 or higher current densities. These nanocomposite materials may be able to operate at higher voltages versus sodium as compared to carbon anodes and thus may be less likely to exhibit SEI layer formation or dendrite formation, making these anode safer than carbon anodes. Additionally, these materials may be more resistant to manganese poisoning than carbon anodes when combined with a manganese-containing cathode such as a sodium manganese oxide cathode.","Furthermore, anode materials with a matrix of the general formula AO\u2014C or AC\u2014C, particularly those materials described in further detail below, may allow the formation of an electrochemically active sodium-alloy material contained within the matrix during an alloying reaction (sodication), which may disappear during a dealloying reaction (desodation). Alternatively, the matrix may contain the electrochemically active material in different crystalline\/amorphous phases during battery cycling (sodation and desodation). Even within a similar material, use of a different metal may result in differences in crystalline\/amorphous phase changes.","Use of a matrix in combination with a sodium-ion-reactive electrochemically active species may help prevent or decrease large volume changes in the electrochemically active species during sodation and desodiation. Due to the larger size of the sodium ion as compared to the lithium ion, sodium-ion batteries may otherwise experience more substantial volume changes than lithium-ion batteries. Furthermore, the larger size of the sodium ion may make re-intercalation into the electrochemically active material more difficult than when lithium ions are used. Thus, the matrix may prove particularly helpful for sodium-ion battery anode materials.","MSb-M\u2032O\u2014C Materials","The first type of anode material has the general formula MSb-M\u2032O\u2014C, where M may be a metal such as iron (Fe), copper (Cu), molybdenum (Mo), nickel (Ni), titanium (Ti), or tin (Sn), or combination thereof, or similar metals and combinations thereof, and where M\u2032 may be aluminum (Al), magnesium (Mg), titanium (Ti), vanadium (V), chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), zirconium (Zr), molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W), niobium (Nb), or tantalum (Ta), or combinations thereof, or similar metals and combinations thereof. In specific embodiments, the first type of anode material may have the general formula CuSb\u2014AlO\u2014C, FeSb\u2014AlO\u2014C, or NiSb\u2014AlO\u2014C.","In specific embodiments, the material may be present in the form of a nanocomposite material in which nanostructured crystalline particles of MSb are embedded in a matrix of the other materials and provide electrochemical activity to the nanocomposite. In the MSb portion, a conductive M framework supports the electrochemically active Sb. M\u2032O, which may also be referred to as a ceramic oxide, may be amorphous or partially amorphous. The \u2014C portion forms a conductive carbon matrix with the M\u2032O. MSb is dispersed within this matrix.","In one embodiment, the particulate or crystalline nature of the MSb portion of the MSb-M\u2032O\u2014C anode material may not develop until after the material has been cycled in an electrochemical cell.","Materials of the general formula MSb-M\u2032O\u2014C may reduce or minimize the effects of changes in volume as sodium ions enter and leave the material by blending nanostructured materials that are electrochemically active towards sodium (MSb) with materials that are inactive towards sodium (M\u2032Oand \u2014C) to form nanocomposite anode materials. Although, in some embodiments, the nanostructured materials may offer shorter diffusion lengths for sodium ions and may accommodate the strain due to volume changes during battery cycling, the large surface-area-to-volume ratio resulting from the particles' small size and the high surface reactivity of these nanostructured materials may be problematic. The addition of M\u2032O\u2014C to form an inactive matrix may help buffer the volume change in the electrochemically active material during charge\/discharge cycles. The M\u2032O\u2014C matrix may also reduce agglomeration of the MSb particles, which is detrimental to battery performance.","Anode materials with the general formula MSb-M\u2032O\u2014C typically operate at potentials sufficiently higher than the potential at which Na converts to Nato avoid plating of sodium metal on the anode, or to reduce the rate of plating to a rate sufficiently low to avoid failure of the battery due to a short circuit during its expected lifetime. The operational potential may also prevent or reduce formation of an SEI layer.","Anode materials with the general formula MSb-M\u2032O\u2014C may be synthesized, in some embodiments, by mechanochemical reduction of SbOwith M and M\u2032 metals in the presence of carbon. The carbon may be from an elemental or polymeric carbon source. For instance, it may be in the form of acetylene black or another similar material. In a specific embodiment, the mechanochemical reduction may be carried out in a single, one-step, high-energy mechanical milling (HEMM) process, which is a type of ball-milling process.","In another embodiment, anode materials of the general formula MSb-M\u2032O\u2014C may be synthesized first by preparing an alloy using high temperature methods, followed by ball-milling.","The large irreversible capacity loss found in the first cycle with some anodes is partly related to the presence of residual oxides of the electrochemically active species like Sb, and such large irreversible loss can be reduced and the coulombic efficiency can be increased by subsequent annealing at moderate temperature in reducing atmospheres.","MSn-M\u2032C\u2014C Materials","The second type of anode material has the general formula MSn-M\u2032C\u2014C, where M may be a metal such as copper (Cu), molybdenum (Mo), nickel (Ni), titanium (Ti), zinc (Zn), or antimony (Sb), combinations thereof, or similar metals and combinations thereof, and where M\u2032 may be titanium (Ti), vanadium (V), chromium (Cr), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W), or silicon (Si) or combinations thereof, or similar metals and combinations thereof.","In one embodiment, the particulate or crystalline nature of the MSn portion of the MSn-M\u2032C\u2014C anode material may not develop until after the material has been cycled in an electrochemical cell.","In an anode material with the general formula MSn-M\u2032C\u2014C, nanostructured MSn particles provide electrochemical activity and the conductive Cu framework supports the electrochemically active Sn.

Cyclic voltammetric measurements in the potential window of 0-2 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV swere carried out on a Solartron 1480 (Solartron Analytical, USA) multichannel potentiostat. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) analysis was conducted with a Solatron SI 1260 equipment. A signal of 10 mV in amplitude was applied in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz. In the EIS measurements, the MSb\u2014AlO\u2014C nanocomposite served as the working electrodes and sodium foil served as the counter and reference electrodes. The impedance response was measured after various number of cycles (1, 10, 20, 30, 40 50 cycles) at 2 V vs. Na\/Na.","Sodiation (discharge)\/desodiation (charge) reactions were carried out in the voltage range of 0 to 2 V.  shows the first charge\/discharge voltage profiles of all the nanocomposites. At a current rate of 100 mA g, the delivered charge capacity is 500 mAh gfor Sb\u2014C, 370 mAh gfor Sb\u2014AlO\u2014C, 250 mAh gfor CuSb\u2014AlO\u2014C, 350 mAh gfor FeSb\u2014AlO\u2014C, and 160 mAh gfor NiSb\u2014AlO\u2014C. The Coulombic efficiencies of Sb\u2014C, Sb\u2014AlO\u2014C, CuSb\u2014AlO\u2014C, FeSb\u2014AlO\u2014C, and NiSb\u2014AlO\u2014C are, respectively, 79%, 70%, 60%, 60%, and 62% in the first cycle. Looking at the Coulombic efficiencies, it appears that the incorporation of AlOand of a metal-supporter lowers the Coulombic efficiency in the first cycle. This irreversible capacity loss is related to the formation of solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer by a reaction of the electrode surface with the electrolyte. Nevertheless, the MSb\u2014AlO\u2014C nanocomposites exhibit very stable cyclic performance compared to those of Sb\u2014C and Sb\u2014AlO\u2014C with Coulombic efficiencies above 99% after the first cycle.","The Sb\u2014C and Sb\u2014AlO\u2014C electrodes show higher charge capacities than those of MSb\u2014AlO\u2014C (M=Fe, Ni, and Cu). However, they display very poor cyclability even in early cycles (). This might be due to the severe aggregation and high volume changes occurring during cycling. Such aggregations combined with large volume changes may destroy the SEI layer during each cycle, leading to the consumption of more Na ions to reform the SEI and thereby poor cyclic performance. The large volume changes can also lead to a crumbling of the electrode and loss of electrical contact with active material, resulting in large capacity loss. In contrast, the MSb\u2014AlO\u2014C nanocomposite electrodes show stable cyclability over many cycles as seen in ,  and .","With an objective to further understand the charge\/discharge process, cyclic voltammetric (CV) plots of several cycles were analyzed for the as-prepared nanocomposite electrodes as shown in  and . In the first discharge scan, all the electrodes show a broad band beginning around 1.0 V, which is related to the formation of SEI layer. In the case of Sb\u2014C and Sb\u2014AlO\u2014C, as shown in , there are two redox peaks around 0.67\/0.92 V and 0.30\/0.75 V. Similarly, the MSb\u2014AlO\u2014C (M=Fe and Cu) electrode scans display two pairs of redox bands around 0.76\/0.93 V and 0.28\/0.73 V, suggesting two steps of Na alloying\/deallying reactions. These two pairs of redox bands can be ascribed to the formation of NaSb and NaSb phases:\n\nSb+Na+eNaSb\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nNaSb+2Na+2eNaSb\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nIn contrast, the NiSb\u2014AlO\u2014C electrode displays a single redox peak around 0.38\/0.71 V. The two-step vs single-step reaction may be related to the differences in the reaction with sodium of different metal-supported-antimony.\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0100","num":"0116"},"figref":["FIG. 8A","FIG. 8B","FIG. 8A"],"sub":["2","3","x","2","3","2","3","x","2","3","2","2","3","2","2","3","2","3"],"sup":["\u22121","\u22121 "]},"In addition to the cyclic performance, the MSb\u2014AlO\u2014C electrodes also exhibit remarkably high-rate capability. ,  and  show the rate performance of the as-prepared nanocomposities. As shown in , the MSb\u2014AlO\u2014C nanocomposites deliver better rate capability than the Sb\u2014C and Sb\u2014AlO\u2014C composites, and  summarizes the results of normalized capacity retention vs. current rate. Furthermore, MSb\u2014AlO\u2014C nanocomposites exhibit excellent high-rate cycling performance. For instance, the CuSb\u2014AlO\u2014C electrode delivers a capacity of 230, 215, 196, 183, and 160 mAh gat current rates of, respectively, 500, 1,000, 3,000, 5,000, 10,000 mA gwith capacity retentions of 98, 88, 80, 76, and 67% at each current rate, as shown in .","To better understand the cyclic performance of the MSb\u2014AlO\u2014C electrodes, electrochemical impedance spectroscopic analysis (EIS) and morphology characterization with TEM were conducted. The impedance was measured after 1, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 cycles, and the results are presented in . Generally, the EIS spectrum can be divided into three frequency regions: low frequency, medium-to-low frequency, and high frequency, which correspond, respectively, to cell geometric capacitance, charge transfer reaction, and sodium-ion diffusion through the surface layer. The slope of the impedance curve in the low frequency region is related to sodium-ion diffusion in the bulk of the active material. A semicircle is observed for each of the high and medium-to-low frequency ranges. While the impedance of Sb\u2014C and Sb\u2014AlO\u2014C drastically increase during cycling, the impedance of MSb\u2014AlO\u2014C electrodes show only a gradual increase and their impedances are much less than those of the Sb\u2014C and Sb\u2014AlO\u2014C electrodes. Among the MSb\u2014AlO\u2014C electrodes, the impedance is in the following order: NiSb\u2014AlO\u2014C<CuSb\u2014AlO\u2014C<FeSb\u2014AlO\u2014C. Furthermore, when observing the morphology of the as-prepared materials before and after 50 cycles, it is noted that the particle sizes of Sb\u2014C and Sb\u2014AlO\u2014C are greatly increased and several particles in many regions are aggregated to each other after cycling as shown in  and , resulting in an increase in impedance during cycling. In contrast, the particle sizes of MSb\u2014AlO\u2014C samples after 50 cycles do not present any dramatic increase. For example, the NiSb\u2014AlO\u2014C sample has similar particle sizes before and after 50 cycles as shown in . Also, in the case of FeSb\u2014AlO\u2014C, it is noted that there are some regions where particles are agglomerated after 50 cycles. The extent of particle dispersion after 50 cycles is in the following order: FeSb\u2014AlO\u2014C<CuSb\u2014AlOC<NiSb\u2014AlO\u2014C. Therefore, the results from the impedance analysis and morphology study are in good agreement with the cyclability data performed at 100 mA g, illustrating that the NiSb\u2014AlO\u2014C and CuSb\u2014AlO\u2014C electrodes exhibit better cyclic performance than the FeSb\u2014AlO\u2014C electrode as shown in .","For ex situ XRD measurements to further determine the Na-storage mechanism in the MSb\u2014AlO\u2014C electrodes, the electrochemical cells tested as in Example 4 were and at different states were disassembled in an Ar-filled glove box.
