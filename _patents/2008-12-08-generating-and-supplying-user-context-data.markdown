title: Generating and supplying user context data
abstract: Techniques are described for providing information about a context that is modeled with multiple context attributes. In some situations, at least some of the context attributes have values used by modules for generating values of other context attributes, and the providing includes determining that a first module is generating a first value of a first of the context attributes of the modeled context and determining that a circular reference exists when it is determined that a module is to generate another value of the first context attribute such that the generating of the another value is caused by the generating of the first value of the first context attribute.

No. 09\/724,799 entitled \u201cGenerating And Supplying User Context Data\u201d and filed Nov. 28, 2000 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,464,153, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,464,153 (issued Dec. 9, 2008), which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/194,760, filed Apr. 2, 2000, entitled \u201cGenerating And Supplying User Context Data\u201d, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/193,999, filed Apr. 2, 2000, entitled \u201cObtaining And Using Contextual Data For Selected Tasks Or Scenarios, Such As For A Wearable Personal Computer.\u201d The entireties of the above-referenced applications are hereby incorporated by reference. This application is also related to application Ser. No. 10\/984,511, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,779,015 (issued Aug. 17, 2010).","The following disclosure relates generally to computer-based modeling of information, and more particularly to modeling and exchanging context data, such as for a wearable personal computer.","Computer systems increasingly have access to a profusion of input information. For example, a computer may be able to receive instructions and other input from a user via a variety of input devices, such as a keyboard, various pointing devices, or an audio microphone. A computer may also be able to receive information about its surroundings using a variety of sensors, such as temperature sensors. In addition, computers can also receive information and communicate with other devices using various types of network connections and communication schemes (e.g., wire-based, infrared or radio communication).","Wearable personal computers (or \u201cwearables\u201d) can have even greater access to current input information. Wearables are devices that commonly serve as electronic companions and intelligent assistants to their users, and are typically strapped to their users' bodies or carried by their user in a holster. Like other computers, wearables may have access to a wide variety of input devices. Moreover, in addition to more conventional input devices, a wearable may have a variety of other input devices such as chording keyboards or a digitizer tablet. Similarly, a wearable computer may have access to a wide variety of sensors, such as barometric pressure sensors, global positioning system devices, or a heart rate monitor for determining the heart rate of its user. Wearables also may have access to a wide variety of non-conventional output devices, such as display eyeglasses and tactile output devices.","Many applications executing on computers utilize data received by the computer from sensors or other input sources. For example, a position mapping application for a wearable computer may utilize data received from a global positioning system device in order to plot its user's physical location and to determine whether that position is within a specified region. In this example, the global positioning system device produces data that is consumed by the position mapping application.","In conventional wearable computer systems, the position mapping application would be designed to interact directly with the global positioning system device sensor to obtain the needed data. For example, the application may be required to instruct the device to obtain position information, retrieve the information obtained by the device, convert it to conventional latitude and longitude representation, and determine whether the represented location is within the special region.","The need for such direct interaction between applications and sensors in order to obtain and process data has several significant disadvantages. First, developing an application to interact directly with a particular sensor can introduce sensor-specific dependencies into the application. Accordingly, the application may need to be subsequently modified to be able to interact successfully with alternatives to that sensor provided by other manufacturers, or even to interact successfully with future versions of the same sensor. Alternately, the sensor could be developed to explicitly support a particular type of application (e.g., via a device driver provided with the sensor), which would analogously introduce application-specific dependencies into the sensor.","Second, direct interaction between the application and the sensor can give rise to conflicts between multiple applications that consume the same data. For example, if the position mapping application was executing on the same wearable computer as a second application for determining the user's distance from home, and the second application also used the global positioning system device, the two applications' interactions with the device could interfere with one another.","Third, direct interaction between the application and the sensor can give rise to conflicts between multiple sensors that produce the same data. For example, if the position mapping application was executing on a wearable computer that had access to both the global positioning system device and an indoor positioning system, the application might well have trouble determining which device to use to determine the user's current position, and\/or have trouble reconciling data produced by both devices.","Fourth, rather than an application having to directly process observable data from the sensors and derive more abstract information itself, it would be advantageous for the application to be able to rely on a separate programmatic entity that derives such abstract information and provides it to the application. For example, it would be more convenient for the position mapping application to be able to rely on a separate programmatic entity that determines the user's location, and to then use that information to determine whether the user is in a special region.","Accordingly, a facility for exchanging information between sensors and applications in a wearable computer system would have significant utility.","A software facility is described below that exchanges information between sources of context data and consumers of context data. In particular, in a preferred embodiment, a characterization module operating in a wearable computer system receives context information from one or more context servers (or \u201csuppliers\u201d), and provides that information to one or more context clients (or \u201cconsumers\u201d). This context information represents a particular context (or \u201cstate\u201d or \u201ccondition\u201d) of the wearable, the user of the wearable, the surrounding physical environment and\/or the available electronic data environment (or \u201ccyber-environment\u201d). In some embodiments the context is represented (or \u201cmodeled\u201d) with a variety of attributes (or \u201cvariables\u201d) each modeling a single aspect of the context. By facilitating the exchange of context information, the facility reduces dependencies of context client applications on specific sensors and other input sources, resolves conflicts between context client applications that consume the same context data, resolves conflicts between multiple sensors or other input sources that produce the same data, and isolates the generation of derived attributes from context client applications.","A context is modeled or represented with multiple attributes that each correspond to a specific element of the context (e.g., ambient temperature, location or a current user activity), and the value of an attribute represents a specific measure of that element. Thus, for example, for an attribute that represents the temperature of the surrounding air, an 80\u00b0 Fahrenheit value represents a specific measurement of that temperature. Each attribute preferably has the following properties: a name, a value, an uncertainty level, units, and a timestamp. Thus, for example, the name of the air temperature attribute may be \u201cambient-temperature,\u201d its units may be degrees Fahrenheit, and its value at a particular time may by 80. Associated with the current value may be a timestamp of 02\/27\/99 13:07 PST that indicates when the value was generated, and an uncertainty level of +\/\u22121 degrees.","Context servers supply values for attributes by receiving and processing input information from sensors or other sources. Attribute values provided by a context server may either be \u201cmeasured\u201d (or \u201cobserved\u201d) in that they are directly received from an input source, or may instead be \u201cderived\u201d in that they are the result of performing processing on one or more measured attribute values. Indeed, a derived attribute value may be produced by performing additional processing on one or more other derived attribute values. Context attributes (or \u201ccondition variables\u201d) are discussed in greater detail in both U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/216,193, filed Dec. 18, 1998 and entitled \u201cMETHOD AND SYSTEM FOR CONTROLLING PRESENTATION OF INFORMATION TO A USER BASED ON THE USER'S CONDITION,\u201d and provisional U.S. Patent Application No. 60\/193,999, filed Apr. 2, 2000 and entitled \u201cOBTAINING AND USING CONTEXTUAL DATA FOR SELECTED TASKS OR SCENARIOS, SUCH AS FOR A WEARABLE PERSONAL COMPUTER,\u201d which are both hereby incorporated by reference.","When the characterization module obtains an attribute value from a context server, it caches the value for use when responding to future requests from context clients for a value of the attribute. Thus, when the characterization module receives a request from a context client for the value of an attribute, the characterization module determines whether it has a cached value for the attribute and, if so, whether the value is sufficiently accurate (e.g., the value does not have too high of an uncertainty) and\/or sufficiently recent (e.g., the value is not too old). If the value is not sufficiently accurate or recent, the characterization module requests and receives an updated value for the attribute from the context server that supplied the value. When the characterization module has a sufficiently accurate and recent value, it supplies the value to the context client. The determination of whether a value is sufficiently accurate and recent can be made in a is variety of ways, such as by using thresholds for recency or uncertainty that can be specified by the context client during the request, by a context server for all values of an attribute or for a specific attribute value, or by the characterization module.","In some embodiments, two or more different context servers may supply to the characterization module their own distinct values for a single attribute. For example, a first context server can supply a value for a user.location attribute based on data received from a global positioning system device, while a second context server can supply a value for the user.location attribute based on data received from an indoor positioning device. Alternately, the first and second context servers could use the same input information when determining the value for a single attribute, but could use different methods to perform the determining and could thus arrive at different values. When multiple content servers supply values for the same attribute, each of the context servers is said to supply values for a separate \u201cinstance\u201d of the attribute. The characterization module preferably provides a variety of different approaches, called \u201cmediators,\u201d for determining what attribute value to provide when a context client requests a value for an attribute that has more than one instance.","For attributes with multiple instances, the characterization module performs similar processing to that described above. In particular, the characterization module can maintain a unique cached value for each attribute instance. If the characterization module receives a request for a value of a particular attribute instance, the request is handled as discussed above. If the characterization module instead receives a attribute value request for an attribute with multiple instances and the request does not specify a particular instance, the characterization module checks the accuracy of each cached attribute instance and requests an updated value for any instance with a value that is not sufficiently accurate. If multiple sufficiently accurate values are available, the characterization module produces a mediated value that is returned to the context client. The mediator to be used for the mediation can be selected in a variety of ways, such as being a default mediator of the characterization module, being requested by a context client, being specified by one or more of the context servers, or being chosen by the characterization module.","The manner in which data (e.g., sensor data and attribute values) flows to and from the characterization module can vary. In some embodiments, a context client may receive an attribute value only after an explicit request, while in other embodiments a context client may be forwarded attribute values without a request (e.g., if the client had previously expressed an interest in receiving values for the attribute and a value has just become available). Similarly, in some embodiments context servers may supply attribute values only when requested, while in other embodiments the context servers may supply attribute values without a request (e.g., if sensor input information is received from which a new value is produced). Request-based processing is a type of \u201cpull\u201d data flow model, and some forms of processing that occur without explicit requests are referred to as a \u201cpush\u201d or \u201cevent-driven\u201d data flow model.","The manner in which the characterization module communicates with the context clients and context servers can also vary. In some embodiments, context servers and context clients perform various interactions with the characterization module (e.g., supplying attribute values and requests) by calling functions provided by the characterization module (e.g., via Component Object Module interfaces). These functions are said to collectively comprise an \u201capplication programming interface\u201d (or \u201cAPI\u201d) to the characterization module. In alternate embodiments, such interactions can be performed using other mechanisms, such as passing messages or objects. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that an API can be created to support a pull data model, a push data model, or a hybrid system including both push and pull functionality.","As one example of an API, each executing context server may register with the characterization module by calling a RegisterContextServer function and supplying parameters to identify itself. If a particular context server is not executing, a context client that desires a value of an attribute or attribute instance supplied by the context server may cause the context server to be launched by using a LaunchContextServer function. After registration, a context server may indicate an ability to supply values for an attribute to the characterization module by using a CreateAttributeInstance function. A particular context server can provide values for a number of different attributes by calling the CreateAttributeInstance function multiple times. In order to consume values of an attribute, a context client may call a RegisterContextClient function in order to identify itself and one or more attributes whose values it seeks to consume. To assist in selecting one or more attributes, a context client may also call a EnumerateAttributesunction to obtain a list of the attributes available from the characterization module. In order to actually retrieve an attribute value, a context client may call a GetAttribute function and use parameters to identify the attribute and any attribute processing that should be applied, such as a specific mediator to be used if values are available for multiple instances of the attribute. For attributes that have multiple instances in the characterization module, a context client may also call a GetAllAttributeInstances function to obtain a value for each instance of the attribute. To force a particular contextserver to reevaluate all of its attribute instances, a context client may call a CompleteContextServerEvaluation function. Also, to retrieve values for attributes that model aspects of the configuration of the characterization module, a context client or other program may call a GetCharacterizationModuleAttribute function. A context client that consumes a particular attribute value may also create a condition in the characterization module (not to be confused with the current modeled condition of the user or the environment that is represented by various attribute values) for testing that attribute by calling a CreateCondition function. Once a context client has created a condition, it can evaluate the condition by calling an EvaluateCondition function using parameters to identify the condition, and may also proceed to create a condition monitor that monitors the condition and notifies the context server when the condition is satisfied by calling a CreateConditionMonitor function. To suspend operation of a created condition monitor, a context server may call a StopConditionMonitor function, and to resume its operation, may call a StartConditionMonitor function. The context server may remove a condition monitor that it created by calling a RemoveConditionMonitor function and, correspondingly, may remove a condition that it created by calling a RemoveCondition function. A context client may unregister with the characterization module by calling an UnregisterContextClient function. A context server may similarly remove attribute instances that it has registered by calling a RemoveAttributeInstance function. Before it does, however, it may first call a CheckAttributeInstanceDependencies function to determine whether any context clients currently depend upon that attribute instance. A context server may unregister with the characterization module by calling an UnregisterContextServer function. A set of API functions are discussed in greater detail in both U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/541,328, filed Apr. 2, 2000 and entitled \u201cINTERFACE FOR EXCHANGING CONTEXT DATA,\u201d and provisional U.S. Patent Application No. 60\/194,123, filed Apr. 2, 2000 and entitled \u201cSUPPLYING AND CONSUMING USER CONTEXT DATA,\u201d which are both hereby incorporated by reference.","In some embodiments, it may also be useful to store attribute value information in a more permanent fashion than a temporary cache. For example, it may be useful for the characterization module to keep a log of all attribute values received and sent, or of all interactions with context clients and context servers. Alternately, it may be useful to record the current values of some or all of the attributes and attribute instances at the same time, such as to capture a complete model of the current context. Storing attribute value information is discussed in greater detail in both U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/464,659, filed Dec. 15, 1999 and entitled \u201cSTORING AND RECALLING INFORMATION TO AUGMENT HUMAN MEMORIES,\u201d and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/541,326, filed Apr. 2, 2000 and entitled \u201cLOGGING AND ANALYZING COMPUTER USER'S DATA,\u201d which are both hereby incorporated by reference. Other uses of attribute value information are described in provisional U.S. Patent Application No. 60\/194,000, filed Apr. 2, 2000 and entitled \u201cSOLICITING PRODUCT INFORMATION BASED ON THE USER'S CONTEXT,\u201d in provisional U.S. Patent Application No. 60\/194,002, filed Apr. 2, 2000 and entitled \u201cAUTOMATED SELECTION OF UNSOLICITED INFORMATION BASED ON A USER'S CONTEXT,\u201d and in provisional U.S. Patent Application No. 60\/194,758, filed Apr. 2, 2000 and entitled \u201cCREATING PORTALS BASED ON THE USER'S CONTEXT,\u201d each of which are hereby incorporated by reference.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["120","110"]},"The wearable computer  has a variety of user-worn user input devices including a microphone , a hand-held flat panel display  with character recognition capabilities, and various other user input devices . Similarly, the computer has a variety of user-worn output devices that include the hand-held flat panel display, an earpiece speaker , an eyeglass-mounted display , and a tactile display . In addition to the various user-worn user input devices, the computer can also receive information from various user sensor input devices  and from environment sensor input devices , including video camera . The characterization module can receive and process the various input information received by the computer, either directly or from context servers that process the input information and generate attribute values, and can supply the received information to context clients or directly to the user by presenting the information on the various output devices accessible to the computer.","In the current environment, computer  is accessible to a computer  (e.g., by being in line-of-sight wireless proximity or by being reachable via a long-distance communication device such as a cellular phone) which also has a variety of input and output devices. In the illustrated embodiment the computer  is non-portable, although the body-mounted computer of the user can similarly communicate with a variety of other types of computers, including body-mounted computers of other users. The devices from which the non-portable computer can directly receive information include various user input devices  and various user sensor input devices . The non-portable computer can output information directly to a display , a speaker , an olfactory device , and a printer . In the illustrated embodiment, the body-mounted computer can communicate with the non-portable computer via a wireless transmission medium. In this manner, the characterization module can receive information from the user input devices  and the user sensor devices  after the information has been transmitted to the non-portable computer and then to the body-mounted computer. Alternately, the body-mounted computer may be able to directly communicate with the user input devices  and the user sensor devices , as well as with other various remote environment sensor input devices , without the intervention of the non-portable computer . Similarly, the body-mounted computer may be able to supply output information to the display , the speaker , the olfactory device , and the printer , either directly or via the non-portable computer, and directly to the telephone . As the user moves out of range of the remote input and output devices, attribute values of the characterization module can be updated to reflect that the remote devices are not currently available.","Information that is received from the various input devices allows the characterization module or an application such as a context server (not shown) executing on the computer  to monitor the user and the environment, and to maintain a model (not shown) of the current context. In some embodiments, the model may be represented in a single location (e.g., the current cached values of all of the context attributes and attribute instances), while in other embodiments the model may be distributed. Such a model can be used by various applications, such as context clients, for a variety of purposes. A model of the current context can include a variety of context attributes that represent information about the user, the computer, and the user's environment at varying levels of abstraction. For example, information about the user at a low level of abstraction can include raw physiological data (e.g., heart rate and EKG) and geographic information (e.g., location and speed), while higher levels of abstraction may attempt to characterize or predict the user's physical activity (e.g., jogging or talking on a phone), emotional state (e.g., angry or puzzled), desired output behavior for different types of information (e.g., to present private family information so that it is perceivable only to myself and my family members), and cognitive load (i.e., the amount of attention required for the user's current activities). Background information which changes rarely or not at all can also be included, such as the user's age, gender and visual acuity. The model can similarly hold environment information at a low level of abstraction, such as air temperature or raw data from a motion sensor, or at higher levels of abstraction, such as the number and identities of nearby people, objects, user mood, and locations. The model of the current context can include information added explicitly from other sources (e.g., application programs), as well as user-specified or system-learned defaults and preference information.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that computer systems  and , as well as their various input and output devices, are merely illustrative and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. The computer systems may contain additional components or may lack some illustrated components. For example, the characterization module could be implemented on the non-portable computer, with the body-mounted computer replaced by a thin computer client such as a transmitter\/receiver for relaying information between the body-mounted input and output devices and the non-portable computer. Alternately, the user may not wear any devices or computers.","In addition, the body-mounted computer may be connected to one or more networks of other devices through wired or wireless communication means (e.g., wireless RF, a cellular phone or modem, infrared, physical cable, a docking station, etc.), either with or without support from other computers such as the computer . For example, the body-mounted computer of a user can make use of output devices in a smart room, such as a television and stereo when the user is at home, if the body-mounted computer is able to transmit information to those devices via a wireless medium or if a cabled or docking mechanism is available. Alternately, kiosks or other information devices can be installed at various locations (e.g., in airports or at tourist spots) to transmit relevant information to body-mounted computers within the range of the information device. Those skilled in the art will also appreciate that specialized versions of the body-mounted computer, characterization module, context clients and\/or context servers can be created for a variety of purposes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","230","210","250","222","223","224","225","226","228","231","232","233","234","237","235","236","237","231","237"]},"In addition, in some embodiments a pre-defined set of attributes are available for use by context servers and context clients. This allows a common meaning to be shared between context clients and context servers as to those attributes and their values, and can also allow a context client to request a pre-defined attribute without having to determine whether the attribute has been created by a context server supplying values for the attribute. In one embodiment a plain-language, hierarchical, taxonometric attribute nomenclature is used to name attributes, such as the example attribute nomenclature illustrated in . The names within the nomenclature are preferably specific so that there is no ambiguity as to what they represent, and the ability to extend the nomenclature by adding new attribute names that conform to the hierarchical taxonomy of the nomenclature is preferably supported. The nomenclature preferably has attribute names relating to a variety of aspects of the user.","For example, as is illustrated in , the nomenclature preferably has a variety of types of attribute names, including: attribute names relating to the user's location, such as user.location.latitude, user.location.building, and user.location.street; attribute names relating to the user's movement, such as user.speed and user.direction; attribute names for various user moods, such as user.mood.happiness, user.mood.anger, and user.mood.confusion; attribute names for user activities, such as user.activity.driving, user.activity.eating, and user.activity.sleeping; attribute names for user physiology values, such as user.physiology.body_temperature and user.physiology.blood_pressure; attribute names for similar attributes of people other than the user, such as person.John_Smith.mood.happiness; attribute names for aspects of the computer system or \u201cplatform,\u201d such as for aspects of the platform's user interface (\u201cUI\u201d) capabilities (e.g., platform.UI.oral_input device_availability and platform.UI.visual_output device_availability) and central processing unit (\u201cCPU\u201d) (e.g., platform.cpu.load and platform.cpu.speed); attribute names for aspects of the local environment, such as environment.local.temperature and environment.local.ambient-noi se_level; attribute names for remote environments, such as environment.place.chicago.time and environment.place.san_diego.temperature; attribute names relating to a future context, such as those that predict or estimate a situation (e.g., environment.local.next_week.temperature); attribute names relating to specific applications, such as an email application (e.g., application.mail.available, application.mail.new_messages_waiting, and application.mail.messages_waiting_tobe_sent); etc. In this manner, the attribute nomenclature used by the facility provides effective names for attributes relating to the user, the computer system, and the environment. Additional attributes are illustrated in , and  illustrates an alternate hierarchical taxonomy related to context, such that various attributes could be added for each of the illustrated categories. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that for both  and , other categories and attributes could be added and existing categories and attributes could be removed or could have alternate names.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","310","320","330","340","350","310","320","330","330","331","320","321","322","310","311","320","321","311","321"]},"Software modules , , and  are said to be context clients because they consume attribute values.

It can also be seen that a context client can consume values for more than one attribute. For example, context client  consumes values for both user.in_region attribute  and user.elevation attribute .

The routine then continues to step  where it performs the Notification Processing subroutine to notify any CCs or CSes about the received message or user indication if appropriate. As is explained in greater detail below, CCs and CSes can submit notification requests so that they will be notified by the CM upon a particular type of occurrence. Such notification requests could include occurrences such as when an attribute value changes, when a particular CC or CS registers or unregisters, when values for an attribute become available or unavailable (e.g., due to registration or unregistration), when a CC registers or unregisters to receive values for an attribute, when the availability of particular input\/output devices changes or other computer system features change, when a package of related themed attributes becomes available or unavailable, for changes in CM internal status (e.g., a change in the default mediator), etc. In addition, the notification requests can be created based not only on explicit requests, but also after the occurrence of a particular type of event (e.g., if a CC requests a value for an attribute for which no CSes are currently supplying values, a notification request could be automatically created to alert the CC if a CS later registers to supply values for the attribute). Moreover, additional information about the notification requests can be supplied (e.g., a number of times that the submitter wants to receive notifications for the request, or an expiration date after which the notification will be removed or become inactive).","After step , the routine continues to step  to determine if a registration or unregistration message was received.

If so, the routine continues to step  to execute the Process Attribute Value Or Value Request Message subroutine. This subroutine will satisfy requests for attribute values if possible (e.g., by supplying a cached value or requesting one or more CSes to supply the value) and will return the requested value or an error message.

If a message related to another CM has not been received, the routine continues instead to step  to determine if a request has been received to establish or modify a notification request. If so, the routine continues to step  to process the notification-related request.

If so, the routine continues to step  to perform the other operation, and if not the routine continues to step  to send an error message to the requester. For example, other types of operations may be a request to receive information about all available attributes, about all attributes available from a particular CS, about which CCs are receiving values for a particular attribute, about properties and property values associated with attributes and attribute instances, to launch or shutdown a CC or CS, to receive information about an attribute taxonomy, to force a CS to reevaluate the values for all its registered attributes, to change internal CM information (e.g., the default mediator), to provide information about available packages of related themed attributes, to provide information about available computer resources such as input\/output devices, etc. After steps , , , , , , or , the routine returns to step .

An example of an uncertainty specification is as follows. For each attribute instance there is a finite likelihood that the real quantity being measured is not the same as the value being expressed. For example, the speedometer of a car may show mph when the \u201ctrue\u201d instantaneous speed is 32.56 mph. There are numerous factors that may give rise to these discrepancies, including the following: precision of measuring apparatus, conversion of continuous quantities to discrete values in the measurement process, random fluctuations, temporal variation, systematic errors, and measurement latency. Since different measured quantities have different sources of uncertainty, it is impossible to foresee and account for each individually. It is therefore helpful to express the overall effects with a general characterization of uncertainty. One type of uncertainty values represent the cumulative effects of all possible discrepancy sources. These uncertainty values may conform to a single, universal definition so that attribute mediators and clients can make effective use of them. Thus, the following definition of uncertainty, which is based upon the definition of standard deviation for random fluctuations about a mean value, could be used for numeric values:","For an attribute instance value, \u03bc, the associated uncertainty, \u03c3, shall represent the likelihood that the following condition has a 68% probability of being true:\n\n\u03bc\u2212\u03c3\u2266\u03bc\u2266\u03bc+\u03c3\n","Where \u03bcrepresents the \u201ctrue\u201d value that the attribute represents.","As with uncertainty, a value timestamp can be indicated in a variety of ways. An example of a timestamp specification is as follows. Attribute values may be thought of as representations of a particular quantity at a point in time. Often this time is not proximate to that of use, so it can be useful to provide the proper timestamp along with the value. One version of a timestamp is defined as follows:","The timestamp represents the moment at which the associated value would have been valid had it been measured directly at that moment. This definition results in some attributes having timestamps that do not correspond to the time at which their values were calculated. For instance, an attribute that represents the acceleration of the user can be calculated by looking at the change in velocity over a period of time. The necessary computations may further delay the availability of the acceleration value. This timestamp is thus specified to represent the time at which the acceleration was \u201cmost\u201d valid, which in this case could be the middle of the time period during which the velocity was measured.","Other types of additional information related to an attribute value can include history information (e.g., frequency of past use and past popularity information), an indication of the supplier of the attribute, indications of equivalent attributes (e.g., for mediation purposes or if a value for this attribute is not available at a later time), indications of clients that have registered for this attribute or consumed values for the attribute, descriptions of clients in order to track statistics, information to be used to evaluate characterization module efficiency and\/or to facilitate process optimization, and indication of a verification of accuracy (e.g., from a third-party, or of the value generation technique that was used), a consumer rating or reputation based on input from other clients (e.g., efficiency or reliability), a cost to use the value (e.g., an actual price, or an amount of time needed to retrieve or process the value), future availability of the attribute value (e.g., how intermittent additional values may be), a version of the attribute, etc.","The subroutine illustrated in  begins in step  where additional information about an attribute value is received.

After step , or if it was instead determined that a timestamp is not received, the subroutine continues to step  to determine if uncertainty or other accuracy information is received, and if so continues to step  to associate that information with the received value. After step , or if it was instead determined that uncertainty or other accuracy information is not received, the subroutine continues to step  to determine if accuracy decay information (e.g., the rate at which the accuracy of the value changes over time) is received, and if so continues to step  to associate that information with the received value.

The unique ID in this example embodiment is used to allow the context server to determine if a circular reference exists when determining the requested attribute value. For example, consider the situation in which CS  is registered to supply values for attribute , and CS  is registered to supply values for attribute . In addition, imagine that the calculation of the value for attribute  depends on the value for attribute . Thus, when CS  receives a pull request to supply the value for attribute , it requests the value for attribute  from the CM, which in turn request the value from CS . After receiving the value for attribute  from CS  via the CM, CS  can then calculate the value for attribute  and satisfy the initial request by supplying the value to the CM. If, however, CS  also depends on the value for attribute  in order to calculate the value for attribute , a circular reference may exist. In that situation, after CS  requests the value of the attribute  in order to calculate the value for attribute , CS  may in turn request the value of attribute  from CS  (via the CM), thus creating a loop such that neither attribute value can be calculated. In order to detect such circular references, the example routine uses a unique ID passed along with attribute value requests. Alternate equivalent ways of identifying circular references could instead be used, or no such processing could be performed.","In the illustrated embodiment, if it is determined that a pull attribute value request has been received by the CS, the routine continues to step  to determine if the received request ID matches a temporarily stored ID for the same attribute value. If so, a circular reference exists, and the routine continues to step  to return an error message. If the ID does not match, the routine continues to step  to determine the input information needed (if any) to calculate the requested value. The routine then continues to step  to determine if the value of another attribute is needed. If so, the routine in step  temporarily stores an indication of the attribute whose value is being calculated and of the ID. The routine then continues to step  to request the attribute value needed, including the received ID. In step , the routine waits for the requested value or error message. After receiving the value or error message, the routine continues to step  to determine if more attribute values are needed, and if so to return to step . After all of the needed attribute values have been received, the routine continues to step  to remove the temporarily stored attribute value and ID, and then continues to step  to determine if any errors were received for needed attribute values such that sufficient information to calculate the value requested of the CS is not available. If so, the routine continues to step  to signal an error.","If there are no such errors, or if it was instead determined in step  that no attribute values were needed, the routine continues to step  to determine if any sensor values or other input information is needed to calculate the value requested of the CS. If so, the routine continues in steps  through  to request and receive the sensor or other input information that is needed. The routine then continues to step  to determine if any errors were received for needed sensor values or other input information such that sufficient information to calculate the value request of the CS is not available. If so, the routine continues to step . If no such errors occurred, or if it was instead determined in step  that no sensor or other input information was needed, the routine continues to step  to calculate the requested attribute value based on the received information. The routine then continues to step  to optionally calculate additional information about the value that characterizes it (e.g., a timestamp or uncertainty information), and then continues to step  to send the value and any additional information to the CM to satisfy the request.","If it was instead determined in step  that an attribute value request was not received, the routine continues to step  to determine if sensor or other input information has been pushed to the CS. If not, the routine continues to step  to process the other information received, and if so continues to step  to determine if the CS has sufficient information to calculate one or more attribute values based on the received input information and other stored information. If so, the routine continues to step  to calculate those values and to push them to the CM, and if not the routine continues to step  to store the sensor information for later use. In alternate embodiments, the CS could request other information that is needed to calculate an attribute value when sensor or other input information is received, rather than waiting until all necessary information has been received.","After steps , , , , , , , , ,  or , the routine continues to step  to determine whether to continue.
