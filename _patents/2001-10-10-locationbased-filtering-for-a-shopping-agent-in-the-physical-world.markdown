title: Location-based filtering for a shopping agent in the physical world
abstract: An agent based system utilizes a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA)-based, Global Positioning System (GPS)-enabled information gathering agent that relies on knowledge of a shopper's physical location to support a shopping task while shopping at a mall. Shoppers indicate their shopping goals to the system. Then, as shoppers stroll through a mall, the system informs them of the availability of items of interest to them available in the immediately surrounding stores, as well as any cheaper local alternatives.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 09\/259,902, filed Feb. 26, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,317,718, issued Nov. 13, 2001, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.","The present invention relates generally to information gathering agents and more specifically to a shopping agent that incorporates the physical location of the user into the information gathering process.","Agent based technology has become increasingly important for use with applications designed to interact with a user for performing various computer based tasks in foreground and background modes. Agent software comprises computer programs that are set on behalf of users to perform routine, tedious and time-consuming tasks. To be useful to an individual user, an agent must be personalized to the individual user's goals, habits and preferences. Thus, there exists a substantial requirement for the agent to efficiently and effectively acquire user-specific knowledge from the user and utilize it to perform tasks on behalf of the user.","The concept of agency, or the user of agents, is well established. An agent is a person authorized by another person, typically referred to as a principal, to act on behalf of the principal. In this manner the principal empowers the agent to perform any of the tasks that the principal is unwilling or unable to perform. For example, an insurance agent may handle all of the insurance requirements for a principal, or a talent agent may act on behalf of a performer to arrange concert dates.","With the advent of the computer, a new domain for employing agents has arrived. Significant advances in the realm of expert systems enable computer programs to act on behalf of computer users to perform routine, tedious and other time-consuming tasks. These computer programs are referred to as \u201csoftware agents.\u201d","Moreover, there has been a recent proliferation of computer and communication networks. These networks permit a user to access vast amounts of information and services without, essentially, any geographical boundaries. Thus, a software agent has a rich environment to perform a large number of tasks on behalf of a user. For example, it is now possible for an agent to make an airline reservation, purchase the ticket, and have the ticket delivered directly to a user. Similarly, an agent could scan the Internet and obtain information ranging from the latest sports or news to a particular graduate thesis in applied physics. Current solutions fail to apply agent technology to existing calendar technology to provide targeted acquisition of background information for a user's upcoming events.","A central issue for developing agents of all types is identifying easily computed features that are either very suggestive of the user's preferences and goals or can somehow be used to constrain the task of the agent. Keyword-based approaches are commonly used. For example, users may be asked to specify keywords to explicitly identify their goals, or keywords and key phrases may be extracted from user data. Collaborative filtering, another technique, involves extending user specified preferences by incorporating those of other users whose preferences overlap. The demographic generalization method involves classifying a user using minimal user input into demographic categories with well-understood preferences. These techniques are all intended to infer as much as possible about a user's goals and preferences based on observable features, while minimizing the need for user input. These web agents have not used physical location as a predictive feature because the locations from which users access the web have largely remained constant\u2014typically their home or office. Moreover, location has not been a particularly easy feature to compute and unambiguously communicate to an agent.","Location has, of course, played a significant role in other areas research. Navigation, most obviously, has relied on the ability to detect and monitor location. Recent work on supporting user mobility in which personalized computing environments follow users to remote locations also rely on knowledge of a user's location. In these cases, however, location is the problem. That is, a vehicle must be guided from one point to another, or a computing environment must be replicated at a remote location. The ParcTab based \u201clocation browser\u201d, which displays file directories and runs programs associated with particular rooms in an office, is somewhat similar in its use of location-awareness as a means of capturing the user's context.","However, the explosive growth in the use of laptops and Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) signals an important change. As we begin to find ourselves bringing our PDAs and laptops everywhere we go, the particular locations we use them will increasingly reflect an important part of our current context. Furthermore, a user's precise location can now be passively and unambiguously obtained by software through the use of Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers. Such receivers are becoming increasingly affordable and compact. Some are now available as PCMCIA cards. In a system in accordance with a preferred embodiment, the user's location is used in a very different way. Rather than defining the problem, the user's location is a crucial piece of data that can be used to inform and constrain the information gathering task. There is now a business and consumer need to enhance the effectiveness of shoppers through the utilization of location information.","According to a broad aspect of a preferred embodiment of the invention, an agent based system an information gathering agent that exploits the physical location of the user. An agent running on a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) equipped with a Global Positions System (GPS) receiver, supports location targeted shopping in an outdoor mall. The agent assists shoppers by providing information about merchandise in which the shopper has expressed an interest. As a shopper strolls through a mall, the system alerts the shopper to merchandise of previously specified categories in the surrounding stores, as well as any cheaper alternatives in the local area. A system in accordance with a preferred embodiment utilizes the user's precise physical location to filter the information it presents.","A preferred embodiment of a system in accordance with the present invention is preferably practiced in the context of a personal computer such as an IBM compatible personal computer, Apple Macintosh computer or UNIX based workstation. A representative hardware environment is depicted in , which illustrates a typical hardware configuration of a workstation in accordance with a preferred embodiment having a central processing unit , such as a microprocessor, and a number of other units interconnected via a system bus . The workstation shown in  includes a Random Access Memory (RAM) , Read Only Memory (ROM) , an I\/O adapter  for connecting peripheral devices such as disk storage units  to the bus , a user interface adapter  for connecting a keyboard , a mouse , a speaker , a microphone , and\/or other user interface devices such as a touch screen (not shown) to the bus , communication adapter  for connecting the workstation to a communication network (e.g., a data processing network) and a display adapter  for connecting the bus  to a display device . The workstation typically has resident thereon an operating system such as the Microsoft Windows NT or Windows\/95 Operating System (OS), the IBM OS\/2 operating system, the MAC OS, or UNIX operating system. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention may also be implemented on platforms and operating systems other than those mentioned. A preferred embodiment is written using JAVA, C, and the C++ language and utilizes object oriented programming methodology. Object oriented programming (OOP) has become increasingly used to develop complex applications. As OOP moves toward the mainstream of software design and development, various software solutions require adaptation to make use of the benefits of OOP. A need exists for these principles of OOP to be applied to a messaging interface of an electronic messaging system such that a set of OOP classes and objects for the messaging interface can be provided.","OOP is a process of developing computer software using objects, including the steps of analyzing the problem, designing the system, and constructing the program. An object is a software package that contains both data and a collection of related structures and procedures. Since it contains both data and a collection of structures and procedures, it can be visualized as a self-sufficient component that does not require other additional structures, procedures or data to perform its specific task. OOP, therefore, views a computer program as a collection of largely autonomous components, called objects, each of which is responsible for a specific task. This concept of packaging data, structures, and procedures together in one component or module is called encapsulation.","In general, OOP components are reusable software modules which present an interface that conforms to an object model and which are accessed at run-time through a component integration architecture. A component integration architecture is a set of architecture mechanisms which allow software modules in different process spaces to utilize each others capabilities or functions. This is generally done by assuming a common component object model on which to build the architecture.","It is worthwhile to differentiate between an object and a class of objects at this point. An object is a single instance of the class of objects, which is often just called a class. A class of objects can be viewed as a blueprint, from which many objects can be formed.","OOP allows the programmer to create an object that is a part of another object. For example, the object representing a piston engine is said to have a composition-relationship with the object representing a piston. In reality, a piston engine comprises a piston, valves and many other components; the fact that a piston is an element of a piston engine can be logically and semantically represented in OOP by two objects.","OOP also allows creation of an object that \u201cdepends from\u201d another object. If there are two objects, one representing a piston engine and the other representing a piston engine wherein the piston is made of ceramic, then the relationship between the two objects is not that of composition. A ceramic piston engine does not make up a piston engine. Rather it is merely one kind of piston engine that has one more limitation than the piston engine; its piston is made of ceramic. In this case, the object representing the ceramic piston engine is called a derived object, and it inherits all of the aspects of the object representing the piston engine and adds further limitation or detail to it. The object representing the ceramic piston engine \u201cdepends from\u201d the object representing the piston engine. The relationship between these objects is called inheritance.","When the object or class representing the ceramic piston engine inherits all of the aspects of the objects representing the piston engine, it inherits the thermal characteristics of a standard piston defined in the piston engine class. However, the ceramic piston engine object overrides these ceramic specific thermal characteristics, which are typically different from those associated with a metal piston. It skips over the original and uses new functions related to ceramic pistons. Different kinds of piston engines have different characteristics, but may have the same underlying functions associated with it (e.g., how many pistons in the engine, ignition sequences, lubrication, etc.). To access each of these functions in any piston engine object, a programmer would call the same functions with the same names, but each type of piston engine may have different\/overriding implementations of functions behind the same name. This ability to hide different implementations of a function behind the same name is called polymorphism and it greatly simplifies communication among objects.","With the concepts of composition-relationship, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism, an object can represent just about anything in the real world. In fact, our logical perception of the reality is the only limit on determining the kinds of things that can become objects in object-oriented software. Some typical categories are as follows:\n\n","With this enormous capability of an object to represent just about any logically separable matters, OOP allows the software developer to design and implement a computer program that is a model of some aspects of reality, whether that reality is a physical entity, a process, a system, or a composition of matter. Since the object can represent anything, the software developer can create an object which can be used as a component in a larger software project in the future.","If 90% of a new OOP software program consists of proven, existing components made from preexisting reusable objects, then only the remaining 10% of the new software project has to be written and tested from scratch. Since 90% already came from an inventory of extensively tested reusable objects, the potential domain from which an error could originate is 10% of the program. As a result, OOP enables software developers to build objects out of other, previously built, objects.","This process closely resembles complex machinery being built out of assemblies and sub-assemblies. OOP technology, therefore, makes software engineering more like hardware engineering in that software is built from existing components, which are available to the developer as objects. All this adds up to an improved quality of the software as well as an increased speed of its development.","Programming languages are beginning to fully support the OOP principles, such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and composition-relationship. With the advent of the C++ language, many commercial software developers have embraced OOP. C++ is an OOP language that offers a fast, machine-executable code. Furthermore, C++ is suitable for both commercial-application and systems-programming projects. For now, C++ appears to be the most popular choice among many OOP programmers, but there is a host of other OOP languages, such as Smalltalk, common lisp object system (CLOS), and Eiffel. Additionally, OOP capabilities are being added to more traditional popular computer programming languages such as Pascal.","The benefits of object classes can be summarized, as follows:\n\n","Class libraries are very flexible. As programs grow more complex, more programmers are forced to reinvent basic solutions to basic problems over and over again. A relatively new extension of the class library concept is to have a framework of class libraries. This framework is more complex and consists of significant collections of collaborating classes that capture both the small scale patterns and major mechanisms that implement the common requirements and design in a specific application domain. They were first developed to free application programmers from the chores involved in displaying menus, windows, dialog boxes, and other standard user interface elements for personal computers.","Frameworks also represent a change in the way programmers think about the interaction between the code they write and code written by others. In the early days of procedural programming, the programmer called libraries provided by the operating system to perform certain tasks, but basically the program executed down the page from start to finish, and the programmer was solely responsible for the flow of control. This was appropriate for printing out paychecks, calculating a mathematical table, or solving other problems with a program that executed in just one way.","The development of graphical user interfaces began to turn this procedural programming arrangement inside out. These interfaces allow the user, rather than program logic, to drive the program and decide when certain actions should be performed. Today, most personal computer software accomplishes this by means of an event loop which monitors the mouse, keyboard, and other sources of external events and calls the appropriate parts of the programmer's code according to actions that the user performs. The programmer no longer determines the order in which events occur. Instead, a program is divided into separate pieces that are called at unpredictable times and in an unpredictable order. By relinquishing control in this way to users, the developer creates a program that is much easier to use. Nevertheless, individual pieces of the program written by the developer still call libraries provided by the operating system to accomplish certain tasks, and the programmer must still determine the flow of control within each piece after being called by the event loop. Application code still \u201csits on top of\u201d the system.","Even event loop programs require programmers to write a lot of code that should not need to be written separately for every application. The concept of an application framework carries the event loop concept further. Instead of dealing with all the nuts and bolts of constructing basic menus, windows, and dialog boxes and then making these things all work together, programmers using application frameworks start with working application code and basic user interface elements in place. Subsequently, they build from there by replacing some of the generic capabilities of the framework with the specific capabilities of the intended application.","Application frameworks reduce the total amount of code that a programmer has to write from scratch. However, because the framework is really a generic application that displays windows, supports copy and paste, and so on, the programmer can also relinquish control to a greater degree than event loop programs permit. The framework code takes care of almost all event handling and flow of control, and the programmer's code is called only when the framework needs it (e.g., to create or manipulate a proprietary data structure).","A programmer writing a framework program not only relinquishes control to the user (as is also true for event loop programs), but also relinquishes the detailed flow of control within the program to the framework. This approach allows the creation of more complex systems that work together in interesting ways, as opposed to isolated programs, having custom code, being created over and over again for similar problems.","Thus, as is explained above, a framework basically is a collection of cooperating classes that make up a reusable design solution for a given problem domain. It typically includes objects that provide default behavior (e.g., for menus and windows), and programmers use it by inheriting some of that default behavior and overriding other behavior so that the framework calls application code at the appropriate times.","There are three main differences between frameworks and class libraries:\n\n","Thus, through the development of frameworks for solutions to various problems and programming tasks, significant reductions in the design and development effort for software can be achieved. A preferred embodiment of the invention utilizes HyperText Markup Language (HTML) to implement documents on the Internet together with a general-purpose secure communication protocol for a transport medium between the client and the Newco. HTTP or other protocols could be readily substituted for HTML without undue experimentation. Information on these products is available in T. Berners-Lee, D. Connoly, \u201cRFC 1866: Hypertext Markup Language\u20142.0\u201d (November 1995); and R. Fielding, H, Frystyk, T. Berners-Lee, J. Gettys and J. C. Mogul, \u201cHypertext Transfer Protocol\u2014HTTP\/1.1: HTTP Working Group Internet Draft\u201d (May 2, 1996). HTML is a simple data format used to create hypertext documents that are portable from one platform to another. HTML documents are SGML documents with generic semantics that are appropriate for representing information from a wide range of domains. HTML has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information initiative since 1990. HTML is an application of ISO Standard 8879:1986 Information Processing Text and Office Systems; Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML).","To date, Web development tools have been limited in their ability to create dynamic Web applications which span from client to server and interoperate with existing computing resources. Until recently, HTML has been the dominant technology used in development of Web-based solutions. However, HTML has proven to be inadequate in the following areas:\n\n","Sun Microsystem's Java language solves many of the client-side problems by:\n\n","With Java, developers can create robust User Interface (UI) components. Custom \u201cwidgets\u201d (e.g. real-time stock tickers, animated icons, etc.) can be created, and client-side performance is improved. Unlike HTML, Java supports the notion of client-side validation, offloading appropriate processing onto the client for improved performance. Dynamic, real-time Web pages can be created. Using the above-mentioned custom UI components, dynamic Web pages can also be created.","Sun's Java language has emerged as an industry-recognized language for \u201cprogramming the Internet.\u201d Sun defines Java as: \u201ca simple, object-oriented, distributed, interpreted, robust, secure, architecture-neutral, portable, high-performance, multithreaded, dynamic, buzzword-compliant, general-purpose programming language. Java supports programming for the Internet in the form of platform-independent Java applets.\u201d Java applets are small, specialized applications that comply with Sun's Java Application Programming Interface (API) allowing developers to add \u201cinteractive content\u201d to Web documents (e.g. simple animations, page adornments, basic games, etc.). Applets execute within a Java-compatible browser (e.g. Netscape Navigator) by copying code from the server to client. From a language standpoint, Java's core feature set is based on C++. Sun's Java literature states that Java is basically \u201cC++, with extensions from Objective C for more dynamic method resolution\u201d.","Another technology that provides similar function to JAVA is provided by Microsoft and ActiveX Technologies, to give developers and Web designers wherewithal to build dynamic content for the Internet and personal computers. ActiveX includes tools for developing animation, 3-D virtual reality, video and other multimedia content. The tools use Internet standards, work on multiple platforms, and are being supported by over 100 companies. The group's building blocks are called ActiveX Controls, small, fast components that enable developers to embed parts of software in hypertext markup language (HTML) pages. ActiveX Controls work with a variety of programming languages including Microsoft Visual C++, Borland Delphi, Microsoft Visual Basic programming system and, in the future, Microsoft's development tool for Java, code named \u201cJakarta.\u201d ActiveX Technologies also includes ActiveX Server Framework, allowing developers to create server applications. One of ordinary skill in the art readily recognizes that ActiveX could be substituted for JAVA without undue experimentation to practice the invention.","In accordance with a preferred embodiment, BackgroundFinder (BF) is implemented as an agent responsible for preparing an individual for an upcoming meeting by helping him\/her retrieve relevant information about the meeting from various sources. BF receives input text in character form indicative of the target meeting. The input text is generated in accordance with a preferred embodiment by a calendar program that includes the time of the meeting. As the time of the meeting approaches, the calendar program is queried to obtain the text of the target event and that information is utilized as input to the agent. Then, the agent parses the input meeting text to extract its various components such as title, body, participants, location, time etc. The system also performs pattern matching to identify particular meeting fields in a meeting text. This information is utilized to query various sources of information on the web and obtain relevant stories about the current meeting to send back to the calendaring system. For example, if an individual has a meeting with Netscape and Microsoft to talk about their disputes, and would obtain this initial information from the calendaring system. It will then parse out the text to realize that the companies in the meeting are \u201cNetscape\u201d and \u201cMicrosoft\u201d and the topic is \u201cdisputes.\u201d Then, the system queries the web for relevant information concerning the topic. Thus, in accordance with an objective of the invention, the system updates the calendaring system and eventually the user with the best information it can gather to prepare the user for the target meeting. In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the information is stored in a file that is obtained via selection from a link imbedded in the calendar system.","A computer program in accordance with a preferred embodiment is organized in five distinct modules: BF.Main, BF.Parse, Background Finder.Error, BF.PatternMatching and BF.Search. There is also a frmMain which provides a user interface used only for debugging purposes. The executable programs in accordance with a preferred embodiment never execute with the user interface and should only return to the calendaring system through Microsoft's Winsock control. A preferred embodiment of the system executes in two different modes which can be specified under the command line sent to it by the calendaring system. When the system runs in simple mode, it executes a keyword query to submit to external search engines. When executed in complex mode, the system performs pattern matching before it forms a query to be sent to a search engine.","The system in accordance with a preferred embodiment utilizes three user defined structures:\n\n","The user-defined structure, tMeetingRecord, is used to store all the pertinent information concerning a single meeting. This info includes userID, an original description of the meeting, the extracted list of keywords from the title and body of meeting etc. It is important to note that only one meeting record is created per instance of the system in accordance with a preferred embodiment. This is because each time the system is spawned to service an upcoming meeting, it is assigned a task to retrieve information for only one meeting. Therefore, the meeting record created corresponds to the current meeting examined. ParseMeetingText populates this meeting record and it is then passed around to provide information about the meeting to other functions.","If GoPatternMatch can bind any values to a particular meeting field, the corresponding entries in the meeting record is also updated. The structure of tMeetingRecord with each field described in parentheses is provided below in accordance with a preferred embodiment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0098"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["A.1.1.1.1.1","Public Type tMeetingRecord"]},{"entry":["\u2003sUserID As String","\u2009(user id given by Munin)"]},{"entry":["\u2003sTitleOrig As String","\u2009(original non stop listed title we need to keep around to"]},{"entry":"send back to Munin)"},{"entry":["\u2003sTitleKW As String","\u2009(stoplisted title with only keywords)"]},{"entry":["\u2003sBodyKW As String","\u2009(stoplisted body with only keywords)"]},{"entry":["\u2003sCompany( ) As String","\u2009(companys identified in title or body through pattern"]},{"entry":"matching)"},{"entry":["\u2003sTopic( ) As String","\u2009(topics identified in title or body through pattern"]},{"entry":"matching)"},{"entry":["\u2003sPeople( ) As String","\u2009(people identified in title or body through pattern"]},{"entry":"matching)"},{"entry":["\u2003sWhen( ) As String","\u2009(time identified in title or body through pattern matching)"]},{"entry":["\u2003sWhere( ) As String","\u2009(location identified in title or body through pattern"]},{"entry":"matching)"},{"entry":["\u2003sLocation As String","\u2009(location as passed in by Munin)"]},{"entry":["\u2003sTime As String","\u2009(time as passed in by Munin)"]},{"entry":["\u2003sParticipants( ) As String","\u2002(all participants engaged as passed in by Munin)"]},{"entry":["\u2003sMeetingText As String","\u2002\u2009(the original meeting text w\/o userid)"]},{"entry":"End Type"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"There are two other structures which are created to hold each individual pattern utilized in pattern matching.

Rather than simply removing random bits of information, however, most of these approaches tried to be intelligent about what information was ultimately presented to the user. This was accomplished by evaluating each document based on the user's interests and discarding the less relevant ones.

This means that all communications between the system and each user, as well as communication between the different minion agents are handled (coordinated) by the Intelligent Agent Coordinator. Examples of these minion agents are:\n\n","The Intelligent Agent Coordinator  of  is also the user's \u201cinterface\u201d to the system, in that whenever the user interacts with the system, regardless of the GUI or other end-user interface, they are ultimately dealing with (asking questions of or sending commands to) the Intelligent Agent Coordinator. The Intelligent Agent Coordinator has four primary responsibilities: 1) monitoring user activities, 2) handling information requests, 3) maintaining each user's profile, and 4) routing information to and from users and to and from the other respective agents.","Monitoring User Activities","Anytime a user triggers a sensor the Intelligent Agent Coordinator receives an \u201cenvironmental cue.\u201d These cues not only enable the Intelligent Agent Coordinator to gain an understanding where users' are for information delivery purposes, but also to learn the standard patterns (arrival time, departure time, etc.) of each persons' life. These patterns are constantly being updated and refined in an attempt to increase the system's intelligence when delivering information. For instance, today it is not uncommon for a person to have several email accounts (work-based, home-based, mobile-based, etc.) as well as several different computers involved in the retrieval process for all of these accounts. Thus, for the Intelligent Agent Coordinator to be successful in delivering information to the correct location it must take into account all of these accounts and the times that the user is likely to be accessing them in order to maximize the probability that the user will see the information. This will be discussed further in another section.","Handling Information Requests","The Intelligent Agent Coordinator handles information requests from other agents in order to personalize information intended for each user and to more accurately reflect each user's interests in the information they are given. These requests will commonly be related to the user's profile. For instance, if an agent was preparing a traffic report for a user it may request the traffic region (search string) of that user from the Intelligent Agent Coordinator. All access to the user's profile data is accessed in this method.","Maintaining User Profiles","User profiles contain extensive information about the users. This information is a blend of user-specified data and information that the Intelligent Agent Coordinator has learned and extrapolated from each user's information and activities. In order to protect the data contained in the profiles, the Intelligent Agent Coordinator must handle all user information requests. The Intelligent Agent Coordinator is constantly modifying and updating these profiles by watching the user's activities and attempting to learn the patterns of their lives in order to assist in the more routine, mundane tasks. The Intelligent Agent Coordinator also employs other agents to glean meaning from each user's daily activities. These agents mine this data trying to discover indications of current interests, long-term interests, as well as time delivery preferences for each type of information. Another important aspect of the Intelligent Agent Coordinator's observations is that it also tries to determine where each user is physically located throughout the day for routing purposes.","Information Routing","Most people are mobile throughout their day. The Intelligent Agent Coordinator tries to be sensitive to this fact by attempting to determine, both by observation (unsupervised learning) and from cues from the environment, where users are or are likely to be located. This is certainly important for determining where to send the user's information, but also for determining in which format to send the information. For instance, if a user were at her desk and using the web client, the Intelligent Agent Coordinator would be receiving indications of activity from her PC and would know to send any necessary information there. In addition, because desktop PCs are generally quite powerful, a full-featured, graphically intense version could be sent. However, consider an alternative situation: the Intelligent Agent Coordinator has received an indication (via the keycard reader next to the exit) that you have just left the building. Minutes later the Intelligent Agent Coordinator also receives notification that you have received an urgent message. The Intelligent Agent Coordinator, knowing that you have left the building and having not received any other indications, assumes that you are reachable via your handheld device (for which it also knows the capabilities) and sends the text of the urgent message there, rather than a more graphically-oriented version.","Inherent Innovations","The Active Knowledge Management system represents some of the most advanced thinking in the world of knowledge management and human computer interaction.

The embodiment is configured for a mall containing a plurality of stores. The system utilizes a GPS receiver to determine the user's location. One advantage of the system is that it enables the retrieval of data for nearby stores without relying on the presence of any special equipment at the mall itself. Although the accuracy of smaller, inexpensive receivers is limited to approximately 75-100 feet, this has thus far proven to be all that is necessary to identify accurately the immediately surrounding stores. The system uses generated data rather than actual store ads and prices. Well structured online catalogs are used. Other embodiments utilize agents that \u201clearn to shop\u201d at a given store using a relatively small amount of knowledge. Moreover, as retailers begin to use standard packages to create online catalogs, we can expect the number of differing formats to decrease, resulting in a tractable number of competing formats. As electronic commerce progresses, it is not unreasonable to expect standards to evolve governing how merchandise offerings are represented.","Goal Specification","Before leaving on a shopping trip, a shopper creates a shopping list of items by selecting from a preexisting set of approximately 85 product categories (e.g. men's casual pants, women's formal shoes, flowers, etc,). They also indicate the shopping venue they intend to visit from a list of malls.","Initial Store Selection","Upon arriving at the mall, begins by suggesting the closest store that sells at least one item of a type entered by the user during goal specification. Along with the store name a system in accordance with a preferred embodiment prepares a list of the specific items available and their prices. A map of the mall displays both the precise location of the store and the shopper's current location. The shopper queries the system to suggest a store at any time based on their current location.","Browsing","To address the need of many shoppers to visit malls or shop generally without a particular destination in mind.  illustrates a display in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention. The display operates in a browse mode for use by shoppers as they stroll through the mall. In browse mode the system suggests items of interest for sale in the stores currently closest to the shopper. An item is considered to be of interest if it matches the categories entered in the goals screen. If there are no items of interest, the general type of merchandise sold at that store is displayed, rather than specific items. As the shopper strolls a map displays his or her precise current location in the mall. If an item displayed is selected by the shopper while browsing, the system alerts the shopper to the local retailer offering the same product for the lowest price, or announces the best local price. This search is restricted to the local mall, as that is the assumed radius the shopper is willing to travel.","Alternatives","It is worth emphasizing that the current inventive agent will support broader aspects of the shopping task, for example, it could operate as bi-directional channels. That is, not only can they provide information to the shopper, but, at the shopper's discretion, they may provide information to retailers as well. In this embodiment, the system indicates a shopper's goals and preferences to a retailer-based agent, who, in turn, responds with a customized offer that bundles service along with the product. Enabling the customization of offers is crucial to gaining the cooperation of retailers who are reluctant to compete solely on price and of value to customers who base their purchases on criteria other than price. While the preferred embodiment focuses on location-based filtering primarily in the context of the shopping task, the current invention provides the basis for \u201cphysical task support\u201d agents that provide an information channel to people engaged in various tasks in the physical world.","The present invention is a significant advance over non location based agents because a users physical location is often very predictive of his or hers current task. If we know someone is at a bowling alley or a post office we can reasonably infer their current activity. Knowledge of a user's current task largely determines the type of information they are likely to find useful. People are unlikely to concern themselves with postal rates while bowling, or optimal bowling ball weight while buying stamps. In addition, knowledge of the resources and obstacles present at a particular location suggest the range of possible and likely actions of someone at that location. This awareness of a user's possible and likely actions can be used to further constrain the type of information a user is likely to find useful. For example, knowledge of a restaurant's wine list could be used by a recommender system to constrain the wine advice it presents.","Knowledge of a shopper's precise location in a shopping mall is valuable because it enables the identification of the stores immediately surrounding the shopper. The offerings of the stores closest to the shopper represent the immediate choices available to the shopper. Given that shoppers place a premium on examining in i merchandise first hand and that there is a cost associated with walking to other stores, the merchandise of the closest surrounding stores constitute the most likely immediate selections of the shopper. Consequently, among the most useful information provided at any given time is the availability of merchandise in the surrounding stores that matches their previously stated goals.","People tend to move to different locations while performing many of their our tasks. This suggests that their immediate surroundings do not completely capture the full range of options they may have. In fact one of the main reasons for leaving a location is to perform an action that is not possible at the current location. Nevertheless, one does tend to address most tasks within relatively local areas. Thus while their immediate surroundings suggest the options they have available at a given point in time, a broader view of a location will often capture the options they are likely to consider over the course of a task. In the case of mall shopping, for example, the stores immediately surrounding the shopper represent the options available at that moment. Mall shoppers, however, are generally willing to travel to any store within the mall. Therefore the potential options over the entire shopping trip include all the stores in the mall. Accordingly, information is presented on offerings of interest only from the immediately surrounding stores because these are the immediately available options. When asked for alternatives, the system restricts itself to all the stores within the mall\u2014the area within which the shopping task as a whole is likely to be performed. Being alerted that a store hundreds or thousands of miles away sells the same merchandise for a few dollars less than the cheapest local alternative is of little value in cases when shoppers require a first hand examination of the merchandise in question or are not willing to wait for shipping.","In addition to the significant advantages over non-location based agents the present invention over comes disadvantages o online (or web) shopping. It is tempting to argue that online shopping will soon become the predominant mode of shopping, pending only greater penetration of home computers, the expansion of online offerings, and better online shopping tools. At first glance it would therefore appear to be a mistake to begin using location to support an activity that will become virtualized. Already we've seen the emergence of a number of software agents that support online shopping. For example, programs that allow users to identify the cheapest source for a music CD, given a title. Similar programs have been developed for buying books, such as BargainBot. These systems demonstrate the potential of electronic commerce web agents to create perfect markets for certain products. The success of these agents will encourage the development of similar web shopping agents for a greater variety of goods.","The Limitations of Online Shopping","Certainly online shopping will continue to grow and the trend towards more powerful online shopping agents will continue. Nevertheless, it also seems clear that no matter how sophisticated web-agents become, traditional physical shopping will continue to dominate the market for the foreseeable future. Several inherent difficulties of online shopping will ensure the continued reliance on physical shopping:","Non-fungible Goods","Web-based shopping agents have typically enabled users to identify the cheapest price for fungible products such as books and music CDs. While this capacity to create \u201cperfect markets\u201d for such commodities is of great benefit to consumers, several difficulties exist that will complicate applying these approaches to arbitrary products.","Commodities are particularly well suited to shopping agents because it is easy to make comparisons between competing offers. Because commodities are fungible, one of the very few dimensions upon which they differ is price. Price therefore becomes the primary, if not sole, criterion upon which purchasing decisions are made.","As soon as we move beyond commodities, however, several other criteria become important. For example, how do we compare items such as sweaters, mattresses, or tables? In addition to price we care about the materials used, the color, how it fits and feels, and the workmanship. Similar problems apply to most other products.","Imprecise Goal Specificaton","A second, related difficulty lies in communicating our desires to an agent. Shopping agents are great if the user knows the precise commodity he or she wants. Then they can simply enter the product by name. Unfortunately, if they don't have a specific item in mind when they shop, then the problem of conveying what is wanted to an agent becomes more difficult. For example, how does the user tell an agent what kind of lamp they want for their living room?","Undeveloped Preferences","Interfaces that allow shoppers to include descriptive features like price ranges, color, options, brands, etc, can help address the above problem, but they are not enough. Much of the time shoppers either haven't formed preferences or can't articulate their desires until after they've started shopping and had a chance to examine various examples of the target products.","Shopping is Entertainment","People like to shop and do so without having a specific purchase in mind. One study found that 42% of consumers are \u201cnon-destination shoppers\u201d that visit the mall primarily for leisure browsing and socializing.","Shopping is Sensory","Even if the user could effectively provide these details most would be unlikely to delegate a purchasing decision to such an agent. After all, many people are uncomfortable even trusting spouses to make appropriate purchases on their behalf. Most people want to see and touch first hand what they're considering before making a purchase decision. The few preferences they may provide an agent cannot replace this rich, first-hand experience. At best such preferences could be used to generate a candidate set for shoppers to consider.","Instant Grafication","Shopping is often a very emotional activity. People are pleased with their purchases and often can't wait to get home to try them out. The inherent delay between online purchases and their receipt is a significant issue to those who simply must take home their selections as soon as they see them.","In the end, consumers will continue to engage in physical shopping because of the limitations listed above. However, the fact that the task can't completely be delegated to software agents does not rule out a role for them. First, users find them useful for purchasing commodities when they know what they want. A second role, however, is to support the physical shopping task itself, throughout the time that a person is engaged in it. This, of course, is the approach taken in the Sproject.","SE","At first blush it may seem that the current invention is subject to some of the same limitations as purely web-based agents. After all, why should it be any easier to communicate your goals to a PDA than it is to a web-based agent? Why would your preferences be any more developed for purchases supported by a PDA system than a web-based agent?","A key difference between purely web-based agents and the current \u201cphysical task support agents\u201d (i.e. an agent that supports a user engaged in a task in a physical setting) is that web-based agents are completely responsible for conveying all information that will be considered by the user. On the other hand, \u201cphysical task support\u201d agents in accordance with a preferred embodiment can augment the approaches of web-based agents by referring to aspects of a user's environment. For example, it is not terribly important to convey richly the feeling of a particular sweater if the sweater is in a store thirty feet away. It need only refer the shopper to the sweater. The shopper will gain a much better appreciation of the sweater by trying it on than through anything that can be conveyed by the system. When too many products match an imprecisely specified goal for a web-based agent, a more restrictive search must be made. However, many matches simply indicates there is a store that is likely to be of great interest to the shopper and therefore should be visited. Once inside, narrowing down the merchandise of interest in person will often be far easier than refining the goals on a web-based agent. Therefore physical task support agents can assist users to elaborate their preferences and identify specific goals by calling users' attention to aspects of their physical environment as a means of conveying information throughout the entire course of the task.","The Promise of Physical Shopping Agents","It is hardly surprising that physical shopping has been neglected by the agents community. After all, until very recently there simply was no reliable way to deliver customized information to individual shoppers in remote locations. However, the explosive growth of PDAs, and their increasingly sophisticated communications capabilities promise to make them effective channels of \u201cjust in time\u201d information to users wherever they happen to be. The present invention provides an ituitive, novel agent that supports physical shopping by exploiting the promise of this developing channel that support all phases of the shopping task and solves the foregoing problems including:","Specification of Goals","Shoppers begin by indicating at least the general category of merchandise they are interested in. Shopping agents need to enable the specification of goals at various degrees of specificity. With the present invention these goals may be refined as the task progresses.","Exploration of Product Space","Before shoppers can make a selection, they need to become educated about what is available. Shopping agents can aid in this task by presenting various classes of offerings, reviews, demonstrations, etc. The present inventive Physical shopping agent can augment this by providing shoppers with a tour of the locally available offerings.","Refinement of Preferences","As shoppers learn what is available and examine the offerings their preferences evolve. Agents need to enable shoppers to refine their preferences over time. The present invention allows the user to refine their preferences.","Identification and Comparison of Candidate Products","As shoppers begin to understand what they want and what is available they typically compile a list of candidates that will be considered more carefully. The present inventive agents supports the construction and maintenance of such lists and facilitates the comparison of candidates within the list according to various criteria.","Negotiation of Offers","The present shopping agent is not restricted to providing the shopper with information. It is possible to negotiate prices and service options with retailers.","Product Selection, Purchase and Product Support","The present invention facilitates the transaction itself and can be used as a channel through which product service can be delivered.","While various embodiments have been described above, it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only, and not limitation. Thus, the breadth and scope of a preferred embodiment should not be limited by any of the above described exemplary embodiments, but should be defined only in accordance with the following claims and their equivalents."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Program Organization ","Data Structures ","Common User Defined Constants ","General Process Flow","Detailed Search Architecture Under the Simple  Query Mode ","Search Alta Vista","News Page ","Pattern Matching in Accordance with a Preferred  EMBODIMENT","Pattern Matching Overcomes these Limitations in  Accordance with a Preferred Embodiment","Patterns ","Pattern Matching Terminology ","Using the Identified Meeting Fields","Alta Vista Search Engine","News Page Search Engine","Enhance Target Rate for Pattern Matching","Wireless Bargain Identification in Accordance with a Preferred Embodiment","mySite!
