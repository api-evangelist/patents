{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This patent application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/469,296, filed on 30 Mar. 2011, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to telecommunications services. More particularly, the present invention relates to capabilities that enhance substantially the value and usefulness of various communication paradigms including, inter alia, Short Message Service (SMS), Multimedia Message Service (MMS), Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD), Internet Protocol (IP) Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), Session Initiation Protocol [SIP]\u2014addressed communications, Electronic Mail (E-Mail), Instant Messaging (IM), etc.","2. Background of the Invention","As the \u2018wireless revolution\u2019 continues to march forward through various flavors of 2G, 3G, 4G, and beyond, the importance to a Mobile Subscriber (MS)\u2014for example a user of a Wireless Device (WD) that is serviced by possibly inter alia a Wireless Carrier (WC)\u2014of their WD grows substantially. Examples of WDs include, inter alia, mobile telephones, handheld computers, Internet-enabled phones, pagers, radios, TVs, audio devices, car (audio, navigation, etc.) systems, recorders, text-to-speech devices, bar-code scanners, net appliances, mini-browsers, Personal Data Assistants (PDAs), etc.","One consequence of such a growing importance is the resulting ubiquitous nature of WDs\u2014i.e., MSs have them available at almost all times and use them for an ever-increasing range of activities. For example, MSs employ their WDs to, possibly inter alia:","1) Exchange (e.g., SMS, MMS, etc.) messages, content (such as inter alia pictures and other static images; songs and other quanta of audio data; movies, streaming video, and other quanta of video data; data from software applications such as games), etc. with other MSs (e.g., \u201cLet's meet for dinner at 6\u201d, etc.) through Peer-to-Peer, or P2P, messaging.","2) Secure information (such as, for example, weather updates, travel alerts, news updates, sports scores, stock updates, etc.), participate in voting initiatives (such as, for example, with the television show American Idol\u00ae), exchange content (such as for example pictures and other static images; songs and other quanta of audio data; movies, streaming video, and other quanta of video data; games and other software applications; etc.), interact with social networking sites, etc. through various of the available Application-to-Peer, or A2P, based service offerings.","3) Engage in Mobile Commerce (which, broadly speaking, encompasses the buying and selling of products, goods, services, etc. through a WD) and Mobile Banking (which, broadly speaking, encompasses performing various banking activities through a WD).","The ubiquitous nature of WDs has among other things resulted in very high volumes of data traffic. As just one example, around the world during 2009 there were over five trillion SMS messages exchanged and in North America during just the first half of 2010 over one trillion SMS messages were exchanged.","Under normal circumstances all of the traffic flows through the mobile ecosystem without issue. However, perturbations do arise. For example, service interruptions, system outages, bursts of traffic (for example in response to a tele-voting initiative, from a mass broadcast of alert or information messages in response to a news item or an emergency situation, etc.), equipment failures, etc. can all result in a \u2018pool\u2019 of traffic (including inter alia SMS, MMS, IMS, etc. messages; SIP-addressed artifacts; application data; WAP-based exchanges; E-Mail messages; signaling, command-and-control, application, etc. data; IM messages; etc.) that needs to be bulk processed.","It would be desirable to have a way of efficiently managing such a pool of traffic, including inter alia a way of dynamically throttling the sending of the traffic in the pool, so as to among other things maximize a WD user's experience.","Aspects of the present invention fill the lacuna that was noted above by (1) providing (within inter alia a Messaging Inter-Carrier Vendor [MICV]) an intelligent dynamic throttling capability that can accommodate a wide range of information (including inter alia SMS, MMS, IMS, etc. messages; SIP-addressed artifacts; application data; WAP-based exchanges; E-Mail messages; signaling, command-and-control, application, etc. data; IM messages; etc.) while (2) addressing, in new and innovatory ways, various of the not insubstantial challenges that are associated with same.","In one embodiment of the present invention there is provided a server-based method for dynamic message throttling that can possibly among other things (1) identify a message pool to be processed (where the message pool comprises a plurality of messages), (2) partition the message pool into a plurality of subdivisions, and (3) while a delivery window is open perform a plurality of processing steps, including (a) opening a subdivision for processing (yielding an open subdivision), (b) selecting a message from the open subdivision (yielding a selected message), (c) performing one or more processing steps on the selected message, (d) dispatching through a gateway aspects of the selected message for subsequent delivery to a message recipient, and (e) pausing zero or more units of time.","In another embodiment of the present invention there is provided a processor-based system on a server for dynamic message throttling that includes possibly among other things (1) workflow modules configured to perform a plurality of processing steps, including at least (a) identifying a message pool to be processed (where the message pool comprising a plurality of messages), (b) partitioning the message pool into a plurality of subdivisions, and (c) performing one or more processing steps while a delivery window is open, including at least (i) opening a subdivision for processing (yielding an open subdivision), (ii) selecting a message from the open subdivision (yielding a selected message), (iii) performing a plurality of processing steps on the selected message, and (iv) pausing zero or more units of time, (2) a gateway configured to dispatch aspects of the selected message for subsequent delivery to a message recipient, (3) a repository configured to preserve aspects of the results of the plurality of processing steps, and (4) an administrator.","These and other features of the embodiments of the present invention, along with their attendant advantages, will be more fully appreciated upon a reading of the following detailed description in conjunction with the associated drawings.","Throughout the drawings (a) like reference numbers generally indicate identical or functionally similar elements and (b) the left-most digit(s) of a reference number generally identify the drawing in which the reference number first appears.

Reference is made to U.S. Pat. No. 7,154,901 entitled \u201cINTERMEDIARY NETWORK SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR FACILITATING MESSAGE EXCHANGE BETWEEN WIRELESS NETWORKS,\u201d and its associated continuations, for a discussion of the concept of a MICV, a summary of various of the services\/functions\/etc. that may be performed by a MICV, and a discussion of the numerous advantages that may arise from same.","While portions of the discussion below will for clarity of exposition reference a MICV, it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other arrangements are equally possible and indeed are fully within the scope of the present invention. For example, aspects of the present invention may be realized through any combination of, possibly inter alia, any one or more of (1) an element of a WC, an element of a landline carrier, an element of a MICV, or multiple such elements working together; (2) a Third-Party (3P) such as possibly inter alia a Content Provider (CP, such as for example a news organization, an advertising agency, a brand, etc.) or a Service Provider (SP, such as for example a X); (3) multiple 3P entities working together; (4) a 3P service bureau; etc.","As illustrated in  and reference numeral , under one particular arrangement of aspects of the present invention a MICV  may be disposed between, possibly inter alia, multiple WCs (WC, WC\u2192WC) and multiple SPs (SP\u2192SP) and thus \u2018bridges\u2019 all of the connected entities. A MICV  thus, as one simple example, may offer various routing, formatting, delivery, value-add, etc. capabilities that provide, possibly inter alia:","1) A WC \u2192 (and, by extension, all of the MSs MS\u2192MS, MS\u2192MS, MS\u2192MS that are serviced by the WC \u2192) with ubiquitous access to a broad universe of SPs \u2192 (and other entities that nay be connected to the MICV), and","2) A SP \u2192 (and other entities that may be connected to the MICV) with ubiquitous access to a broad universe of WCs \u2192 (and, by extension, to all of the MSs MS\u2192MS, MS\u2192MS, MS MS that are serviced by the WCs \u2192).","Generally speaking a MICV may have varying degrees of visibility (e.g., access, etc.) to the (MS\u2190\u2192MS, MS\u2190\u2192SP, etc.) messaging traffic:","1) A WC may elect to route just their out-of-network messaging, signaling, data, etc. traffic to a MICV. Under this approach the MICV would have visibility (e.g., access, etc.) to just the portion of the WC's traffic that was directed to the MICV by the WC.","2) A WC may elect to route all of their messaging, signaling, data, etc. traffic to a MICV. The MICV may, possibly among other things, subsequently return to the WC that portion of the traffic that belongs to (i.e., that is destined for a MS of) the WC. Under this approach the MICV would have visibility (e.g., access, etc.) to all of the WC's traffic.","For purposes of illustration,  and reference numeral  depict one specific logical implementation of aspects of a MICV  that is possible under one particular arrangement of aspects of the present invention.  and reference numeral  depict among other things Gateways ( and  that for example provide inter alia information\/data receipt and dispatch capabilities across among other things different application-level and\/or physical-level communication protocols), Queues ( and  that for example provide inter alia interim storage and buffering capabilities), and a Message Highway (MH  that for example provides inter alia interconnection capabilities).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["300","316","318","400","316","400","402","412","404","414","408","418","406","416","410","420","422"],"sub":["1 ","a ","1 ","b ","1 ","d ","1 ","c ","1 ","e "]},"A dynamically updateable set of one or more Receivers (Rx\u2192Rx in the diagram) \u2018get\u2019 input (e.g., messages) from a MICV  MH  and possibly inter alia deposit them on an intermediate or temporary Queue (Q\u2192Q in the diagram) for subsequent processing.","A dynamically updateable set of one or more Queues (Q\u2192Q and Q\u2192Q in the diagram) operate as intermediate or temporary buffers for incoming and outgoing data (e.g., messages).","A dynamically updateable set of one or more WorkFlows (WorkFlow\u2192WorkFlow in the diagram) possibly inter alia (a) remove incoming messages from an intermediate or temporary Queue (Q\u2192Q in the diagram), (b) perform all of the required operations on the messages (more about this below), and (c) deposit the processed messages on an intermediate or temporary Queue (Q\u2192Q in the diagram).","A dynamically updateable set of one or more Transmitters (Tx\u2192Tx in the diagram) possibly inter alia remove processed messages from an intermediate or temporary Queue (Q\u2192Q in the diagram) and \u2018put\u2019 the messages on a MICV  MH .","An Administrative Interface  provides a linkage to all of the different components of a MPE so that a MPE, along with each of the components of a MPE, may be fully and completely administered or managed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","324","326"],"sub":["1 ","n "]},"1) Scheduled (e.g., daily, weekly, etc.) and\/or on-demand reporting with report results delivered through SMS, MMS, etc. messages; through E-Mail; through a WWW-based facility; etc.","2) Scheduled and\/or on-demand data mining initiatives (possibly leveraging or otherwise incorporating one or more external data sources) with the results of same presented through Geographic Information Systems (GISs), visualization, etc. facilities and delivered through SMS, MMS, etc. messages; through E-Mail; through a World Wide Web (WWW)-based facility; etc.","It is important to note that the depicted repositories DB\u2192DB are a logical representation of the possibly multiple physical repositories.

It will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other components, component arrangements, etc. are easily possible and, indeed, are fully within the scope of the present invention.","For simplicity  and  identify various components as for example \u2018Message Highway\u2019 and \u2018Message Processing Engine.\u2019 It is important to note that such components are not limited to operating on, processing, handling, etc. just (e.g., SMS, MMS, IMS, etc.) messages. Rather, as explained in detail below, all of the various MICV components are natively capable of operating on, processing, handling, etc. a more general quanta of data.","Central to the operation of a MICV is the unit of information within a MICV that is received, manipulated or otherwise operated on, dispatched, etc. Unlike prior environments that might operate just on, and thus potentially be limited just to, an SMS message or a MMS message, the unit of information within a MICV is a more general quanta of data. Accordingly a MICV is natively capable of operating on inter alia an SMS message, a MMS message, an IMS message, an E-Mail message, a Voice Over IP (VoIP) data stream, a video data stream (e.g., a movie, a video conference call, etc.), a voice telephone call, signaling and other command-and-control data, an audio data stream (e.g., a song, etc.), a SIP-addressed artifact, IM data, games and other software applications, pictures and other static images, data from software applications such as games, etc.","Within a MICV a flexible, extensible, and dynamically configurable IMO (see for example  and reference numeral ,  and reference numeral , and  and reference numeral ) may be employed as an internal representation of a received quanta of data. An IMO (, , and ) may logically contain possibly inter alia one or more headers ( and ), a body ( and ), etc. within which for example aspects of a received quanta of data may be preserved. An IMO may physically be realized through any combination of possibly inter alia proprietary data structures, Java Message Service (JMS) messages or objects, flat files, database entries, in-memory constructs, etc.","For purposes of illustration, within an SMS context a MICV may support the receipt and dispatch of information through possibly inter alia Short Message Peer-to-Peer (SMPP) via Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)\/IP and Mobile Application Part (MAP) via SS7. Under such a context:","1)  and reference numeral  depict an exemplary incoming SMS message received via for example SMPP with for example the data elements associated with the SMS message encapsulated within a SMPP Protocol Data Unit (PDU ) encapsulated within a TCP Segment  encapsulated within an IP Packet .","2)  and reference numeral  depict an exemplary incoming SMS message received via for example MAP with for example the data elements associated with the SMS message encapsulated within a Message Signal Unit (MSU )","3)  and reference numeral  depict a hypothetical IMO  that is possible in support of an SMS message received via for example SMPP, and","4)  and reference numeral  depict a hypothetical IMO  that is possible in support of an SMS message received via for example MAP.","It will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that numerous alternative arrangements, in connection with for example different contexts (such as inter alia MMS, VoIP, a voice call, signaling data, command-and-control data, software application data, etc.) and different communication protocols, are easily possible.","For simplicity of exposition the balance of the present discussion will consider SMS messages. However, it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that, as described above, the more general unit of information\u2014a quanta of data\u2014is equally applicable.","Consider a pool of SMS messages (Message\u2192Message, see  and reference numeral ) that has arisen from for example a disruption (e.g., from a service interruption, from a system outage, etc.) in a messaging ecosystem, a burst of messages (e.g., in response to a tele-voting initiative, from a mass broadcast of alert or information messages in response to a news item or an emergency situation), etc.","Any number of constraints, etc. may need to be considered as the messages in the pool are processed. As just one example, various temporal factors (e.g., the day of the week, the time of the day, etc.) may contribute to define one or more \u2018windows.\u2019 Within such a window (i.e., when a window is open) a message may be sent. Outside of such a window (i.e., when a window is closed) a message may need to be held, and not sent, until a sufficient amount of time passes so that a window (re)opens.  and reference numeral  depict a hypothetical window that opens at  (at\/after which messages may be sent) and that closes at  (at\/after which messages may not be sent). Note that for simplicity of exposition no specific time reference point\u2014e.g., GMT, a local time zone, etc.\u2014is specified for .","It will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that numerous alternative window arrangements are easily possible including inter alia the definition of multiple (possibly discrete, possibly overlapping) windows during a given 24-hour period, the definition of one or more quiet periods within a window (during which messages may not be sent), the association of a maximum message processing\/transmission\/etc. count to a particular period (e.g., one minute, three minutes, five minutes, 15 minutes, one hour, etc.) within a window, etc.","A pool of messages (e.g., Message\u2192Message, see  and reference numeral ) may be divided into some number of segments (Segment\u2192Segment) through among other things (a) a range of parameters, configuration values, settings, etc. and (b) any combination of one or more means including inter alia:","1) Uniform Means. For example, given inter alia a specified number of segments a pool of messages may be evenly divided across the segments. As illustrated by and reference numeral  a pool of 1740 messages may be divided into four segments with each segment containing 435 messages and as illustrated by and reference numeral  the same pool of 1740 messages may be divided into six segments with each segment containing 290 messages.","2) Random Means. For example, given inter alia a specified number of segments, along with perhaps other constraints (such as for example segment size maximums and\/or minimums, etc.), a pool of messages may be randomly divided across the segments. As illustrated by and reference numeral  a pool of  messages may be divided into four segments with each segment containing a different number of messages and as illustrated by and reference numeral  the same pool of 1220 messages may be divided into six segments with each segment containing a different number of messages","3) Algorithmic Means. For example, given inter alia a specified number of segments, an algorithm or formula (as supplied for example by a user, by an intermediary, by a WC, etc.), along with perhaps other constraints (such as for example segment size maximums and\/or minimums, etc.) a pool of messages may be algorithmically divided across the segments.","The above identified means are illustrative only and it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other means are easily possible.","Various of the parameters, configuration values, settings, etc. and\/or the means (uniform, random, etc.) that were described above may be implemented through FIG.

Such an approach effectively makes the message transmission self-moderating or self-regulating\u2014i.e., as fast or as slow as a positive acknowledgement, receipt, etc. is received the next message may be processed. If for example a particular WC (to whom a MICV is sending a message) can accept messages quickly then messages will be sent quickly; if the WC can only accept messages slowly then messages will be sent slowly.","It will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other ProcessPool functions (beyond those that were illustrated by  and \u2192) are easily possible. For example, a range of Quality of Service (QoS) metrics, targets, etc., for which in some cases a financial amount may be associated, may be included as additional processing constraints.","In the discussion above a simple model of Message Pool\u2192Segments\u2192Messages was employed. That simple model was employed for ease of exposition and was inter alia in no way intended to be exhaustive or limiting. It will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other flat, hierarchical, etc. models of any size, depth, etc. (such as for example Message Pool Segments\u2192Units\u2192Messages, Message Pool\u2192Blocks\u2192Groups\u2192Parts\u2192Messages, etc.) may be employed.","In the discussion above reference was made on numerous occasions, for purposes of illustration, to SMS, MMS, etc. message traffic. Such references were not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the specific forms disclosed. It will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other quanta of data including inter alia IMS message, an E-Mail message, a VoIP data stream, a video data stream [e.g., a movie, a video conference call, etc.], a voice telephone call, signaling and other command-and-control data, an audio data stream [e.g., a song, etc.], IM data, games and other software applications, pictures and other static images, data from software applications such as games, SIP-addressed artifacts, WAP-based exchanges, etc. are easily possible and, indeed, are fully within the scope of the present invention.","It is important to note that the hypothetical examples that were presented above, which were described in the narrative and which were illustrated in the accompanying figures, are exemplary only. They are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the specific forms disclosed. It will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous alternatives to the presented examples are easily possible and, indeed, are fully within the scope of the present invention.","The following list defines acronyms as used in this disclosure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0127","num":"0126"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Acronym","Meaning"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["A2P","Application-to-Peer"]},{"entry":["API","Application Programming Interface"]},{"entry":["CD-ROM","Compact Disc Read-Only Memory"]},{"entry":["CP","Content Provider"]},{"entry":["DBMS","Database Management System"]},{"entry":["DRAM","Dynamic Random Access Memory"]},{"entry":["E-Mail","Electronic Mail"]},{"entry":["EPROM","Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory"]},{"entry":["ETL","Extraction-Transformation-Load"]},{"entry":["GIS","Geographic Information System"]},{"entry":["IM","Instant Messaging"]},{"entry":["IMO","Internal Message Object"]},{"entry":["IMS","IP Multimedia Subsystem"]},{"entry":["IP","Internet Protocol"]},{"entry":["JMS","Java Message Service"]},{"entry":["MAP","Mobile Application Part"]},{"entry":["MEMS","Microelectromechanical Systems"]},{"entry":["MH","Message Highway"]},{"entry":["MICV","Messaging Inter-Carrier Vendor"]},{"entry":["MMS","Multimedia Message Service"]},{"entry":["MPE","Message Processing Engine"]},{"entry":["MS","Mobile Subscriber"]},{"entry":["MSU","Message Signal Unit"]},{"entry":["ODBMS","Object Database Management System"]},{"entry":["P2P","Peer-to-Peer"]},{"entry":["PCMCIA","Personal Computer Memory Card International Association"]},{"entry":["PDA","Personal Digital Assistant"]},{"entry":["PDU","Protocol Data Unit"]},{"entry":["PROM","Programmable Read-Only Memory"]},{"entry":["QoS","Quality of Service"]},{"entry":["RAM","Random Access Memory"]},{"entry":["RDBMS","Relational Database Management System"]},{"entry":["RF","Radio Frequency"]},{"entry":["SIP","Session Initiation Protocol"]},{"entry":["SMPP","Short Message Peer-to-Peer"]},{"entry":["SMS","Short Message Service"]},{"entry":["SP","Service Provider"]},{"entry":["SS7","Signaling System Seven"]},{"entry":["3P","Third Party"]},{"entry":["TCP","Transmission Control Protocol"]},{"entry":["TDR","Transaction Detail Record"]},{"entry":["USSD","Unstructured Supplementary Service Data"]},{"entry":["VoIP","Voice Over IP"]},{"entry":["WAP","Wireless Application Protocol"]},{"entry":["WC","Wireless Carrier"]},{"entry":["WD","Wireless Device"]},{"entry":["WWW","World-Wide Web"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated herein and form part of the specification, depict embodiments of the present invention and, together with the summary that was presented above and the description that may be found below, further serve to illustrate inter alia the principles, structure, and operation of such embodiments.
