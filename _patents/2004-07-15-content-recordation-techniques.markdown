{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","CONCLUSION"],"p":["The present invention generally relates to the field of content and in particular to content recordation techniques.","Users are continually exposed to an ever increasing variety of clients that provide network access, such a set-top boxes, wireless phones, computers, and so on. A user of a set-top box, for instance, may view traditional television programming obtained from a broadcast network for display on a television, as well as order pay-per-view movies, receive video-on-demand (VOD), play \u201clive\u201d video games, and so on. Likewise, a user of a wireless phone may place and receive traditional telephone calls, as well as read email, download digital music, and so on.","Another such example is a digital video recorder (DVR). A DVR typically includes non-volatile storage (e.g., a hard disk) that enables the user to record desired content. DVR's also offer control functionality, such as the ability to pause content that is currently being broadcast and allows viewers to watch the content, while still in progress, from the point it was paused. The DVR plays back the content from storage, starting at the pause event, while continuing to record the currently-broadcast content. Additionally, the DVR may support other control functions, such as rewinding, fast forwarding a stored program, slow motion playback, and the like.","To record content using a DVR, a user was typically required to directly interact with the DVR itself. In some instances, the user could configure the DVR to record related content by specifying parameters to be matched with those of available content to locate potentially desirable content. For example, the user could specify the title of a television program so that the DVR would record each television program having that title. However, the user was not assured that the DVR would record a particular content item of interest. In other words, the user could not be certain that the potentially desirable content recorded by the DVR corresponded with the actual content the user wished to record. For example, although the DVR may be configured to record a particular television program, the DVR might fail to record a special regarding the actors in that particular television program. Therefore, when the user was located \u201caway\u201d from the DVR, the user could not cause the DVR to record the particular content item, even if the user had access to one or more of the clients that provide network access as previously described.","Accordingly, there is a continuing need for improved content recordation techniques.","Content recordation techniques are described. The content recordation techniques may be utilized when the user is local to and remote from the client. For example, a user, when remotely located from a client configured as a digital video recorder (DVR), interacts with a remote device that is configured as a wireless phone. The user utilizes the wireless phone to access a review of a television program via the Internet. Based on the review, the user invokes a recording document that is embedded in the review to be communicated to the remote client. The recording document describes the television program, such as by describing a title, actors, broadcast time, service (e.g., channel) that broadcasts the television program, and so on.","Upon receipt of the recording document, the remote client executes a parser module to examine the recording document to determine if the television program described in the recording document is available for being recorded by the remote client. For instance, the recording document may be compared with electronic program guide (EPG) data that is received from a head end, EPG data service, and so on. The EPG data may be utilized to determine if the television program is available. The EPG data may also be utilized to determine how the television program is to be recorded, such as by supplying a channel and broadcast start time. If the television program is available, a reference to the television program is added to a recording list based on the EPG data. For example, the broadcast channel and the broadcast start time may be added to the recording list. The recording list is then utilized by the remote client to cause the client to record the content. In another instance, the recording document may cause the head end to cause the client to record the content, such as by examining EPG data stored at the head end to determine if the content is available for recording. If so, the head end causes the client the record the content. In a further instance, the recording document may cause the head end itself to record the content, such as in a network digital video recorder (NDVR) scenario.","The same reference numbers are utilized in instances in the discussion to reference like structures and components.","Overview","Content recordation techniques are described. In an implementation, a content recordation technique is described in which a client, such as a digital video recorder (DVR), is configured to record content streamed from a head end through use of a recording document that describes the content. The recording document may be provided in a variety of ways, such as embedded in a web site, shared via email or text messaging, submitted via an application programming interface (API), manually written by a user, and so on. The recording document is processed via a parser module to locate the content item that is described by the recording document. In one scenario, the parser module compares the recording document with an electronic program guide (EPG) that is stored on the client to find a matching content item that is described in the EPG data. If a sufficient match is found, a reference to the matching content item is added to a recording list based on the EPG data, such as a broadcast channel and time to record the matching content item. In another scenario, the head end processes the recording document provided by a remote device to determine whether the described content item is available. If so, the head end then causes the client to record the particular content item, such as through communication of a recording list to the client. Thus, a user may cause a particular content item to be recorded without direct interaction with the client.","In a further implementation, the head end stores client state data to process content recordation requests. For example, the head end may include client state data, such as ratings limits, favorite channels, levels of service, and so on, that is accessible locally by the head end. The head end may utilize this client state data to determine if the client is permitted to access the content item described by the recording document. If so, the head end may then cause the client to record the content. By performing the determination utilizing client state data at the head end, the head end provides an authoritative source for processing requests to record content by the client. This may result in a variety of increased functionality that is available to the user, such as an ability to change from an old client to a new client without manually updating client state data from the old client to the new client, remote initiation of content recordation without obtaining a connection with the client itself, and so on.","Exemplary Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","106","106"]},"The client  is configured to receive content communicated from the content provider  over the network . The content provider  includes content (), where \u201ck\u201d can be any integer from 1 to \u201cK\u201d, that is locally stored on the content provider . The content () may include a variety of data, such as television programming, video-on-demand, one or more results of remote application processing, and so on. The content provider  communicates the content () over a network  to a head end . The network  may be the same as or different from network . For example, the network  may represent a dedicated network connection between the content provider  and the head end  while network  is implemented by the Internet, both networks ,  may be the Internet, and so on.","The content () may then be stored in a database  as content (), where \u201cn\u201d can be any integer from 1 to \u201cN\u201d, on the head end  for communication over the network  to the client . In other words, the content () stored in the database  may be copies of the content () received from the content provider  over the network .","The head end , as illustrated, includes a distribution server  to format and distribute the content () over the network . Distribution from the head end  to the client  may be accomplished in a number of ways, including cable, RF, microwave, and satellite. Although the head end  is illustrated as separate from the content provider , the content provider  may also include the head end .","The head end  may also include a database  having a plurality of EPG data (), where \u201cm\u201d can be any integer from one to \u201cM\u201d. The EPG data () is used to construct an EPG  for display by the client  to a user. The EPG , for instance, may enable the user to observe a listing of television programs that are currently being broadcast from the head end , as well as a listing of television programs that will be broadcast in the future. Additionally, the EPG  may allow the viewer to navigate to a television program (e.g., content ()) from the EPG  itself. To provide additional information to the user, the EPG  may include one or more content characteristics that describe content represented in the EPG . The content characteristics may include title, broadcast time, broadcast channel, output duration of the content, plot description, a rating (e.g., G, PG, PG-13, R, etc.), a principle actor's name, and so on. The EPG data may be communicated to the client  in a variety of ways. In one instance, the EPG data () is broadcast to the client  utilizing a carousel file system. The carousel file system repeatedly broadcasts the EPG data over an out-of-band (OOB) channel to the client  over the network . Although the head end  is illustrated as including the EPG data (), in another instance the EPG data () is provided over the network  utilizing a separate EPG data service.","The client  may be configured as a computer that is capable of communicating over the network , such as a desktop computer, a mobile station, an entertainment appliance, a set-top box  that is communicatively coupled to a display device  as illustrated, and so forth. Although the set-top box  is shown separately from the display device , the set-top box  may be built into the display device  to form an integral unit. The client  may also relate to a person and\/or entity that operate the client . In other words, client  may describe a logical client that includes a user and\/or a machine. Although one client  is illustrated, a plurality of clients may be communicatively coupled to the network .","The client  may also include a database  having locally stored content (), where \u201cj\u201d can be any integer from 1 to \u201cJ\u201d. For example, the client  may be configured as a DVR that stores the database  in hard disk memory. Due to the size of the memory, users are able to record content, such as content () streamed from the head end . As previously described, the DVR also offers control functions, such as the ability to pause content that is currently being broadcast and allows viewers to watch the content while still in progress from the point it was paused. The DVR plays back the content from disk memory, starting at the pause event, while continuing to record the currently-broadcast content in the disk memory. Additionally, the DVR may support other control functions, such as rewinding, fast forwarding a stored program, slow motion playback, and the like.","The client  is equipped with sufficient processing and storage capabilities to store and run a navigation module . The navigation module , when executed on the client , provides control functions for interacting with content. For example, the control functions may include the DVR control functions as previously discussed, as well as channel selection, electronic program guide (EPG) navigation, and so on. In another implementation, the navigation module  provides media player functionality, such as to play media having audio and\/or visual data, such as MP3 data.","In a further implementation, the client  may execute the navigation module  to cause recordation of the content () at the distribution server . For example, the navigation module  may form a request that is communicated to the distribution server  over the network  to record content () communicated to the distribution server  from the content provider . The distribution server , in response to the request, records the requested content such that the navigation module  operates as a network digital video recorder (NDVR). Thus, through execution of the navigation module , the client  may playback locally-stored content (), content () that is stored remotely over the network , and may even control the recordation and playback of the remotely stored content () to the client .","Generally, any of the functions described herein can be implemented using software, firmware (e.g., fixed logic circuitry), manual processing, or a combination of these implementations. The terms \u201cmodule,\u201d \u201cfunctionality,\u201d and \u201clogic\u201d as used herein generally represent software, firmware, or a combination of software and firmware. In the case of a software implementation, the module, functionality, or logic represents program code that performs specified tasks when executed on a processor (e.g., CPU or CPUs). The program code can be stored in one or more computer readable memory devices. The content recordation techniques described below are platform-independent, meaning that the content recordation techniques may be implemented on a variety of commercial computing platforms having a variety of processors.","The environment  supports a variety of techniques for recordation of the content (), () through use of a recording document . The recording document , for instance, describes content to be recorded and may conform to an extensible Markup Language (XML) schema that is parsable by a parser module  to locate a particular content item. For example, the recording document  may describe a title and a start time for a desired content item. The parser module  is executed on the distribution server  to compare the title and the start time described in the recording document with the EPG data () stored in the database  to determine if and when the particular content item is available. If the particular content item is available, a reference to the particular content item is added to a recording list  to cause the particular content item to be recorded. For example, the recording list  may be utilized by the distribution server  to record content () at the head end  in a NDVR scenario. In another example, the recording list  is communicated to the client  to cause the navigation module  to record content () locally in a DVR scenario. In a further example, the recording document  is communicated from the remote device  to the client  for parsing by the client , an example of which is shown in relation to .","The recording document  may be provided in a variety of ways. As illustrated in , the recording document  is stored on a remote device  that is communicatively coupled to the network . Therefore, a user of the remote device  may provide the recording document  to the head end  to cause recording of content described by the recording document . Thus, the recording document  may be provided remotely by the remote device  such that the user does not need to interact with the client  locally to cause recordation of desired content. A variety of other ways of providing the recording document  are described in relation to , B, and .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","118","104","142","104","202","204","204"]},"The navigation module  and the recording list  are illustrated as being executed on the processor  and are storable in memory . The EPG  is illustrated as being stored in the memory  and is executable on the processor . It should be noted that in the illustrated system  of , the recording list  is depicted within the client  to show that the recording list  may be configured for use by the navigation module  to cause recordation of content, further discussion of which may be found starting in relation to .","The client  may also include a network interface  for receiving the content () of  that is communicated (e.g., streamed) over the network . For example, the network interface  may be configured as a tuner that receives broadcast content from over the network , may be configured as a transmitter\/receiver (transceiver) that is suitable for two-way communication over the network , and so on. Thus, the network interface  may be configured to transmit and receive messages over the network to and from the head end  and\/or the remote device .","Content () received from the network  via the network interface  may be stored in the database  for later output by the client  and\/or provide for immediate output of the content (). The database  is illustrated as being separate from memory , but may also be included in memory . For example, the storage device for the database  may be configured as a hard disk drive and the memory  may be configured as RAM, both the memory  and the database  may be implemented as RAM, both the memory  and the database  may be implemented as removable memory, and so forth. The client  executes the navigation module  to retrieve the content () from the database  and output the content () through an output interface  for rendering on the display device . Thus, in this implementation, the client  is capable of operating as a DVR that stores and plays back the content ().","The client  may be locally controlled by a user via inputs provided by an input device . The inputs are received by the client  from an input interface  over a local connection . The input interface , local connection  and input device  may be configured in a variety of ways. For example, the input interface  may be configured as a wireless port, such as an infrared (IR) or Bluetooth wireless port, for receiving wireless communications from input device , such as a remote control device, a handheld input device, or any other wireless device, such as a wireless keyboard. In alternate embodiments, the input interface  may use an RF communication link or other mode of transmission to communicate with client , such as a wired connection which may include a universal serial bus (USB) connection, and so on.","When output of content is requested, the navigation module  is executed on the processor  to obtain content, such as from content () of  that is streamed from the distribution server  over the network , content () that is stored locally on the database , and so on. The navigation module  may also restore the content to the original encoded format as provided by the content provider  of . For example, content () of  may be compressed and then streamed from the distribution server  to the client . Therefore, when the navigation module  receives the content, the content may be decompressed for rendering by the display device .","The distribution server  also includes a processor  and memory . The parser module  is illustrated as being executed on the processor  and is storable in memory . The memory  of the distribution server  is also illustrated as including a plurality of client state data (), where \u201cl\u201d can be any integer from 1 to \u201cL\u201d. The client state data () is utilized to process requests to record content, such as at the head end  of  as content () and\/or at the client in database  as content (). For example, the distribution server  may include a content manager module  (hereinafter, \u201cmanager module\u201d) that is executable on the processor  to manage client  content access. The client state data (), for instance, may specify parental blocks to prevent viewing of content items, may specify conditional access rights (e.g., digital access rights) of the client for particular items of content, rating limits, favorite channels, level of service provisioned, and so on. The manager module , when executed, may determine if the client  is permitted (i.e., authorized) to record the particular content item, and if so, the distribution server  causes the client , and specifically the navigation module , to record the particular content item. In this way, the head end  provides an authoritative source for client state data () in the system  and environment  as shown, respectively, in . In an implementation, the distribution server  may be considered the primary source for the client state data () for a particular client, even over the client  itself. For example, by storing the client state data () on the distribution server , a user may switch set-top boxes without transferring client state data between the set-top boxes. Further discussion of use of the client state data () may be found in relation to .","The remote device  is also illustrated as including a processor  and memory . The recording document  is illustrated as being stored in memory  and is executable on the processor . The remote device  also includes a recording module  which is illustrated as being executed on the processor  and is storable in memory . The recording module , when executed, generates the recording document  for a particular content item. For example, the recording module  may provide a user interface for accepting user inputs that describe a particular content item. The user inputs are processed by the recording module  to generate a recording document  that follows a schema that is understood by the parser module . The parser module , when executed, parses the recording document  to locate and compare descriptive data in the recording document  with EPG data () in the database . EPG data () that matches the descriptive data is then utilized to determine how to record a particular content item described in the recording document . A reference to the particular content item is then added to the recording list  to cause the navigation module  to be executed on the client  to record the particular content item. A variety of other scenarios are also contemplated such that the user may cause recordation of content at the client  and\/or the head end  of , further examples of which may be found in relation to the following figure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 1","FIG. 2A"],"b":["250","118","104","142","200","220","138","136"],"smallcaps":"L"},"In the exemplary system  illustrated in , however, the client  executes the parser module  to parse the recording document  that is communicated from the remote device  over the network . The parser module  may then be utilized to populate the recording list  as previously described by comparing the recording document  with EPG  that is stored in the memory . Thus, in this instance, the head end  acts to broadcast content () over a broadcast network  and does not actively participate in the recordation of the content () on the client , further discussion of which may be found in relation to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2A","FIG. 1"],"b":["300","118","104","302","108","104","108","102","108","302"],"i":["k","k","k"]},"The recording document  is then communicated to the distribution server  over the network  for parsing by the parser module . The parser module , when executed, locates the particular content item (e.g., the next episode of the television program) based on the recording document  and the EPG data () and adds a reference to the particular content item to a recording list . The recording list  causes the navigation module  to record the content locally in the database  as content (). Thus, the recording document  embedded in the content () provides for automatic recording of the next episode of the television program with minimal user intervention.","In another such technique, a remote content recordation technique is provided by using a remote record service . For example, the remote record service  may provide a web site which enables a user to select content for recording. The web site  may then communicate a recording document  that describes the content selected by the user to cause the client  to automatically record the selected content as previously described.","In a further such technique, the user interacts with the remote device  to remotely record content using the client . For example, the remote device  may execute an email module  that causes an email that contains a recording document  to be communicated to the distribution server . The distribution server  may then execute the parser module  to compare the descriptive data in the recording document  with the EPG data () to determine if the particular content item referenced in the email is available. If so, the parser module  may then be executed to determine if access to the particular content item is permitted by the client  based on the client state data (). For example, the client state data () may indicate whether the user subscribes to a content service package that includes the particular content item. If the user does have conditional access rights, the particular content item is added to the recording list  for causing the navigation module  to record the particular content item as content () in the database .","In another example, the remote device  may include a text messaging module  to receive a text message from another remote device. The text message may describe a particular content item, such as by providing the title, names of actors, genre, and so on. The text message may be examined to dynamically generate the recording document  that contains the content descriptions from the text message. The recording document  may then be communicated to the distribution server  for processing as previously described. In this example, the recording document  is dynamically generated, further discussion of which may be found in relation to . Although the system  of  described the execution of the parser module  on the distribution server , the parser module  may also be executed on the client . For example, the parser module , when executed on the client , may compare the descriptive data in the recording document  with the EPG  (e.g., the EPG data utilized to form the EPG stored on the client ) to determine availability of the particular content item. Further discussion of execution of the parser module  by the client  may also be found in relation to . Although a variety of exemplary content recordation techniques have been described, a variety of other content recordation techniques may also be provided that utilize a recording document for comparison with EPG data.","Exemplary Procedures","The following discussion describes content recordation techniques that may be implemented utilizing the previously described systems and devices. Aspects of each of the procedures may be implemented in hardware, firmware, or software, or a combination thereof.

Each of these elements may occur more than once in the recording document .","At block , the remote device communicates the recording document  to the head end . For example, the recording document  may be transmitted (i.e., pushed) over the network , implemented using the Internet, for receipt by the head end . In another example, the recording document is \u201cpulled\u201d from the remote device  by the head end . For instance, the head end  may be configured to periodically monitor the remote device  for presence of the recording document .","At block , the head end  queries the database  of EPG data () to determine if the particular content item described by the recording document  is available. The head end , for instance, may execute the parser module  to locate data in the recording document  that describes the particular content item, which is illustrated at block  of  as \u201ccontent description \u201d. The content description  (i.e., the descriptive data) is then compared with the EPG data () to find a match. For example, the <program>, <service>, and <airing> elements may be compared with the EPG data () to find a particular content item which most satisfies those elements. Thus, the parser module , when executed, may determine how to record the particular content item that is described by the recording document by cross-referencing the content description  with the EPG data ().","In an implementation, the head end  utilizes minimum search field requirements before querying the database that contains EPG data () (block ). For example, specific combinations of search criteria, when included in a recording document, may result in a failure in the query (block ) due to insufficient amount of information (e.g., elements) to locate the particular content item. For instance, a recording document that only specifies a <service> (e.g., a broadcast channel) may be considered as invalid unless a corresponding <program> and\/or <airing> is provided. The following is a listing of exemplary legal combinations of the three elements previously described:","<program> (e.g., record this program anytime it is streamed, on any service);","<program>, <service> (record this program anytime it is streamed from a specified service);","<program>, <airing> (record this program at this time from any service);","<program>, <service>, <airing> (record this program at this time from this service); and","<service>, <airing> (record the named service at the given time).","Although three elements are described, a variety of other elements and combinations thereof may also be included in the recording document  to locate a particular content item.","Through use of elements and different combinations of the elements, for example, search criteria may be broadly or narrowly specified depending upon the desired implementation. For instance, a fan website may post a recording document for recording any episode of a particular television program no matter what time it is broadcast and no matter which channel broadcasts the television program. Such a recording document may specify the title of the television program (e.g., <program>) without supplying any other additional elements. In another instance, a website provided by a particular content broadcaster may supply a recording document that specifies episodes that are broadcast by that particular content broadcaster and does not wish to include episodes that are broadcast by rival broadcasters. In this instance, the recording document specifies the title of the television program (e.g., <program>) and the broadcaster (e.g., <service>).","Although some examples of search criteria have been described, a variety of other search criteria may also be specified in a recording document. For example, the recording document may specify alternative matching attributes, such as \u201c(<program> and <service>) or (<service> and <airing>)\u201d. Additionally, each of the elements may be specified in a variety of ways. For instance, a target service may be specified by call sign, name, affiliate, and so on. Thus, the recording document may flexibly describe search criteria as contemplated by a creator of the recording document.","The search criteria (i.e., elements) may also be processed so that the recording document is transportable between users having different respective content providers. For example, users may receive content through different channel lineups, the users may be located in different time zones, and so on. Time-based search criteria, for instance, may be specified using any time-zone and then normalized to a local time-zone when parsed. In another instance, the search criteria may be restricted to within a particular offset from coordinated universal time (UTC). Multiple criteria may be specified in this way so one time can be specified that applies only to Pacific Standard Time (PST) and Eastern Standard Time (EST), for example, and another time set for Mountain Standard Time (MST) and Central Standard Time (CST). In a further instance, a search \u201cwindow\u201d can be specified to allow the episode to be matched within a specific range of time around the time specified.","If the particular content item is available, then the head end adds a content reference  to the particular content item in the recording list  (block ). The content reference , for instance, may specify a broadcast channel and time to record the referenced content item, map to a memory location of the particular content item in a database  of  at the head end , and so on.","At block , the head end  causes the client  to record the particular content item referenced in the recording list . For example, the head end  may execute the parser module  to communicate the content reference  over the network  to the client . The navigation module , upon receipt of the content reference , records the particular content item to the database  as specified by the content reference . Thus, in this example, the remote device  is able to cause the client  to record a particular content item without direct interaction with the client .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"],"b":["500","502","228","136","400","404"]},"The remote device , for example, includes the recording module . The recording module , when executed on the remote device , provides an output for display on a display device  of the GUI . The GUI  in this example provides an interface for entering keyword search elements which may be utilized to locate a particular content item. For instance, the user may utilize an input device to enter a portion of a title and actors in the particular content item, such as \u201cGodfather\u201d , \u201cPacino\u201d , and \u201cDeNiro\u201d . The recording module  utilizes these elements to form the recording document . The recording document  is then communicated over the network  to the distribution server  and parsed by the parser module  as previously described to determine if the described particular content item of the recording document  is available.","In this example, the elements \u201cGodfather\u201d , \u201cPacino\u201d  and \u201cDe Niro\u201d  are utilized to determine if the particular content item \u201cGodfather II\u201d is available by finding a content item described in the EPG data () of  that satisfies each of these elements. In another implementation, a \u201cbest match\u201d may be performed so that the content item described in the EPG data () which satisfies the most elements in the recording document  is reported to the user via the GUI . For example, Godfather II may not be available based on a query of the EPG data (). However, the movie Godfather I, which satisfies the elements \u201cGodfather\u201d  and \u201cPacino\u201d  may be available. Therefore a result of the query, which indicates the availability of Godfather I, is output via the GUI  so that the user can decide whether to record that particular content item.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5"],"b":["600","500","136","136"]},"The client , for instance, may be configured as a set-top box  that is communicatively coupled to the display device .

The user, upon reading the content review , may desire to record the particular content item described in the review. In this instance, however, the content review  does not include a preconfigured recording document as previously described in relation to . Therefore, the client  executes a recording module  to dynamically generate the recording document  based on the content review .","The recording module , for example, may be executed to examine the content review  to find one or more words which describe the particular content item. In an implementation, the recording module  compares words in the content review  with a database  of descriptive words which may be utilized to describe content, such as names of broadcast channels, titles, actors, and so on. For instance, the recording module , when executed, locates the words \u201chardball\u201d , \u201cChris Matthews\u201d , and \u201cMSNBC\u201d  (MSNBC is a trademark of MSNBC Cable L.L.C. of New York, N.Y.). The recording module  then generates a recording document  and communicates it over the network  to a parser module  that is executable on another client .","The parser module , when executed on the other client , compares the recording document  with an EPG  to determine if the particular content item described in the recording document  is available, and if so, causes a navigation module  to record the particular content item as content (), where \u201cp\u201d can be any integer from one to \u201cP\u201d, in the database .","In another implementation, the recording module  and the parser module  are executed to directly compare words - in the content review  with the EPG  that is stored on the client . In other words, the EPG  (and more particularly the EPG data that is utilized to configure the EPG ) provides the database . In this implementation, the recording module  does not wait until after the recording document  is completely generated to perform the comparison, but rather compares words - with the EPG .","It should be noted that in the system  of , the client  executes the recording module  to generate the recording document . Another client  executes the parser module  to determine if the particular content item is available based on another EPG  that is stored locally on the other client .

For example, the client may provide an icon for selection by the user, a drop-down menu for activation of the recording module, and so on. At block , the recording module, when executed, examines the text to locate descriptions of the particular content item. For instance, the recording module may first examine the text to locate words which are typically used to describe the <program>, <service>, and <airing> elements that were previously described. The recording module may also locate other words which describe the particular content item, such as actor, output duration of the content, genre, start time, stop time, plot, and so on.","At block , the recording module generates a recording document that includes the located descriptions of the particular content item.
