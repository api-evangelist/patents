The invention further relates to methods of preparing the compounds and methods of using the compounds and compositions.","Inflammation","Inflammation is a response of vascularized tissues to infection or injury and is affected by adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelial cells of blood vessels and their infiltration into the surrounding tissues. In normal inflammation, infiltrating leukocytes release toxic mediators to kill invading organisms, phagocytize debris and dead cells, and play a role in tissue repair and the immune response. However, in pathologic inflammation, infiltrating leukocytes are over-responsive and can cause serious or fatal damage. See, e.g., Hickey, (Academic Press 1990).","The integrins are a family of cell-surface glycoproteins involved in cell-adhesion, immune cell migration and activation. Alpha-4 (\u03b14) integrin is expressed by all circulating leukocytes except neutrophils, and forms heterodimeric receptors in conjunction with either the beta1 (\u03b21) or beta7 (\u03b27) integrin subunits. Both alpha-4 beta-1 (\u03b14\u03b21) and alpha-4 beta-7 (\u03b14\u03b27) play a role in the migration of leukocytes across the vascular endothelium (Springer et al., 1994 76: 301-14; Butcher et al., 1996, 272: 60-6) and contribute to cell activation and survival within the parenchyma (Damle et al., 1993; 151: 2368-79; Koopman et al., 1994, 152: 3760-7; Leussink et al., 2002, 103: 131-136). \u03b14\u03b21 is constitutively expressed on lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, mast cells, basophils and eosinophils.","\u03b14\u03b21 (also known as very late antigen-4, VLA-4), binds to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) (Lobb et al., 1994, 94: 1722-8), which is expressed by the vascular endothelium at many sites of chronic inflammation (Bevilacqua et al., 1993 11: 767-804; Postigo et al., 1993 144: 723-35). \u03b14\u03b21 has other ligands, including fibronectin and other extracellular matrix (ECM) components.","Intercellular adhesion mediated by \u03b14\u03b21 and other cell surface receptors is associated with a number of inflammatory responses. At the site of an injury or other inflammatory stimulus, activated vascular endothelial cells express molecules that are adhesive for leukocytes. The mechanics of leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells involves, in part, the recognition and binding of cell surface receptors on leukocytes to the corresponding cell surface molecules on endothelial cells. Once bound, the leukocytes migrate across the blood vessel wall to enter the injured site and release chemical mediators to combat infection.","Rheumatoid Arthritis","Rheumatoid arthritis (\u201cRA\u201d) is a chronic inflammatory disease that causes pain, swelling, stiffness, and loss of function, primarily the joints. RA is estimated to affect approximately 1 percent of the world's population. In the U.S. alone, an estimated 2.1 million people suffer from the disease. This relatively high frequency suggests a complex etiology and pathogenesis.","The disease process leading to RA begins in the synovium, the membrane that surrounds a joint creating a protective sac. In healthy individuals, the synovium produces synovial fluid that lubricates, nourishes and protects joint tissues. This clear fluid lubricates and nourishes the cartilage and bones inside the joint capsule. In individuals suffering from RA, the immune system, for unknown reasons, attacks the cells inside synovium. Leukocytes infiltrate from the circulation into the synovium causing continuous abnormal inflammation (i.e., synovitis). Consequently, the synovium becomes inflamed, causing warmth, redness, swelling, and pain. The collagen in the cartilage is gradually destroyed, narrowing the joint space and eventually damaging bone. The inflammation causes erosive bone damage in the affected area. During this process, the cells of the synovium grow and divide abnormally, making the normally thin synovium thick and resulting in a joint that is swollen and puffy to the touch. See, e.g., Paul, (3d ed., Raven Press, 1993).","It is believed that bone damage begins during the first year or two that a person has the disease. This is one reason why early diagnosis and treatment are important in the management of RA. As the disease progresses, abnormal synovial cells begin to invade and destroy the cartilage and bone within the joint. The surrounding muscles, ligaments, and tendons that support and stabilize the joint become weak and unable to work normally. RA also causes more generalized bone loss that may lead to osteoporosis, making bones fragile and more prone to fracture. All of these effects cause the pain, impairment and deformities associated with RA.","Although RA almost always develops in the wrists and knuckes, some patients experience the effects of the disease in places other than the joints. For instance, the knees and the ball of the foot are often affected as well. Often, many joints may be involved, and even the spine can be affected. In about 25% of people with RA, inflammation of small blood vessels can cause rheumatoid nodules, or lumps, under the skin. These are bumps under the skin that often form close to the joints. As the disease progresses, fluid may also accumulate, particularly in the ankles. Many patients with RA also develop anemia, or a decrease in the normal number of red blood cells. Other less prevalent effects include neck pain, dry eyes and dry mouth. On rare occasions, patients may also develop inflammation of the-blood vessels, the lining of the lungs, or the sac enclosing the heart.","RA has several special features that differentiate it from other types of arthritis. For example, RA generally occurs in a symmetrical pattern\u2014if one knee or hand is involved, the other one is also. The disease often affects the wrist joints and the finger joints closest to the hand. RA usually first affects the small joints of the hands and feet, but may also involve the wrists, elbows, ankles and knees. It can also affect other parts of the body besides the joints. In addition, patients with the disease may have fatigue, occasional fever, and a general sense of not feeling well (malaise).","Another distinct feature of RA is the variance between individuals. For some, it lasts only a few months or a year or two and subsides without causing any noticeable damage. Other people have mild or moderate disease, with periods of worsening symptoms (flares) and periods in which they feel better (remissions). In severe cases, the disease is chronically active most of the time, lasting for many years, and leading to serious joint damage and disability.","RA encompasses a number of disease subtypes, such as Felty's syndrome, seronegative RA, \u201cclassical\u201d RA, progressive and\/or relapsing RA, and RA with vasculitis. Some experts classify the disease into type 1 or type 2. Type 1, the less common form, lasts a few months at most and leaves no permanent disability. Type 2 is chronic and lasts for years, sometimes for life.","RA is believed to be one of several \u201cautoimmune\u201d diseases (\u201cauto\u201d means self), so-called because a person's immune system attacks his or her own body tissues. Although much has been learned about the process leading to RA, researchers have yet to uncover all of the factors that lead to this disease. One prevalent theory is that a combination of factors trigger RA, including an abnormal autoimmune response, genetic susceptibility, environmental, biologic factors, hormonal, and reproductive factors. Nonetheless, despite intensive research, the cause of RA remains obscure. See El-Gabalawy et al., AR4(suppl 3):S297-S301 (2002).","RA occurs across all races and ethnic groups. Although the disease often begins in middle age and occurs with increased frequency in older people, children and young adults may also develop juvenile RA. Like other forms of arthritis, RA exhibits a clear gender bias: approximatley two to three times as many women as men have the disease (Lawrence et al., 1998, 41:778-799). However, a genetic predisposition has been identified and, in white populations, localized to a pentapeptide in the HLA-DR1 locus of class II histocompatibility genes. Environmental factors may also play a role. Immunologic changes may be initiated by multiple factors.","Prominent immunologic abnormalities that may be important in pathogenesis include immune complexes found in joint fluid cells and in vasculitis. Plasma cells produce antibodies that contribute to these complexes. Lymphocytes that infiltrate the synovial tissue are primarily T helper cells, which can produce pro-inflammatory cytokines. Increased adhesion molecules contribute to inflammatory cell emigration and retention in the synovial tissue.","The onset is usually insidious, with progressive joint involvement, but may be abrupt, with simultaneous inflammation in multiple joints. Tenderness in nearly all inflamed joints and synovial thickening are common. Initial manifestations may occur in any joint.","Stiffness lasting less than 30 minutes on arising in the morning or after prolonged inactivity is common. Subcutaneous rheumatoid nodules are not usually an early manifestation. Visceral nodules, vasculitis causing leg ulcers or mononeuritis multiplex, pleural or pericardial effusions, lymphadenopathy, Felty's syndrome, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, and episcleritis are other manifestations. As many as 75% of patients improve symptomatically with conservative treatment during the first year of disease. However, less than 10% are eventually severely disabled despite full treatment. The disease greatly affects the lives of most RA patients. Complete bed rest is occasionally indicated for a short period during the most active, painful stage of severe disease. In less severe cases, regular rest should be prescribed.","Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may provide important symptomatic relief and may be adequate as simple therapy for mild RA, but they do not appear to alter the long-term course of disease. Salicylates, such as aspirin, may be used for treatment.","Gold compounds usually are given in addition to salicylates or other NSAIDs if the latter do not sufficiently relieve pain or suppress active joint inflammation. In some patients, gold may produce clinical remission and decrease the formation of new bony erosions. Parenteral preparations include gold sodium thiomalate or gold thioglucose. Gold should be discontinued when any of the above manifestations appear. Minor toxic manifestations (e.g., mild pruritus, minor rash) may be eliminated by temporarily withholding gold therapy, then resuming it cautiously about 2 wk after symptoms have subsided. However, if toxic symptoms progress, gold should be withheld and the patient given a corticosteroid. A topical corticosteroid or oral prednisone 15 to 20 mg\/day in divided doses is given for mild gold dermatitis; larger doses may be needed for hematologic complications. A gold chelating drug, dimercaprol 2.5 mg\/kg IM, may be given up to four to six times\/day for the first 2 days and bid for 5 to 7 days after a severe gold reaction.","Hydroxychloroquine can also control symptoms of mild or moderately active RA. Toxic effects usually are mild and include dermatitis, myopathy, and generally reversible corneal opacity. However, irreversible retinal degeneration has been reported. Sulfasalazine may also be used for treatment of RA.","Oral penicillamine may have a benefit similar to gold and may be used in some cases if gold fails or produces toxicity in patients with active RA. Side effects requiring discontinuation are more common than with gold and include marrow suppression, proteinuria, nephrosis, other serious toxic effects (eg, myasthenia gravis, pemphigus, Goodpasture's syndrome, polymyositis, a lupuslike syndrome), rash, and a foul taste.","Steroids are the most effective short-term anti-inflammatory drugs. However, their clinical benefit for RA often diminishes with time. Steroids do not predictably prevent the progression of joint destruction. Furthermore, severe rebound follows the withdrawal of corticosteroids in active disease. Contraindications to steroid use include peptic ulcer, hypertension, untreated infections, diabetes mellitus, and glaucoma.","Immunosuppressive drugs are increasingly used in management of severe, active RA. However, major side effects can occur, including liver disease, pneumonitis, bone marrow suppression, and, after long-term use of azathioprine and malignancy.","Whatever may be the actual cause, there is no cure for RA, and although the disease is not fatal, disease complications and symptoms may persist throughout an individual's lifetime, and may even shorten survival by a few years. Affected joints may become deformed, and the performance of even ordinary tasks may be very difficult or impossible.","Based on the above, new compositions and methods of preventing rheumatoid arthritis and treating the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis are needed such that patients can have better quality of life.","The invention relates to combination therapies comprising methotrexate and an antibody to alpha-4 integrin or an immunologically active antigen binding fragment thereof or a small molecule alpha-4 integrin antagonist for use in a subject in need thereof. Preferably, the subject is a mammal. More preferably, the mammal is human.","The invention also relates to methods of treating rheumatoid arthritis in a subject in need thereof comprising administering in therapeutically effective amounts, a combination therapy comprising methotrexate and an antibody to alpha-4 integrin or an immunologically active antigen binding fragment thereof or a small molecule alpha-4 integrin antagonist.

All publications mentioned herein are incorporated herein by reference to disclose and describe the methods and\/or materials in connection with which the publications are cited.","By \u201cprotein\u201d is meant to include but is not limited to immunoglobulins, enzymes, receptor, and fragments thereof. Although discussion of the formulation is provided in reference to an antibody or immunoglobulin, other proteins are contemplated as interchangeable in the formulations disclosed.","By \u201cimmunoglobulin\u201d is meant to include, but is not limited to, an antibody and antibody fragment (such as scFv, Fab, Fc, F(ab\u2032)), and other genetically engineered portions of antibodies. Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains, immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM. Several of these may be further divided into subclasses (isotypes), e.g., IgG-1, IgG-2, IgG-3, and IgG-4; IgA-1 and IgA-2. The heavy chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called alpha (\u03b1), delta (\u0394), epsilon (\u03b5), gamma (\u03b3), and mu (\u03bc), respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known. Preferably, the immunoglobulin recognizes and binds to alpha-4 integrin.","The term \u201cantibody\u201d is used in the broadest sense and includes monoclonal antibodies (including agonist and antagonist antibodies), antibody compositions with polyepitopic specificity, and antibody fragments (e.g., Fab, F(ab\u2032), scFv and Fv), so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity. \u201cAntibody\u201d is meant to include polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal antibodies, humanized antibodies, human antibodies, Primatized\u00ae antibodies and other antibodies produced via genetic engineering.","The term \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to conventional (polyclonal) antibody preparations, which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity, the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they are synthesized by the hybridoma culture, uncontaminated by other immunoglobulins. The modifier \u201cmonoclonal\u201d indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al., 1975 256: 495 or by the many improvements thereon derived in the intervening period. Some of these are discussed for instance in, Harlow et al., UA: A LM\u2014PPNO. 1 (Cold Spring Harbor Press, NY 1998); Harlow et al., A: A LM(Cold Spring Harbor Press, NY 1988); and Shepherd et al., MA: A PA(Oxford University Press, 2000).","The term \u201cmonoclonal antibodies\u201d also includes \u201cchimeric\u201d antibodies (immunoglobulins) in which a portion of the heavy and\/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity. For example, the ability to bind to alpha-4 integrin. The \u201cmonoclonal antibodies\u201d may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described for example in Clackson et al., 1991 352: 624-628 and Marks et al., 1991 222: 581-597.","\u201cHumanized\u201d forms of non-human (e.g., murine, rabbit, bovine, equine, porcine, and the like) antibodies are chim eric immunoglobulins, immunoglobulin chains or fragments thereof (such as Fv, Fab, Fab\u2032, F(ab\u2032)or other antigen-binding subsequences of-antibodies), which contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a complementary determining region (CDR) of the recipient are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat or rabbit having the desired specificity, affinity and capacity. In some instances, Fv framework residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibody may comprise residues which are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. These modifications are made to further refine and optimize antibody performance. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. The humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin.","The expression \u201clinear antibodies\u201d are also included by the general term \u201cantibody\u201d and are a pair of tandem Fd segments (V-C1-V-C1), which form a pair of antigen binding regions. Linear antibodies can be bispecific or monospecific.","A \u201cvariant antibody\u201d (also included by the generic term \u201cantibody\u201d) is a molecule which differs in amino acid sequence from a \u201cparent\u201d antibody's amino acid sequence by virtue of addition, deletion and\/or substitution of one or more amino acid residue(s) in the parent antibody sequence. In the preferred embodiment, the variant comprises one or more amino acid substitution(s) in one or more hypervariable region(s) of the parent antibody. For example, the variant may comprise at least one substitution, e.g., from about one to about ten, and preferably from about two to about five, in one or more hypervariable regions of the parent antibody. Ordinarily, the variant will have an amino acid sequence having at least 75% amino acid sequence identity with the parent antibody heavy or light chain variable domain sequences, more preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 85%, more preferably at least 90%, and most preferably at least 95%. Identity or homology with respect to this sequence is defined herein as the percentage of amino acid residues in the candidate sequence that are identical with the parent antibody residues, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity. None of the N-terminal, C-terminal, or internal extensions, deletions, or insertions into the antibody sequence should be construed as affecting sequence identity or homology.","To analyze such properties, one should compare a Fab form of the variant to a Fab form of the parent antibody or a full length form of the variant to a full length form of the parent antibody, for example, because it has been found that the format of the antibody impacts its activity in the biological activity assays disclosed herein. The variant antibody of particular interest is one which displays at least about 10 fold, preferably at least about 20 fold, and most preferably at least about 50 fold, enhancement in biological activity when compared to the parent antibody. The \u201cparent\u201d antibody is one which is encoded by an amino acid sequence used for the preparation of the variant. Preferably, the parent antibody has a human framework region and has human antibody constant region(s). For example, the parent antibody may be a humanized or a human antibody.","An \u201cisolated antibody\u201d is one which has been identified and separated and\/or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments, the antibody will be purified (1) to greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method, and most preferably more than 99% by weight, (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or non-reducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody's natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.","\u201cAntibody fragments\u201d comprise a portion of an intact antibody, generally the antigen binding or variable region of the intact antibody. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab\u2032, F(ab\u2032), and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies; single-chain antibody molecules; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.","\u201cSingle-chain Fv\u201d or \u201csFv\u201d antibody fragments comprise the Vand Vdomains of antibody, wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Generally, the Fv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the Vand Vdomains which enables the sFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding.","The term \u201cdiabodies\u201d refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain (V) connected to a light chain variable domain (V) in the same polypeptide chain (V-V). By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites.","The route of antibody administration is in accord with welll known methods, and may include injection or infusion by intravenous, intraperitoneal, intracerebral, intramuscular, intraocular, intraarterial, or intralesional routes, or by sustained release systems. The antibody can be administered continuously by infusion or by bolus injection. Therapeutic antibody compositions generally are placed into a container having a sterile access port, for example, an intravenous solution bag or vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle.","A \u201cstable\u201d formulation is one in which the protein therein essentially retains its physical stability and\/or chemical stability and\/or biological activity upon storage. Various analytical techniques for measuring protein stability are available in the art and are reviewed in PPDD, 247-301 (Vincent Lee ed., New York, N.Y., 1991) and Jones, 1993 10: 29-90, for examples. Stability can be measured at a selected temperature for a selected time period as exemplified by the provided examples.","A protein, such as an antibody or fragment thereof, \u201cretains its physical stability\u201d in a pharmaceutical formulation if it shows no signs of aggregation, precipitation and\/or denaturation upon visual examination of color and\/or clarity, or as measured by UV light scattering or by size exclusion chromatography.","A protein \u201cretains its chemical stability\u201d in a pharmaceutical formulation, if the chemical stability at a given time is such that the protein is considered to still retain its biological activity. Chemical stability can be assessed by detecting and quantifying chemically altered forms of the protein. Chemical alteration may involve size modification (e.g., clipping), which can be evaluated using size exclusion chromatography, SDS-PAGE and\/or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization\/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI\/TOF MS), for examples. Other types of chemical alteration include charge alteration (e.g., occurring as a result of deamidation), which can be evaluated by ion-exchange chromatography, for example.","An antibody \u201cretains its biological activity\u201d in a pharmaceutical formulation, if the biological activity of the antibody at a given time is within about 10% (within the errors of the assay) of the biological activity exhibited at the time the pharmaceutical formulation was prepared as determined in an antigen binding assay, for example.","By \u201cisotonic\u201d is meant that the formulation of interest has essentially the same osmotic pressure as human blood. Isotonic formulations will generally have an osmotic pressure from about 250 to 350 mOsm. Isotonicity can be measured using a vapor pressure or ice-freezing type osmometer, for example.","As used herein, \u201cbuffer\u201d refers to a buffered solution that resists changes in pH by the action of its acid-base conjugate components. The buffer of this invention has a pH in the range from about 3.0 to about 7.5; preferably from about pH 4.0 to about 7.0; more preferably from about pH 5.0 to about 6.5; and most preferably has a pH of about 6.0\u00b10.5. A pH of any point in between the above ranges is also contemplated.","A \u201cpreservative\u201d is a compound which can be included in the formulation to essentially reduce bacterial action therein, thus facilitating the production of a multi-use formulation, for example. Examples of potential preservatives include octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride, hexamethonium chloride, benzalkonium chloride (a mixture of alkylbenzyldimethylammonium chlorides in which the alkyl groups are long-chain compounds), and benzethonium chloride. Other types of preservatives include aromatic alcohols such as phenol, butyl and benzyl alcohol, alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben, catechol, resorcinol, cyclohexanol, 3-pentanol, and m-cresol.","By \u201cpatient\u201d or \u201csubject\u201d is meant to include any mammal. A \u201cmammal\u201d, for purposes of treatment, refers to any animal classified as a mammal, including but not limited to humans, domestic and farm animals, and zoo, sports, or pet animals, such as dogs, horses, cats, cows, and the like. Preferably, the mammal is human.","By \u201cAntegren\u2122\u201d is meant to include the antibody also known as AN100226 (antibody code number) or natalizumab (USAN name). Antegren\u2122 is a recombinant, humanized anti-alpha-4 integrin antibody. Preferably the disease or condition being treated in the mammal is one which is modulated when a therapeutically effective dose of Antegren\u2122 is administered.","The terms \u201csmall molecule alpha-4-integrin antagonists\u201d (i.e., anti-alpha-4 agents and small molecule compounds) as used herein refer to any agent that binds specifically to an integrin comprising an alpha-4 subunit and inhibits activity of the integrin. Preferably such molecules bind to alpha-4 in a manner that prevents its interaction with VCAM 1 and thereby VCAM-1 signaling. This also includes agents that specifically bind to alpha-4 integrin as well as agents that bind to an integrin dimer that comprises the alpha-4 integrin, e.g., alpha-4 beta-1 (i.e., \u03b14\u03b21 integrin) or alpha-4 beta-7 (i.e., \u03b14\u03b27 integrin). Preferably, the agent is one that binds to alpha-4 in a manner, which inhibits VLA4 (alpha-4) from interacting with its cognate ligand, i.e., beta-7 or beta-1. More preferably, the anti-alpha-4 agent inhibits VLA4 from interacting with VCAM-1.","The term \u201cagent\u201d is meant to include synthetic molecules (e.g., antibodies, small molecules, peptides, or other synthetically produced molecules or compounds, as well as recombinantly produced gene products) as well as naturally occurring compounds (e.g., polypeptides, antibodies, antibody fragments and the like). Preferably the agent is an antagonist of alpha-4 beta-1 integrin interaction with its cognate ligand. Thus, the agent preferably binds to either VCAM-1 or to alpha-4 beta-1 integrin in a manner so as to inhibit or prevent VCAM-1 interaction with alpha-4 beta-1 integrin. The agent also inhibits VLA-4 recruitment of immune cells inhibiting an inflammatory response, which is responsible for the disease or condition being treated in the subject.","The term \u201cefficacy\u201d as used herein in the context of a chronic dosage regime refers to the effectiveness of a particular treatment regime. Efficacy can be measured based on change the course of the disease in response to an agent of the present invention.","The term \u201csuccess\u201d as used herein in the context of a chronic treatment regime refers to the effectiveness of a particular treatment regime. This includes a balance of efficacy, toxicity (e.g., side effects and patient tolerance of a formulation or dosage unit), patient compliance, and the like. For a chronic administration regime to be considered \u201csuccessful\u201d it must balance different aspects of patient care and efficacy to produce the most favorable patient outcome.","The terms \u201cspecifically binds\u201d or \u201cbinds specifically\u201d as used herein refer to the situation in which one member of a specific binding pair will not show any significant binding to molecules other than its specific binding partner (e.g., an affinity of about 1000 times or more for its binding partner). In the present invention, the small compounds, such as N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperzain-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester, will not show significant binding to any polypeptide other than an alpha-4 integrin or a receptor comprising an alpha-4 integrin. For example, the small compounds used in the methods of the invention that bind to an alpha-4 integrin with a binding affinity of greater than 0.3 nM are said to bind specifically to an alpha-4 integrin.","The term \u201csubstantially similar\u201d as used herein is intended to mean any polypeptide that has an alteration in the sequence such that a functionally equivalent amino acid is substituted for one or more amino acids in the polypeptide, thus producing a change that has no or relatively little effect on the binding properties of the polypeptide. For example, one or more amino acid residues within the sequence can be substituted by another amino acid of a similar polarity or similar size.","The terms \u201celicits an immune response\u201d and \u201celicits a host immune response\u201d as used herein refer to the production of an immune response to a receptor comprising an alpha-4 integrin in a subject upon introduction of an agent of the invention to the subject. An immune response in the subject can be characterized by a serum reactivity with an alpha-4 integrin receptor that is at least twice that of an untreated subject, more preferably three times the reactivity of an untreated subject, and even more preferably at least four times the reactivity of an untreated subject, with serum immunoreactivity measured using a serum dilution of approximately 1:100.","The terms \u201ctreating\u201d, \u201ctreatment\u201d, and the like are used herein to refer to obtaining a desired pharmacological and physiological effect. The effect may be prophylactic in terms of preventing or partially preventing a disease, symptom or condition thereof and\/or may be therapeutic in terms of a partial or complete cure of a disease, condition, symptom or adverse effect attributed to the disease. The term \u201ctreatment\u201d, as used herein, covers any treatment of a disease in a mammal, particularly a human, and includes: (a) preventing the disease from occurring in a subject which may be predisposed to the disease but has not yet been diagnosed as having it, i.e., causing the clinical symptoms of the disease not to develop in a subject that may be predisposed to the disease but does not yet experience or display symptoms of the disease; (b) inhibiting the disease, i.e., arresting or reducing the development of the disease or its clinical symptoms; or (c) relieving the disease, i.e., causing regression of the disease and\/or its symptoms or conditions. The invention is directed towards treating a patient's suffering from disease related to pathological inflammation. The present invention is involved in preventing, inhibiting, or relieving adverse effects attributed to pathological inflammation over long periods of time and\/or are such caused by the physiological responses to inappropriate inflammation present in a biological system over long periods of time.","As used herein, \u201cacyl\u201d refers to the groups H\u2014C(O)\u2014, alkyl-C(O)\u2014, substituted alkyl-C(O)\u2014, alkenyl-C(O)\u2014, substituted alkenyl-C(O)\u2014, alkynyl-C(O)\u2014, substituted alkynyl-C(O)-cycloalkyl-C(O)\u2014, substituted cycloalkyl-C(O)\u2014, aryl-C(O)\u2014, substituted aryl-C(O)\u2014, heteroaryl-C(O)\u2014, substituted heteroaryl-C(O), heterocyclic-C(O)\u2014, and substituted heterocyclic-C(O)\u2014 wherein alkyl, substituted alkyl, alkenyl, substituted alkenyl, alkynyl, substituted alkynyl, cycloalkyl, substituted cycloalkyl, aryl, substituted aryl, heteroaryl, substituted heteroaryl, heterocyclic and substituted heterocyclic are as defined herein.","\u201cAcylamino\u201d refers to the group \u2014C(O)NRR where each R is independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, substituted alkyl, alkenyl, substituted alkenyl, alkynyl, substituted alkynyl, aryl, substituted aryl, cycloalkyl, substituted cycloalkyl, heteroaryl, substituted heteroaryl, heterocyclic, substituted heterocyclic and where each R is joined to form together with the nitrogen atom a heterocyclic or substituted heterocyclic ring wherein alkyl, substituted alkyl, alkenyl, substituted alkenyl, alkynyl, substituted alkynyl, cycloalkyl, substituted cycloalkyl, aryl, substituted aryl, heteroaryl, substituted heteroaryl, heterocyclic and substituted heterocyclic are as defined herein.","\u201cAcyloxy\u201d refers to the groups alkyl-C(O)O\u2014, substituted alkyl-C(O)O\u2014, alkenyl-C(O)O\u2014, substituted alkenyl-C(O)O\u2014, alkynyl-C(O)O\u2014, substituted alkynyl-C(O)O\u2014, aryl-C(O)O\u2014, substituted aryl-C(O)O\u2014, cycloalkyl-C(O)O\u2014, substituted cycloalkyl-C(O)O\u2014, heteroaryl-C(O)O\u2014, substituted heteroaryl-C(O)O\u2014, heterocyclic-C(O)O\u2014, and substituted heterocyclic-C(O)O\u2014 wherein alkyl, substituted alkyl, alkenyl, substituted alkenyl, alkynyl, substituted alkynyl, cycloalkyl, substituted cycloalkyl, aryl, substituted aryl, heteroaryl, substituted heteroaryl, heterocyclic and substituted heterocyclic are as defined herein.","\u201cAlkenoxy\u201d refers to the group \u201calkenyl-O-\u201d.","\u201cSubstituted alkenoxy\u201d refers to the group \u201csubstituted alkenyl-O-\u201d.","\u201cAlkenyl\u201d refers to alkenyl group preferably having from 2 to 10 carbon atoms and more preferably 2 to 6 carbon atoms and having at least 1 and preferably from 1-2 sites of alkenyl unsaturation.","\u201cLower alkenyl\u201d refers to an alkenyl group preferably having from 2 to 6 carbon atoms and having at least 1 site and preferably only 1 site of alkenyl unsaturation (i.e., >C\u2550C<).

It is not understood exactly how methotrexate works in rheumatoid arthritis, but reduces inflammation and slow worsening of the disease. Methotrexate is considered a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD). It is effective in the early stages of rheumatoid arthritis to prevent disease progression, especially in combination with other medications.","Methotrexate is effective in relieving joint inflammation, slowing disease progression, and preventing disability by delaying joint destruction. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis may be more likely to continue treatment with methotrexate than with other DMARDs because of favorable results and tolerable side effects. Physicians often recommend that methotrexate be used with one or more combination therapy.","Combination therapy may allow for lower doses of an individual drug to be used, which may reduce the risk of adverse effects that can occur with higher doses. Methotrexate combined with hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine may be more effective that methotrexate alone.","Whatever may be the actual cause, there is no cure for RA, and although the disease is not fatal, disease complications and symptoms may persist throughout an individual's lifetime, and may even shorten survival by a few years. Affected joints may become deformed, and the performance of even ordinary tasks may be very difficult or impossible.","Notwithstanding what has been previously reported in the literature, new compounds, compositions and methods for using these compounds and compositions to inhibit rheumatoid arthritis are needed.","In a general sense, the method of the invention does not involve any particular mode of administration, since the mode of administration is dependent upon the form of the active agent and the formulation developed to administer the active agent. Modes of administration include, but are not limited to, oral, parenteral (e.g., subcutaneous, subdural, intravenous, intramuscular, intrathecal, intraperitoneal, intracerebral, intraarterial, or intralesional routes of administration), topical, localized (e.g., surgical application or surgical suppository), rectal, and pulmonary (e.g., aerosols, inhalation, or powder). The route of administration would be based on the composition being administered (e.g., immunoglobulin being administered intravenously versus small compound being administered orally), tissue targeting (e.g., intrathecal administration to target the site of a spinal cord injury), and the like, as would be known to the artisan of ordinary skill.","Additionally, the anti-alpha-4 agents (e.g., anti-alpha-4-antibodies, small compound alpha-4-integrin antagonists, and the like) can be combined with other compounds or compostions used to treat, ameliorate or palliate symptoms associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Furthermore, the compounds disclosed herein can be administered alone or in combination with other agents, such as alpha-4 integrin inhibitors, including anti-alpha-4 integrin antibodies and immunologically active fragments thereof (e.g., natalizumab). When administered in combination, the small compound alpha-4-integrin antagonists may be administered in the same formulation as these other compounds or compositions, or in a separate formulation. When administered in combination, the anti-alpha-4-antibodies are generally administered in a separate formulation than the small compound alpha-4-integrin antagonists, other compounds, and compositions. When administered in combinations, the anti-alpha-4 agents may be administered prior to, following, or concurrently with the other compounds and compositions used to treat, ameliorate, or palliate symptoms. The invention relates to introducing relatively constant amounts of an active agent to a patient's circulatory system over a period of months or years. This chronic introduction of an agent that selectively binds to alpha-4 integrin or a dimer comprising alpha-4 integrin (e.g. alpha-4-beta-1) results in suppression of pathological inflammation being maintained at a constant level over a period of time. By maintaining therapeutic levels of an active agent for a period of time, pathological inflammation can be chronically suppressed in the patient.","Compounds of Formulae I and II","In one aspect, the compounds that can be utilized as combination therapies with methotrexate for the treatment of RA are compounds of Formulae I, IA, IB, IC, and II.","In one aspect, the compounds that can be utilized as combination therapies with methotrexate for the treatment of RA are compounds defined by Formula I below.

In one method for preparing such carbamates, a hydroxy compound of the present invention or an intermediate thereof is contacted with about 1.0 to about 1.2 equivalents of 4-nitrophenyl chloroformate in an inert diluent, such as dichloromethane, at a temperature ranging from about \u221225\u00b0 C. to about 0\u00b0 C. for about 0.5 to about 2.0 hours. Treatment of the resulting carbonate with an excess, preferably about 2 to about 5 equivalents, of a trialkylamine, such as triethylamine, for about 0.5 to 2 hours, followed by about 1.0 to about 1.5 equivalents of a primary or secondary amine provides the carbamate. Examples of amines suitable for using in this reaction include, but are not limited to, piperazine, 1-methylpiperazine, 1-acetylpiperazine, morpholine, thiomorpholine, pyrrolidine, piperidine and the like.","Alternatively, in another method for preparing carbamates, a hydroxy-containing compound is contacted with about 1.0 to about 1.5 equivalents of a carbamyl chloride in an inert diluent, such as dichloromethane, at a temperature ranging from about 25\u00b0 C. to about 70\u00b0 C. for about 2 to about 72 hours. Typically, this reaction is conducted in the presence of a suitable base to scavenge the acid generated during the reaction. Suitable bases include, by way of example, tertiary amines, such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, N-methylmorpholine and the like. Additionally, at least one equivalent (based on the hydroxy compound) of 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)pyridine is preferably added to the reaction mixture to facilitate the reaction. Examples of carbamyl chlorides suitable for use in this reaction include, by way of example, dimethylcarbamyl chloride, diethylcarbamyl chloride and the like.","Likewise, when a compound of the present invention or an intermediate thereof contains a primary or secondary hydroxyl group, such hydroxyl groups can be readily converted into a leaving group and displaced to form, for example, amines, sulfides and fluorides. For example, derivatives of 4-hydroxy-L-proline can be converted into the corresponding 4-amino, 4-thio or 4-fluoro-L-proline derivatives via nucleophilic displacement of the derivatized hydroxyl group. Generally, when a chiral compound is employed in these reactions, the stereochemistry at the carbon atom attached to the derivatized hydroxyl group is typically inverted.","These reactions are typically conducted by first converting the hydroxyl group into a leaving group, such as a tosylate, by treatment of the hydroxy compound with at least one equivalent of a sulfonyl halide, such as p-toluenesulfonyl chloride and the like, in pyridine. This reaction is generally conducted at a temperature of from about 0\u00b0 C. to about 70\u00b0 C. for about 1 to about 48 hours. The resulting tosylate can then be readily displaced with sodium azide, for example, by contacting the tosylate with at least one equivalent of sodium azide in an inert diluent, such as a mixture of N,N-dimethylformamide and water, at a temperature ranging from about 0\u00b0 C. to about 37\u00b0 C. for about 1 to about 12 hours to provide the corresponding azido compound. The azido group can then be reduced by, for example, hydrogenation using a palladium on carbon catalyst to provide the amino (\u2014NH) compound.","Similarly, a tosylate group can be readily displaced by a thiol to form a sulfide. This reaction is typically conducted by contacting the tosylate with at least one equivalent of a thiol, such as thiophenol, in the presence of a suitable base, such as 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU), in an inert diluent, such as N,N-dimethylformamide, at a temperature of from about 0\u00b0 C. to about 37\u00b0 C. for about 1 to about 12 hours to provide the sulfide. Additionally, treatment of a tosylate with morpholinosulfur trifluoride in an inert diluent, such as dichloromethane, at a temperature ranging from about 0\u00b0 C. to about 37\u00b0 C. for about 12 to about 24 hours affords the corresponding fluoro compound.","Furthermore, a compound of the present invention or an intermediate thereof having a substituent containing an iodoaryl group, for example, when R, of Formula I or II, is a (4-iodophenyl)methyl group, can be readily converted either before or after the above coupling reactions into a biaryl compound. Typically, this reaction is conducted by treating the iodoaryl compound with about 1.1 to about 2 equivalents of an arylzinc iodide, such as 2-(methoxycarbonyl)phenylzinc iodide, in the presence of a palladium catalyst, such as palladium tetra(triphenylphosphine), in an inert diluent, such as tetrahydrofuran, at a temperature ranging from about 24\u00b0 C. to about 30\u00b0 C. until the reaction is complete. This reaction is further described, for example, in Rieke, 1991, 56, 1445.","In some cases, the compounds of the present invention or intermediates thereof may contain substituents having one or more sulfur atoms. Such sulfur atoms will be present, for example, when the amino acid of Formula A employed in the above reactions is derived from L-thiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid, L-(5,5-dimethyl)thiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid, L-thiamorpholine-3-carboxylic acid and the like. When present, such sulfur atoms can be oxidized either before or after the above coupling reactions to provide a sulfoxide or sulfone compound using conventional reagents and reaction conditions. Suitable reagents for oxidizing a sulfide compound to a sulfoxide include, by way of example, hydrogen peroxide, 3-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (MCPBA), sodium periodate and the like. The oxidation reaction is typically conducted by contacting the sulfide compound with about 0.95 to about 1.1 equivalents of the oxidizing reagent in an inert diluent, such as dichloromethane, at a temperature ranging from about \u221250\u00b0 C. to about 75\u00b0 C. for about 1 to about 24 hours. The resulting sulfoxide can then be further oxidized to the corresponding sulfone by contacting the sulfoxide with at least one additional equivalent of an oxidizing reagent, such as hydrogen peroxide, MCPBA, potassium permanganate and the like. Alternatively, the sulfone can be prepared directly by contacting the sulfide with at least two equivalents, and preferably an excess, of the oxidizing reagent. Such reactions are described further in March, \u201c4th Ed., pp. 1202-1202, Wiley Publishers, (1992).","As described above, the compounds of the present invention having an Rsubstituent other an hydrogen can be prepared using an N-substituted amino acid of Formula A, such as sarcosine, N-methyl-L-phenylalanine and the like, in the above-described coupling reactions. Alternatively, such compounds can be prepared by N-alkylation of a sulfonamide of Formula I or C (where Ris hydrogen) using conventional synthetic procedures. Typically, this N-alkylation reaction is conducted by contacting the sulfonamide with at least one equivalent, preferably 1.1 to 2 equivalents, of an alkyl or substituted alkyl halide in the presence of a suitable base, such as potassium carbonate, in an inert diluent, such as acetone, 2-butanone and the like, at a temperature ranging from about 25\u00b0 C. to about 70\u00b0 C. for about 2 to about 48 hours. Examples of alkyl or substituted alkyl halides suitable for use in this reaction include, but are not limited to, methyl iodide, and the like.","Additionally, the sulfonamides of Formula I or C wherein Ris hydrogen and Ris a 2-alkoxycarbonylaryl group can be intramolecularly cyclized to form 1,2-benzisothiazol-3-one derivatives or analogues thereof. This reaction is typically conducted by treating a sulfonamide, such as N-(2-methoxycarbonylphenylsulfonyl)glycine-L-phenylalanine benzyl ester, with about 1.0 to 1.5 equivalents of a suitable base, such as an alkali metal hydride, in a inert diluent, such as tetrahydrofuran, at a temperature ranging from about 0\u00b0 C. to about 30\u00b0 C. for about 2 to about 48 hours to afford the cyclized 1,2-benzisothiazol-3-one derivative.","Lastly, the compounds of Formula I or II where Q is \u2014C(S)NR\u2014 are prepared by using an amino thionoacid derivative in place of amino acid A in the above described synthetic procedures. Such amino thionoacid derivatives can be prepared by the procedures described in Shalaky et al., 61:9045-9048 (1996) and Brain et al., 62:3808-3809 (1997) and references cited therein.","Compounds of Formulae III-IX","In one aspect, the compounds that can be utilized as combination therapies with methotrexate for the treatment of RA are compounds of Formulae IIIa, IIIb, IVa, IVb, Va, Vb, Vc, Vd, Ve, VIa, VIIb, VIIa, VIIb, VIIc, VIId, VIIe, VIIIa, VIIIb, IXa, IXb, IXc, IXd, and IXe.","In one aspect, the compounds that can be utilized as combination therapies with methotrexate for the treatment of RA are compounds defined by Formula IIIa and\/or IIIb below.

U.S. Ser.

No. 6,492,372), herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Further description of these type of compounds is described in U.S. Patent Publication 20030139402, a divisional application of U.S. Ser. No. 09\/489,377, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Compound Preparation for Compounds of Formulae III-IX","The compounds of Formulae III-IX can be prepared from readily available starting materials using the following general methods and procedures. It will be appreciated that where typical or preferred process conditions (i.e., reaction temperatures, times, mole ratios of reactants, solvents, pressures, etc.) are given, other process conditions can also be used unless otherwise stated. Optimum reaction conditions may vary with the particular reactants or solvent used, but such conditions can be determined by one skilled in the art by routine optimization procedures.","Additionally, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art, conventional protecting groups may be necessary to prevent certain functional groups from undergoing undesired reactions. Suitable protecting groups for various functional groups as well as suitable conditions for protecting and deprotecting particular functional groups are well known in the art. For example, numerous protecting groups are described in T. W. Greene and G. M. Wuts, , Second Edition, Wiley, New York, 1991, and references cited therein.","Furthermore, the compounds of Formulae III-IX will typically contain one or more chiral centers. Accordingly, if desired, such compounds can be prepared or isolated as pure stereoisomers, i.e., as individual enantiomers or diastereomers, or as stereoisomer-enriched mixtures.

This reaction is typically conducted by contacting the tosylate with at least one equivalent of a thiol, such as thiophenol; in the presence of a suitable base, such as 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU), in an inert diluent, such as N,N-dimethylformamide, at a temperature of from about 0\u00b0 C. to about 37\u00b0 C. for about 1 to about 12 hours to provide the sulfide. Additionally, treatment of a tosylate with morpholinosulfur trifluoride in an inert diluent, such as dichloromethane, at a temperature ranging from about 0\u00b0 C. to about 37\u00b0 C. for about 12 to about 24 hours affords the corresponding fluoro compound.","Furthermore, a compound of Formulae III-IX or an intermediate thereof having a substituent containing an iodoaryl group, for example, when Ris a (4-iodophenyl)methyl group, can be readily converted either before or after the above coupling reactions into a biaryl compound. Typically, this reaction is conducted by treating the iodoaryl compound with about 1.1 to about 2 equivalents of an arylzinc iodide, such as 2-(methoxycarbonyl)phenylzinc iodide, in the presence of a palladium catalyst, such as palladium tetra(triphenylphosphine), in an inert diluent, such as tetrahydrofuran, at a temperature ranging from about 24\u00b0 C. to about 30\u00b0 C. until reaction completion. This reaction is further described, for example, in Rieke, 1991, 56, 1445. Additional methods for preparing biaryl derivatives are disclosed in International Publication Number WO 98\/53817, published Dec. 3, 1998, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","In some cases, the compounds of Formulae III-IX or intermediates thereof may contain substituents having one or more sulfur atoms. When present, such sulfur atoms can be oxidized either before or after the above coupling reactions to provide a sulfoxide or sulfone compound using conventional reagents and reaction conditions. Suitable reagents for oxidizing a sulfide compound to a sulfoxide include, by way of example, hydrogen peroxide, 3-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (MCPBA), sodium periodate and the like. The oxidation reaction is typically conducted by contacting the sulfide compound with about 0.95 to about 1.1 equivalents of the oxidizing reagent in an inert diluent, such as dichloromethane, at a temperature ranging from about \u221250\u00b0 C. to about 75\u00b0 C. for about 1 to about 24 hours. The resulting sulfoxide can then be further oxidized to the corresponding sulfone by contacting the sulfoxide with at least one additional equivalent of an oxidizing reagent, such as hydrogen peroxide, MCPBA, potassium permanganate and the like. Alternatively, the sulfone can be prepared directly by contacting the sulfide with at least two equivalents, and preferably an excess, of the oxidizing reagent. Such reactions are described further in March, \u201c4th Ed.; pp. 1201-1202, Wiley Publisher, 1992.","Other procedures and reaction conditions for preparing the compounds of this invention are described in the examples set forth below.

Compounds that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred.","The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the EDwith little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range which includes the IC(i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography. The effective blood level of the compounds of the subject invention is preferably greater than or equal to 10 ng\/ml.","The amount of the pharmaceutical composition administered to the patient will vary depending upon what is being administered, the purpose of the administration, such as prophylaxis or therapy, the state of the patient, the manner of administration, and the like. In therapeutic applications, compositions are administered to a patient already suffering from a disease in an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest the symptoms of the disease and its complications. An amount adequate to accomplish this is defined as \u201ctherapeutically effective dose.\u201d Amounts effective for this use will depend on the disease condition being treated as well as by the judgment of the attending clinician depending upon factors such as the severity of the inflammation, the age, weight and general condition of the patient, and the like.","The compositions administered to a patient are in the form of pharmaceutical compositions described supra. These compositions may be sterilized by conventional sterilization techniques, or may be sterile filtered. The resulting aqueous solutions may be packaged for use as is, or lyophilized, the lyophilized preparation being combined with a sterile aqueous carrier prior to administration. The pH of the compound preparations typically will be between 3 and 11, more preferably from 5 to 9 and most preferably from 7 to 8. It will be understood that use of certain of the foregoing excipients, carriers, or stabilizers will result in the formation of pharmaceutical salts.","The active compound is effective over a wide dosage range and is generally administered in a pharmaceutically or therapeutically effective amount. The therapeutic dosage of the compounds of the present invention will vary according to, for example, the particular use for which the treatment is made, the manner of administration of the compound, the health and condition of the patient, and the judgment of the prescribing physician. For example, for intravenous ad-ministration, the dose will typically be in the range of about 0.5 mg to about 100 mg per kilogram body weight, preferably about 3 mg to about 50 mg per kilogram body weight. Effective doses can be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems. Typically, the clinician will administer the compound until a dosage is reached that achieves the desired effect.","According to one aspect of the invention, the compounds are administered in combination with methotrexate, to treat, ameliorate, or palliate the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. When administered in combination, the compounds may be administered in the same formulation as the methotrexate, or in a separate formulation. The compounds may be administered prior to, following, or concurrently with the methotrexate such that the benefitsd of the combination therapy are achieved. The calculation of appropriate dosages will be well within the purvue of the skilled artisan. Standard doses of methotrexate for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis range from 2 mg to 20 mg per dose per week. Dosages of the compounds are as set forth above. The methotrexate dosage may be administered as a single dose or as a divided dose. Once a response has been achieved, the dosage may be reduced if possible to the lowest effective dose. The maximum recommended dose is 20 mg\/week. Preferably, methotrexate is administered orally or via injection.","When employed as pharmaceuticals, the compounds of the subject invention are usually administered in the form of pharmaceutical compositions. This invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions, which contain as the active ingredient, one or more of the compounds of the subject invention above, associated with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients. The excipient employed is typically one suitable for administration to human subjects or other mammals. In making the compositions of this-invention, the active ingredient is usually mixed with an excipient, diluted by an excipient or, enclosed within a carrier which can be in the form of a capsule, sachet, paper or other container. When the excipient serves as a diluent, it can be a solid, semi-solid, or liquid material, which acts as a vehicle, carrier or medium for the active ingredient. Thus, the compositions can be in the form of tablets, pills, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosols (as a solid or in a liquid medium), ointments containing, for example, up to 10% by weight of the active compound, soft and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories, sterile injectable solutions, and sterile packaged powders.","In preparing a formulation, it may be necessary to mill the active compound to provide the appropriate particle size prior to combining with the other ingredients. If the active compound is substantially insoluble, it ordinarily is milled to a particle size of less than 200 mesh. If the active compound is substantially water soluble, the particle size is normally adjusted by milling to provide a substantially uniform distribution in the formulation, e.g., about 40 mesh.","Some examples of suitable excipients include lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth, gelatin, calcium silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, sterile water, syrup, and methyl cellulose. The formulations can additionally include: lubricating agents such as talc, magnesium stearate, and mineral oil; wetting agents; emulsifying and suspending agents; preserving agents such as methyl- and propylhydroxy-benzoates; sweetening agents; and flavoring agents. The compositions of the invention can be formulated so as to provide quick, sustained or delayed release of the active ingredient after administration to the patient by employing procedures known in the art.","The quantity of active compound in the pharmaceutical composition and unit dosage form thereof may be varied or adjusted widely depending upon the particular application, the manner or introduction, the potency of the particular compound, and the desired concentration. The term \u201cunit dosage forms\u201d refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient. The concentration of therapeutically active compound may vary from about 1 mg\/ml to 250 g\/ml.","Preferably, the compound can be formulated for parenteral administration in a suitable inert carrier, such as a sterile physiological saline solution. For example, the concentration of compound in the carrier solution is typically between about 1-100 mg\/ml. The dose administered will be determined by route of administration. Preferred routes of administration include parenteral or intravenous administration. A therapeutically effective dose is a dose effective to produce a significant steroid tapering. Preferably, the amount is sufficient to produce a statistically significant amount of steroid tapering in a subject.","Administration of therapeutic agents by intravenous formulation is well known in the pharmaceutical industry. An intravenous formulation should possess certain qualities aside from being just a composition in which the therapeutic agent is soluble. For example, the formulation should promote the overall stability of the active ingredient(s), also, the manufacture of the formulation should be cost effective. All of these factors ultimately determine the overall success and usefulness of an intravenous formulation.","Other accessory additives that may be included in pharmaceutical formulations of compounds of the present invention as follow: solvents: ethanol, glycerol, propylene glycol; stabilizers: EDTA (ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid), citric acid; antimicrobial preservatives: benzyl alcohol, methyl paraben, propyl paraben; buffering agents: citric acid\/sodium citrate, potassium hydrogen tartrate, sodium hydrogen tartrate, acetic acid\/sodium acetate, maleic acid\/sodium maleate, sodium hydrogen phthalate, phosphoric acid\/potassium dihydrogen phosphate, phosphoric acid\/disodium hydrogen phosphate; and tonicity modifiers: sodium chloride, mannitol, dextrose.","The presence of a buffer is necessary to maintain the aqueous pH in the range of from about 4 to about 8 and more preferably in a range of from about 4 to about 6. The buffer system is generally a mixture of a weak acid and a soluble salt thereof, e.g., sodium citrate\/citric acid; or the monocation or dication salt of a dibasic acid, e.g., potassium hydrogen tartrate; sodium hydrogen tartrate, phosphoric acid\/potassium dihydrogen phosphate, and phosphoric acid\/disodium hydrogen phosphate.","The amount of buffer system used is dependent on (1) the desired pH; and (2) the amount of drug. Generally, the amount of buffer used is in a 0.5:1 to 50:1 mole ratio of buffer:alendronate (where the moles of buffer are taken as the combined moles of the buffer ingredients, e.g., sodium citrate and citric acid) of formulation to maintain a pH in-the range of 4 to 8 and generally, a 1:1 to 10:1 mole ratio of buffer (combined) to drug present is used.","A useful buffer in the invention is sodium citrate\/citric acid in the range of 5 to 50 mg per ml. sodium citrate to 1 to 15 mg per ml. citric acid, sufficient to maintain an aqueous pH of 4-6 of the composition.","The buffer agent may also be present to prevent the precipitation of the drug through soluble metal complex formation with dissolved metal ions, e.g., Ca, Mg, Fe, Al, Ba, which may leach out of glass containers or rubber stoppers or be present in ordinary tap water. The agent may act as a competitive complexing agent with the drug and produce a soluble metal complex leading to the presence of undesirable particulates.","In addition, the presence of an agent, e.g., sodium chloride in an amount of about of 1-8 mg\/ml, to adjust the tonicity to the same value of human blood may be required to avoid the swelling or shrinkage of erythrocytes upon administration of the intravenous formulation leading to undesirable side effects such as nausea or diarrhea and possibly to associated blood disorders. In general, the tonicity of the formulation matches that of human blood which is in the range of 282 to 288 mOsm\/kg, and in general is 285 mOsm\/kg, which is equivalent to the osmotic pressure corresponding to a 0.9% solution of sodium chloride.","The intravenous formulation can be administered by direct intravenous injection, i.v. bolus, or can be administered by infusion by addition to an appropriate infusion solution such as 0.9% sodium chloride injection or other compatible infusion solution.","The compositions are preferably formulated in a unit dosage form, each dosage containing from about 5 to about 100 mg, more usually about 10 to about 30 mg, of the active ingredient. The term \u201cunit dosage forms\u201d refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient.","The active compound is effective over a wide dosage range and is generally administered in a pharmaceutically effective amount. It, will be understood, however, that the amount of the compound actually administered will be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, the severity of the patient's symptoms, and the like.","For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical excipient to form a solid preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present invention. When referring to these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, it is meant that the active ingredient is dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition may be readily subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules. This solid preformulation is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above containing from, for example, 0.1 to about 500 mg of the active ingredient of the present invention.","The tablets or pills of the present invention may be coated or otherwise compounded to provide, a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permit the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids and mixtures of polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol, and cellulose acetate.","The liquid forms in which the novel compositions of the present invention may be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include aqueous solutions suitably flavored syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavored emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil, or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles.","Compositions for inhalation or insufflation include solutions and suspensions in pharmaceutically acceptable, aqueous or organic solvents, or mixtures thereof, and powders. The liquid or solid compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients as described supra. Preferably the compositions are administered by the oral or nasal respiratory route for local or systemic-effect. Compositions in preferably pharmaceutically acceptable solvents may be nebulized by use of inert gases. Nebulized solutions may be breathed directly from the nebulizing device or the nebulizing device may be attached to a face masks tent, or intermittent positive pressure breathing machine. Solution, suspension, or powder compositions may be administered, preferably orally or nasally, from devices which deliver the formulation in an appropriate manner.","The compounds of this invention can be administered in a sustained release form. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the protein, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (e.g., poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate) as described by Langer et al., 15: 167-277 (1981) and Langer, 12: 98-105 (1982) or poly(vinyl alcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma ethyl-L-glutamate (Sidman et al., 22: 547-556, 1983), non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate (Langer et al., supra), degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT\u2122 (i.e., injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(\u2212)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (EP 133,988).","The compounds of this invention can be administered in a sustained release form, for example a depot injection, implant preparation, or osmotic pump, which can be formulated in such a manner as to permit a sustained release of the active ingredient. Implants for sustained release formulations are well-known in the art. Implants may be formulated as, including but not limited to, microspheres, slabs, with biodegradable or non-biodegradable polymers. For example, polymers of lactic acid and\/or glycolic acid form an erodible polymer that is well-tolerated-by the host. The implant is placed in proximity to the site of protein deposits (e.g., the site of formation of amyloid deposits associated with neurodegenerative disorders), so that the local concentration of active agent is increased at that site relative to the rest of the body.","The following formulation examples illustrate pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention.","Hard gelatin capsules

Such transdermal patches may be used to provide continuous or discontinuous infusion of the compounds of the present invention in controlled amounts. The construction and use of transdermal patches for the delivery of pharmaceutical agents is well known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,023,252, issued Jun. 11, 1991, herein incorporated by reference. Such patches may be constructed for continuous, pulsatile, or on demand delivery of pharmaceutical agents.","Direct or indirect placement techniques may be used when it is desirable or necessary to introduce the pharmaceutical composition to the brain. Direct techniques usually involve placement of a drug delivery catheter into the host's ventricular system to bypass the blood-brain barrier. One such implantable delivery system used for the transport of biological factors to specific anatomical regions of the body is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,011,472, which is herein incorporated by reference.","Indirect techniques, which are generally preferred, usually involve formulating the compositions to provide for drug latentiation by the conversion of hydrophilic drugs into lipid-soluble drugs. Latentiation is generally achieved through blocking of the hydroxy, carbonyl, sulfate, and primary amine groups present on the drug to render the drug more lipid soluble and amenable to transportation across the blood-brain barrier. Alternatively, the delivery of hydrophilic drugs may be enhanced by intra-arterial infusion of hypertonic solutions which can transiently open the blood-brain barrier.","According to one aspect of the invention, the compound may be administered alone with methotrexate, as a combination of compounds and with methotrexate, or in combination with anti-alpha-4-antibodies and methotrexate. The compounds of the present invention may also be administered in combination with an immunosuppressant, wherein the immunosuppressant is typically used to treat the condition or disease for which the compound of the present invention is being administered.

When administered in combinations, the compounds may be administered prior to, following, or concurrently with the other compounds and methotrexate.","Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are suitable for use in a variety of drug delivery systems. Suitable formulations for use in the present invention are found in , Mace Publishing Company, Philadelphia, Pa., 17th ed. (1985).","In order to enhance serum half-life, the compounds may be encapsulated, introduced into the lumen of liposomes, prepared as a colloid, or other conventional techniques may be employed which provide an extended serum half-life of the compounds. A variety of methods are available for preparing liposomes, as described in, e.g., Szoka et al., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,235,871, 4,501,728 and 4,837,028 each of which is incorporated herein by reference.","Polymer Conjugates","Compounds of the present invention may be formulated and administered as polymer conjugates, preferably PEG derivatives. Polymer conjugates may exhibit benefits over non-conjugated polymers, such as improved solubility and stability.","As such, single polymer molecules may be employed for conjugation with the compounds of the present invention, although it is also contemplated that more than one polymer molecule can be attached as well. The conjugated compounds of the present invention may find utility in both in vivo as well as non-in vivo applications. Additionally, it will be recognized that the conjugating polymer may utilize any other groups, moieties, or other conjugated species, as appropriate to the end use application. By-way of example, it may be useful in some applications to covalently bond to the polymer a functional moiety imparting UV-degradation resistance, or antioxidation, or other properties or characteristics to the polymer. As a further example, it may be advantageous in some applications to functionalize the polymer to render it reactive and enable it to cross-link to a drug molecule and to enhance various properties or characteristics of the overall conjugated material. Accordingly, the polymer may contain any functionality, repeating groups, linkages, or other constitutent structures which do not preclude the efficacy of the conjugated the compounds of the present invention composition for its intended purpose.","Illustrative polymers that may usefully be employed to achieve these desirable characteristics are described supra, as well as in PCT WO 01\/54690 (to Zheng et al.) incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The polymer may be coupled to the compounds of the present invention (preferably via a linker moiety) to form stable bonds that are not significantly cleavable by human enzymes. Generally, for a bond to be not \u201csignificantly\u201d cleavable requires that no more than about 20% of the bonds connecting the polymer and the compounds of the present invention to which the polymer is linked, are cleaved within a 24 hour period, as measured by standard techniques in the art including, but not limited to, high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC).","The compounds of the present inventions are conjugated most preferably via a terminal reactive group on the polymer although conjugations can also be branched from non-terminal reactive groups. The polymer with the reactive group(s) is designated herein as \u201cactivated polymer\u201d. The reactive group selectively reacts with reactive groups on the compounds of the present invention. The activated polymer(s) is reacted so that attachment may occur at any available functional group on compounds of the present invention. Amino, carbon, free carboxylic groups, suitably activated carbonyl groups, hydroxyl, guanidyl, oxidized carbohydrate moieties, amino, carbon and mercapto groups of the compounds of the present invention (if available) can be used as attachment sites.","Generally, about 1.0 to about 10 moles of activated polymer per mole of the compounds of the present invention, depending on concentration, is employed. The final amount is a balance between maximizing the extent of the reaction while minimizing non-specific modifications of the product and, at the same time, defining chemistries that will maintain optimum activity, while at the same time optimizing the half-life of the compounds of the present invention. Preferably, at least about 50% of the biological activity of the compounds of the present invention is retained, and most preferably 100% is retained.","The reactions may take place by any suitable art-recognized method used for reacting biologically active materials with inert polymers. Generally, the process involves preparing an activated polymer and thereafter reacting the compounds of the present invention with the activated polymer to produce a soluble compound suitable for formulation. This modification reaction can be performed by several methods, which may involve one or more steps. The polymeric substances included herein are preferably water-soluble at room temperature. A non-limiting list of such polymers includes polyalkylene oxide homopolymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) or polypropylene glycols, polyoxyethylenated polyols, copolymers thereof and block copolymers thereof, provided that the water solubility of the block copolymers is maintained.","In the preferred practice of the present invention, polyalkylene glycol residues of C-Calkyl polyalkylene glycols, preferably polyethylene glycol (PEG), or poly(oxy)alkylene glycol residues of such glycols are advantageously incorporated in the polymer systems of interest. Thus, the polymer to which the compounds of the present invention are attached may be a homopolymer of polyethylene glycol (PEG) or is a polyoxyethylated polyol, provided in all cases that the polymer is soluble in water at room temperature. Non-limiting examples of such polymers include polyalkylene oxide homopolymers such as PEG or polypropylene glycols, polyoxyethylenated glycols, copolymers thereof and block copolymers thereof, provided that the water solubility of the block copolymer is maintained.","Examples of polyoxyethylated polyols include, but are not limited to, polyoxyethylated glycerol, polyoxyethylated sorbitol, polyoxyethylated glucose, or the like. The glycerol backbone of polyoxyethylated glycerol is the same backbone occurring naturally in, for example, animals and humans in mono-, di-, and triglycerides. Therefore, this branching would not necessarily be seen as a foreign agent in the body.","Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the foregoing list is merely illustrative and that all polymer materials having the qualities described herein are contemplated. The polymer need not have any particular molecular weight, but it is preferred that the molecular weight be between about 300 and 100,000, more preferably between 10,000 and 40,000. In particular, sizes of 20,000 or more are most effective at preventing loss of the product due to filtration in the kidneys.","Polyethylene glycol (PEG)and related polyalkylene oxides (PAOs) are known in the art as being useful adjuncts for the preparation of drugs. See for example, PCT WO 93\/24476. PEG has also been conjugated to proteins, peptides and enzymes to increase aqueous solubility and circulating life in vivo as well as reduce antigenicity. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,298,643 and 5,321,095, both to Greenwald et al. PCT WO 93\/24476 discloses using an ester linkage to covalently bind an organic molecule to water-soluble polyethylene glycols. Thus, the compounds of the invention are preferably administered as polyethylene glycol (PEG) derivatives. Further description of polyethylene glycol derivatives of the compounds of the present invention and reaction conditions for preparing these derivatives are described in U.S. Ser. No. 60\/538,573, entitled \u201cPolyethylene Glycol Conjugates of Dipeptides,\u201d filed Jan. 23, 2004, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","As such, the compounds or conjugates of this invention may contain one or more polyethylene glycol (PEG) substituents covalently attached thereto. Such conjugates demonstrate improved serum half-life, as compared to compounds lacking polyethylene glycol substituents. Without being limited to any theory, the improved serum half-life is believed to be associated with the covalent conjugation of at least one polyethylene glycol entity onto the structure of the compound.","The term \u201cPEG\u201d refers to polymers comprising multiple oxyalkylene units. Such polymers are optionally mono-capped with a substituent preferably selected from alkyl, aryl, substituted alkyl, and substituted aryl. Inclusive of such polymers are those diamino capped polyoxyalkylene polymers which are known in the art as Jeffamines\u00ae. Still further, such polymers can optionally contain one or more non-oxyalkylene units such as the commercially available poly[di(ethylene glycol)adipates, poly[di(ethylene glycol)phthalate diols, and the like.","By PEG derivative is meant a polyethylene glycol polymer in which one or both of the terminal hydroxyl groups found in polyethylene glycol itself has been modified. Examples of suitable modifications include replacing one or both hydroxyl group(s) with alternative functional groups, which may be protected or unprotected, with low molecular weight ligands, or with another macromolecule or polymer. Modification of the terminal hydroxyl groups in the polyethylene glycol may be achieved by reacting the polyethylene glycol with compounds comprising complementary reactive functional groups, including functional groups which are able to undergo a reaction with the hydroxyl groups in polyethylene glycol. The PEG derivatives of the compounds of this invention may contain one or more polyethylene glycol (PEG) substituents covalently attached thereto by a linking group.","\u201cLinking group\u201d or \u201clinker\u201d refers to a group or groups that covalently links a non-PEG substituted compound of the present invention with one or more PEG groups. Each linker may be chiral or achiral, linear, branched or cyclic and may be homogenous or heterogeneous in its atom content (e.g., linkers containing only carbon atoms or linkers containing carbon atoms as well as one or more heteroatoms present on the linker.","The PEG group or groups are covalently attached to the linker using conventional chemical techniques providing for covalent linkage of the PEG group to the linker. The linker, in turn, may be covalently attached to the otherwise, non-PEG substituted compounds of the present invention. Reaction chemistries resulting in such linkages are well known in the art. Such reaction chemistries involve the use of complementary functional groups on the linker, the non-PEG substituted compound of the present invention and the PEG groups. Preferably, the complementary functional groups on the linker are selected relative to the functional groups available on the PEG group for bonding or which can be introduced onto the PEG group for bonding. Again, such complementary functional groups are well known in the art.","Such polymers have a number average molecular weight of from about 100 to 100,000; preferably from about 1,000 to 50,000; more preferably from about 10,000 to about 40,000.","The polymer conjugates of the invention may provide enhanced in vivo retention as compared to the non-conjugated compounds. The improved retention of the conjugate within the body results in lower required dosages of the drug, which in turn results in fewer side effects and reduced likelihood of toxicity. In addition, the drug formulation comprising these polymer conjugates may be administered less frequently to the patient while achieving a similar or improved therapeutic effect. The conjugates of this invention have improved inhibition, in vivo, of adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells mediated by VLA-4 by competitive binding to VLA-4. Preferably, the compounds of this invention can be used in I.V. formulations.","The therapeutic dosage of the polymer conjugates of the present invention will vary according to, for example, the particular use-for which the treatment is made, the manner of administration of the compound, the health and condition of the patient, and the judgment of the prescribing physician. For example, for intravenous administration, the dose will typically be in the range of about 20 \u03bcg to about 2000 \u03bcg per kilogram body weight, preferably about 20 \u03bcg to about 500 \u03bcg, more preferably about 100 \u03bcg to about 300 \u03bcg per kilogram body weight. Suitable dosage ranges for intranasal administration are generally about 0.1 pg to 1 mg per kilogram body weight. Effective doses can be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.","When formulated and administered as polymer conjugates, the compounds or conjugates of this invention are characterized as containing one or more polyethylene glycol substituents covalently attached thereto. Without being limited to any theory, the improved serum half-life is believed to be associated with covalent conjugation of at least one polyethylene glycol entity onto the structure of the compound.","Accordingly, the compounds of the present invention may be PEG derivatives of formula XXII below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0741","num":"2274"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00056","num":"00056"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00056","he":"35.05mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US07605166-20091020-C00056.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"wherein","R is selected from the group consisting of a PEG moiety, amino, substituted amino, alkyl and substituted alkyl wherein each amino, substituted amino, alkyl and substituted alkyl is optionally substituted with a PEG moiety wherein, in each case, the PEG moiety optionally comprises a linker which covalently links the PEG moiety;","Aris selected from the group consisting of aryl, substituted aryl, heteroaryl and substituted heteroaryl wherein each of aryl, substituted aryl, heteroaryl and substituted heteroaryl is optionally substituted with a PEG moiety wherein the PEG moiety optionally comprises a linker which covalently links the PEG moiety to Ar;","Aris selected from the group consisting of aryl, substituted aryl, heteroaryl and substituted heteroaryl wherein each of aryl, substituted aryl, heteroaryl and substituted heteroaryl is optionally substituted with a PEG moiety wherein the PEG moiety optionally comprises a linker which covalently links the PEG moiety to Ar;","X is selected from the group consisting of \u2014S\u2014, \u2014SO\u2014, \u2014SOand optionally substituted \u2014CH\u2014;","Y is selected from the group consisting of-O\u2014 and \u2014NR\u2014 wherein Ris selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and alkyl;","W is selected from the group consisting of a PEG moiety which optionally comprises a linker and \u2014NRRwherein Rand Rare independently selected from the group consisting of alkyl, substituted alkyl, and where Rand R, together with the nitrogen atom bound thereto, form a heterocyclic ring or a substituted heterocyclic ring wherein each of alkyl, substituted alkyl, heterocyclic and substituted heterocyclic is optionally substituted with a PEG moiety which further optionally comprises a linker;","m is an integer equal to 0, 1 or 2;","n is an integer equal to 0 to 2;

The immunoglobulins are preferably antibodies or fragments thereof that bind to an alpha-4 integrin or dimer thereof. Also contemplated herein are immunoglobulin molecules that bind to VCAM-1 in a manner such that they inhibit VCAM-1 interaction with VLA-4. By antibodies is meant to include complete immunoglobulins such as IgG1 or IgM, or inhibitors derived from antibodies, such as Antegren\u2122. Preferably, the immunoglobulins recognize epitopes on VLA-4 and by recognizing and binding to these epitopes, the immunoglobulines inhibit VLA-4 from interacting with VCAM-1.","When the agent of the invention is an antibody, a monoclonal antibody is the preferred antibody. In contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations, which typically include different antibodies directed against different epitopes, each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single epitope on the antigen. A second advantage of monoclonal antibodies is that they are synthesized by means that are uncontaminated by other immunoglobulins, e.g., by phage display or isolation from a hybridoma. Although the present invention intends to encompass both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies as agents of the invention, monoclonal antibodies are preferred as they are highly specific, and the invention is thus discussed primarily in terms of monoclonal antibodies.","\u201cNative antibodies and immunoglobulins\u201d are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150,000 Daltons, composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. Each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the number of disulfide linkages varies between the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain (V) followed by a number of constant domains. Each light chain has a variable domain at one and (V) and a constant domain at its other end; the constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain, and the light chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light and heavy chain variable domains (Clothia et al., 1985, 186: 651-63; Novotny et al., 1985, 82: 4592-6).","In addition, other antibodies can be identified using techniques available in the art.

No N-terminal, C-terminal, or internal extensions, deletions, or insertions into the antibody sequence shall be construed as affecting sequence identity or homology. The variant retains the ability to bind the receptor and preferably has properties that are superior to those of the parent antibody. For example, the variant may have a stronger binding affinity, enhanced ability to activate the receptor, etc. To analyze such properties, one should compare a Fab form of the variant to a Fab form of the parent antibody or a full-length form of the variant to a full-length form of the parent antibody. The variant antibody of particular interest herein is one which displays at least about 10 fold, preferably at least about 20 fold, and most preferably at least about 50 fold, enhancement in biological activity when compared to the parent antibody. The \u201cparent\u201d antibody herein is one that is encoded by an amino acid sequence used for the preparation of the variant. Preferably, the parent antibody has a human framework region and has human antibody constant region(s). For example, the parent antibody may be a humanized or human antibody. An \u201cisolated\u201d antibody is one that has been identified and separated and\/or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials that would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or non-proteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments, the antibody will be purified (1) to greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method, and most preferably more than 99% by weight, (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or non-reducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody-in-situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody's natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated antibodies will be prepared by at least one purification step.","Monoclonal Antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies can also be produced using the conventional hybridoma methods. These methods have been widely applied to produce hybrid cell lines that secrete high levels of monoclonal antibodies against many specific antigens, and can also be used to produce monoclonal antibodies of the present invention. For example, mice (e.g., Balb\/c mice) can be immunized with an antigenic alpha-4 epitope by intraperitoneal injection. After sufficient time has passed to allow for an immune response, the mice are sacrificed and the spleen cells obtained and fused with myeloma cells, using techniques well known in the art. The resulting fused cells, hybridomas, are then grown in a selective medium, and the surviving cells grown in such medium using limiting dilution conditions. After cloning and recloning, hybridomas can be isolated that secrete antibodies (for example, of the IgG or IgM class or IgG1 subclass) that selectively bind to the target, alpha-4 or a dimer comprising an alpha-4 integrin. To produce agents specific for human use, the isolated monoclonal can then be used to produce chimeric and humanized antibodies. Antibodies can also be prepared that are anti-peptide antibodies. Such anti-peptide antibodies would be prepared against peptides of alpha-4 integrin.","Chimeric, Primatized\u00ae and humanized antibodies can be produced from non-human antibodies, and can have the same or similar binding affinity as the antibody from which they are produced. Techniques developed for the production of chimeric antibodies (Morrison et al., 1984 81: 6851; Neuberger et al., 1984 312: 604; Takeda et al., 1985 314: 452) by splicing the genes from a mouse antibody molecule of appropriate antigen specificity together with genes from, for example, a human antibody molecule of appropriate biological activity can be used; such antibodies are within the scope of this invention. For example, a nucleic acid encoding a variable (V) region of a mouse monoclonal antibody can be joined to a nucleic acid encoding a human constant (C) region, e.g., IgG1 or IgG4. The resulting antibody is thus a species hybrid, generally with the antigen binding domain from the non-human antibody and the C or effector domain from a human antibody.","Humanized antibodies are antibodies with variable regions that are primarily from a human antibody (the acceptor antibody), but which have complementarity determining regions substantially from a non-human antibody (the donor antibody). See, e.g., Queen et al., 1989 86: 10029-33; WO 90\/07861; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,054,297; 5,693,761; 5,585,089; 5,530,101 and 5,224,539. The constant region or regions of these antibodies are generally also from a human antibody. The human variable domains are typically chosen from human antibodies having sequences displaying a high homology with the desired non-human variable region binding domains. The heavy and light chain variable residues can be derived from the same antibody, or a different human antibody. In addition, the sequences can be chosen as a consensus of several human antibodies, such as described in WO 92\/22653.","Specific amino acids within the human variable region are selected for substitution based on the predicted conformation and antigen binding properties. This can be determined using techniques such as computer modeling, prediction of the behavior and binding properties of amino acids at certain locations within the variable region, and observation of effects of substitution. For example, when an amino acid differs between a non-human variable region and a human variable region, the human variable region can be altered to reflect the amino acid composition of the non-human variable region.","In a specific embodiment, the antibodies used in the chronic dosage regime of the present invention are humanized antibodies as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,840,299, which is incorporated herein by reference.","In another embodiment, transgenic mice containing human antibody genes can be immunized with an antigenic alpha-4 structure and hybridoma technology can be used to generate human antibodies that selectively bind to alpha-4.","Chimeric, human and\/or humanized antibodies can be produced by recombinant expression, e.g., expression in human hybridomas (Cole et al., , Alan R. Liss, p. 77 (1985)), in myeloma cells or in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. Alternatively, antibody-coding sequences can be incorporated into vectors suitable for introducing into the genome of animal thereby producing a transgenic animal. One example would be to produce such antibodies in the milk of a transgenic animal such as a bovine. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,849,992 and 5,304,489. Suitable transgenes include trangenes having a promoter and\/or enhancer from a mammary gland specific gene, for example casein or \u03b2-lactoglobulin.","Natalizumab And Related Humanized Antibodies","The invention provides for a method of using humanized immunoglobulins that specifically bind to a VLA-4 ligand either alone or in combination to diagnose and\/or treat rheumatoid arthritis. One preferred antibody for use in such methods of treatment and in medicaments includes that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,840,299 assigned to Elan Pharmaceuticals, which is herein incorporated in its entirety. Another aspect contemplates the use of fragments of these antibodies as assessed in vivo.","The humanized antibodies comprise a humanized light chain and a humanized heavy chain. In one aspect, the humanized light chain can comprise three complementarity determining regions (i.e., CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3) having amino acid sequences from the corresponding complementarity determining regions of a mouse 21-6 immunoglobulin light chain, and a variable region framework from a human kappa light chain variable region framework sequence except in at least one position selected from a first group consisting of positions L45, L49, L58 and L69, wherein the amino acid position is occupied by the same amino acid present in the equivalent position of the mouse 21.6 immunoglobulin light chain variable region framework.","The humanized heavy chain comprises three complementarity determining regions (i.e., CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3) having amino acid sequences from the corresponding complementarity determining regions of a mouse 21-6 immunoglobulin heavy chain, and a variable region framework from a human heavy chain variable region framework sequence except in at least one position selected from a group consisting of H27, H28, H29, H30, H44, H71, wherein the amino acid position is occupied by the same amino acid present in the equivalent position of the mouse 21-6 immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region framework. The immunoglobulins specifically bind to VLA-4 with an affinity having a lower limit of about 10Mand an upper limit of about five times the affinity of the mouse 21-6 immunoglobulin.","Usually, the humanized light and heavy chain variable region frameworks are from RE1 and 21\/28\u2032CL variable region framework sequences respectively. When the humanized light chain variable region framework is from RE1, at least two framework amino acids are replaced. One amino acid is from the first group of positions described supra. The other amino acids are from a third-group-consisting of positions L104, L105 and L107. This position is occupied by the same amino acid present in the equivalent position of a kappa light chain from a human immunoglobulin other than RE1.","Some humanized immunoglobulins have a mature light chain variable region sequence designated La or Lb, or a mature heavy chain variable region sequence designated Ha, Hb or Hc (). Preferred humanized immunoglobulins include those having a La light chain and an Ha, Hb or Hc heavy chain.","The humanized immunoglobulins have variable framework regions substantially from a human immunoglobulin (termed an acceptor immunoglobulin) and complementarity determining regions substantially from a mouse immunoglobulin termed mu MAb 21.6 (referred to as the donor immunoglobulin). The constant region(s), if present, are also substantially from a human immunoglobulin. The humanized antibodies exhibit a specific binding affinity for VLA-4 of at least 10, 10, or 10M. Usually the upper limit of binding affinity of the humanized antibodies for VLA-4 is within a factor of three or five of that of mu MAb 21.6 (about 10M). Often the lower limit of binding affinity is also within a factor of three or five of that of mu MAb 21.6.","Humanized antibodies can be produced as exemplified, for example, with the mouse MAb 21.6 monoclonal antibody. The starting material for production of humanized antibodies is mu MAb 21.6. The isolation and properties of this antibody are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,033,655 (assigned to Elan Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Briefly, mu MAb 21.6 is specific for the \u03b1subunit of VLA-4 and has been shown to inhibit human lymphocyte binding to tissue cultures of rat brain cells stimulated with tumor necrosis factor. From N-terminal to C-terminal, both light and heavy chains comprise the domains FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3 and FR4. The assignment of amino acids to each domain is in accordance with the numbering convention of Kabat.","The next step involved selecting human antibodies to supply framework residues. The substitution of mouse CDRs into a human variable domain framework is most likely to result in retention of their correct spatial orientation if the human variable domain framework adopts the same or similar conformation to the mouse variable framework from which the CDRs originated. This is achieved by obtaining the human variable domains from human antibodies whose framework sequences exhibit a high degree of sequence identity with the murine variable framework domains from which the CDRs were derived. The heavy and light chain variable framework regions can be derived from the same or different human antibody sequences. The human antibody sequences can be the sequences of naturally occurring human antibodies or can be consensus sequences of several human antibodies. See Kettleborough et al., 4: 773 (1991); Kolbinger et al., 6: 971 (1993).","Suitable human antibody sequences are identified by computer comparisons of the amino acid sequences of the mouse variable regions with the sequences of known human antibodies. The comparison is performed separately for heavy and light chains but the principles are similar for each. This comparison reveals that the mu 21.6 light chain shows greatest sequence identity to human light chains of subtype kappa 1; the mu 21.6 heavy chain shows greatest sequence identity to human heavy chains of subtype one, as defined by Kabat, supra. Thus, light and heavy human framework regions are usually derived from human antibodies of these subtypes, or from consensus sequences of such subtypes. The preferred light and heavy chain human variable regions showing greatest sequence identity to the corresponding regions from mu MAb 21.6 are from antibodies RE1 and 21\/28\u2032CL respectively.","Computer modeling can then be used to further enhance the humanized antibody's ability to bind to its cognate antigen. The unnatural juxtaposition of murine CDR regions with human variable framework region can result in unnatural conformational restraints, which, unless corrected by substitution of certain amino acid residues, lead to loss of binding affinity. The selection of amino acid residues for substitution is determined, in part, by computer modeling. Computer hardware and software for producing three-dimensional images of immunoglobulin molecules are widely available. In general, molecular models are produced starting from solved structures for immunoglobulin chains or domains thereof. The chains to be modeled are compared for amino acid sequence similarity with chains or domains of solved three dimensional structures, and the chains or domains showing the greatest sequence similarity is\/are selected as starting points for construction of the molecular model. For example, for the light chain of mu MAb 21.6, the starting point for modeling the framework regions, CDR1 and CDR2 regions, was the human light chain RE1. For the CDR3 region, the starting point was the CDR3 region from the light chain of a different human antibody HyHEL-5. The solved starting structures are modified to allow for differences between the actual amino acids in the immunoglobulin chains or domains being modeled, and those in the starting structure. The modified structures are then assembled into a composite immunoglobulin. Finally, the model is refined by energy minimization and by verifying that all atoms are within appropriate distances from one another and that bond lengths and angles are within chemically acceptable limits.","As-noted supra, the humanized antibodies of the invention comprise variable framework regions substantially from a human immunoglobulin and complementarity determining regions substantially from a mouse immunoglobulin termed mu MAb 21.6. Having identified the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of mu MAb 21.6 and appropriate human acceptor immunoglobulins, the next step is to determine which, if any, residues from these components should be substituted to optimize the properties of the resulting humanized antibody. In general, substitution of human amino acid residues with murine should be minimized, because introduction of murine residues increases the risk of the antibody eliciting a HAMA response in humans. Amino acids are selected for substitution based on their possible influence on CDR conformation and\/or binding to antigen. Investigation of such possible influences is by modeling, examination of the characteristics of the amino acids at particular locations, or empirical observation of the effects of substitution or mutagenesis of particular amino acids.","When an amino acid differs between a mu MAb 21.6 variable framework region and an equivalent human variable framework region, the human framework amino acid should usually be substituted by the equivalent mouse amino acid if it is reasonably expected that the amino acid:\n\n","Other candidates for substitution are acceptor human framework amino acids that are unusual for a human immunoglobulin at that position (e.g., amino acids at positions L104, L105 and L107 of mu MAb 21.6). These amino acids can be substituted with amino acids from the equivalent position of more typical human immunoglobulins. Alternatively, amino acids from equivalent positions in the mouse MAb 21.6 can be introduced into the human framework regions when such amino acids are typical of human immunoglobulin at the equivalent positions.","In general, substitution of all or most of the amino acids fulfilling the above criteria is desirable. Occasionally, however, there is some ambiguity about whether a particular amino acid meets the above criteria, and alternative variant immunoglobulins are produced, one of which has that particular substitution, the other of which does not. The humanized antibodies will usually contain a substitution of a human light chain framework residue with a corresponding mu MAb 21.6 residue in at least 1, 2 or 3, and more usually 4, of the following positions: L45, L49, L58 and L69. The humanized antibodies also usually contain a substitution of a human heavy chain framework residue in at least 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, and sometimes 6, of the following positions: H27, H28, H29, H30, H44 and H71. Optionally, H36 may also be substituted. In preferred embodiments when the human light chain acceptor immunoglobulin is RE1, the light chain also contains substitutions in at least 1 or 2, and more usually 3, of the following positions: L104, L105 and L107. These positions are substituted with the amino acid from the equivalent position of a human immunoglobulin having a more typical amino acid residues. Appropriate amino acids to substitute are shown in .","Usually the CDR regions in humanized antibodies are substantially identical, and more usually, identical to the corresponding CDR regions in the mu MAb 21.6 antibody. Occasionally, however, it is desirable to change one of the residues in a CDR region. For example, Example 4 identifies an amino acid similarity between the mu MAb 21.6 CDR3 and the VCAM-1 ligand. This observation suggests that the binding affinity of humanized antibodies might be improved by redesigning the heavy chain CDR3 region to resemble VCAM-1 even more closely. Accordingly, one or more amino acids from the CDR3 domain can be substituted with amino acids from the VCAM-1 binding domain. Although not usually desirable, it is sometimes possible to make one or more conservative amino acid substitutions of CDR residues without appreciably affecting the binding affinity of the resulting humanized immunoglobulin.","Other than for the specific amino acid substitutions discussed above, the framework regions of humanized immunoglobulins are usually substantially identical, and more usually, identical to the framework regions of the human antibodies from which they were derived. Of course, many of the amino acids in the framework region make little or no direct contribution to the specificity or affinity of an antibody. Thus, many individual conservative substitutions of framework residues can be tolerated without appreciable change of the specificity or affinity of the resulting humanized immunoglobulin. However, in general, such substitutions are undesirable.","Production of Variable Regions.","Having conceptually selected the CDR and framework components of humanized immunoglobulins, a variety of methods are available for producing such immunoglobulins. Because of the degeneracy of the code, a variety of nucleic acid sequences will encode each immunoglobulin amino acid sequence. The desired nucleic acid sequences can be produced by de novo solid-phase DNA synthesis or by PCR mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant of the desired polynucleotide. Oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis is a preferred method for preparing substitution, deletion and insertion variants of target polypeptide DNA. See Adelman et al., 2: 183 (1983). Briefly, the target polypeptide DNA is altered by hybridizing an oligonucleotide encoding the desired mutation to a single-stranded DNA template. After hybridization, a DNA polymerase is used to synthesize an entire second complementary strand of the template that incorporates the oligonucleotide primer, and encodes the selected alteration in the target polypeptide DNA.","Selection of Constant Region.","The variable segments of humanized antibodies produced as described supra are typically linked to at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. Human constant region DNA sequences can be isolated in accordance with well-known procedures from a variety of human cells, but preferably immortalized B-cells (see Kabat et al., supra, and WO 87\/02671) (each of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety). Ordinarily, the antibody will contain both light chain and heavy chain constant regions. The heavy chain constant region usually includes CH1, hinge, CH2, CH3, and CH4 regions.","The humanized antibodies include antibodies having all types of constant regions, including IgM, IgG, IgD, IgA and IgE, and any isotype, including IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4. When it is desired that the humanized antibody exhibit cytotoxic activity, the constant domain is usually a complement-fixing constant domain and the class is typically IgG, When such cytotoxic activity is not desirable, the constant domain may be of the IgGclass. The humanized antibody may comprise sequences from more than one class or isotype.","Other Anti-VLA-4 Antibodies","Other anti-VLA-4 antibodies include but are not limited to HP1\/2, HP-2\/1, HP2\/4, L25, and P4C2. These antibodies may also be administered in an effective amount to diagnose and\/or treat imflammatory bowel conditions as one skilled in the art as discussed herein and as generally known in the art would readily appreciate.","Frequently, monoclonal antibodies created in mice are later humanized to avoid the human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) immune response in a human subject injected with a mouse antibody. This occurs by CDR grafting or reshaping. Thus, typically the antibodies are first mouse monoclonal antibodies that through CDR grafting or reshaping become humanized, as discussed above for the 21.6 antibody.","Specifically, the humanized antibodies have specificity for VLA-4 and have the ability to diagnose and\/or treat imflammatory bowel conditions. These antibodies are derived from sources (e.g., mouse typically) that at least one or more of the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of the variable domains are derived from a donor non-human anti-VLA-4 antibody, and in which there may or may not have been minimal alteration of the acceptor antibody heavy and\/or light variable framework region in order to retain donor antibody binding specificity. Preferably, the antigen binding regions of the CDR-grafted heavy chain variable domain comprise the CDRs corresponding to positions 31-35 (CDR1), 50-65 (CDR2) and 95-102 (CDR3). In a preferred embodiment, the heavy chain further includes non-human residues at framework positions 27-30 (Kabat numbering). The heavy chain can further include non-human residues at framework position 75 (Kabat numbering). The heavy chain can further include non-human residues at framework position(s) 77-79 or 66-67 and 69-71 or 84-85 or 38 and 40 or 24 (Kabat numbering). Preferably, the antigen binding regions of the CDR-grafted light chain variable domain comprise CDRs corresponding to positions 24-34 (CDR1), 50-56 (CDR2) and 89-97 (CDR3). In a preferred embodiment, the light chain further includes non-human residues at framework-positions 60- and 67 (Kabat numbering). These residue designations are numbered according to the Kabat numbering (Kabat et al., 5ed. 4 vol. SPII, U.S. Department of Health Human Services, NIH, USA (1991)).","Synthesis and Humanization of Mouse Antibody HP1\/2. HP1\/2 is another antibody that is directed against VLA-4.

regarding how each of these light and heavy chain sequences were prepared are provided in U.S. Pat. No. 6,602,503, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all puposes. Various combinations of the above light and heavy chains can be prepared based on computer modeling as known in the art.","Additional antibodies that recognize and bind to \u03b1integrin are known in the art. These include but are not limited to GG5\/3 (Keszthelyi et al., 47(4): 1053-1059 (1996)), FW3-218-1 (ATCC No.: HB-261; an IgG2b antibody against sheep \u03b14 integrin), and R1-2 (ATCC No.: HB-227; IgG2b antibody developed in ). Whether the antibodies are developed in mouse or other animals, each of the sequences can be genetically engineered such that they are humanized based on what is known in the art and with the aid of computer modeling. The anti-\u03b14 integrin humanized antibodies can then be assessed for their ability-to diagnose and\/or treat imflammatory bowel conditions on the in vitro and in vivo assays disclosed herein.","Antibody Fragments. Also contemplated for use in treating rheumatoid arthritis are antibody fragments of antibodies that bind to anti-alpha4 or VCAM-1 such that they inhibit VLA-4 and VCAM-1 interaction. Antibody fragments include Fab, F(ab\u2032), scFv and Fv fragments which can be used in the compositions disclosed herein.","The term \u201cFab fragment\u201d as used herein refers to a partial antibody molecule containing a single antigen-binding region, which consists of a portion of both the heavy and light chains of the molecule.","The term \u201cF(ab\u2032)fragment\u201d as used herein refers to a partial antibody molecule containing both antigen binding regions, and which consists of the light chains and a portion of the heavy chains of the molecule.","The term \u201cFv fragment\u201d as used herein refers to the portion of the antibody molecule involved in antigen recognition and binding.","The term \u201cscFv\u201d as used herein refers to single chain Fv (scFv) fragments. These scFv fragments are recombinant antibody derivatives that consist only of the variable domains of antibody heavy and light chains connected by a flexible linker. scFv antibody fragments comprise the Vand Vdomains of antibody, wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Generally, the Fv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the Vand Vdomains which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of scFv see Pluckthun in , vol. 113, 269-315 (Rosenburg and Moore eds., Springer-Verlag, New York 1994).","Also included in antibody fragments are diabodies. The term \u201cdiabodies\u201d refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain (V) connected to a light chain variable domain (V) in the same polypeptide chain (V-V). By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in, for example, EP 404,097; WO 93\/11161; and Hollinger et al., 1993 90: 6444-8.","Antibody fragments also include linear antibodies. The expression \u201clinear antibodies\u201d when used throughout this application refers to the antibodies described in, e.g., Zapata et al., 1995 8(10): 1057-62. Briefly, these antibodies comprise a pair of tandem Fd segments (V-C1-V-C1), which form a pair of antigen binding regions. Linear antibodies can be bispecific or monospecific.","Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen binding fragments, called \u201cFab\u201d fragments, each with a single antigen binding site, and a residual \u201cFc\u201d fragment, whose name reflects its ability to crystallize readily. Pepsin treatment yields an F(ab\u2032)fragment that has two antigen combining sites and is still capable of cross-linking antigen.","Antibody Purification. When using recombinant techniques, the antibody can be produced intracellularly, in the periplasmic space, or directly secreted into the medium. If the antibody is produced intracellularly, as a first step, the particulate debris, either host cells or lysed fragments, is removed, for example, by centrifugation or ultrafiltration. Carter et al., 10: 163-7 (1992) describe a procedure for isolating antibodies, which are secreted to the periplasmic space of . Briefly, cell paste is thawed in the presence of sodium acetate (pH 3.5), EDTA, and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF) over about 30 min. Cell debris can be removed by centrifugation. In instances when the antibody is secreted into the medium, supernatants from such expression systems are generally first concentrated using a commercially available protein concentration filter, for example, an Amicon or Millipore Pellicon ultrafiltration unit. A protease inhibitor such as PMSF may be included in any of the foregoing steps to inhibit proteolysis and antibiotics may be included to prevent the growth of adventitious contaminants.","The antibody composition prepared from the cells is preferably subjected to at least one purification step prior to LPHIC. Examples of suitable purification steps include hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, and affinity chromatography, with affinity chromatography being the preferred purification technique. The suitability of protein A as an affinity ligand depends on the species and isotype of any immunoglobulin Fc domain that is present in the antibody. Protein A can be used to purify antibodies that are based on human \u03b31, \u03b32, or \u03b34 heavy chains (Lindmark et al., 1983 62: 1-13). Protein G is recommended for all mouse isotypes and for human \u03b33 (Guss et al., 1986 5: 1567-75). The matrix to which the affinity ligand is attached is most often agarose, but other matrices are available. Mechanically stable matrices such as controlled pore glass or poly(styrenedivinyl)benzene allow for faster flow rates and shorter processing times than can be achieved with agarose. Where the antibody comprises a C3 domain, the Bakerbond ABX\u2122 resin (J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, N.J.) is useful for purification. Other techniques for protein purification such as fractionation on an ion-exchange column, ethanol precipitation, Reverse Phase HPLC, chromatography on silica, chromatography on heparin SEPHAROSE\u2122, chromatography on an anion or cation exchange resin-(such as a polyaspartic acid column), chromatofocusing, SDS-PAGE, and ammonium sulfate precipitation are also available depending on the antibody to be recovered.","Following any preliminary purification step(s), the mixture comprising the antibody of interest and contaminant(s) is subjected to LPHIC. Often, the antibody composition to be purified will be present in a buffer from the previous purification step. However, it may be necessary to add a buffer to the antibody composition prior to the LPHIC step. Many buffers are available and can be selected by routine experimentation. The pH of the mixture comprising the antibody to be purified and at least one contaminant in a loading buffer is adjusted to a pH of about 2.5-4.5 using either an acid or base, depending on the starting pH. Preferably, the loading buffer has a low salt concentration (i.e., less than about 0.25 M salt).","The mixture is loaded on the HIC column. HIC columns normally comprise a base matrix (e.g., cross-linked agarose or synthetic copolymer material) to which hydrophobic ligands (e.g., alkyl or aryl groups) are coupled. A preferred HIC column comprises an agarose resin substituted with phenyl groups (e.g., a Phenyl SEPHAROSE\u2122 column). Many HIC columns are available commercially. Examples include, but are not limited to, Phenyl SEPHAROSE 6 FAST FLOW\u2122 column with low or high substitution (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology, AB, Sweden); Phenyl SEPHAROSE\u2122 High Performance column (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology, AB, Sweden); Octyl SEPHAROSE\u2122 High Performance column (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology, AB, Sweden); FRACTOGEL\u2122 EMD Propyl or FRACTOGEL\u2122 EMD Phenyl columns (E. Merck, Germany); MACRO\u2014PREP\u2122 Methyl or MACRO-PREP\u2122 t-Butyl Supports (Bio-Rad, California); WP HI-Propyl (C)\u2122 column (J. T. Baker, New Jersey); and TOYOPEARL\u2122 ether, phenyl or butyl columns (TosoHaas, PA).","The antibody is eluted from the column using an elution buffer, which is normally the same as the loading buffer. The elution buffer can be selected using routine experimentation. The pH of the elution buffer is between about 2.5-4.5 and has a low salt concentration (i.e., less than about 0.25 M salt). It has been discovered that it is not necessary to use a salt gradient to elute the antibody of interest; the desired product is recovered in the flow through fraction, which does not bind significantly to the column.","The LPHIC step provides a way to remove a correctly folded and disulfide bonded antibody from unwanted contaminants (e.g., incorrectly associated light and heavy fragments). In particular, the method provides a means to substantially remove an impurity characterized herein as a correctly folded antibody fragment whose light- and -heavy chains fail to associate through disulfide bonding.","Diagnostic or therapeutic formulations of the purified protein can be made by providing the antibody composition in the form of a physiologically acceptable carrier, examples of which are provided below.","To remove contaminants (e.g., unfolded antibody and incorrectly associated light and heavy fragments) from the HIC column so that it can be re-used, a composition including urea (e.g., 6.0 M urea, 1% MES buffer pH 6.0, 4 mM ammonium sulfate) can be flowed through the column. Other methods are known in the art.","Immunoglobulin Formulations. Antibodies and immunoglobulins having the desired therapeutic effect may be administered in a physiologically acceptable carrier to a subject. The antibodies may be administered in a variety of ways including but not limited to parenteral administration, including subcutaneous, subdural, intravenous, intramuscular, intrathecal, intraperitoneal, intracerebral, intraarterial, or intralesional routes of administration, localized (e.g., surgical application or surgical suppository), and pulmonary (e.g., aerosols, inhalation, or powder).","Depending upon the manner of introduction, the immunglobulins may be formulated in a variety of ways. The concentration of therapeutically active immunoglobulin in the formulation (i.e., a formulation sufficient to inhibit rheumatoid arthritis) may vary from about 1 mg\/ml to 1 g\/ml. Preferably, the immunoglobulin composition, when administered to a subject in need thereof, reaches a blood level of immunoglobulin in the subject of about 10 ng\/ml or more.","Preferably, the immunoglobulin is formulated for parenteral administration in a suitable inert carrier, such as a sterile physiological saline solution. For example, the concentration of immunoglobulin in the carrier solution is typically between about 1-100 mg\/ml. The dose administered will be determined by route of administration. Preferred routes of administration include parenteral or intravenous administration.","According to one aspect of the invention, the immunoglobulins are administered in combination with methotrexate, to treat, ameliorate, or palliate the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. When administered in combination, the immunoglobulins may be administered in the same formulation as the methotrexate, or in a separate formulation. The compounds may be administered prior to, following, or concurrently with the methotrexate such that the benefitsd of the combination therapy are achieved. The calculation of appropriate dosages will be well within the purvue of the skilled artisan. Standard doses of methotrexate for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis range from 2 mg to 20 mg per dose per week. Dosages of the compounds are as set forth above. The methotrexate dosage may be administered as a single dose or as a divided dose. Once a response has been achieved, the dosage may be reduced if possible to the lowest effective dose. The maximum recommended dose is 20 mg\/week. Preferably, methotrexate is administered orally or via injection.","According to an important feature of the invention, an immunoglobulin that recognizes and binds to VLA-4 may be administered alone, or in combination with an anti-inflammatory agent, which is typically used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Administration of anti-inflammatory agents can occur prior to, concurrent with or after administration with the immunoglobulin.","A therapeutically effective amount of an anti-alpha-4 integrin antibody or immunoglobulin, e.g., Antegren\u2122 (also known as natalizumab), can be estimated by comparison with established effective doses for known antibodies, taken together with data obtained for Antegren\u2122 in both in vivo and in vitro models. As is known in the art, adjustments in the dose may be necessary due to immunoglobulin degeneration or metabolism, systemic versus localized delivery, as well as the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, drug interactions and the severity of the condition of the subject to whom the immunoglobulin is administered. Such adjustments may be made and appropriate doses determined by one of skill in the art through routine experimentation.","Therapeutic formulations of the immunoglobulin are prepared for storage by mixing the immunoglobulin having the desired degree of purity with optional physiologically acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers (16ed., A. Osol, Ed., 1980 and more recent editions), in the form of lyophilized cake or aqueous solutions. Acceptable immunoglobulin carriers, excipients or stabilizers are nontoxic, nontherapeutic and\/or nonimmunogenic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid; low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, arginine or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol; salt-forming counterions such as sodium; and\/or nonionic surfactants such as Tween, Pluronics or polyethylene glycol (PEG). Specific examples of carrier molecules include but are not limited to glycosaminoglycans (e.g., heparin sulfate), hyaluronic acid, keratan-sulfate, chondroitin 4-sulfate, chondroitin 6-sulfate, heparan sulfate and dermatin sulfate, perlecan and pentopolysulfate.","Pharmaceutical compositions comprising immunoglobulins can also include if desired, pharmaceutically acceptable, non-toxic carriers or diluents, which are vehicles commonly used to formulated pharmaceutical compositions for animal or human administration. The diluent is selected so as not to affect the biological activity of the combination. Examples include but are not limited to distilled water, physiological phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solutions, dextrose solution, and Hank's solution.","The agents of the invention can be formulated into preparations for injections by dissolving, suspending or emulsifying them in an aqueous or nonaqueous solvent, such as vegetable or other similar oils, synthetic aliphatic acid glycerides, esters of higher aliphatic acids or propylene glycol. The formulations may also contain conventional additives, such as solubilizers, isotonic agents, suspending agents, emulsifying agents, stabilizers and preservatives.","The immunoglobulins may also be utilized in aerosol formulation to be administered via inhalation or pulmonary delivery. The agents of the present invention can be formulated into pressurized acceptable propellants such as dichlorodifluoromethane, propane, nitrogen and the like.","The immunoglobulin also may be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization (e.g., hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules and poly-methylmethacylate microcapsules), in colloidal drug delivery systems (e.g., liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules), or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in , supra.","The immunglobulin to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes, prior to or following lyophilization and reconstitution. The immunglobulin ordinarily will be stored in lyophilized form or in solution.","Therapeutic immunglobulin compositions generally are placed into a container having a sterile access port, for example, an intravenous solution bag or vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle or similar sharp instrument.","Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the protein, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (e.g., poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate) as described by Langer et al., 15: 167-277 (1981) and Langer, 12: 98-105 (1982) or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma ethyl-L-glutamate (Sidman et al., 22: 547-556, 1983), non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate (Langer et al., supra), degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT\u2122 (i.e., injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(\u2212)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (EP 133,988).","While polymers such as ethylene-vinyl acetate and lactic acid-glycolic acid enable release of molecules for over 100 days, certain hydrogels release proteins for shorter time periods. When encapsulated antibodies remain in the body for a long time, they may denature or aggregate as a result of exposure to moisture at 37\u00b0 C., resulting in a loss of biological activity and possible changes in immunogenicity. Rational strategies can be devised for immunglobulin stabilization depending on the mechanism involved. For example, if the aggregation mechanism is discovered to be intermolecular S-S bond formation through thio-disulfide interchange, stabilization may be achieved by modifying sulfhydryl residues, lyophilizing from acidic solutions, controlling moisture content, using appropriate additives, developing specific polymer matrix compositions, and the like.","Sustained-release immunglobulin compositions also include liposomally entrapped immunglobulin. Liposomes containing the immunglobulin are prepared by methods known per se. See, e.g., Epstein et al., 82: 3688-92 (1985); Hwang et al., 77: 4030-4 (1980); U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,485,045; 4,544,545; 6,139,869; and 6,027,726. Ordinarily, the liposomes are of the small (about 200 to about 800 Angstroms), unilamellar type in which the lipid content is greater than about 30 mole percent (mol. %) cholesterol; the selected proportion being adjusted for the optimal immunglobulin therapy.","The immunoglobulins of this invention can be administered in a sustained release form, for example a depot injection, implant preparation, or osmotic pump, which can be formulated in such a manner as to permit a sustained release of the active ingredient. Implants for sustained release formulations are well-known in the art. Implants are formulated as microspheres, slabs, etc. with biodegradable or non-biodegradable polymers. For example, polymers of lactic acid and\/or glycolic acid form an erodible polymer that is well-tolerated by the host. The implant is placed in proximity to the site of protein deposits (e.g., the site of formation of amyloid deposits associated with neurodegenerative disorders), so that the local concentration of active agent is increased at that site relative to the rest of the body.","In addition, immunoglobulins which prevent RA may be provided by administering a polynucleotide encoding a whole or partial antibody (e.g., a single chain Fv) to a subject. The polynucleotide is administered to a subject in an appropriate vehicle to allow the expression of the immunoglobulin in the subject in a therapeutically effective amount.","Certain agents of the invention, including antibodies and peptides, are sometimes administered in combination with an adjuvant. A variety of adjuvants can be used in combination with an anti alpha-4 agent to elicit an immune response. Preferred adjuvants augment the intrinsic response to an agent without causing conformational changes in the agent that affect the qualitative form of the response. Preferred adjuvants include aluminum hydroxide and aluminum phosphate, 3 De-O-acylated monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL\u2122) (see GB 2220211 (RIBI ImmunoChem Research Inc., Hamilton, Mont., now part of Corixa). Stimulon\u2122 QS-21 is a triterpene glycoside or saponin isolated from the bark of the Quillaja Saponaria Molina tree found in South America (see Kensil et al., in (eds. Powell & Newman, Plenum Press, NY, 1995); U.S. Pat. No. 5,057,540), (Aquila BioPharmaceuticals, Framingham, Mass.). Other adjuvants are oil in water emulsions (such as squalene or peanut oil), optionally in combination with immune stimulants, such as monophosphoryl lipid A (see Stoute et al., 1997 336: 86-91). Another adjuvant is CpG (WO 98\/40100). Alternatively, an agent can be coupled to an adjuvant. However, such coupling should not substantially change the conformation of the desired alpha-4 epitope so as to affect the nature of the host immune response. Adjuvants can be administered as a component of a therapeutic composition with an active agent or can be administered separately, before, concurrently with, or after administration of the therapeutic agent.","A preferred class of adjuvants for administration is aluminum salts (alum), such as aluminum hydroxide, aluminum phosphate, aluminum sulfate. Such adjuvants can be used with or without other specific immunostimulating agents such as MPL or 3-DMP, QS-21, polymeric or monomeric amino acids such as polyglutamic acid or polylysine. Another class of adjuvants is oil-in-water emulsion formulations. Such adjuvants can be used with or without other specific immunostimulating agents such as muramyl peptides (e.g., N-acetylmuramyl-L-threonyl-D-isoglutamine (thr-MDP), N-acetyl-normuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine (nor-MDP), N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutaminyl-L-alanine-2-(1\u2032-2\u2032dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-hydroxyphosphoryloxy)-ethylamine (MTP-PE), N-acetylglucsaminyl-N-acetylmuramyl-L-Al-D-isoglu-L-Ala-dipalmitoxy propylamide (DTP-DPP) theramide\u2122, or other bacterial cell wall components. Oil-in-water emulsions include (a) MF59 (WO 90\/14837), containing 5% Squalene, 0.5% Tween 80, and 0.5% Span 85 (optionally containing various amounts of MTP-PE) formulated into submicron particles using a microfluidizer such as Model 110Y microfluidizer (Microfluidics, Newton Mass.), (b) SAF, containing 10% Squalene, 0.4% Tween 80, 5% pluronic-blocked polymer L121, and thr-MDP, either microfluidized into a submicron emulsion or vortexed to generate a larger particle size emulsion, and (c) Ribi\u2122 adjuvant system (RAS), (Ribi Immunochem, Hamilton, Mont.) containing 2% squalene, 0.2% Tween 80, and one or more bacterial cell wall components from the group consisting of monophosphoryl lipid A, trehalose dimycolate (TDM), and cell wall skeleton (CWS), preferably MPL+CWS (Detox\u2122). Another class of preferred adjuvants is saponin adjuvants, such as Stimulon\u2122 (QS-21; Aquila, Framingham, Mass.) or particles generated therefrom such as ISCOMs (immunostimulating complexes) and ISCOMATRIX. Other adjuvants include Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant (IFA), cytokines, such as interleukins (e.g., IL-1, IL-2, and IL-12), macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Such adjuvants are generally available from commercial sources.","An adjuvant can be administered with an agent as a single composition, or can be administered before, concurrent with or after administration of the agent. The agent and an adjuvant can be packaged and supplied in the same vial or can be packaged in separate vials and mixed before use. The agent and adjuvant are typically packaged with a label indicating the intended therapeutic application. If the agent and adjuvant are packaged separately, the packaging typically includes instructions for mixing before use. The choice of an adjuvant and\/or carrier depends on such factors as the stability of the formulation containing the adjuvant, the route of administration, the dosing schedule, and the efficacy of the adjuvant for the species being vaccinated. In humans, a preferred pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant is one that has been approved for human administration by pertinent regulatory bodies. Examples of such preferred adjuvants for humans include alum, MPL and QS-21. Optionally, two or more different adjuvants can be used simultaneously. Preferred combinations include alum with MPL, alum with QS-21, MPL with QS-21, and alum, QS-21 and MPL together. Also, Incomplete Freund's adjuvant can be used (Chang et al., 32, 173-186 (1998)), optionally in combination with any of alum, QS-21, and MPL and all combinations thereof.","Antegren\u2122. Antegren\u2122 is a humanized monoclonal antibody that has therapeutic potential in that it prevents migration of inflammatory cells from blood vessels to sites of inflammation. Antegren\u2122 binds to cell surface receptors known as alpha-4-beta-1 (VLA-4) and alpha-4-beta7 integrins. These receptors help white blood cells, particularly T lymphocytes and eosinophils, move from the inside of blood vessels out into surrounding tissues of the body at sites of inflammation, where these cells then participate in the inflammatory process. Antegren\u2122 blocks these receptors, thus preventing the cells from contributing to the inflammatory response.","The typical method of administering Antegren\u2122 is intravenous. Intravenous administration requires the final formulation to be isotonic. For example, a formulation of Antegren\u2122, 5 mg\/mL in 50 mM L-histidine, 150 mM NaCl, pH 6.0 was initially chosen. During a Phase II study, protein precipitation of the antibody was observed during the dilution and introduction of Antegren\u2122 into the clinical dosing apparatus. Polysorbate 80 was introduced into the formulation to resolve the observed protein precipitation.","The two factors that have been shown to accelerate the precipitation of the Antegren\u2122 antibody are the presence of trace levels of silicone oil and denaturation at the air-liquid interface. The silicone oil was introduced into the product upon use of standard lubricated polypropylene syringes equipped with siliconized rubber stoppers. The introduction of the silicone oil is sufficient to cause discernible antibody precipitation upon gentle agitation and room temperature storage. The aggregation and subsequent precipitation caused by denaturation at the air-liquid interface has become more discernable problematic with the drug being shipped to more clinical sites. Both causes of protein precipitation have been resolved by the addition of polysorbate 80 at a concentration of 0.02% (w\/v).","The addition of polysorbate 80 to the formulation also overcomes the problem of precipitating or aggregating antibody when preparing formulations with higher protein content. Initial work focused on agitation-induced aggregation at high protein concentrations, including 50 mg\/mL. By subjecting the material to agitation using a vortex-type mixer, aggregated species were detected by size exclusion-high performance liquid chromatography (SEC-HPLC). This model identified polysorbate 80 as an effective inhibitor of aggregation, while sucrose and other buffering components had little beneficial effect.","The effectiveness of the addition of 0.02% (w\/v) polysorbate 80 in preventing agitation-induced precipitation at a protein concentration of 5 mg\/mL was assessed following addition of 10 \u03bcL of a 10% polysorbate 80 solution to vials of Antegren\u2122 (Lot No. AN100226-0003). The vials were shaken on their sides along with several vials of Antegren\u2122 in Formulation #1 at 150 rotations per minute in a horizontal plane. Within 3 hours of this treatment at room temperature, the vials of Formulation #1 were laden with particles and appeared turbid while the vials with 0.02% (w\/v) polysorbate 80 remained clear and free of particles.","The observed aggregation is presumed to be caused by the air-surface interface, as vials completely filled with Antegren\u2122 in the absence of polysorbate 80 were shaken for extended periods of time without additional particle formation being induced.","An evaluation of the ability of 0.02% (w\/v) polysorbate 80 to inhibit the protein precipitation facilitated by trace levels of silicone was conducted. A vial of Antegren\u2122 (Lot No. AN100226-0003) was adjusted to 0.02% (w\/v) polysorbate 80 and drawn into a commercially available, lubricated 60 mL polypropylene syringe. The material was allowed to stand for several hours at room temperature. Visual inspection confirmed that no precipitation was occurring. The material was then filtered through a 0.2 \u03bcm filter into a 5-mL vial and inspected and found to be substantially free of particles after several days, while vials treated in the same manner in the absence of polysorbate 80 (Formulation #1) were laden with particles.","Further descriptions of Antegren\u2122 and procedures for preparing this humanized monoclonal antibody are also described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,840,299, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Further descriptions of formulations for Antegren\u2122 and procedures for preparing such forumulations of this humanized monoclonal antibody are also described in U.S. provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/445,181, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Agents and Small Molecule Alpha-4 Integrin Antogonist Compounds that Selectively Bind to Alpha-4 Integrins","Various types of agents with the ability to bind to and inhibit alpha-4 integrin can be used in the practice of the invention. Many such agents have been identified and characterized, and specific agents are described below. Given the teachings disclosed herein, it is well within the skill of one in the art to identify other agents that will be able to inhibit the alpha-4-comprising integrin dimers in a manner that biologically mimics or is similar to the specifically described agents, and the present invention is intended to include the chronic administration of such agents. As it is also contemplated to include combinations of agents, discussion of agents other than small compounds are also provided.","Drug Combinations. The anti-alpha-4 integrin agents (e.g., anti-alpha-4 integrin antibodies and methotrexate and small compound alpha-4 integrin antagonists and methotrexate) can be combined with other compounds or compositions used to treat, ameliorate or palliate symptoms associated with RA.","Dosage forms of the agents to be used in combination with the compounds and compositions disclosed herein would vary depending on the subject and drug combination being utilized.","The benefit of such combination therapies is that it may lessen the class-specific and agent-specific side effects currently encountered with some of the drugs. Combinations of drugs that can lessen the quantity of a particular drug administered may reduce adverse side effects experienced by a patient.","When administered in combination, the small compound alpha-4-integrin antagonists may be administered in the same formulation as these other compounds or compositions, or in a separate formulation. When administered in combination, the anti-alpha-4-antibodies are generally administered in a separate formulation than the other compounds and compositions. When administered in combinations, the anti-alpha-4 agents may be administered prior to, following, or concurrently with the other compounds and compositions used to treat, ameliorate, or palliate symptoms.","Chronic Administration Dosage Regimes","The chronic treatment regime of the present invention provides anti-alpha-4 agent at a level that will maintain sufficient receptor saturation to treat rheumatoid arthritis in a patient in need of such. The methods of the invention entails administration once per every two weeks or once a month to once every two months, with repeated dosings taking place over a period of at least six months, and more preferably for a year or longer. The methods of the invention involve obtaining and maintaining a receptor saturation level in a human patient of a dimer comprising alpha-4 integrin (e.g., VLA-4) in a range of from about 65% to 100%, more preferably between 75%, to 100%, and even more preferably between 80-100%. These receptor saturation levels are maintained at these levels chronically (e.g., over a period of 6 months or so) to allow for continued suppression of pathological inflammation.","In a specific embodiment, the anti-alpha-4 agent is an antibody, preferably a humanized or human antibody, and the dosing is on a monthly basis. In another specific embodiment, the anti-alpha-4 agent is a compound of Formula I-XXIX as provided above. Levels of receptor saturation can be monitored to determine the efficacy of the dosing regime, and physiological markers measured to confirm the success of the dosage regime. As a confirmation, serum levels of the antibody can be monitored to identify clearance of the antibody and to determine the potential effect of half-life on the efficacy of the treatment.","The amount of agent administered in a dosage unit may depend on whether adjuvant is also administered, with higher dosages generally being required in the presence of adjuvant. For immunization with an agent of the invention, the dosage ranges from about 0.0001 to 100 mg\/kg, and more usually 0.01 to 5 mg\/kg, of the host body weight. For example dosages can be 1 mg\/kg body weight or 10 mg\/kg body weight. Dosage and frequency vary depending on the half-life of the agent in the patient. The dosage and frequency of administration can vary depending on whether the treatment is prophylactic or therapeutic. For an antibody administration, each dosing injection is generally between 2.0 to 8.0 mg\/kg dosage. For a compound administration, each dosing injection is generally between 1.0 to 10.0 mg\/kg dosage. In accordance with the teachings provided herein, effective dosages can be monitored by obtaining a fluid sample from a patient. For this, generally a blood serum or cerebrospinal fluid sample it taken and integrin receptor saturation is determined using methods well known in the art. Ideally, a sample is taken prior to initial dosing; subsequent samples are taken and measured prior to and\/or after each immunization.","When adjuvant is being administered, the dosage level is increased in accordance with the particular adjuvant and the level of immunogenicity of the anti-alpha-4 agent. Doses for individual agents, selected in accordance with the present invention, are determined according to standard dosing methods, taken in conjunction with the teachings provided herein.","As an alternative to chronic administration comprised of repeated individual dosings, an anti-alpha-4 agent can be administered as a sustained release formulation, provided the dosage is such that the levels of receptor saturation remain sufficient to suppress inflammation. For example, controlled release systems can be used to chronically administer an anti-alpha-4 agent within the scope of this invention. Discussions of appropriate controlled release dosage forms may be found in Lesczek Krowczynski, -1987 (CRC Press, Inc.).","The various controlled release technologies cover a very broad spectrum of drug dosage forms. Controlled release technologies include, but are not limited to physical systems and chemical systems. Physical systems include, but not limited to, reservoir systems with rate-controlling membranes, such as microencapsulation, macroencapsulation, and membrane systems; reservoir systems without rate-controlling membranes, such as hollow fibers, ultra microporous cellulose triacetate, and porous polymeric substrates and foams; monolithic systems, including those systems physically dissolved in non-porous, polymeric, or elastomeric matrices (e.g., non-erodible, erodible, environmental agent ingression, and degradable), and materials physically dispersed in non-porous, polymeric, or elastomeric matrices (e.g., non-erodible, erodible, environmental agent ingression, and degradable); laminated structures, including reservoir layers chemically similar or dissimilar to outer control layers; and other physical methods, such as osmotic pumps, or adsorption onto ion-exchange resins.","Chemical systems include, but are not limited to, chemical erosion of polymer matrices (e.g., heterogeneous, or homogeneous erosion), or biological erosion of a polymer matrix (e.g., heterogeneous, or homogeneous). Additional discussion of categories of systems for controlled release may be found in Agis F. Kydonieus, 1980 (CRC Press, Inc.).","The methods of the invention can be used to treat a patient that is affected with a disorder involving or arising from pathological inflammation, or to prophylactically treat a patient at risk for a particular disorder. The dosage regimes necessary for prophylactic versus therapeutic treatment can vary, and will need to be designed for the specific use and disorder treated.","In some methods, two or more agents (e.g., monoclonal antibodies with different binding specificities) are administered simultaneously, in which case the dosage of each agent administered falls within the ranges indicated. Intervals can also be irregular as indicated by measuring receptor saturation levels or by following other indicia of the disease process.","Those of skill will readily appreciate that dose levels can vary as a function of the specific agent, the severity of the symptoms and the susceptibility of the subject to side effects. Some of the specific agents are more potent than others. Preferred dosages for a given agent are readily determinable by those of skill in the art by a variety of means. A preferred means is to measure the physiological potency of a given agent.","In prophylactic applications, pharmaceutical compositions are chronically administered to a patient susceptible to, or otherwise at risk of, a particular disease in an amount sufficient to eliminate or reduce the risk or delay the outset of the disease. Such an amount is defined to be a prophylactically effective dose.","The anti alpha-4 agents of the invention can be used with effective amounts of other therapeutic agents against acute and chronic inflammation. Such agents include other antagonists of adhesion molecules (e.g., other integrins, selecting, and immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily members (see Springer, (1990) 346:425-433; Osborn (1990) 62:3; Hynes (1992) 9:11)). Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane glycoproteins consisting of an a chain (120-180 kDa) and a P chain (90-110 kDa), generally having short cytoplasmic domains. For example, three important integrins, LFA-1, Mac-1 and P150,95, have different alpha subunits, designated CD11a, CD11b and CD11c, and a common beta subunit designated CD18. LFA-1(\u03b1\u03b2) is expressed on lymphocytes, granulocyte and monocytes, and binds predominantly to an Ig-family member counter-receptor termed ICAM-1 and related ligands. ICAM-1 is expressed on many cells, including leukocytes and endothelial cells, and is up-regulated on vascular endothelium by cytokines such as TNF and IL-1. Mac-1 (\u03b1\u03b2) is distributed on neutrophils and monocytes, and also binds to ICAM-1. The third \u03b2integrin, P150,95 (\u03b1\u03b2), is also found on neutrophils and monocytes. The selectins consist of L-selectin, E-selectin and P-selectin.","Other antiinflammatory agents that can be used in combination with the anti alpha-4 agents include antibodies and other antagonists of cytokines, such as interleukins IL-1 through IL-13, tumor necrosis factors \u03b1 and \u03b2 (TNF-\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b2), interferons \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3, tumor growth factor Beta (TGF-\u03b2), colony stimulating factor (CSF) and granulocyte monocyte colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Other antiinflammatory agents include antibodies and other antagonists of chemokines such as MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2, RANTES, exotaxin and IL-8. Other anti-inflammatory agents include NSAIDS, steroids and other small molecule inhibitors of inflammation. Formulations, routes of administration and effective concentrations of agents for combined therapies are as described above for the humanized antibodies against alpha-4 integrin.","Treatment Regimes","The invention further relates to regimes for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. These regimes may include administering to a subject about 2 mg to about 20 mg of methotrexatexate as well as an antibody to alpha-4 integrin or an immunologically active antigen binding fragment thereof. Alternatively, the regimen may include administering to a subject about 2 mg to about 20 mg of methotrexatexate as well as a small molecule alpha-4 integrin antagonist. Preferably, the subject is a mammal. More preferably, the mammal is human. Preferably, the antibody to alpha-4 integrin or immunologically active antigen binding fragment is administered in an amount of about 0.01 mg\/kg of body weight to about 50 mg\/kg of body weight. Preferably, the small molecule alpha-4 integrin antagonist is administered in an amount of about 2 mg to about 20 mg of methotrexate and about 0.01 mg\/kg of body weight to about 100 mg\/kg of body weight of a compound.","The regimen may be administered at any time of day or week, and in any order, such that a therapeutically effective does is achieved. The antibodies, fragments or compounds may be administered prior to, following, or concurrently with the methotrexate such that the benefitsd of the combination therapy are achieved. The amount of methotrexate administered per week should not exceed 20 mg.","The following examples are put forth so as to provide those of ordinary skill in the art with a complete disclosure and description of how to make and use the present invention, and is not intended to limit the scope of what the inventors regard as their invention nor is it intended to represent that the experiments below are all or the only experiments performed. Efforts have been made to ensure accuracy with respect to numbers used (e.g., amounts, temperature, etc.) but some experimental errors and deviations should be accounted for.

Further, all temperatures are in degrees Celsius (unless otherwise indicated). The following Methods were used to prepare the compounds set forth below as indicated.","N-Tosylation of the appropriate amino acid was conducted via the method of Cupps, Boutin and Rapoport 1985, 50, 3912.","Amino acid methyl esters were prepared using the method of Brenner and Huber 1953, 36, 1109.","The desired dipeptide ester was prepared by the reaction of a suitable N-protected amino acid (1 equivalent) with the appropriate amino acid ester or amino acid ester hydrochloride (1 equivalent), benzotriazol-1-yloxy-tris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate [BOP] (2.0 equivalent), triethylamine (1.1 equivalent), and DMF. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. The crude product is purified flash chromatography to afford the dipeptide ester.","Hydrogenation was performed using 10% palladium on carbon (10% by weight) in methanol at 30 psi overnight. The mixture was filtered through a pad of Celite and the filtrate concentrated to yield the desired amino compound.","To a chilled (0\u00b0 C.) THF\/HO solution (2:1, 5-10 mL) of the appropriate ester was added LiOH (or NaOH) (0.95 equivalents). The temperature was maintained at 0\u00b0 C. and the reaction was complete in 1-3 hours.
