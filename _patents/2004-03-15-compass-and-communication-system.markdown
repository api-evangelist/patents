title: Compass and communication system
abstract: A system and method indicate azimuth of a diver to a remote console. A compass sensor module on a headgear worn by the diver has a two-axis gimbal mechanism provided with a protective housing around ring and two orthogonal axis structures. A magnetic field sensor unit mounted on one axis structure provides magnetic field data signals representative of the azimuth faced by the diver. A processor section of the compass module connected to the sensor unit provides azimuth data signals from the magnetic field data signals. A data transmission module has a conductor extending from the compass module to an amplifier and cable for amplifying azimuth data signals and remotely transmitting them. An acoustic transducer in the data module can also transmit azimuth data signals as acoustic signals through water. The console connected to the cable and water receives and displays the remotely transmitted azimuth data signals.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This is a continuation-in-part of co-pending U.S. patent application entitled \u201cSmall Head-Mounted Compass System With Optical Display\u201d by William d. Olstad et al., U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Ser. No. 10\/699,426 (NC 84835), filed Nov. 3, 2003 and incorporates all references and information thereof by reference herein.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","This invention relates to a system for indicating horizontal orientation of an operator under conditions of impaired visibility. More particularly, this invention relates to a system partially mounted on headgear or equipment (dive masks, goggles, firefighting masks, helmets, head straps, backpacks, portable equipments) for indicating horizontal orientation or azimuth of a operator-wearer (diver and other workers) for real-time evaluations and advice by remote observers.","Some skilled workers such as divers, miners, rescue personnel etc. frequently perform their physically demanding tasks under highly dangerous and confined conditions that may include limited visibility. Often, the dangers created by these conditions are exacerbated by technically sophisticated\/dangerous equipment and other hazardous circumstances at the recovery or work site. During a strenuous and intensive effort, situations can arise outside of the expertise of the worker that need inputs from one or more cognizant experts to successfully complete a task. The effectiveness of the advice from the expert usually is based on information from the worker that is unmistakable.","For example, during salvage of complicated and highly explosive ordnance from great depths, divers often need technical assistance and guidance from structural experts concerning specifics of the construction of the craft that carried the ordnance to safely remove the items of interest. Technical assistance from ordnance experts may also be needed for safely handling and bringing the ordnance items to the surface after their removal.","The technical experts located a safe distance away can transmit needed technical information to a diver or other worker at the site by contemporary communication systems. However, since much of a work site can be at least partially obscured, the diver often may be unable to describe his location or the surrounding structures with sufficient accuracy to enable the distant experts to correctly evaluate the situation and properly advise the diver. Existing techniques for getting diver azimuth to surface require the diver to stop what he is doing, find his compass, orient compass, read compass (if possible) and verbally transmit reading to surface using a hardwire or acoustic communication system. This process is awkward, inefficient, prone to error, a potential safety hazard, and is not real time.","The experts on the surface may be unable to determine if a diver is looking one way toward one end of a submerged chamber at an empty container or the other way at a similarly appearing container filled with unstable explosives at the other end of the chamber. Disastrous consequences could follow by giving the wrong technical advice since it is not clear exactly which way or where the diver is looking.","Thus, in accordance with this inventive concept, a need has been recognized in the state of the art for a system providing continuous, compass data representative of horizontal orientation or azimuth of a worker such as a diver and communicating this azimuth data to a remote location for evaluation and responsive action.","An object of the invention is to provide a system providing continuous, compass data representative of horizontal orientation or azimuth of a diver and communicating this azimuth data to a remote location for evaluation and responsive action.","Another object is to provide a system providing information of azimuth that does not require an operator to maintain a predetermined physical attitude.","Another objective is to provide a system for providing data representative of the azimuth of a diver for remote evaluation of a task and advice concerning the task by technical experts.","Another object of the invention is to provide a compact and rugged system partially carried on a headgear or other equipment to provide data representative of heading or direction faced for more responsive evaluation of reported information at a remote location.","Another object of the invention is to provide a compact system having a compass sensor module on a worker and communications module linking the compass module to a remote location.","Another object of the invention is to provide a compass and communications system to help perform undersea tasks in a safer and more efficient manner with better and more thorough results.","These and other objects of the invention will become more readily apparent from the ensuing specification when taken in conjunction with the appended claims.","Accordingly, the present invention is for a compass and communication system to transmit azimuth data representative of heading of an operator such as a diver to a remote location on a surface craft. A compass sensor module has a waterproof housing and a mounting mechanism on the housing to engage a headgear worn at the back of a diver's head. A two-axis gimbal mechanism inside the waterproof housing has a protective housing connected to the waterproof housing and contains ring structure and two orthogonal axis structures. A magnetic field sensor unit is mounted on one of the axis structures and provides magnetic field data signals representative of the direction or azimuth faced by the diver. The mounting mechanism transmits horizontal yawing motions of the diver to the gimbal mechanism and magnetic field sensor unit. A processor electronics section of the compass sensor module is connected to the magnetic field sensor unit to provide data signals representative of azimuth from the magnetic field data signals. A data transmission module has an electrically insulated conductor connected to the compass sensor module and an amplifier stage for amplifying an electromagnetic form of the azimuth data signals and an electrically insulated cable extends from the amplifier stage for remotely transmitting the electromagnetic azimuth signals. An acoustic transducer in the data transmission module is connected to the amplifier stage to transmit the azimuth data signals as acoustic signals through ambient water to the remote location. A transceiver\/display console at the remote craft is connected to the cable and water to receive and display the remotely transmitted azimuth data signals.","Referring to , compass and communication system  of the invention is for communicating data (shown as arrow ) representative of heading in the horizontal plane or azimuth of a diver  submerged at a work site  that can be deep in water . Compass and communication system  can input azimuth data  to diver-carried equipment  that may be used to perform tasks at work site  or could input data  to other operator equipment such as sonar, head-mounted display, etc. that could utilize such data  at the site. Compass and communication system  can also be used to provide azimuth data  for other workers such as miners underground, firefighters and\/or rescue workers in visually challenging surroundings (i.e. in darkness, turbid water, smoke, fog, or other obscurants) or other location that is not observable from without.","Compass and communication system  generates and transmits data  representative of azimuth of the worker-diver  to transceiver\/display console  at a remote location , such a surface support craft  on water  or to submerged platform (not shown) during clandestine operations. Azimuth data  at remote location  can be viewed by technical experts in marine geology, structures, and ordnance, for example. Because a diver's heading often is indeterminable during diving operations, azimuth data  can be the only means available to apprise the observers which direction diver  is looking and which side of a structure or chamber in a sunken craft is being observed. Consequently, observers having azimuth data  are better informed to evaluate additional oral and\/or visual communications from diver  and can give diver  more meaningful technical guidance regarding safer and more effective salvage or work procedures may be given to diver .","Compass and communication system  has a compass sensor module  that generates azimuth data  for transmission through water  or air  via a data-transmission module . Compass sensor module  is mounted at the back  of the head  on a headgear  that can include straps connected to diving facemasks (as depicted), goggles, firefighting masks, helmets, etc. and stand-alone head-strap-and-bracket assemblies. Optionally, compass sensor module  could be mounted on diver-carried equipment  for performing tasks at work site  or could input data  to other operator equipment such as sonar, head-mounted display, or compass sensor module  could be mounted on a portable life-support apparatus  such as a compressed air tank, re-breather unit, etc. to indicate the direction diver  is facing.","Compass sensor module  has an electrically insulated conductor  connected to feed data  to data-transmission module  that partially can be held by diver . Data-transmission module  also could be located partially on head  alongside of compass sensor module  or be mounted on equipment  or life-support apparatus .","Referring also to , compass sensor module  can be substantially the same as disclosed with regard to the compass system in the referenced co-pending application supra and can be contained in a small waterproof housing  that may be depth rated to about 200 feet in salt water. Compass sensor module  has a clamp-like mounting mechanism  to hold module  on headgear  or on life support apparatus . Compass sensor module  might also be mounted on diver-carried equipment , for example a film or video camera or search sonar. Azimuth data  representative of compass headings could be sent topside along with scanned video\/sonar information data to permit correlation of the scanned information data and the azimuth data  for more responsive real-time evaluations by experts topside.","Waterproof housing  of compass sensor module  contains a miniature electronic, two-axis, magnetic field sensor unit  which provides magnetic field data signals (shown as arrow ) over electrical cable . Magnetic field data signals  are indicative or representative of the direction or azimuth faced by diver-operator . A typical, commercially available off the shelf two-axis magnetic field sensor module that can be used for magnetic field sensor module  is known as the PNI MicroMag 2-axis Magnetic Sensor Module Part Number 11594 manufactured by PNI Corporation of 5464 Skylane Blvd., Suite A, Santa Rosa, Calif. 95403.","Magnetic field sensor unit  is mounted on a two-axis gimbal mechanism  in waterproof housing  to allow a wide range of movement by diver  without degrading the accuracy of magnetic field sensor unit . Two-axis gimbal mechanism  can be a scaled-down version of many well known mechanically gimbaled and damped self-leveling systems. These leveling systems create damped, substantially level platforms for instrumentations, and typically, they are used as the supports for ships' compasses to dampen motions from them, or they may be for gyros or other applications where such supports are needed. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 4,318,522.","Two-axis gimbal mechanism  could be like the gimbal of prior art shown in  of the '522 patent. Two-axis gimbal mechanism and could provide the requisite leveling and yaw detection (horizontal, azimuth sensing) capabilities for magnetic field sensor unit  by miniaturizing the '522 structure of  and substituting magnetic field sensing unit  for the object that looks like a rolling-pin. Miniaturization of such a self leveling system to meet the size constraints of compass sensor module  is within the scope of one skilled in the art without calling for anything more than the exercise of ordinary skill and does not require undue experimentation. The details of mounting magnetic field sensor module in two axis gimbal mechanism are set forth in the above referenced co-pending application and are incorporated by reference herein.","Referring also to , magnetic field sensor unit  is mounted in a protective housing  of gimbal mechanism  via a ring structure  coupled to two orthogonal axis structures  and  of gimbal mechanism . Pivot points  are at opposite ends of axis structure  to allow rolling motions of magnetic field sensor unit , and pivot points  are at opposite ends of axis structure  to allow pitching motions of magnetic field sensor unit . Thus, magnetic field sensor unit  stays substantially level regardless of the pitch and roll of compass sensor module  during movement of diver-operator . A ballasting counterweight  is connected to the bottom of magnetic field sensor unit . Counterweight  is rigidly attached to and hangs from unit  and helps keep unit  level and prevents oscillations of unit  by pitching and rolling motions of diver . Protective, sealed housing  can be filled with an oil-like non-reactive fluid  to dampen the movement of magnetic field sensor unit  so that it does not oscillate as diver  goes from one place to another and\/or performs tasks. These features allow diver  a wide range of pitch and roll motions of up to +\/\u221290\u00b0 without degrading the accuracy of magnetic field sensor unit .","Protective housing  is connected at points  to waterproof housing  (only two of which are depicted in ), and housing  is securely connected to headgear  at the back  of head  by mounting mechanism . Consequently, any horizontal yawing motions (or changes in azimuth) of diver  are transmitted to gimbal mechanism  and magnetic field sensor unit  so that the azimuth or direction diver  is facing can be sensed by sensor unit  that generates responsive magnetic field data signals . This generation is because yawing motions in the horizontal plane (changes in azimuth) by diver  are not compensated for by gimbal mechanism . Thus, magnetic field sensor unit  is able to sense rotational motion and different directional headings or facings of diver  as diver  turns left or right (yawing motion). Magnetic field sensor unit  responsively generates directional magnetic field data signals  that can be representative of the azimuth or direction diver  faces in the horizontal plane during progression from one location to another or while at a particular undersea location.","A processor electronics section  is connected to magnetic field sensor unit  via electrical cable  to receive magnetic field data signals . Processor section  reads magnetic field data signals , makes calculations using previously stored calibration data to yield the compass heading (azimuth), and provides an output as representative azimuth data signals (shown as arrow ) in the proper format to data transmission module  over its electrically insulated conductor . Optionally, compass sensor module  can also have a small, multi-function wireless RF\/acoustic transmitter  to transmit data signals  in electromagnetic form A a short distance through water  to a small wireless RF receiver  of data transmission module  that is connected to amplifier . As a further option, multi-function RF\/acoustic transmitter  in compass sensor module  could acoustically transmit data signals  through acoustic transducer  as acoustic signals  through water  to acoustic transducer\/transceiver  in data transmission module , or directly transmit acoustic signals  to an acoustic transducer transceiver  on remotely located craft . However, an unacceptable number of additional batteries might be needed at module  for directly, acoustically transmitting to craft .","Compass sensor module  has a switch  connected to processor section . A push-button  from switch  extends through housing  to permit diver-operator  to selectively turn-on or turn-off compass sensor module  as desired. Button  of switch  is coupled to processor section  that is connected to battery  for electrical power when diver  pushes button  to turn-on compass sensor module . Processor section  also connects magnetic field sensing unit  to battery  via electrical cable  to activate it when button  is displaced by diver .","Representative data signals  from compass sensor module  are connected to a data transmission module  via its conductor  or through water . Data transmission module  is shown as being partially hand held by diver  along with equipment package . Module  and\/or equipment  can be carried or otherwise transported by diver  at other places on the body or by undersea transport vehicles at or near the work site.","Data transmission module  includes an interconnected amplifier  and battery power supply  connected to conductor  and a remotely extending electrically insulated cable . Amplified data signals  from amplifier  are coupled via cable  to transceiver\/display console  on craft  for display and evaluation or relay of azimuth data  via RF antenna  to another remote location or satellite (not shown). Data transmission module  could additionally have an acoustic transducer\/transceiver  for transmitting data signals  as acoustic signals  through ambient water  to acoustic transducer\/transceiver  connected to transceiver\/display console  or to appropriate acoustic receivers carried by others in water . Either mode of transmission assures that technical observers on craft  can use the information of azimuth data signals  and be apprised of the direction faced by diver  at work site .","In operation, diver-operator  turns on compass sensor module  by pushing push-button  of switch . The horizontal X and Y components of the earth's magnetic field are sensed by magnetic field sensor unit  which is kept steady and level by being mounted on two-axis damped, mechanical gimbal mechanism . Magnetic field signals  are generated and are coupled over cable  to processor electronics section  which reads signals  and generates compass heading or azimuth data signals  based on previously stored calibration data. Processor section  couples representative compass heading azimuth data signals  via cable  to to data transmission module  where data signals  are transmitted remotely via cable  or water  to console  on craft . There data  can be displayed for evaluation and responsive action by technical experts or relayed via antenna  to a more distant facility.","Compass and communication system  of the invention is compact and out-of-the-way to not distract a worker. System  of the invention does not interfere with the completion of tasks in intense work environments under dangerous, mentally and physically demanding conditions of obscured visibility that may approach zero. Miners and rescue workers can also benefit from being equipped with compass and communication system in their dangerous work environment that may need an expert's advice.","These workers as well as diver  could additionally have bidirectional electromagnetic voice communications with experts at remote locations. For surface workers, a small radio transceiver  having an acoustic microphone\/speaker  in compass sensor module  can be connected to cable  of data transmission module  to allow bidirectional electromagnetic communications of information (shown as bidirectional arrow ) between them and experts near console . For divers, cable communications to a commercially available diver acoustic headset  and microphone equipment  would be made over insulated conductors A and A to ports  and  on compass sensor module . These communications  and azimuth data  are in real time to assure safe and successful completion of a task at site  regardless of ambient visual environmental conditions (i.e. darkness, turbid water, smoke, fog, and any other opaque obscurants).","Acoustic transducer\/transceiver  of data transmission module  and transducer\/transceiver  on craft  also can permit bidirectional communications in the form of bidirectional acoustic communications (shown as bidirectional arrow ) that are transmitted through ambient water  between diver  and craft . Bidirectional acoustic communications  and azimuth data  sent as acoustic signals  are in real-time for safer and more successful operations.","Compass and communication system  of the invention is small, self-contained, waterproof and ruggedized to allow its reliable operation during salvage operations or at potential underwater crime scenes for example. System  of the invention provides diver heading (or where diver is looking in this case) information as data  to topside experts and other support personnel via wire  or water  transmitting acoustic signals . Topside personnel can monitor the direction of travel of diver  and area coverage if diver  is in a navigation mode (swimming with head aligned with body) during search and rescue sweeps at an underwater crime scene. If diver  stops moving during the sweeps, topside experts might determine that there a problem has developed which could be resolved from a standpoint of safety. If diver  finds the targeted item, diver  can provide topside experts at remote location  with a rough \u201cmapping\u201d of scene of the targeted area. This mapping is transferred via verbal information via acoustic data signals  from acoustic transducer\/transceiver  or electromagnetic information signals  over cable  along with real-time azimuth data signals  over a possible 360\u00b0 sweep from a given point as diver  says what is being observed. This sort of complete information could be highly useful by those involved in underwater archeological research. Complete search of an area with no overlooked spots can be coordinated.","Compass and communication system  could benefit diver  from having a display of azimuth data  at diver equipment package  or at a display such as referred to above in the co-pending application. Since experts at topside have real-time verbal communications and azimuth data  at transceiver\/display console , diver  and topside experts can discuss the information and make appropriate adjustments as a situation develops.","Having the teachings of this invention in mind, modifications and alternate embodiments of compass and communication system  may be adapted without departing from the scope of the invention. Its uncomplicated, compact design that incorporates structures long proven to operate successfully lends itself to numerous modifications to permit its reliable use in hostile and demanding marine and underground applications where impaired visibility greatly complicates effective action. Compass and communication system  can be made from a wide variety of materials for resistance to corrosion, strength to bear up during routine abuse, and to provide long term reliable operation under a multitude of different operational conditions and requirements.","The disclosed components and their arrangements as disclosed herein, all contribute to the novel features of this invention. Compass and communication system  of the invention provides a reliable and capable means for improving the effectiveness of workers and reducing the hazards associated with operations under highly dangerous conditions that include near zero visibility. Therefore, compass and communication system , as disclosed herein is not to be construed as limiting, but rather, is intended to be demonstrative of this inventive concept.","It should be readily understood that many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible within the purview of the claimed invention. It is to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.\n\n"],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["3","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["4","4"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
