title: System and method for dynamically generating a selectable search extension
abstract: A system and related techniques accept user-inputted search terms, for example to perform a search for files or other data or objects. Corresponding matches to those terms may be presented to the user in a “word-wheel”-type breakout list generated on the fly for groupings of hits by attributes or other criteria, as the system searches through the file system at the current level or point in the file system hierarchy. According to embodiments, when the search logic fails to locate a hit on the inputted search term at the current level or point in the file system hierarchy, an extension of the search to different levels or points in the file system hierarchy may be automatically generated, and for instance presented to the user as a selectable search box. That box may for example be highlighted to the user for easy selection. When the user does select the selectable search box, the user's search, for instance for files of type or extension “.doc” or “.memo”, may be seamlessly extended to other files, folders, trees or other points or levels in the file system hierarchy. Search results may be continuously or dynamically updated as the user, for example, enters more characters or other data.

No. 60\/566,947 filed May 3, 2004 entitled \u201cSystem and Method for Dynamically Generating a Selectable Search Extension\u201d, which application is assigned or under obligation of assignment to the same entity as this application, from which application priority is claimed, and which application is incorporated by reference herein; and to the subject matter of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/440,035 entitled \u201cSystem and Method for Filtering and Organizing Items Based on Common Elements\u201d filed May 16, 2003, which is in turn a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/403,341 entitled \u201cSystem and Method for Filtering and Organizing Items Based on Common Elements\u201d filed Mar. 27, 2003, each of which applications is assigned or under obligation of assignment to the same entity as this application, and each of which applications is incorporated by reference herein.","Not applicable.","The invention relates to the field of computing, and more particularly to a platform for automatically generating a selectable search as a user inputs search terms, for instance matching file attributes or content to files in a file system, which search may be presented in word-wheel style and expand the level of directories or other point or level in file hierarchies in which the search may be performed.","In the realm of operating system, application design and other fields, the need for a powerful and flexible search facility to search a user's storage frequently arises. A user may wish, for example, to search his or her hard drive to locate all files of a certain type or extension, such as \u201c.doc\u201d, \u201c.jpg\u201d, \u201c.memo\u201d, \u201c.report\u201d or others to pull up documents to edit, print other manipulate in other ways. A user may likewise wish to search for files based on associated metadata, such as file size, or date created or modified. A user may at times also choose to search for files based on internal file content, such as desired text or numbers. The need to efficiently initiate and carry out these searches becomes particularly acute when the user is attempting to look through a large quantity of files or data. That situation may apply for example when a user is examining a national customer list in a CRM package, or updating contacts files or shared documents within a large corporation or other organization. In other cases, a user may wish to sort or search through a collection or catalogue of musical, video or other media or file material. Some search tools and facilities have evolved in response to large-scale file search and other requirements.","For example, some applications and other packages may present the user with an input box type of search interface, where the user may enter search terms such as file extensions or other attributes, or in-file characters or text. As the search, for example through a local hard drive and associated file system, progresses, files which partly or fully match the entered attributes or text may be displayed to the user to select or manipulate.","However, existing search tools may be constrained by certain limitations in usability or functionality. For instance, even such search tools as exist merely present the results gathered from searching the client or other file system at the current level or point in the file system hierarchy. So if no results are found in a given directory or folder, the user may be required to restart and reenter another search in another directory or folder, even when using the same search terms. Likewise, existing search tools do not permit the concurrent execution of searches on both file attributes (extension, name etc.) as well as deep or internal file searching, for instance to match text strings. Other problems in file management and search technology exist.","The invention overcoming these and other problems in the art relates in one regard to a system and method for dynamically generating a selectable search extension, in which a user may initiate a search through a file system based on file attributes or content at a current level or point in a file system hierarchy. In embodiments, the inventive platform may automatically generate on-the-fly results reflecting matches with files within the current level or point of the file system hierarchy. For example the platform may display a running total of files whose name, date, size, author or other attributes or textual or other content match the input search term or terms as the user enters those terms. According to embodiments of the invention in another regard, when the immediate results to the user's input search terms displays no or too few matches to any files in the current level or point in the file system hierarchy, or based on other conditions, a selectable search box may be automatically generated and presented. In embodiments the search box may dynamically suggest auto-complete strings for suggested or candidate search terms. The selectable search box may in embodiments be presented to the user in highlighted form, and permit the user to extend the search using the same search input or criteria to other levels by clicking or otherwise selecting a different level or point in the file system hierarchy, which may be highlighted or presented in a menu interface for quick activation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["104","102","108","110","102","106","106","118","106","118"]},"During operation and use of client , the user may access storage  and file system  to perform such tasks as locating, opening, modifying and saving files and other objects. The tasks the user may engage may include searching for one or more files or other objects, for instance to open those files using one or more application in the set of applications , to enumerate a set of local files, for example to generate a total count of numbers of files of certain type, to locate and delete obsolete files, or other purposes or tasks. According to embodiments of the invention in one regard, the user may manipulate the user interface  to initiate and perform file searching tasks, for instance using one or more facilities, file types, objects or other features incorporated in or supported by operating system .","In embodiments as shown, the user may accordingly activate a search term input box , for instance by making a file menu selection within one or more screens in operating system , such as those screens or views generated by clicking or activating \u201cMyComputer\u201d or other icons, sidebars, menus or other resources. The user may respond to the search term input box  by entering one or more search terms related to a file or files of interest. For example, the user may wish to view all files with desired attributes, such as files having a \u201c.doc\u201d, \u201c.memo\u201d, \u201c.report\u201d, \u201c.txt\u201d, \u201c.jpg\u201d or other extension, or which were authored by a given user or on a certain date. Other extensions or attributes are possible, such as the time, language, file size, or other attribute of one or more files within file system . A user may in another regard likewise search for files within file system  based on the internal text, character, numbers or other content of those files, and enter those search terms accordingly. Search terms, data structures and related resources may in embodiments be, include or interface to for example those described in the aforementioned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/440,035 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/403,341, or other search schemes or mechanisms.","As illustrated in , according to embodiments of the invention in one regard, as the user begins to enter one or more search terms in the search term input box , the system may respond by automatically generating and presenting a search box . The search box  may reflect search activity and logic in response to the inputted search terms. According to embodiments as shown, the search box  may include, for example in an upper portion of a menu panel, a listing of a set of attributes for files which match the inputted search term or partial search term. According to embodiments, the listing of the set of attributes may be generated in an on-the-fly, immediate or real-time fashion so that as each new letter, character, number or other symbol in the search term is typed in or otherwise entered, the results may be immediately displayed.","In embodiments as shown, the on-the-fly results may include a parenthetical tally of the total number of files matching the inputted search term or partial search term, up to that moment in time. It may be noted that as illustrated in , when for example more than one property value matches the search string or term, the user may be presented with a menu entry indicating that the property \u201ccontains\u201d the search string or term, such as \u201cName contains \u2018lo\u2019\u201d as shown. That is, in the illustrative example multiple names in the view may contain the string \u2018lo\u2019, e.g., \u201cLogan\u201d, \u201cLorraine\u201d, \u201cLomar\u201d or others. On the other hand, when there is only one unique property in the view which matches the search string or term, the user may be presented with a menu entry indicating that the property \u201cis\u201d the search string or term, such as \u201cCity is Los Angeles\u201d as shown. Other interfaces and formats for displaying results are possible.","According to embodiments of the invention in one regard, the on-the-fly search results on file attributes may be generated from searching files displayed in the current list. In embodiments those files may be located in a single directory or location, or across multiple locations. As further illustrated in , while the on-the-fly search activity is taking place on file attributes, according to embodiments additional search activity may be initiated. More particularly, as illustrated the search box  may present in a lower menu section or otherwise a set of further search resources, in the exemplary case including one or more lines indicating internal (or deep) file searching which may take place concurrently or sequentially with the on-the-fly searching on file attributes. In the illustrative example, files at the current point or level of file system  may thus be examined for internal text (\u201clo\u201d) as that text is inputted by the user. Files containing that text string may be located and presented in the search box  as they are located. The speed with which the internally searched hits may be generated may vary according to the number of files in the current point or level in the file system , the input search terms, the type or existence of indexing on that file system or other factors.","Thus according to the invention in one regard, the user who initiates search activity may be presented with a multipart view on results in real-time as they are generated, including results of matching on file attributes (illustratively, the upper half of the search box ) and on internal file content (bottom half), at the same time and without having to activate any additional options to do so.","Moreover, according to embodiments of the invention in further regards, as the results presented in the search box  unfold, the user may be presented with further automatic options to extend their search activity, to different points or levels of file system  or otherwise. In such cases and as more particularly illustrated in , according to embodiments of the invention the system may return the results of searching at a current level  of file system . Those results may accompanied by a presentation in search box  of automatically generated search extensions or options. In embodiments as shown, those extensions may include the highlighting of a different or modified level  or other point or location in file system  to which the same search terms inputted by the user may be applied, in an attempt to locate more or further matching files or other hits.","The user may for example highlight the modified level , such as a corporate directory or organizational contacts list, personal file folder or library, most-recently accessed file list, or other modified or different point or level in the file system  to activate that further searching in that location. The results of that continued or extended searching may likewise be presented in search box , or otherwise. The modified level  may be selected for example based on predetermined relational rules, such as moving one up or down one level in file system , by logical rules such as moving to directories with matching or related names or which stand in parent, child or other relationship to the current level , by defaults such as looking in a most-recently accessed files list, or by other rules or criteria.","The search options presented to the user may thus be automatically primed to look in further predetermined or logically related places in the file system , without a need for the user to manually change the directory or other hierarchical level they are viewing. In embodiments, the presentation of search extension options may be automatically presented, regardless of the amount or type of results at current level  of file system or other parameters. In other embodiments, the triggering of search extension options in search box  may be conditioned on defined criteria, such as when searching on attributes and content based on whole or partial search terms generates no matching results, or fewer hits than the user finds necessary. In embodiments the user may enter minimum thresholds or they may be set by default. Other triggering conditions are possible.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["402","404","406","112","408","118","118"]},"In step , the running results of the on-the-fly search on attributes at the current level in file system  may be presented to the user, for example via a search box , in word-wheel type fashion or otherwise. In step , a sequential or concurrent deep file search, for instance involving opening and searching files internally, or indices of files, for text or strings matching the user input, may be initiated at the current point or level in the file system , for example within a current directory or folder.","In step , results of the on-the-fly deep searching on internal file content may be presented to the user, for example via the search box , for instance separated from the realtime search results based on file attributes by a menu separator or line. In step , depending on the results of the on-the-fly attribute and\/or deep file searching, the user may be presented with a selectable search extension box, to extend the search based on the currently inputted search terms to other points or levels in the hierarchy of file system .","In step , an extension of the search to a different point or level in the file system  may be initiated, for instance when the user activates a highlighted directory, file or other prompt in search box . In embodiments the same search terms which the user had inputted into the search term input box  may be pre-inserted into the highlighted portion of the search box , or otherwise. On-the-fly results may in embodiments be similarly presented via search box  as the multi-level extension to the search activity progresses.","In step , the view in search box  or other interface may be updated to display user-selected or highlighted files or other results, for example a clicked or highlighted file or set of files located in a different level of the file system . Files may be opened, sorted or otherwise manipulated when the view moves to the new point or level in the file system . Prior levels may be stored or displayed as shadowed directories, folders or other objects, in embodiments. In step , processing may repeat, return to a prior processing point, jump to a further processing point, or end.","The foregoing description of the invention is illustrative, and modifications in configuration and implementation will occur to persons skilled in the art. For instance, while the invention has generally been described in terms of a platform in which an interface displays a single search box or facility, in embodiments multiple search boxes or other interfaces, for example cascaded search boxes, may be generated as matches or partial matches are found.","Similarly, while the invention has in embodiments been generally described as executing searches on local hard disk or other storage, in embodiments the automatic searches may be performed on one or more local, remote or distributed storage or file systems, independently or in combinations. For example, a remote server disk may be searched, or a local hard disk may be searched in combination with a storage area network (SAN). Multiple local disks or other media may likewise be searched, serially or concurrently.","Other hardware, software or other resources described as singular may in embodiments be distributed, and similarly in embodiments resources described as distributed may be combined. Further, while the invention has generally been described as involving on-the-fly searches based on a single search term as that string or term is typed, in embodiments multiple or joint search terms may be accepted for searching, for instance using Boolean operations. The scope of the invention is accordingly intended to be limited only by the following claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
