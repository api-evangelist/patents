{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This non-provisional patent application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application 60\/760,392 filed Jan. 20, 2006.","1. Field of the Invention","The invention described herein relates to analysis of unstructured information and, in particular, relates to text analytics.","2. Related Art","More than 80% of data being gathered by users of information systems is unstructured. This data may be in the form of emails, blogs, websites, documents, spreadsheets etc. As the number of computer and Internet users continues to grow, more and more unstructured data content is created. This is evident when observing the growth of the Internet and websites (about 10 million) and documents and emails residing on an individual's desktop. This growth of data has created a need for understanding and leveraging the data's content.","This has given rise to the emerging text analytics area. This area focuses on understanding, harnessing and linking contents of emails, websites, and text data, for example, in database records and documents (henceforth collectively called \u201cdocuments\u201d). The primary domain of expertise and knowledge comes from natural language processing (NLP), a sub-division of artificial intelligence (AI).","The advantages of text analytics are well-known and several text analysis techniques are increasingly adopted in all walks of life. Today, customer feedback through a company's website is analyzed immediately and accurately for negative tones. Once such tones are identified, they are immediately used with the rest of the customer data for personalized action. Law enforcement agencies use the text analysis techniques on incident reports to look for the modus operandi of suspected criminals. Such broad examples are plentiful. In spite of such compelling benefits and advantages, however, text analysis adoption has been limited due to several limitations in current processing techniques.","There are several methods\/algorithms available in NLP that can be used in attempting to understand the language of a document and summarize what the document is about. The challenge has been to match the expectations of the reviewer with the output of the NLP algorithm(s).","Overcoming this challenge has been difficult and several approaches have been proposed with varied degrees of success. Key approaches in this area include:\n\n","What is needed, therefore, is a method and system for performing text analytics in a manner that avoids these shortcomings.","Further embodiments, features, and advantages of the present invention, as well as the operation of the various embodiments of the present invention, are described below with reference to the accompanying drawings.","A preferred embodiment of the present invention is now described with reference to the figures, where like reference numbers indicate identical or functionally similar elements. While specific configurations and arrangements are discussed, it should be understood that this is done for illustrative purposes only. A person skilled in the relevant art will recognize that other configurations and arrangements can be used without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. It will be apparent to a person skilled in the relevant art that this invention can also be employed in a variety of other systems and applications.","In order to overcome automated methodology limitations, several techniques have been proposed over the years:\n\n","The popularity of ontologies appears to be growing. The ability to rigorously capture, store and reuse the conceptual schema about a domain makes ontologies attractive for diverse user communities. For example, the Semantic Web initiative is a project that intends to create a universal medium for information exchange by giving meanings (semantics), in a manner understandable by machines, to the content of documents on the Web. The Semantic Web extends the World Wide Web through the use of standards, markup languages and related processing tools. One of the main components of this initiative is capturing the representation of knowledge (which reflects a user's interest) in a formal way (http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/sw).","Because of this initiative, several public sector organizations and private sector companies have been working on building ontologies that formally capture rich meta-data. If used appropriately, these meta-data structures can help users analyze text content. This can be done formally in the areas of user interest. A high level system flow diagram is shown in , which illustrates the use of ontologies for analysis of textual information. Here, a user creates one or more ontologies, which are used in an analytical engine, along with text or database input. The results can be generated in a graphical form, e.g., graphs and charts, which can then be analyzed by the same or different user.","Thesauri are widely thought of as special purpose ontologies where classes\/objects are called \u201cterms\u201d with a limited set of relationships between these terms, as defined in the ANSI\/NISO Z39.19-2003 US standard entitled \u201cGuidelines for the Construction, Format, and Management of Monolingual Thesauri\u201d and its equivalent international standard ISO 2788. Unlike ontologies, which allow any user-defined relationship between classes, thesauri allow only the following relationships between terms:","BT=broader term","BTG=broader term (generic)","BTI=broader term (instance)","BTP=broader term (partitive)","GS=generic structure","HN=history note","NT=narrower term","NTG=narrower term (generic)","NTI=narrower term (instance)","NTP=narrower term (partitive)","RT=related term","SEE=equivalent to U (USE)","SN=scope note","TT=top term","U=use","UF=used for","UF+=used for . . . and . . .","USE+=use . . . and . . .","X=see from (equivalent to UF); reciprocal of see","Based on the fact that thesauri are specific instances of ontologies, the method described herein for mapping ontologies to concept semantic networks (CSNs) can be used to map thesauri to CSNs as well.","A concept semantic network can be viewed as a set of ideas or concepts that are interrelated and represent one's beliefs about a certain topic. Humans develop ideas or concepts about almost every topic and these concepts can change as people learn more about these topics. A CSN becomes very useful in text analytics where users need not think about \u201ckeywords\u201d like search engines do but rather about concepts. Once a concept is defined, the definition can be reused multiple times.  shows an example CSN that has definitions for \u201cAutomobile,\u201d \u201cUS Automobile,\u201d and \u201cImported Automobile\u201d concepts. Notice that \u201cAutomobile\u201d is defined in terms of the latter two concepts. Also \u201cUS Automobile\u201d and \u201cImported Automobile\u201d are in turn defined in terms of other concepts. According to the definition given in , when user uses \u201cAutomobile\u201d he or she in fact means \u201cUS Automobiles\u201d and \u201cImported Automobiles\u201d which, in turn, get resolved to \u201cFord\u201d and \u201cToyota\u201d respectively. Of course a more complete definition might have included all US automobiles and all imported automobiles.","In other words, a concept can be defined in terms of other concepts. Another example is the concept \u201cNorth America\u201d which can be defined in terms of concepts \u201cUSA,\u201d \u201cCanada,\u201d and \u201cMexico.\u201d Recursively, any of these three concepts can be defined in terms of other concepts. These multi-level definitions build what is called a concept-hierarchy.","A concept can be part of multiple concept hierarchies. For example the concept \u201cNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization\u201d can be defined in terms of concepts representing member countries which include \u201cUSA\u201d and \u201cCanada.\u201d Now we have \u201cUSA\u201d and \u201cCanada\u201d as members of two concept hierarchies. A concept semantic network may contain one or more concept hierarchies. A valid concepts grammar is described in Appendix II.","Concepts can be as simple as a single word or a phrase, or can be a complete hierarchy, as shown in the above examples. A concept may also be a complex construct of other concepts linked using logical operators such as \u201cAND,\u201d \u201cOR,\u201d and \u201cNOT.\u201d Using the above example one could define a new concept of \u201cToyota AND Ford NOT Honda.\u201d A complex concept can be resolved by substituting the definitions of its sub-concepts. Appendix II provides an example of a formal grammar for complex concepts. Once simple concepts are extracted from ontologies, they can be used to construct complex concepts within a CSN to provide a new level of comprehensiveness that is not possible in ontologies.","As indicated above, ontologies are developed mainly for machine consumption, which makes them less useful for human users despite their rich content. On the other hand, concept semantic networks are more user-oriented. Users are accustomed to view things as related \u201cconcepts\u201d or \u201cideas.\u201d One of the challenges that face CSN users is how to create CSNs and maintain them effectively. This challenge can be overcome with variable degrees of success using one or more of the following approaches:\n\n","Examples of widely accepted ontology languages include DAML (DARPA Agent Markup Language) and OWL. Ontolgies include two parts; one that deals with capturing definitions of terms which cover classes, subclasses, properties, restrictions, and individual objects and a second part that addresses inference and logical implications. The first part of the language (definitions) is used primarily to establish the mapping between ontologies and CSNs.","Before explaining the conversion process, it is important to highlight some of the main differences between ontologies and CSNs, which will also clarify-some of the conversion steps.\n\n","To illustrate the conversion process, an ontology about digital camera components will be used. This example is presented for illustration purposes only and does not limit the scope of the invention. The actual code for the digital camera ontology is presented in Appendix I. The ontology classes are: \u201cPurchaseableItem,\u201d \u201cMoney,\u201d \u201cRange,\u201d \u201cViewer,\u201d and \u201cWindow\u201d as shown in the .","The PurchaseableItem class has the subclasses \u201cBody,\u201d \u201cCamera,\u201d and \u201cLens.\u201d Also \u201cBody\u201d and \u201cCamera\u201d have a number of subclasses. The expanded list of classes and subclasses is shown in .","All ontology classes and subclasses are mapped into concepts in a CSN while preserving their hierarchical relationships. This means that the resulting CSN has the following concepts: \u201cPurchaseable Item,\u201d \u201cBody,\u201d \u201cBody With Non Adjustable Shutter Speed,\u201d \u201cCamera,\u201d \u201cLarge Format,\u201d \u201cSLR,\u201d \u201cDigital,\u201d \u201cLens,\u201d \u201cMoney,\u201d \u201cRange,\u201d \u201cViewer,\u201d and \u201cWindow.\u201d These concepts are shown in the list view of .","Note that a \u201cpart\u201d concept is also shown, though it was not one of the ontology classes or subclasses, but this will be explained later. Notice also that in an ontology, class and subclass names are made of a connected string (with no white spaces) as required by the ontology language specifications. In a CSN, there is no such restriction and therefore, during the conversion process, connected multiword strings are split into multiple words to provide a more user friendly interface. Bear in mind that ontologies are more machine oriented while CSNs are for human user consumption and so they are expected to be user friendly.","After identifying the concepts, the ontology-CSN conversion method identifies the concept type to associate with every concept. Several options are available to accomplish this task. The conversion mechanism may interact with the user to capture his\/her preference as to which option to choose. Options can include:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0080"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},"In addition to representing class hierarchies, ontologies are capable of representing property hierarchies. One can define a property with a number of sub-properties recursively, which establishes a hierarchy. Using a ontology-CSN conversion utility, property hierarchies are converted into concept hierarchies. In the digital camera example, \u201cpart\u201d is a property that has two subproperties; namely, \u201clens\u201d and \u201cbody.\u201d This hierarchy is also converted to a concept hierarchy with a parent concept of \u201cpart\u201d and two child concepts of \u201clens\u201d and \u201cbody.\u201d","One of the major differences between an ontology and a CSN is inheritance. Ontologies allow downward inheritance of class properties to all its subclasses. In a CSN, concept properties may have to be explicitly defined. In other words, though concepts may be related with \u201cis-a\u201d relationships in a CSN, this does not necessarily imply inheriting ancestor's properties. The ontology-CSN conversion utility allows users the option to convert class properties as \u201cchild\u201d concepts of the concept that maps to that class. If a user uses this option, properties will also be considered as child concepts of the other child concepts that map to the subclasses of the main class. To illustrate this, consider the digital camera example. The \u201cCamera\u201d class has \u201cDigital\u201d and \u201cLarge-Format\u201d as two subclasses and \u201cbody,\u201d \u201cview Finder,\u201d \u201clens,\u201d and \u201ccost\u201d as properties. The conversion is done such that \u201cCamera\u201d is the parent concept and \u201cDigital\u201d and \u201cLarge-Format\u201d are two of its child concepts. A user can also choose to include properties as child concepts in which case \u201cbody,\u201d \u201cview Finder,\u201d \u201clens,\u201d and \u201ccost\u201d also become child concepts of \u201cCamera,\u201d as illustrated in . Since \u201cDigital\u201d and \u201cLarge-Format\u201d are subclasses of \u201cCamera,\u201d they inherit its properties. Regarding the CSN shown in , \u201cbody,\u201d \u201cview Finder,\u201d \u201clens,\u201d and \u201ccost\u201d are also child concepts of \u201cDigital\u201d and \u201cLarge-Format.\u201d In other words, a user can preserve the inheritance of properties feature of ontologies when CSNs are created.","The following example, shown in Table 1, explains a part of an aviation thesaurus that deals with \u201cair conditioning systems.\u201d \u201cAir cycle machines\u201d, \u201cducts\u201d, \u201cequipment cooling fans\u201d, heat exchangers\u201d, \u201cmixing valves\u201d, \u201cpacks\u201d, and \u201crecirculation fans\u201d are narrower terms with respect to \u201cair conditioning systems\u201d. Not only is there a great deal of redundancy in describing the relationships between terms, but users cannot use other types of criteria to group terms. When this is converted into a concept bank, as shown in Table 2, the representation is more compressed and allows the user to provide \u201cconcept types\u201d for every concept. The types can be used for grouping and browsing purposes. In this example the user chooses to assign, whether manually or automatically (using a lexical database), the concept type \u201cParts\u201d to the terms \u201cfans\u201d and \u201cducts\u201d. The user can always browse concepts using \u201cPart\u201d which was not possible using thesauri.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0084"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE

automated conversion may not perfectly satisfy every end-user need. Therefore, it can be useful to have an easy to use user interface that allows users to edit the generated CSN before it is saved. Users may also want to take advantage of having their concepts in a CSN and start building more complex concepts of the basic concepts extracted from the ontology. The conversion utility could provide a GUI similar to the one presented in  to enable users to customize concept definitions and relationships. Internally CSNs can be stored in relational tables with an option to save or export them into other formats, such as XML, CSV, and Excel.","In an embodiment of the present invention, the system and components of the present invention described herein are implemented using well known computers, such as a computer  shown in .
