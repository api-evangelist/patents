In addition to the illustrative aspects, embodiments, and features described above, further aspects, embodiments, and features will become apparent by reference to the drawings and the following detailed description.","In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. In the drawings, similar symbols typically identify similar components, unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description, drawings, and claims are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented here.","Advances in computing technologies and related technologies (e.g., visual display technology, battery technology, etc.) in recent years have greatly facilitated in the development of computing devices having increasingly smaller form factors while still maintaining exceptional processing capabilities. Examples of such mobile computing devices include, for example, laptops, Netbooks, tablet computers (i.e., \u201cslate\u201d computers), e-readers, Smartphones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and so forth. Because of their compactness, such mobile computing devices (herein \u201ccomputing devices\u201d) are becoming much easier to share among a plurality of users. That is, due to their small form factors, such devices allow owners of such devices to physically share such devices with friends, family, co-workers, clients, and so forth.","Unfortunately, when such devices are shared amongst a plurality of users having varying levels of accessing rights to such devices, confidential data\/applications that are accessible through such devices may also become available to all of these users. For example, suppose a primary user (e.g., an owner) of a mobile computing device wants to show a particular electronic document being displayed through her computing device to a group of friends by handing-off the computing device to the group of friends. In doing so, the group of friends, in addition to being able to view the electronic document, may also have access to many other things that the primary user may not want the group of friends to have access to. For example, upon handed the computing device, the group of friends may be able to view any confidential documents, images, applications, websites, passwords, and so forth, that may be open or running at the time that the computing device was handed over to the group of friends. Even worse, the group of friends may be able to not just access open applications and content, but may be able to retrieve\/use\/modify any content (e.g., documents, image files, audio files, etc.) or any applications that may be stored in the computing device.","There are countless other situations, some of which will be described herein, where a mobile computing device (e.g., a tablet computer, an e-reader, a Smartphone, a laptop, and so forth) may be shared between a plurality of users having varying degrees of accessing rights to the device. Such situations could potentially result in comprising the confidentiality\/usage of data\/applications that may be stored\/accessed through such a device.","In accordance with various embodiments, computationally implemented methods, systems, and articles of manufacture are presented that can provide a particular level of access, via a computing device, to one or more items (e.g., electronic documents or files including textual, image, audio or video files, applications, passwords, and so forth) in response, at least in part, to determining which of a plurality of users detected in the proximate vicinity of the computing device has primary control of the computing device. Note that although the \u201ccomputing device\u201d to be described herein will be described\/illustrated as being a tablet computer, in alternative embodiments, a computing device may take on other form factors including a variety of other types of portable\/mobile computing devices including, for example, a Smartphone, a laptop computer, a Netbook, an e-reader, a personal digital assistant (PDA), and so forth.","Referring now to  illustrating a computing device * in the form of a tablet computer in accordance with various embodiments. For the embodiments, the computing device * may have at least a first side  that includes a display screen  (e.g., a touch screen), and a second side  (not visible in  but shown in ) that is opposite of the first side . As further illustrated in , the first side  of the computing device * may include a center  (note that in  a center axis has been drawn-in that represents an axis originating from the center  of the first side  of the computing device * and perpendicular to the surface of the display screen ). In various embodiments, the first side  of the computing device * may include one or more sensors including one or more visual sensors  (e.g., one or more cameras including one or more digital cameras, webcams, infrared cameras, and\/or other types of image capturing devices) and\/or one or more audio sensors  (e.g., one or more microphones). Note that although the first side  of the computing device * of  is illustrated as having three visual sensors  and three audio sensors , in alternative embodiments, the first side  may include alternative number of visual sensors  and\/or audio sensors  than what is depicted in . Further, and although not shown in , in various embodiments, the second side  of the computing device * may also include one or more sensors in the form of one or more visual sensors  and\/or one or more audio sensors  (see, for example, , which shows at least one visual sensor  and at least one audio sensor  included in the second side  of the computing device *).","As will be further described herein, in various embodiments, data provided by such sensors (e.g., one or more visual sensors  and\/or one or more audio sensors ), as well as, in some cases, data provided by one or more movement sensors  that may be included with the computing device *(see illustrating some of the types of sensors  that may be included with the computing device *), may be used to detect at least the presence of one or more users (e.g., one or more persons) in the proximate vicinity (e.g., immediate surrounding area) of the computing device *. Examples of movement sensors  include, for example, accelerometers, inertia sensors, gyroscopes, and so forth. In some embodiments, data from such sensors  may also be used\/analyzed in order to detect the specific spatial locations, relative to the computing device *, of those users detected in the proximate vicinity of the computing device *. Still further, data from such sensors  may be used in some embodiments in order to identify users who have been detected as being in the proximate vicinity of the computing device *.","As will be further described herein, the illustrated computing device * may employ the computationally implemented methods, systems, and articles of manufacture in accordance with various embodiments for providing a particular level of access to one or more items in response to determining automatically which of a plurality of users detected in the proximate vicinity of the computing device * has primary control of the computing device *. In particular, the computing device * may be endowed with logic that is designed to, among other things, detect the presence of a plurality of users in the proximate vicinity of the computing device *, determine which of the plurality of users detected in the proximate vicinity of a computing device * has primary control of the computing device *, and provide a particular level of access, via the computing device *, to one or more items, the particular level of access to be provided to the one or more items being in response, at least in part, to determining which of the plurality of users detected in the proximate vicinity of the computing device * has primary control of the computing device *. As will be further described herein, in various embodiments, the determination as to which of the plurality of users detected in the proximate vicinity of the computing device * has \u201cprimary control\u201d of the computing device * may be based on data provided by one or more sensors  (see ) that may be included with the computing device *.","Turning briefly to and , and are two block diagrams representing two different implementations of the computing device * of  illustrated in as computing device \u2032 and in as computing device \u2033. In particular, and as will be further described herein, illustrates a computing device \u2032 that is the \u201chardwired\u201d or \u201chard\u201d implementation of the computing device * of  in which certain logic modules including a primary control determining module \u2032, an access providing module \u2032, and an alert generating module \u2032 are implemented using purely hardware or circuitry components (e.g., application specific integrated circuit or ASIC). In contrast, illustrates a computing device \u2033 that is the \u201csoft\u201d implementation of the computing device * of  in which certain logic modules including a primary control determining module \u2033, an access providing module \u2033, and an alert generating module \u2033 are implemented using electronic circuitry such as one or more processors (e.g., microprocessors, controllers, etc.) executing one or more programming instructions (e.g., software).","For purposes of the following, \u201c*\u201d represents a wildcard. Thus, references in the following to \u201ccomputing device *\u201d may be in reference to the computing device \u2032 of or to the computing device \u2033 of unless indicated otherwise. It should be noted that the two implementations of the computing device * of  illustrated in and are two extreme or opposite versions\/implementations of the computing device * of  in which certain logic modules (e.g., the primary control determining module *, the access providing module *, and the alert generating module *) are implemented using purely \u201chardware solutions\u201d (e.g., implemented using circuitry such as ASIC) as illustrated in , or using purely \u201csoftware solutions\u201d (e.g., implemented using software executed by hardware such as one or more processors) as illustrated in . That is, those having ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the computing device * or at least the logic modules (e.g., the primary control determining module *, the access providing module *, and the alert generating module *) illustrated in and ,, and may be implemented using essentially any combination of hardware and software solutions. Since, there are many ways of combining hardware, software, and\/or firmware in order to implement the various logic modules (e.g., the primary control determining module *, the access providing module *, and the alert generating module *), only the two extreme implementations illustrated in and (e.g., the purely hardware solution as illustrated in and the software solution of ) are illustrated here. It should be noted here that with respect to the \u201csoft\u201d implementation illustrated in , hardware such as one or more processors  are still needed in order to execute the software. Further details related to the two implementations of computing device * illustrated in and will be provided in greater detail below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIGS. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"i":["a ","d ","a ","a","b","c ","a","b","c"],"b":["2","20","10","200","20","20","20","10","10","20","20","20","10","10","10","10","120","124","124","122","20","10"]},"Various techniques may be employed in order to detect presence of users * in the proximate vicinity of the computing device *. For example, in some cases, a facial recognition system or software in combination with visual data provided by one or more visual sensors  (e.g., image capturing devices such as webcams and\/or digital cameras) may be employed in order to detect whether the faces of one or more users * are in the proximate vicinity of the computing device *. Alternatively or additionally, a voice recognition system or software in combination with audio data provided by one or more audio sensors  (e.g., microphones) may be employed in order to detect whether the voices of one or more users * are detected to have originated from the proximate vicinity of the computing device *. In still other cases, movement data provided by one or more movement sensors  may additionally or alternatively be used in order to detect whether the computing device * is exhibiting one or more movements (e.g., a heart or pulse rate) that is determined to be associated with one or more users *(e.g., detection of such signature movements may at least infer that the computing device * is in physical contact with the one or more users *). As alluded to above, in some cases, data from a variety of sensors  (e.g., movement sensors , visual sensors  and\/or audio sensors ) may be employed in order to determine whether one or more users * are in the proximate vicinity of the computing device *.","If the computing device *, or the logic endowed with the computing device *, determines that a plurality of users * are in the proximate vicinity of the computing device *, then that computing device * may be designed to determine which of the plurality of users * determined to be in the proximate vicinity of the computing device * has primary control of the computing device *. In some embodiments, such a determination may be automatically executed whenever the computing device *(or its endowed logic) detects that there are a plurality of users * in the proximate vicinity of the computing device *. In some alternative embodiments, and as will be described below, the determination as to which of a plurality of users * detected in the proximate vicinity of the computing device * has primary control of the computing device * may be automatically done whenever a user *(e.g., a primary user or a secondary user having inferior access rights than the primary user) is detected relinquishing primary control of the computing device *. In various embodiments, the \u201cproximate vicinity\u201d of the computing device * may be the immediate area surrounding the computing device * from which a user * may access (e.g., hear, see, use, manipulate, modify, and so forth) one or more items (e.g., electronic files or documents, software applications, audio or image files, passwords, and so forth) through the computing device *.","As will be further described herein, the determination as to which users * detected in the proximate vicinity of the computing device * has primary control of the computing device * may be accomplished in a number of different ways in various alternative embodiments. For example, in some embodiments, the determination as to which users * detected in the proximate vicinity of the computing device * has primary control of the computing device * may involve at least initially detecting or determining the specific spatial locations of the plurality of users * with respect to the computing device *. In some cases, this may mean detecting the specific spatial locations of the faces or eyes of each of the plurality of the users * with respect to the computing device * or with respect to the specific orientation of the computing device *. That is, typically those users * detected as being on the backside or second side  (see ) of the computing device * can be discounted as having primary control when determining which users * has primary control of the computing device * since users * who are determined to be on the second side  of the computing device * will have limited access at least to the display screen . Thus, a strong inference may be made that those users * detected as being on the second side  of the computing device  will not have primary control of the computing device *.","In various embodiments, the determination of the specific spatial locations of the plurality of users *(e.g., specific spatial locations of the faces or eyes of the plurality of users *) may be based on visual data provided by one or more visual sensors  and\/or based on audio data provided by one or more audio sensors . By employing, for example, parallax techniques, and based on data provided by, for example, one or more visual sensors  (providing image data from different angles) the specific spatial locations of each of the plurality of users * detected in the proximate vicinity of the computing device * may be determined at least with respect to the computing device *(e.g., determined relative to the specific spatial location of the computing device *). In some embodiments, the computing device * may employ multiple visual sensors  and\/or multiple audio sensors  in order to more accurately determine the specific spatial locations of each of the detected users *(e.g., parallax techniques for determining distances typically require a minimum of two different lines of sight) relative to the location of the computing device *. Thus, more accurate results may be obtained by using data provided by multiple sensors  (e.g., multiple visual sensors ).","After the computing device *(or at least the logic endowed with the computing device *) determines the specific spatial locations of each of the plurality of users * detected in the proximate vicinity of the computing device *, a determination may be made by the computing device * as to which of the detected users * has primary control of the computing device * based on the specific spatial locations of the plurality of users *. In order to make such a determination, in some embodiments, the computing device * may be designed to determine which user * detected to be in the proximate vicinity of the computing device * is actually nearest or closest to the computing device *. More particularly, in some cases, the computing device * maybe designed to determine which of the plurality of users * is nearest to the first side  (or the display screen ) of the computing device *. In various embodiments, those users * determined to be nearest to the computing device * or at least to the first side  of the computing device * may be determined to have primary control of the computing device *. In some embodiments, in order to determine which user * has primary control of the computing device *, the computing device *(or at least the logic endowed with the computing device *) may be additionally or alternatively designed to determine which of the plurality of users * is or are spatially located principally on the side of the first side of the computing device *. For these embodiments, the computing device * may be designed to determine which of the plurality of users *(e.g., determine which of the eyes or faces of the plurality of users *) is or are located centered on the 1side or spatially centered closest to the center  of the first side  of the computing device *. For example, in , user appears to be nearest to the center  of the first side  and would, therefore, be considered to have primary control of the computing device *.","In some embodiments, in order to determine which of the plurality of users * detected in the proximate vicinity of the computing device * has primary control of the computing device *, the computing device * may be designed to detect whether the computing device is exhibiting one or more movements that at least substantially matches with one or more signature movements (e.g., heart or pulse rate) of one or more users * detected as being in the proximate vicinity of the computing device *. By making such a determination, an inference may be made that those users *, whose signature movements appears to be exhibited by the computing device *, may be in contact with the computing device *, and therefore, has primary control of the computing device *.","Note that in cases where multiple users * are deemed to have primary control of the computing device *, such as in the example scenario illustrated in where two users and are located equal distance from the first side  of the computing device *, the computing device * may be designed to use tie-breaker rules in order to provide the proper level of access to the one or more items as will be described herein. For example, and as will be further described below, in some embodiments, if two or more users * are determined to have primary control of the computing device *(e.g., the faces of multiple users * are detected to be equal distance from the first side  of the computing device *), then the access to be provided to the one or more items will be based on the access rights of the user * having the least or lowest access rights among the two or more users * who were determined to have primary control of the computing device *. In alternative embodiments, however, the access to be provided to the one or more items will be based on the access rights of the user * having the highest access rights among the two or more users * who were determined to have primary control of the computing device *.","In addition to determining which of the plurality of users * detected in the proximate vicinity of the computing device * has primary control of the computing device *, the computing device (or at least the logic endowed with the computing device *) may be designed to determine the identities of the one or more users determined to have primary control of the computing device *. That is, at a minimum, the computing device * should be able to determine whether those users * determined to have primary control of the computing device * is or are primary users (e.g., users such as owners who have superior access rights to the computing device * or to the content\/applications that are available through the computing'device *) or secondary users (e.g., users having access rights that are inferior to those of a primary user). Such a determination may be made prior to, during, or after determining which of the plurality of users * detected in the proximate vicinity of the computing device * has primary control of the computing device *.","At this time, it should be noted that although only two groups of users (e.g., primary and second users) having two distinct levels of accessing rights thus far have been discussed for illustrative purposes and for ease of understanding, those having ordinary skill in the arts will recognize that users * of the computing device * could very well be classified into three or more groups of users having three or more distinct levels of accessing rights to the computing device *(or to the content\/applications accessed through the computing device *). Thus, the general concepts that were described here although were directed to systems where only two levels of access rights exists, these concepts could be equally applicable to scenarios in which three or more groups of users having three or more distinct levels of accessing rights exists.","In some embodiments, the computing device * rather than merely determining whether a particular user * detected as having primary control of the computing device * is a primary user or a secondary user, may determine the actual identity (e.g., legal name, username, and so forth) of the particular user *. Such a determination may be made based on data provided by one or more sensors  (e.g., one or more movement sensors , one or more visual sensors , and\/or one or more audio sensors ) and using, for example, facial or voice recognition application. Also, when one or more movement sensors  (e.g., accelerometers, inertia devices, gyroscopes, and so forth) are employed, the movement data provided by the one or more movement sensors  may be used in order to determine whether the computing device * is exhibiting movements that at least substantially matches with the signature movements (e.g., heart or pulse rate) of one or more identifiable persons. If the computing device * does indeed exhibit movements that match with the signature movements of a specific identifiable person then the identification of the user * having primary control of the computing device * may be made (although may not be conclusive since signature movements of each identifiable person may not be unique to that particular identifiable person).","After determining which user * has primary control of the computing device *, the computing device * as alluded to earlier may be designed to provide a particular level of access, via the computing device, to one or more items, the particular level of access to be provided being in response, at least in part, to determining which of the plurality of users * detected in the proximate vicinity of the computing device * has primary control of the computing device *. The type of access to be provided to the one or more items will depend on a number of factors including, for example, what types of items is access to be or not to be provided to, and the security preferences of the owner of the computing device * or system\/network administrators. At least three levels of access to the one or more items may be provided via the computing device * in response to determining which of the plurality of users * detected in the proximate vicinity of the computing device * has primary control of the computing device *. The three levels of access that could be provided to the one or more items are full access, partial access, and\/or no access.","Further, depending on whether the one or more items are, for example, textual, image, or audio files, the access that may or may not be provided may be related to visual and\/or audio access to the one or more items. In cases where the one or more items are, for example, one or more productivity documents (e.g., word processing documents, spreadsheet documents, and so forth), the access that is or is not to be provided may be the right to edit or not edit such documents (e.g., in other words providing the documents in read-only format, partially editable format, or fully editable format). In embodiments where the one or more items include one or more software applications, the access that may or may not be provided to the one or more items include access to one or more functionalities of the one or more software applications. A more detailed discussion related to the various types of access that may or may not be provided to the one or more items will be provided below with respect to the operations and processes to be described herein.","In some embodiments, the particular level of access to be provided to the one or more items may, in addition to being in response to determining which of the users * has primary control of the computing device *, may be in response to ascertaining that the one or more items are affiliated with one or more particular entities (e.g., persons, businesses, websites, and so forth). For example, suppose a primary user of a computing device * wishes to conceal her relationship with a particular entity. In order to keep such a relationship confidential, the computing device *(or the logic endowed with the computing device *) may be designed to obfuscate any items that are ascertained to be affiliated with the particular entity whenever the computing device * is in the primary control of, for example, a secondary user. Thus, when the computing device * detects that a secondary user has primary control of the computing device *, the computing device * may seek out all items that are ascertained to be affiliated with the particular entity, and to restrict access to such items by hiding\/disguising these items. Further, upon detecting that the primary control of the computing device * has been returned to the primary user, greater access may be provided to the items ascertained to be affiliated with the particular entity. A more detailed discussion related to the above \u201cascertainment\u201d discussion will be provided below with respect to the operations and processes to be described herein.","In some embodiments, the computing device * in response to providing the particular level of access to the one or more items may generate an alert that indicates that the computing device * has been reconfigured to provide the particular level of access to the one or more items. By generating such an alert, users * may be notified to the change in the configuration of the computing device *(e.g., to indicate that the computing device is in a \u201csafe\u201d or \u201csecure\u201d mode or to indicate that the computing device * is in an \u201cunrestricted\u201d mode). Various types of alerts may be generated in various alternative embodiments including, for example, an audio alert (e.g., a ring, a buzz, or a voice with a vocal message), a particular vibration (e.g., the computing device * generating a particular vibration), and\/or visual alerts (e.g., a symbol displayed on a display screen  of the computing device * or the background color of the display screen  changing to a pre-defined color).","Turning now to illustrating another exemplary environment  in which primary control of the computing device * of  is being relinquished by a user by transferring the computing device * to a plurality of users and . In various embodiments, user may be a primary user or a secondary user of the computing device *. Similarly, each of the users and may be a primary user or a secondary user. In various embodiments, the computing device * may be designed to detect that the primary control of the computing device * is being relinquished by user based on, for example, data provided by one or more sensors  (e.g., one or more movement sensors , one or more visual sensors , and\/or one or more audio sensors ). In some embodiments, the computing devices * may additionally or alternatively be designed to detect the presence of multiple users and in the proximate vicinity of the computing device *.","The detection of the users and in the proximate vicinity of the computing device * in some cases may be based on data provided by one or more sensors  (e.g., one or more movement sensors , one or more visual sensors , and\/or one or more audio sensors ). After detecting the presence of multiple users and in the proximate vicinity of the computing device *, the computing device * may be designed to determine which of the multiple users and has primary control of the computing device *. In various embodiments, such a determination may be based on the spatial locations of the multiple users and (e.g., spatial locations of the faces or eyes of users and ) relative to, for example, the specific orientation of the computing device *(e.g., relative to the first side  of the computing device *). For example, in some cases, the computing device * may be designed to determine which of the users and (or the faces or eyes of the users and  detected in the proximate vicinity of the computing device * is centered on the first side  of the computing device * or centered nearest to the center  (e.g., nearest to center axis ) of first side  of the computing device *.

Specific examples of operably couplable include but are not limited to physically mateable and\/or physically interacting components and\/or wirelessly interactable and\/or wirelessly interacting components and\/or logically interacting and\/or logically interactable components.","While particular aspects of the present subject matter described herein have been shown and described, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that, based upon the teachings herein, changes and modifications may be made without departing from the subject matter described herein and its broader aspects and, therefore, the appended claims are to encompass within their scope all such changes and modifications as are within the true spirit and scope of the subject matter described herein. Furthermore, it is to be understood that the invention is defined by the appended claims.","It will be understood by those within the art that, in general, terms used herein, and especially in the appended claims (e.g., bodies of the appended claims) are generally intended as \u201copen\u201d terms (e.g., the term \u201cincluding\u201d should be interpreted as \u201cincluding but not limited to,\u201d the term \u201chaving\u201d should be interpreted as \u201chaving at least,\u201d the term \u201cincludes\u201d should be interpreted as \u201cincludes but is not limited to,\u201d etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases \u201cat least one\u201d and \u201cone or more\u201d to introduce claim recitations. However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to inventions containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases \u201cone or more\u201d or \u201cat least one\u201d and indefinite articles such as \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d (e.g., \u201ca\u201d and\/or \u201can\u201d should typically be interpreted to mean \u201cat least one\u201d or \u201cone or more\u201d); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations.","In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should typically be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of \u201ctwo recitations,\u201d without other modifiers, typically means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations). Furthermore, in those instances where a convention analogous to \u201cat least one of A, B, and C, etc.\u201d is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., \u201ca system having at least one of A, B, and C\u201d would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and\/or A, B, and C together, etc.).","In those instances where a convention analogous to \u201cat least one of A, B, or C, etc.\u201d is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., \u201ca system having at least one of A, B, or C\u201d would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and\/or A, B, and C together, etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that virtually any disjunctive word and\/or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms, whether in the description, claims, or drawings, should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms. For example, the phrase \u201cA or B\u201d will be understood to include the possibilities of \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d or \u201cA and B.\u201d"],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"i":["a ","a","b","c "],"b":["200","20","20","20","10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"i":["b ","d ","e ","f.
