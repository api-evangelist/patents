No. 7,191,193, filed on Jan. 2, 2003, entitled \u201cAutomatic Digital Music Library Builder.\u201d","Embodiments of the present invention relate to provisioning and tracking of media content, and to revenue disbursement to content owners, content distributors, and parties involved in content provisioning.","Traditionally, content such as music and movies was packaged in physical media such as records and cassette tapes. Consumers were accustomed to convenience in enjoying content they purchased; they were able to access their content any time of day and were able to take their content with them wherever they traveled. Content was typically organized on shelves and accessed like books. With the advent of computers and digital content, content was packaged in storage media such as CDs, player devices and computer disks. CDs were organized on shelves and content stored in player devices and computer disks was organized as files and folders.","More recently with the advent of content streaming, consumers are now having content played to them as live broadcasts from content servers. The shift in paradigm from physically packaged content to content that is not stored on a consumer device, but instead streamed for playing, has been largely perceived by consumers as limiting. Despite the advantage of having access to enormous collections of content stored on content servers, consumers still prefer to have something physical in hand with content stored thereon, be it a CD or a player device or a computer.","Consumer preference to have content physically in hand is a carryover from the tradition of the home being a consumer's central archive, where he enjoys his music and from where he takes the music of his choice with him when he is away from the home. In order to attract a consumer to the idea of remote content servers being his archive, in addition to or instead of his home, compelling new services must be offered that surpass the traditional services.","Embodiments of the present invention concern a global content service that provisions content to consumers, provides access to their content wherever the consumers are located, organizes their content, enforces rights management to content, tracks content usage, and disburses revenue to content providers, content distributors, content aggregators and other vendors in the purchase and supply chains. Content, as used herein, includes inter alia music, video, books and games.","In a broad perspective, embodiments of the present invention generate a data structure that serves as a registry, whereby details of each piece of content acquired by a consumer from any of a plurality of sources is recorded, and content acquired by members of a common household is aggregated. In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, consumers are associated with households even when consumer and household data is obtained from disparate sources that may not provide identical data. Additionally, content subscriptions acquired by the consumer and the consumer's family are also recorded in the registry. Content and content subscriptions may be acquired at distributor stores, at kiosks, on-line via Internet e-commerce web sites, via cable and satellite stations, via peer-to-peer file sharing applications, and wirelessly over the air. Content may also be acquired from recorder devices. In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, content is registered even if the content metadata is obtained from different sources that may not be identical.","Similarly, each player and recorder device purchased by the consumer is recorded in the registry. Player devices, as used herein, include inter alia home entertainment systems, mobile phones, portable player devices, and automobile decks. Recorder devices, as used herein, include inter alia home entertainment systems, computers, audio recorders, video recorders and digital television recorders. As such, the registry registers all content available to the consumer and to the consumer's family members, and registers all content players and recorders owned by the consumer and by the consumer's family members.","On the supply side, for each piece of content recorded in the registry, a list of content aggregators that supply the piece of content is indicated. As such, the data structure identifies all sources from which the consumer and his family members can access the content for which they have rights.","Embodiments of the present invention enable the consumer to access his content from his home and from many locations away from his home, including inter alia automobiles and other vehicles, hotels and resorts, and offices. In one embodiment of the present invention, a mobile consumer, who is away from home, accesses and navigates his content and his content playlists, using his cellular telephone, and selects content to be played. The selected content is streamed to an embedded player in the consumer's cellular telephone upon demand, from one or more content servers.","In general, for each piece of content requested by the consumer to be played on a specific player device, an appropriate supply source is identified, based on the player device, based on the consumer's location, based on the requested content, and based on rules defined for the requested content regarding specific supply sources; and the content is delivered to the consumer from the supply source. Embodiments of the present invention ensure that the content is delivered to the consumer in a format and at a bandwidth compatible with the specific player device, the player device software, and the player device Internet connection. Embodiments of the present invention also enforce rights management by authenticating each consumer vis a vis the content that he currently has rights to.","On the disbursement side, embodiments of the present invention track the consumer's usage of content, and generate a log of content usage for purposes of revenue disbursement. At the end of each payment period, fees paid by the consumer, fees paid by advertisers, and other fees paid into the service are allocated among various content owners, distributors, aggregators and other stakeholders in the purchase and supply chains, based on the usage log, and accounting reports are generated for each stakeholder.","In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, content associations are identified, whereby a first piece of content is a trigger for purchase of a second piece of content. For example, a consumer playing a movie on his set-top cable box may decide to purchase a soundtrack for the movie. The movie is thus associated with the soundtrack. In turn, revenue generated by the soundtrack is shared with stakeholders for the movie.","Embodiments of the present invention may also be used advantageously for tracking usage and for merchandising. A first consumer, for example, who purchases a piece of content, may wish to share the content with friends. The content is shared from person to person along a sharing chain of friends, one friend sharing with the next friend. The content may be shared using digital copies of the content, or the content may be shared virtually. The shared copies may be trial copies, which can only be accessed in limited ways. Some or all of the friends along the chain may eventually purchase their own copy of the content, converting it from a trial copy to an owned copy. Using an embodiment of the present invention, when such a friend purchases a license to convert a shared trial copy of the content into an owned copy, information as to the original source of purchase as well as the friend's usage is tracked. This information can be used, inter alia, to allot a portion of the payment received from the friend to the original source of purchase, and to aggregate usage and purchase statistics.","There is thus provided in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention a method for provisioning content to users, including for each of a plurality of items of media content, maintaining information about one or more owners of the item of media content, and maintaining information about one or more providers of the item of media content, for each of a plurality of users, maintaining information

access his entire content collections and subscriptions, at any location where he may be. From the consumer's perspective, he has access to a virtual replica of his content archive, his content broadcast stations, and his content playlists, at his home, in his car, in his hotel room, and wherever he travels. His content archive is presented to him in an organized way for browsing and for access via any of a plurality of player devices, including inter alia his home entertainment systems, his media players, his cell phones, his automobile deck, a rented automobile deck, and a hotel in-room entertainment system.","The following definitions are employed throughout the specification.","CONTENT\u2014digital media including inter alia music, video, books and games.","CONTENT MAPPING\u2014determining for a designated piece of content and for a designated content media format, one or more IDs for uniquely identifying the designated piece of content.","CONTENT ROUTING\u2014determining an appropriate source from which to transmit designated content to a player device.","MEDIA SERVER\u2014a computer server that archives and provisions media.","NAMESPACE\u2014a range of identifiers that are associated uniquely with items, where items may be inter alia media content, player devices, consumers and households.","PLAYER DEVICE\u2014a media player including inter alia home entertainment systems, mobile phones, portable media players, software applications such as PC applications, and automobile decks.","PLAYLIST\u2014a sequence of pieces of content for playing on a player device.","RECORDER DEVICE\u2014a media recorder, including inter alia home entertainment systems, computers, audio recorders, video recorders and digital television recorders.","REGISTRY\u2014a central data store where users' inventories are listed.","TRACKING SERVER\u2014a computer server that tracks content-related events, including inter alia playbacks and purchases.","Consumers typically build themselves personal libraries of digital content, which are stored on memory units such as hard disk drives and removable memory cards. Digital content may be acquired through the Internet via subscription services and a la carte purchases, via peer-to-peer exchanges, and by converting songs from a compact disc (CD) and importing them into a content library.","Licenses for digital content may be acquired through several channels, including, inter alia,","(i) content purchased at a retail outlet store;","(ii) content purchased via the Internet from an online retailer;","(iii) content recorded onto a recorder device from broadcast, off-the-air;","(iv) content purchased through a recorder device from a licensing authority; and","(v) content purchased through a player device from a media kiosk.","Content for preview may be licensed from these same channels.","Digital content typically includes media data and auxiliary data, referred to as metadata, used to index the content within the consumer's library. For example, within MP3 audio files metadata is accessed through an ID3 tag, WMA audio files embed metadata within the files, and both file types can embed metadata within the filenames themselves. By indexing his content, a consumer can browse his library, search his library to find and access individual content therein, remove content and create playlists. Generally, player devices provide a user interface through which consumers view content metadata.","Reference is made to , which is a simplified block diagram of nine components of a content provisioning and revenue disbursement system , in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The components shown in  may be implemented in one or more server computers, in one or more client computers, or in both one or more server computers and one or more cooperating client computers.

Content scanner  is generally implemented on a home PC.","Content scanner  scans the consumer's PCs to generate a list of IDs of content resident thereon. Content scanner  also scans the consumer's PCs for media archives, such as iTunes databases, Windows Media Player databases, Napster databases and other such player databases, and for media playlists. Content scanner  also scans the consumer's PCs for podcasts that the consumer subscribes to and Internet radio station preferences.","Content scanner  sends scanned content information to content identifier , to identify or validate the identity of the scanned content. Content scanner  may send content metadata, or an excerpt of content, or content fingerprints, to content identifier .","With each content ID, content scanner  also determines a content status, including inter alia digital rights management data for the content, and time constraints for the content. Content scanner  verifies that digital rights managed content have valid licenses.","Content scanner  may additionally transmit content to a data store, referred to as a \u201cdigital locker\u201d, which acts as a remote backup of the consumer's content.","Content Identifier ","Shown in  is a content identifier , which identifies an aggregate of a consumer's entire content archive and content broadcast subscriptions. Content identifier  is generally implemented on a server computer. After content scanner  scans a consumer's PC to identify his media libraries, playlists and subscriptions, content scanner  sends the results to content identifier . Content identifier  identifies or validates identities of the scanned content. Content identifier  identifies content using a variety of methods, including inter alia lookup of content metadata in a reference database of metadata, and matching of a digital fingerprint of the media with a reference database of fingerprints.","Reference is made to , which is a simplified flowchart of a process for content identification, as performed by content identifier , in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The flowchart of  is divided into two columns. The left column indicates steps performed by a content scanner, such as content scanner , and the right column indicates steps performed by a content identifier, such as content identified .","At step  the content scanner scans a consumer's PC for media content that is stored therein, as described hereinabove. At step  the content scanner sends metadata and fingerprints for the media scanned at step  to the content identifier. At step  the content identifier selects a lookup method to identify the media, based on the data provided by the content scanner. At step  the content identifier identifies some or all of the media. At step  the content identifier sends the results of its identification at step  to the content scanner. At step  the content scanner uploads content that the content identifier was unable to identify to the digital locker. At step  the content scanner registers the content via registrar , as described in detail hereinbelow with reference to ","Namespace Mapper ","Shown in  is a namespace mapper . Namespace mapper  is generally implemented on a server computer. A \u201cnamespace\u201d is a range of identifiers that are associated uniquely with items, where items may be, inter alia, media content, player devices, consumers and households. In general, data obtained from multiple sources may not adhere to the same naming convention, and may further be inconsistent. \u201cNamespace mapping\u201d determines, for a designated item, one or more IDs for uniquely identifying the designated item.","In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, namespace mapper  aggregates information from multiple data sources, including, inter alia, information about media content, information about player devices, information about consumers, and information about companies and other stakeholders in the content purchase and supply chains. In order to disambiguate the information obtained from the multiple sources, namespace mapper  uniquely identifies data elements from the multiple sources, and associates them correctly within a centralized registry.","Namespace mapper  normalizes content data by mapping content to the reference data store of content used by content identifier . Thus content received from multiple sources with different and possibly incorrect metadata is assigned consistent and correct metadata.","Namespace mapper  performs namespace mapping in order to compare information obtained from two or more sources, and determine whether or not the information refers to the same entity. For example, a consumer, John W. Smith, may be identified by attributes including, inter alia, his name, address and cell phone number in a mobile carrier database. John purchases a CD from Best Buy, and because he is a member of Best Buy's rewards program, his purchase information is recorded in Best Buy's database. However, in the Best Buy database, John's name is listed as \u201cJohn Smith\u201d, without the middle initial, and his address is different than the address in the mobile carrier database. As such, when the consumer attributes provided by the two data sources are compared, namespace mapper  finds that:","Name\u2014the names do not exactly match: John W. Smith vs. John Smith;","Address\u2014the addresses do not match; and","Cell Phone Number\u2014the phone numbers match.","Namespace mapper  assigns weights to each attribute (Name, Address, Cell Phone Number), and combines the degrees of match according to the weights in order to determine whether or not the two sets of attributes correspond to the same person. Because a cell phone number is generally unique to an individual, this attribute is assigned a high weight; and since an address may not be unique to an individual, this attribute is assigned a lower weight. As such, based on the similarity of the two names, on the discrepant addresses, and on the identical cell phone numbers, namespace mapper  concludes that the two sets of attributes do in fact correspond to the same person. Thus the CD purchased by John at Best Buy is registered with John W. Smith's acquired content, as described hereinbelow.","Reference is made to , which is a simplified flowchart of a process for mapping consumer data to a consumer namespace, as performed by namespace mapper , in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The flowchart of  is divided into two columns. The left column indicates steps performed by a data source, and the right column indicates steps performed by a namespace mapper, such as namespace mapper .","At step  a mobile carrier provides consumer information to system . The example shown in  relates to the above John Smith example. The carrier's information includes the name spelled as \u201cJohn W. Smith\u201d, the address \u201c1 Elm Street, Anywhere, Okla.\u201d, and the phone number \u201c212-555-1234\u201d. At step  the namespace mapper checks if this customer is already known to system . If not, then the namespace mapper stores the customer data as a new customer record in a data store.","At step  a retailer, such as Best Buy, provides consumer information to system . The consumer information differs from the information provided by the mobile carrier at step  in the spelling of the consumer's name, and in the address. At step  the namespace mapper checks if this customer is already known to system  and compares the consumer information to information stored in the data store. At step , based on similarities in name and telephone number as indicated above, the namespace mapper concludes that the retailer's customer information corresponds to the mobile carrier's customer information. As such, the namespace mapper does not add a new customer record to the data store, but instead maps the retailer's customer information to the already existing record with the mobile carrier's customer information.","Reference is made to , which is a diagram illustrating namespace mapping for a consumer, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Shown in  is information about a consumer, Jonathan Samuels, arriving from four sources of information; namely, a mobile carrier database, a Best Buy rewards program database, an online store database, and a consumer home computer file directory. The mobile carrier database provides identifying information about Jonathan Samuels, such as his name, address and cell phone number. The Best Buy database provides identifying information about content that Jonathan Samuels purchases at a Best Buy retail store. The online store database provides information about content that Jonathan Samuels purchases online. The home computer file directory provides information about content that Jonathan Samuels has stored on his home computer. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the four sources are integrated in order to register all of Jonathan Samuels' content.","Reference is made to , which is a simplified flowchart for a process of mapping content data to a content namespace, as performed by namespace mapper , in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The flowchart of  is divided into two columns. The left column indicates steps performed by a data source, and the right column indicates steps performed by a namespace mapper, such as namespace mapper .","At step  a first data source, for example, a metadata aggregator, provides information about media content. In the example shown in , the information includes a song \u201cWooden Ships\u201d, an artist \u201cCrosby Stills and Nash\u201d, and an album \u201cSo Far\u201d. At step  the namespace mapper checks if the media information is already stored in a data store. For the case at hand, the data store has an already existing record with a song \u201cWooden Ships\u201d, an artist \u201cCrosby, Stills, Nash and Young\u201d, and an album \u201cSo Far\u201d. Based on similarities in the information, the namespace mapper concludes that the content matches similar content found in the data store, and identifies the content information received from the metadata aggregator as corresponding to the already existing record in the data store.","Similarly, at step  a second data source, for example, the on-line Napster content source, provides information about media content. The information differs from the information provided by the metadata aggregator at step  in that the artist name is \u201cCrosby Stills Nash & Young\u201d, and differs from the already existing record in the data store in that the artist is punctuated \u201cCrosby, Stills, Nash and Young\u201d.

SDK  may also operate without local inventory cache , in which case API  communicates with web services interface  via a translation layer .","Reference is made to , which is a simplified architecture diagram of a web services layer  of system , in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Web services layer  provides two types of services; namely, binary web services  and high level web services .","Binary web services  are provided for low-level client applications and devices, which may be limited in computational capability and\/or memory capacity. Such client devices generally provide a lightweight binary interface protocol. Such client devices may include inter alia low-end cellular phones or embedded devices. Binary web services are generally accessed via SDK  and not directly from client applications.","High level web services  provide an interface for more advanced applications and devices, such as PC applications and smartphones. High level web services are generally accessible from client applications, from SDK  and from backend systems of companies working with system , such as content distributors, registrants and other partners.","Messages from binary web services  are parsed by a message parser , and translated into high level web services by a message translator . The translated messages are in turn parsed by message parser , and passed to a semantic analyzer , which determines message validity and provides the messages to engine .","Messages from high level web services  do not require binary message parsing, and are provided directly to message parser  which, in turn, passes them to semantic layer .","Reference is made to , which is a simplified architecture diagram of an engine layer  and a database layer  of system , in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Engine layer  may contain multiple back end nodes . Each such back end node  services a specific subset of consumers or devices that communicate with system . The allocation of consumers and devices between different back end nodes  may be inter alia geographic or service based.","Database layer  contains a node-specific database  and a master back end database . Each instance of a node-specific database  contains data associated with and maintained by a single instance of a back end node . Such data may include inter alia consumer media data for the consumers serviced by the database's specific back end node .","Master back end database  exists in only one instance for system , and contains data that is common across all back end nodes .","Engine layer  also includes master back end , which serves to synchronize back end nodes  with master back end database .","It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the breakdown of engine  into back end nodes  and master back end  is one of several mechanisms that enable system  to achieve massively scalability.","Each instance of a back end node  includes a web services layer , a business logic layer , and a node synchronization manager .","Web services layer  receives communications from web services , Business logic layer  implements core business logic of system .","Node synchronization manager  provides data to master back end . Master back end  propagates data to master back end database , and then to other instances of node specific database .","It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that segmenting database layer  into non-specific databases  and master back end database , is one of several mechanisms enabling system  to be massively scalable.","Reference is made to , which is a simplified architecture diagram of a back end node  of system , in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Back end node  is an instance of back end node .","Back end node  receives requests from partners and player devices, as described hereinabove. Partners include inter alia owners of media content, and providers of media content. Player devices include inter alia mobile phones, portable media players and automobile decks. Back end node  uses a message dispatcher  to forward messages to a set of engine modules , such modules implementing the core business logic of engine .","Back end node  also contains a node-specific database , corresponding to node-specific database , and a node synchronization manager , corresponding to node synchronization manager .","Message dispatcher  manages incoming requests and routes them to their appropriate destinations. The destinations may be internal to system , such as engine modules , or external to system , such as content owners and content distributors.","Engine modules  implement core functionality of system . An engine module generally exists for each of the server components shown in . Additional modules may exist to provide additional functionality, or to provide support functionality for the components of .","Engine modules  are broken up into data aggregation modules , routing modules  and manager modules . It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that this breakdown is artificial, and is made herein for the sake of clarity in understanding roles of the different modules. Data aggregation modules  include inter alia content tracker . Routing modules  include inter alia content router . Manager modules  include inter alia rights manager  and disbursement manager .","Each engine module  maintains its relevant data store in node-specific database . Node-specific database  is synchronized with master back end database  via node synchronization manager , as described hereinabove.","In the foregoing specification, the invention has been described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments thereof. It will, however, be evident that various modifications and changes may be made to the specific exemplary embodiments without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention.
