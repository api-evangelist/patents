{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention relates to noise reduction. In particular, the present invention relates to removing noise from signals used in pattern recognition.","A pattern recognition system, such as a speech recognition system, takes an input signal and attempts to decode the signal to find a pattern represented by the signal. For example, in a speech recognition system, a speech signal (often referred to as a test signal) is received by the recognition system and is decoded to identify a string of words represented by the speech signal.","To decode the incoming test signal, most recognition systems utilize one or more models that describe the likelihood that a portion of the test signal represents a particular pattern. Examples of such models include Neural Nets, Dynamic Time Warping, segment models, and Hidden Markov Models.","Before a model can be used to decode an incoming signal, it must be trained. This is typically done by measuring input training signals generated from a known training pattern. For example, in speech recognition, a collection of speech signals is generated by speakers reading from a known text. These speech signals are then used to train the models.","In order for the models to work optimally, the signals used to train the model should be similar to the eventual test signals that are decoded. In particular, the training signals should have the same amount and type of noise as the test signals that are decoded.","Typically, the training signal is collected under \u201cclean\u201d conditions and is considered to be relatively noise free. To achieve this same low level of noise in the test signal, many prior art systems apply noise reduction techniques to the testing data.","In one technique for removing noise, the prior art identifies a set of correction vectors from a stereo signal formed of two channel signals, each channel containing the same pattern signal. One of the channel signals is \u201cclean\u201d and the other includes additive noise. Using feature vectors that represent frames of these channel signals, a collection of noise correction vectors are determined by subtracting feature vectors of the noisy channel signal from feature vectors of the clean channel signal. When a feature vector of a noisy pattern signal, either a training signal or a test signal, is later received, a suitable correction vector is added to the feature vector to produce a noise reduced feature vector.","In other systems, noise-reduced feature vectors are estimated using models of static aspects of noise, models of the static aspects of clean speech and an observation or acoustic model that predicts the value of a clean speech vector given a noisy speech vector and a noise vector. Although such systems are effective, they are not ideal because the models only represent static aspects of noise and clean speech. They do not represent the dynamic relationships found between neighboring frames of noise and neighboring frames of clean speech. As a result, the sequences of noise-reduced feature vectors produced by these systems tend to include a large number of discontinuities between neighboring feature vectors. In other words, the changes between neighboring noise-reduced feature vectors are not as smooth as in normal speech.","In light of this, a noise reduction technique is needed that is more effective at removing noise from pattern signals.","A system and method are provided that reduce noise in pattern recognition signals. To do this, embodiments of the present invention utilize a prior model of dynamic aspects of clean speech together with one or both of a prior model of static aspects of clean speech, and an acoustic model that indicates the relationship between clean speech, noisy speech and noise. In one embodiment, components of a noise-reduced feature vector are produced by forming a weighted sum of predicted values from the prior model of dynamic aspects of clean speech, the prior model of static aspects of clean speech and the acoustic model.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100","100"]},"The invention is operational with numerous other general purpose or special purpose computing system environments or configurations.

Each summand is formed by multiplying the weighted sum of three terms by the relative probability of the noisy feature vector, y, occurring given the mixture component. The first term is the prediction of the reduced-noise vector taken from the mean of the static aspects of the prior clean speech model, \u03bc. The second term is the prediction for the reduced-noise vector based on the estimate of the reduced-noise vector for the preceding frame and the mean of the dynamic aspects of the prior clean speech model, (x+\u03bc)). The last term, y\u2212g({overscore (n)}\u2212x), is the prediction for the noise-reduced clean-speech vector based on the acoustic model in absence of any prior information.","Thus, the estimator of Equation 24 utilizes a prior model of static aspects of clean speech, a prior model of dynamic aspects of clean speech and an acoustic distortion model. As a result, the sequence of noise-reduced vectors produced using the estimator of Equation 24 contain fewer discontinuities and appear more natural.","In addition, the weighting values applied to each of the terms in each summand are such that as the variance of one of the terms increases, its relative weighting decreases. Thus, as a term becomes more accurate in its description of the noise-reduced value, its weighting increases relative to the weighting of the other terms.","For example, the weighting value applied to the value predicted by the prior model for static aspects of clean speech is a function of the variance of the prior model for dynamic aspects of clean speech. As a result, when the variance of the model for the dynamic aspects of cleans speech increases relative to the variance of the model for the static aspects of clean speech, the relative weighting of the value predicted by the prior model for static aspects increases.","A similar effect occurs for the weighting of the value predicted by the prior model for the dynamic aspects of clean speech, since this weighting value is a function of the variance of the prior model for the static aspects of clean speech.","Note that although the estimator of Equation 24 utilizes three terms, the present invention may also be practiced utilizing only the first two terms, the prior models for the static and dynamic aspects of clean speech, or by using only the last two terms, the prior model for the dynamic aspects of speech and the acoustic model.","Before the estimator of Equation 25 can be used, the parameters for the various models must be trained. Under one embodiment, an EM algorithm is used to train the mean and covariance parameters \u03bc, \u03a6, \u03bcand \u03a6in the cepstral domain. During this training process, the mixture component weights, c, are also trained. Techniques for performing such training are well known in the art. The fixed covariance matrix, \u03a8, is estimated by pooling the training data with all available signal to noise ratios.","A method and system for using the present invention in speech recognition is shown in the flow diagram of  and the block diagram of . The method begins in step  of , where a noisy speech signal is converted into a sequence of feature vectors. To do this, a microphone  of , converts audio waves from a speaker  and one or more additive noise sources  into electrical signals. The electrical signals are then sampled by an analog-to-digital converter  to generate a sequence of digital values, which are grouped into frames of values by a frame constructor . In one embodiment, A-to-D converter  samples the analog signal at 16 kHz and 16 bits per sample, thereby creating 32 kilobytes of speech data per second and frame constructor  creates a new frame every 10 milliseconds that includes 25 milliseconds worth of data.","Each frame of data provided by frame constructor  is converted into a feature vector by a feature extractor . Methods for identifying such feature vectors are well known in the art and include 13-dimensional Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCC) extraction.","In step  of , the feature vectors for the noisy speech signal are provided to a noise estimation module  in . Noise estimation module  estimates the noise in the current frame and provides a feature vector representing the noise estimate together with the noisy speech signal to a noise reduction module .","In step  of , noise reduction module  uses Equation 24 above and the model parameters of Equation 24, which are stored in noise reduction parameter storage , to produce a sequence of noise-reduced feature vectors from the sequence of noisy feature vectors. In particular, noise reduction module  uses the distribution parameters for the prior model of the dynamic aspects of clean speech together with the distribution parameters of the prior model of the static aspects of clean speech and\/or an acoustic model, as described above.","The output of noise reduction module  is a series of noise-reduced feature vectors. If the input signal is a training signal, this series of noise-reduced feature vectors is provided to a trainer , which uses the noise-reduced feature vectors and a training text  to train an acoustic model . Techniques for training such models are known in the art and a description of them is not required for an understanding of the present invention.","If the input signal is a test signal, the noise-reduced feature vectors are provided to a decoder , which identifies a most likely sequence of words based on the stream of feature vectors, a lexicon , a language model , and the acoustic model . The particular method used for decoding is not important to the present invention and any of several known methods for decoding may be used.","The most probable sequence of hypothesis words is provided to a confidence measure module . Confidence measure module  identifies which words are most likely to have been improperly identified by the speech recognizer, based in part on a secondary acoustic model(not shown). Confidence measure module  then provides the sequence of hypothesis words to an output module  along with identifiers indicating which words may have been improperly identified. Those skilled in the art will recognize that confidence measure module  is not necessary for the practice of the present invention.","Although  depicts a speech recognition system, the present invention may be used in any pattern recognition system and is not limited to speech.","Although the present invention has been described with reference to particular embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
