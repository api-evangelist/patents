Field of the Invention","The invention relates to the field of computers. More specifically, the invention relates to policy enforcement.","2. Background of the Invention","Enforcing an anti-virus policy on an organization's network by maintaining an anti-virus program is a difficult task. The task is made difficult by constantly changing threats to an organization's network, software updates to the anti-virus program, and the distribution of host devices throughout the organization's network.","One method for maintaining a single anti-virus program of a single vendor in host devices of an organization's local area network (LAN) involves programming a choke point. A choke point monitors a number of host devices coupled to the choke point. The choke point is configured to enforce the organization's anti-virus policy. The host devices that do not have a current version of a single anti-virus program of a single vendor, that do not enable the single anti-virus program of the single vendor, or that do not have the single anti-virus program of the single vendor, are restricted from accessing the Internet through the choke point. If the host devices do not have the single anti-virus program of the single vendor or do not have the current version of the single anti-virus program of the single vendor, then the choke point retrieves components for installing or updating the single anti-virus of the single vendor from a predefined location. The choke point sends the retrieved components to the non-complying host devices.","The method of maintaining a single anti-virus program of a single vendor does not allow for the use of multiple anti-virus products by a single vendor, multiple anti-virus products by multiple vendors, or a single anti-virus product by multiple vendors. The method of maintaining a single anti-virus program of a single vendor also does not allow for the enforcement of a network policy defined for more than anti-virus protection of an organization's network. In addition, an administrator or similar person must configure each choke point for a particular anti-virus program. If an organization changes to a different vendor's anti-virus program, then someone must reconfigure each choke point throughout the organization's network with the new anti-virus program.","A method and apparatus for centralized policy programming and distributive policy enforcement is described. According to one embodiment of the invention, a method provides for centrally maintaining a plurality of policy definitions for one or more subscribers, generating policy configurations using the plurality of policy definitions, each of the policy configurations being specific to one of the plurality of policy definitions, and disseminating the policy configurations to the appropriate ones of the subscribers' networks.","These and other aspects of the present invention will be better described with reference to the Detailed Description and the accompanying Figures.","In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. However, it is understood that the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known circuits, structures, standards, and techniques have not been shown in detail in order not to obscure the invention.","In the description, the term network policy refers to a set of rules to be applied to an organization's network. A network policy may concern software configurations of host devices within the network or device configurations of host devices within the network. These software and\/or hardware configurations may relate to external network external access, internal network external access, security requirements, license requirements, content filtering, virtual private networks, etc. Throughout the description, the term policy is used to refer to a network policy.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["101","103","103","105","105","113","115","117","113","115","117","113","115","117","113","117","115"]},"The LAN  includes a choke point A, a host A, and a host device B. Within the LAN , the choke point A is coupled with the host devices A and B. The LAN  includes a local policy coordinator server , a choke point B, and host devices C and D. Within the LAN , the choke point B and the local policy coordinator server  are coupled with the host devices C-D. The LAN  includes a choke point C, and host devices E-H. Within the LAN , the choke point C is coupled with the host devices E-H. A choke point is a point along the path to the external access point of a network or sub-network (e.g., a firewall, a VPN client, a VPN server, an SSL concentrator, modem, bridge, router, switch, etc.).","The global policy coordinator server  has a global policy coordinator . The local policy coordinator server  has a local policy coordinator . The choke points A-C respectively have policy definition enforcement agents (PDEAs) A-C. The host devices B-H respectively have policy configuration implementation agents (PCIAs) B-H. The host device A does not have a PCIA.","Policy coordinators use policy definitions to disseminate policy configurations to PCIAs and identify the disseminated policy configurations to PDEAs. The global policy coordinator  maintains policy definitions for one or more LANs of one or more subscribers. In contrast, the local policy coordinator  maintains one or more policy definitions for one or more networks of a single subscriber. Policy definitions are programmed into the global policy coordinator for multiple subscribers. In one embodiment of the invention, each subscriber remotely programs their policy into the global policy coordinator. In alternative embodiments of the invention, the entity that maintains the global policy coordinator programs policies into the global policy coordinator for subscribers. Such centralized policy programming enables efficient management of multiple policy definitions. Although, the local policy coordinator  maintains the policy definition(s) for a single subscriber, it still provides centralized policy programming albeit on a smaller scale.","Centralized policy programming also enables the efficient generation and dissemination of policy configurations from a central location. The global policy coordinator  maintains template configurations used to generate policy configurations based on policy definitions. Subscribers that program their policy definitions into the global policy coordinator  and subscribers that maintain their own policy definitions with local policy coordinators subscribe to the global policy coordinator to receive current policy configurations for their policy definitions. Subscriber's are able to rely on an entity that maintains the global policy coordinator  (\u201ca policy enforcement service provider\u201d) to keep the template configurations up-to-date and disseminate policy configurations as indicated by the policy definitions. Hence, subscribers define their policy or change their policy, which typically occurs infrequently, while a policy enforcement service provider maintains template configurations and generates new policy configurations on behalf of the subscriber, which typically requires more frequent activity and resources.","In , the global policy coordinator  maintains policy definitions for the subscribers that own the LANs  and . The local policy coordinator  maintains a policy definition for the LAN . The global policy coordinator  generates policy configurations for the LANs  and  based on the appropriate policy definitions. The global policy coordinator  transmits appropriate ones of the generated policy configurations to the appropriate PCIAs. In particular with reference to , the global policy coordinator transmits policy configurations based on a policy definition for the LAN  to the PCIAs B, and a policy configuration based on a policy definition for the LAN  to the PCIAs E-H. The global policy coordinator  does not transmit a policy configuration to the host device A because the host device A does not have a PCIA.","The local policy coordinator  requests template configurations from the global policy coordinator . The requested template configurations are based on the policy definition programmed into the local policy coordinator . The local policy coordinator  generates a policy configuration for the LAN  with the template configurations received from the global policy coordinator . The local policy coordinator transmits the generated policy configuration to the PCIAs C-D.","The global policy coordinator  also transmits policy configuration identifiers that identify the transmitted policy configurations. In particular with reference to , the global policy coordinator  transmits: 1) a policy configuration identifier, which identifies the policy configuration transmitted to the PCIA B, to the PDEA A in the LAN ; and 2) a policy configuration identifier that identifies the policy configuration transmitted to the PCIAs E-H to the PDEA C in the LAN . For the LAN , the local policy coordinator  transmits a policy configuration identifier that identifies the policy configuration transmitted to the PCIAs C-D.","The PDEAs A-C use received policy configuration identifiers to enforce the policy definition for their LAN. The PDEAs A-C enforce the policy definitions for their respective LANs by restricting external access of their LANs host devices that do not comply with their policy definition. A host device is not in compliance with its LAN's policy definition if 1) the host device does not have a PCIA, 2) the host device's PCIA does not have the policy configuration identified by the policy configuration identifier most recently received by the host device's governing PDEA, or 3) the host device's configuration status is inconsistent with the policy configuration identified by its PDEA.","A PCIA implements a received policy configuration on its host device. The PCIA communicates to its corresponding PDEA the identity of its most recently received policy configuration. The PCIA also reports its host device's configuration status to its PDEA. In , the PCIA B communicates with the PDEA A 1) to identify the policy configuration most recently received from the global policy coordinator , and 2) to report the configuration status of the host device B. The PCIAs E-H communicate with the PDEA C 1) to identify the policy configuration most recently received from the global policy coordinator , and 2) to respectively report the configuration status of the host devices E-H. The PCIAs C-D communicate with the PDEA B 1) to identify the policy configuration most recently received from the local policy coordinator , and 2) to respectively report the configuration status of the host devices C-D.","PDEAs and PCIAs may be implemented as software, hardware, or a combination of hardware and software. Although the PDEAs A-C are illustrated in  as respectively residing on choke points A-C, that are remote from the host devices A-H, alternative embodiments may implement PDEAs on choke points that are directly connected to each of the host devices A-H, or part of the host devices A-H.","Distributively enforcing a policy ensures policy compliance for individual host devices within a network without burdening the owner of the network. Local choke points ensure that devices within its LAN comply with requisite policy definitions while a policy coordinator that is separate from the choke points carry out more complex functionality to ensure policy compliance. Centralized policy programming improves reliability of policy enforcement since the most current policy configurations are at a centralized location. Centralized policy programming also enables efficient programming of different LANs for an organization with either the same policy or different policies for the different LANs. In addition, centralized policy programming also unloads administrative tasks related to ensuring enforcement of an organization's network policy and updating a policy configuration onto a policy enforcement service provider. The policy enforcement service provider's resources can be dedicated to maintaining and disseminating policy information for multiple organizations, each having one or more LANs. Alternatively, the local policy coordinator enables an organization to define its policy with a higher level of granularity while still implementing a current policy configuration retrieved from the policy enforcement service provider.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["201","203","207","215","219","201","209","213","201","209","213","201","209","213","209","201","203","215","207","219"]},"The subscription editor  receives and stores subscription information  in the subscription database . The subscription information  may be entered by a user, read from a file, received from a remote location, etc. The subscription information  indicates the subscription status of subscribers with respect to a variety of services including policy enforcement. A policy is defined with the policy editor . The policy editor  stores policy definitions  in the policy definitions database . A given one of the policy definitions  may be defined from a remote location, may be directly defined by a user at a global policy coordinator server, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["301","303","303"]},"A second policy parameter  indicates a device(s) upon which the selected rule is to be applied. In , the second policy parameter  indicates a set of one or more types of devices, client or server, upon which the selected rule(s) is to be applied. The type of device may be selected based on machine name, operating system, etc. In alternative embodiments of the invention, the second policy parameter  indicates a list of network addresses (e.g., MAC addresses, IP addresses, etc.). The administrator can select one or more of the network addresses of devices upon which the selected rule(s) is to be applied.","A third policy parameter , rule trigger event, defines what will cause a policy coordinator to generate a policy configuration for the policy definition that includes the selected rule(s) (\u201can unconditional rule trigger event\u201d) or what will cause a policy coordinator to make a determination of whether a policy configuration should be generated for the policy definition that includes the selected rule(s) (\u201ca conditional rule trigger event\u201d). The third policy definition parameter  may be a time period, frequency of network events, user prompted events, detection of a policy definition violation, etc. In another embodiment of the invention, the trigger for a selected rule is specified for the PCIA, the PDEA, policy coordinator, or a combination of them. For example, the trigger for restricting software is defined for the PCIA. The trigger for updating software is defined for both the PCIA and the policy coordinator. A subscriber may designate the policy parameters illustrated in  at a local policy coordinator server, through remotely logging in to the policy editor of a global policy coordinator, etc.","To provide an example, in one embodiment, assume a policy for a LAN is defined to include anti-virus protection. The anti-virus protection rule is defined for one or more different anti-virus products made by one or more different anti-virus product vendors. The policy definition may include additional rules. A security patches rule is defined for certain programs (i.e., which programs must have the most current security patches) and the number of days in a period to check for the most current security patches. A disallowed programs rule is defined for one or more certain programs. A content filtering rule is defined with disallowed URLs, configuration gradients of an Internet browser, and\/or rated websites. A licensing rule is defined with a license key. These examples are meant to aid in the understanding of the invention and not meant to be limiting upon the invention.","Returning to , the policy generator  retrieves subscription information  from the subscription database  and policy definitions  from the policy definitions database  in response to one or more triggers as defined in a policy definition. Additional triggers include expiration of a time period, receipt of the policy definition, renewal of a subscription, modifications to the template configurations database, a refresh request from a PDEA, a request from a local policy coordinator, etc. For example, a policy definition includes a rule to maintain software with a trigger defined as every 48 hours. The trigger for the policy generator  to retrieve the policy definition to generate a corresponding policy configuration is the initial programming of the policy definition, and every 48 hours after the initial programming. In alternative embodiments of the invention, agents within the policy definitions database  push a policy definition in response to triggers. For example, when a policy definition is initially stored in the policy definitions database , the agents monitoring the policy definitions database  push the policy definition to the policy generator . Subsequent to the initial storing of the policy definition, the agents monitoring the policy definitions database  push the policy definition to the policy generator  every 48 hours.","The policy generator  collects template configurations  from the template configurations database  in accordance with the policy definitions  and the subscription information , and generates policy configurations A-M. The policy generator  may collect template configurations and generate a policy configuration in response to a trigger event occurring, depending on whether the trigger event is conditional or unconditional. When an unconditional trigger event occurs, the policy generator collects template configurations and generates a policy configuration. When a conditional trigger event occurs, the policy generator collects template configurations and generates a policy configuration after a determination is made that the policy generator should collect the template configurations and generate the policy configuration. A trigger event may be any of the following types of trigger events: a conditional coordinator trigger event, an unconditional coordinator trigger event, a conditional rule trigger event, an unconditional rule trigger event, a conditional policy definition trigger event, or an unconditional policy definition trigger event.","A coordinator trigger event is a trigger event defined for the coordinator by the entity managing the policy coordinator. For example, an administrator defines a conditional coordinator trigger event to be detection of modification to the template configurations database. When the template configurations database is modified, the policy coordinator determines if any policy definitions are affected and generates policy configurations for those policy definitions that are affected. As another example, the administrator of the policy coordinator defines an unconditional coordinator trigger event to be the programming of a new policy definition into the policy definitions database or modification of a policy definition currently in the policy definitions database. Whenever a new policy definition is programmed or current policy definition is modified, the policy generator collects template configurations for the policy definition and generates a policy configurations for it. A rule trigger event has been described with reference to . A policy definition trigger event is an event defined for a policy definition. For example, a subscriber's administrator may define an unconditional policy definition trigger event to be the lapse of a time period. Once the time period lapses, the policy generator collects template configurations for the policy definition and generates a corresponding policy configuration. Various inter-trigger rules may also be established to supersede certain trigger events. For example, although a subscriber defines an unconditional policy trigger event as the lapse of 24 hours, an administrator of a policy coordinator may define an inter-trigger rules that blocks the generation of a policy configuration in response to an unconditional policy trigger event to avoid taxing resources of the system hosting the policy coordinator. The template configurations in the template configurations database  may be maintained by an administrator, entered by an administrator and maintained by a script or program, etc.","Certain embodiments include mechanisms to avoid the transmission of policy configurations when not necessary. In one embodiment of the invention, a log is maintained, for example by the policy generator . The log tracks the most recent policy configuration generated for each subscriber. If the policy generator  generates a new policy configuration for a subscriber that is the same as the previously generated policy configuration for that subscriber, then the generated policy configuration is not transmitted. In another embodiment of the invention, a flag is maintained in addition or instead of the log. The flag indicates whether any modifications have been made on the template configurations database . If the flag indicates that no modification has been made on the template configurations database  and if the policy definition is not newly programmed into the global policy coordinator , then the policy generator  will not retrieve template configurations from the template configurations database .","At a given time, the template configurations  collected from the template configurations database  will correspond to a policy definition and subscriber information for a given subscriber. The policy generator  will also generate policy configuration identifiers for each policy configuration that is generated.","The policy generator  transmits subscription status A-C and policy configuration identifiers A-C to PDEAs A-C. The policy generator  also transmits policy configurations A-M to PCIAs A-M. If the PDEAs A-C belong to the same subscriber and are to enforce the same policy definition, then the policy configurations A-M are the same policy configurations and are transmitted at the same time or at approximately the same time. Likewise, the policy configuration identifiers A-C and subscription status A-C are the same if the PDEAs A-C belong to the same subscriber and are to enforce the same policy. If the PDEAs A-C belong to different subscribers and\/or are enforcing different policies, then policy configurations A-M will correspond to the appropriate policy definitions, the subscription status  will correspond to the appropriate subscribers, the policy configuration identifiers A-C will correspond to the appropriate policy configurations, and the times of transmission are independent. While in one embodiment the policy configurations A-M each include their policy configuration identifier, in alternative embodiments they do not and the policy generator  also transmits policy configuration identifiers to the PCIAs A-M.","The policy generator  may not retrieve those of the policy configurations A-M that correspond to a subscriber without a current subscription. Various embodiments may implement different techniques to ensure subscription maintenance. In one embodiment, the policy generator  transmits a subscription status to a PDEA and waits until the subscriber's subscription is made current. In an alternative embodiment of the invention, the policy generator  transmits a subscription status and a policy configuration identifier to a PDEA and a policy configuration to a PCIA. If the subscriber's subscription information is not updated within a period of time indicated by the policy generator  or previously defined at the PDEA, then the PDEA may either prevent traffic from flowing through it or stop monitoring traffic. In another embodiment of the invention, the policy generator  transmits a message to a subscriber to inform the subscriber that their subscription has expired while continuing to perform policy coordination and enforcement.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 2","FIG. 4","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["401","403","407","415","403","405","405","407","203","407","402","414","419","402","101","201","419","414","419","414","419","414"]},"The policy generator  retrieves the policy definition  from the policy definitions database  and subscription information  from a subscription database . The policy generator  collects template configurations  from the template configurations database  in accordance with the policy definition  and the subscription information . The policy generator  may be blocked from retrieving the template configurations  if the subscriber that manages the local policy coordinator  has not made its subscription current. As previously described, the policy generator  may have a time period to access the template configurations database  until external access is blocked if the subscription is not made current. The local policy coordinator  may also ensure that the subscriber's subscription is made current as described with reference to the global policy coordinator  of .","Similar to the policy generator  of , the policy generator  generates a policy configuration identifier  and communicates the policy configuration identifier  to PDEAs A-C. The policy generator  also generates a policy configuration  from the collected template configurations  and communicates the policy configuration  to PCIAs A-F. As previously described, while in one embodiment the policy configuration  includes the policy configuration identifier , in another embodiment it does not and the policy generator  transmits the policy configuration identifier  to the PCIAs A-F.","In alternative embodiments of the invention, a policy coordinator (either local or global) transmits more than a policy configuration identifier to a PDEA. For example, the policy coordinator may transmit a list of restricted sites to the PDEA. The PDEA can then prevent access to the restricted sites.","With centralized policy programming and distributed policy enforcement, a subscriber need only to define its policy in order for the policy to be enforced upon the subscriber's network. A policy enforcement service provider maintains template configurations and updates the policy configurations for the defined policy. Centralized policy programming enables a policy enforcement service provider to efficiently generate policy configurations for multiple subscribers. Centralized policy programming also allows scalability of programming a policy. A single policy generator can disseminate a policy configuration and policy configuration identifier to any number of LANs instead of a system administrator configuring each choke point for the LANs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["507","504","505","505","507","505","506","507","505","507","505","507","507","505","507"]},"If the block  results from the PCIA's  current policy configuration identifier not matching the PDEA's  current policy configuration identifier, then the PCIA  attains a current policy configuration from a policy generator , illustrated as line , by requesting a current policy configuration at a time 2.1.

Since the choke point  does not have a PDEA, the PDEA maintains individual tables for each host device within the LAN cloud  accessing the LAN cloud . Tables A-F may record traffic outgoing from the LAN cloud  to each host device within the LAN cloud  and only permit incoming traffic that is responsive to outgoing traffic. Alternatively, the tables A-F may record incoming traffic from each of the host devices within the LAN cloud  and block traffic from certain of the host devices that violates certain criteria.","Since the choke point  has a PDEA B, the PDEA A allows traffic to flow between the LAN clouds  and  in accordance with its policy definition. Likewise, the PDEA B allows traffic to flow between the LAN clouds  and  in accordance with its policy definition, which may or may not be the same as PDEA's A policy definition. Either one or both of the PDEAs A and B may maintain tables to monitor VPN traffic between the clouds  and  in accordance with their respective policy definitions.","The dial-in device  dials into the LAN cloud . The dial-in device  accesses the LAN cloud  via the choke point . The PDEA A monitors the traffic from the dialing device  with a table . The PDEA A may force the dial-in device  to install a PCIA in order to access the LAN cloud . If the PDEA A allows the dial-in device  to access the LAN cloud , the PDEA  will maintain a table  to monitor traffic from the dial-in device . The table can be used to monitor traffic from the dial-in device with different techniques. The PDEA A may record outgoing traffic from the LAN cloud  to the dial-in device in the table  and only allow responsive traffic from the dial-in device. Alternatively, the PDEA A may record ingress traffic from the dial-in device . The PDEA A may record ingress and egress traffic to the dial-in device . The PDEA A may allow all ingress traffic from the dial-in device that is confirmed as originating from the dial-in device and block any traffic from a device passing traffic through the dial-in device.","While the invention has been described in terms of several embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention is not limited to the embodiments described.
