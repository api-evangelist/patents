title: Policy-based authentication
abstract: A device receives a request to authenticate an end user of a user device based on a requested use of an application by the user device, and communicates with an authentication client, provided in the user device, to perform an authentication requested by the request. The device also generates a response to the request based on the communication with the authentication client, where the response indicates that the end user is or is not authenticated to use the application. The device further provides the response to an application server device hosting the application.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["A service provider is an entity (e.g., a business or an organization) that sells bandwidth of or access to a network (e.g., the Internet, a data network, a telecommunication network, etc.) associated with the service provider. Service providers may include telecommunications companies, data carriers, wireless communications providers, Internet service providers, cable television operators offering high-speed Internet access, etc. Service provider networks enable third party application developers to create applications that use network resources, such as location systems that determine locations of mobile communication devices. These applications make requests to a network device, such as a gateway. The network device processes the requests and sends the requests to service provider systems that provide services, such as determining the locations of mobile communication devices, messaging, and\/or other services. Such service provider systems may be referred to as enablers.","The service provider network defines application programming interfaces (APIs) for third party application developers to access the capabilities of enablers in the service provider network. A third party application often needs to authenticate a person (i.e., an end user) using the third party application, and often provides some form of authentication of the end user. However, in many cases, it is preferable to have the service provider network perform this function on behalf of the third party application. For example, if a developer would like the service provider to bill for an end user's use of their application, the service provider network needs to authenticate the end user of the application. The third party application not only needs to identify the end user, but also needs to receive a level of assurance for that identification. The end user, the application, and the service provider network need to form trust relationships. Unfortunately, the APIs provided for the third party applications often do not provide an identifier for end users using the third party applications, making authentication of such end users very difficult.","The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements.","Systems and\/or methods described herein may provide an authentication enabler and a gateway in a service provider network, and may provide an authentication client in a user device. The authentication enabler, gateway, and authentication client may enable the systems and\/or methods to perform authentication processes. For example, the systems and\/or methods may perform an authentication as a result of an authentication request received from a third party application. In another example, the systems and\/or methods may perform a policy-based authentication in which the gateway performs a role in evaluating authentication policies.","In one example implementation, a third party application, associated with a service provider network, may request authentication of an identity, such as an end user identity. The systems and\/or methods may authenticate the third party application and may evaluate authentication policies for the application, the end user, and the service provider network. If the request complies with policies, the authentication enabler and the authentication client may perform authentication processes requested by the request, and may return an authentication result to the requesting third party application.","If identity information, associated with the end user, is not provided in the request and a policy requires authentication of the end user identity, the systems and\/or methods may return a message to the third party application. The returned message may instruct the application to obtain the identity information of the end user, and return the identity information to the gateway. Upon receipt of the identity information, the gateway may request the authentication enabler to authenticate the end user identity, with a method defined by policies, and to return the authentication result. If the authentication result indicates that the end user identity is authenticated, the third party application may request that another enabler (e.g., a location enabler), associated with the service provider network, perform a particular function, such as determine a location of a target user device.","The term \u201ccomponent,\u201d as used herein, is intended to be broadly construed to include hardware (e.g., a processor, a microprocessor, an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), a chip, a memory device (e.g., a read only memory (ROM), a random access memory (RAM), etc.), etc.) or a combination of hardware and software (e.g., a processor, microprocessor, ASIC, etc. executing software contained in a memory device).","As used herein, the term \u201cuser\u201d is intended to be broadly interpreted to include a user device or a user of a user device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","110","120","130","140","150","160","170","100","110","120","130","140","150","160","170","110","120","130","140","150","160","170","100","100"]},"User device  may include any device that is capable of communicating with gateway , application server , authentication enabler , and\/or other devices\/networks  via network . For example, user device  may include a mobile computation and\/or communication device, such as a radiotelephone, a personal communications system (PCS) terminal (e.g., that may combine a cellular radiotelephone with data processing and data communications capabilities), a personal digital assistant (PDA) (e.g., that can include a radiotelephone, a pager, Internet\/intranet access, etc.), a wireless device, a smartphone, a laptop computer (e.g., with a wireless air card), a global positioning system (GPS) device, a content recording device (e.g., a camera, a video camera, etc.), a set-top box (STB), a voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) device, an analog terminal adaptor (ATA), etc. In another example, user device  may include a fixed (e.g., provided in a particular location, such as within a user's home) computation and\/or communication device, such as a laptop computer, a personal computer, a tablet computer, a STB, a television, a gaming system, etc.","In one example implementation, user device  may include an authentication client that interfaces with an end user of user device , and communicates with gateway  and\/or authentication enabler  to perform authentications of the end user. The authentication client may reside in a storage device provided in user device  or may reside in an external storage device, such as a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card, an external hard drive, a flash memory data storage device, etc. The authentication client, via user device , may enable the end user to access one or more third party applications provided in application server  and described below.","Gateway  may include one or more computation and\/or communication devices that gather, process, search, and\/or provide information in a manner described herein. For example, gateway  may include one or more server devices, network devices (e.g., routers, switches, firewalls, network interface cards (NICs), hubs, bridges, optical add-drop multiplexers (OADMs), etc.), etc. In an example implementation, gateway  may receive requests from third party applications provided by application server , and may perform policy actions on the requests. Gateway  may forward the requests for further processing (if necessary), and may route the requests to authentication enabler . The authentication enabler  may return responses (for the requests) to the gateway , and gateway  may provide the responses to the requesting third party applications. Gateway  may be a functional entity that may include one or more processing elements and may provide policy decisions and enforcement.","Policies, which may be invoked by gateway , may include authentication rules, business rules, authorization, etc. Authentication rules may include user names, passwords, personal identification numbers (PINs), etc. Business rules may include operations, definitions, and\/or constraints that apply to an organization, and may apply to people, processes, corporate behavior and computing systems in an organization.","Application server  may include one or more server devices, or other types of computation or communication devices, that gather, process, search, and\/or provide information in a manner described herein. In an example implementation, application server  may store one or more third party applications that use resources provided by a service provider network, which may include gateway , authentication enabler , identity management database , and other devices\/networks . The third party applications may include applications that determine locations of mobile communication devices (e.g., user device ), applications that connect calls between user device  and other user devices , etc. The third party applications, via application server , may provide services to end users associated with user device , may make authentication requests to authentication enabler , and may make requests for other services to other enablers associated with the service provider network. The third party applications, via application server , may receive responses to such requests from gateway . Alternatively, or additionally, one or more of the third party applications may be permanently stored on user device  or may be retrieved from application server  and temporarily stored on user device .","Authentication enabler  may include one or more server devices, or other types of computation or communication devices, that gather, process, search, and\/or provide information in a manner described herein. In an example implementation, authentication enabler  may receive a request for authenticating user device , an end user of user device , and\/or a third party application being utilized by user device , and may perform the authentication requested by the request. If the authentication is successful, authentication enabler  may create a mechanism, such as a security token, an authentication token, or an access token, indicating a successful authentication. The security, authentication, or access token may include an expiration time period. Authentication enabler  may store session information associated with the authentication, and may generate a response indicating whether the authentication is successful (e.g., which may include the security, authentication, or access token) or is unsuccessful. In one example, authentication enabler  may utilize other devices\/networks  for performing authentications, such as using an instant messaging system to authenticate the end user or using a voice communication system to authenticate a voice of the end user.","Identity management database  may include one or more storage devices that store information provided by and\/or retrieved by gateway  and\/or authentication enabler . In one example implementation, identity management database  may store identity management information, such as user identities, user credentials, tokens, user profiles, authentication policies, etc.","Other devices\/networks  may include one or more computation or communication devices, or networks, that gather, process, search, and\/or provide information in a manner described herein. In one example implementation, other devices\/networks  may include other enabler devices (e.g., an instant messaging system, a voice processing system, a location enabler, etc.); a registration server; a bootstrapping server function (BSF) device; a home subscriber server (HSS); etc.","Network  may include a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), a telephone network, such as the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), an intranet, the Internet, an optical fiber or fiber optic-based network, or a combination of networks. In one example implementation, network  may enable user device  to communicate with one or more of gateway , application server , authentication enabler , identity management database , and other devices\/networks .","In one example implementation of network , authentication enabler  may provide third party applications, generated via application server  and used by user device , with the ability to request authentication of an identity, such as an end user of user device . Authentication enabler  may also enable the third party applications to request a type of authentication of the end user, such as via a user name and password, via a secure token, etc. The third party applications, the end user, and the service provider network may implement policies that govern the authentication process performed by authentication enabler . For example, the end user may deny a third party application access to a location of the end user. In another example, a third party application may require a two-factor authentication of the end user (e.g., something a user has and something a user knows), and may not explicitly request authentication when requesting other enablers, such as an instant messaging system, provided by other devices\/networks . Such an authentication process may be referred to as a policy-based authentication and may involve gateway . In one example implementation, the authentication process may be a combination of requested behavior and policy evaluations.","In another example implementation of network , the authentication client, associated with user device , may receive challenges and may process information, such as username and password, received from the end user, user device , gateway , application server , and\/or other devices\/networks .

Gateway  may log the information provided in response  and location , and may generate a response . Response  may include the features of response  as well as location . Gateway  may provide response  to application server , and application server  may enable the end user, via user device , to use location  of target user .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0122","num":"0121"},"figref":"FIG. 15","b":["1500","1500","120","1500","120"]},"As shown in , process  may include receiving, from an application used by a user device, a request for a location of a target user (block ), determining that the request does not include an identifier of the end user of the user device (block ), and providing, to the application, an error message indicating the missing identifier of the end user (block ). For example, in implementations described above in connection with , the end user, via user device , may invoke the use of an application provided by application server , as indicated by reference number . Based on requested use  of the application, application server  may generate location request  requesting the location of target user . Application server  may provide request  to gateway , and gateway  may receive request . Gateway  may evaluate request  by retrieving information provided in identity management database , as indicated by reference number . It may be assumed that gateway  determines that authentication of the end user is required and that GBA authentication or a higher level of assurance is required for the end user. It may also be assumed that gateway  determines that request  does not include an identifier associated with the end user. Since the end user identifier is missing in request , gateway  may not return a location of target user , but instead may return message , to application server , requesting the end user identifier. Message  may include an error message for location request .","As further shown in , process  may include receiving, based on the error message and from the application, a request and the identifier of the end user (block ), providing the request to an authentication enabler for authenticating the end user based on the identifier (block ), and receiving a valid authentication response from the authentication enabler based on the request (block ). For example, in implementations described above in connection with , the application of application server  may receive message , and may obtain the end user identifier from user device , as indicated by reference number . The application of application server  may re-issue location request  that includes the features of request  as well as the missing end user identifier  (e.g., MDN=161755501111). Application server  may provide location request  to gateway . Based on receipt of request , gateway  may provide a request  to authentication enabler . Request  may include the features of request , but may also include information obtained from the evaluation of request , such as the GBA authentication of the end user required by request . Authentication enabler  may receive request , and may retrieve GBA token , associated with the end user, from identity management database . If GBA token  is present, authentication enabler  may validate GBA token  and may return a successful GBA authentication response  to gateway .","Returning to , process  may include sending the location request to a location determining device (block ), receiving a location of the target user from the location determining device (block ), and sending the location of the target user to the application (block ). For example, in implementations described above in connection with , gateway  may provide location request , which may include the features of location request , to a location enabler provided in other devices\/networks . The location enabler may retrieve location  (e.g., of target user ) from target user , and may return location  to gateway .

Gateway  may provide response  to application server , and application server  may enable the end user, via user device , to use location  of target user .","Systems and\/or methods described herein may provide an authentication enabler and a gateway in a service provider network, and may provide an authentication client in a user device. The authentication enabler, gateway, and authentication client may enable the systems and\/or methods to perform authentication processes. For example, the systems and\/or methods may perform an authentication as a result of an authentication request received from a third party application. In another example, the systems and\/or methods may perform a policy-based authentication in which the gateway performs a role in evaluating authentication policies.","The foregoing description of implementations provides illustration and description, but is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed.
