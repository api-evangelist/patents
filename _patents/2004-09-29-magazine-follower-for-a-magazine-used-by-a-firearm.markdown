title: Magazine follower for a magazine used by a firearm
abstract: An improved magazine follower for use in existing magazines such as a 30 round magazine comprises a follower plate, a base plate, and a spring. The follower plate comprises a top plate, a convex follower leg, and a concave follower leg. The external shapes of the top plate, the convex follower leg, and the concave follower leg mirror the interior profile of the magazine, constraining the motion of the follower plate to a well-defined path within the magazine. The method of attaching the spring to the follower plate and the base plate in addition to the shape of the spring keeps the spring from “wobbling” or moving off a vertical axis of the spring as rounds of ammunition are loaded or dispensed. Consequently, the present system reduces binding or jams within the magazine, improving performance and life of the magazine follower.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["U.S. GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The inventions described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.","The present invention generally relates to a firearm. More specifically, the present invention relates to a magazine for chambering ammunition in the firearm. In particular, the present invention pertains to a magazine follower in the magazine that provides a force on the ammunition within the magazine to chamber the ammunition without jamming.","Automatic and semi-automatic firearms typically comprise a magazine in which one or more rounds of ammunition are placed. The magazine comprises a magazine follower that pushes the topmost round into position for chambering in the automatic or semi-automatic firearm. For example, a M16 Rifle or M4 Carbine comprises a 30 round magazine. The first round placed in the magazine presses against the magazine follower. Additional rounds placed in the magazine compress the magazine follower toward the bottom of the magazine. The magazine follower comprises, for example, a spring that applies force to the rounds in the magazine, pushing the rounds up toward the chamber of the automatic or semi-automatic firearm.","Although conventional magazine technology has proven to be useful, it would be desirable to present additional improvements. A conventional 30 round magazine comprises a magazine follower that has a tendency to jam and not properly feed the round into the automatic or semi-automatic firearm. As rounds are loaded into the magazine, an off-center pressure on the magazine follower can cause the magazine follower to bind, interrupting and slowing the process of loading rounds in the magazine. Thus, there is need for an improved magazine follower that does not jam or bind during loading of the magazine or firing of the automatic or semi-automatic firearm. The need for such a system has heretofore remained unsatisfied.","The present invention satisfies this need, and presents a system and an associated method (collectively referred to herein as \u201cthe system\u201d or \u201cthe present system\u201d) for an improved magazine follower for use in existing magazines such as a 30 round magazine. While described in relation to a 30 round magazine, the present system can be used in any magazine.","The present system comprises a follower plate, a base plate, and a spring. The present system is a replacement for a conventional magazine follower in a magazine. The present system is placed in the magazine with the base plate inserted first and fitted snugly against the bottom of the magazine. One or more rounds of ammunition are placed in the magazine against the follower plate. The spring pushes against the follower plate and the rounds of ammunition, presenting the top-most round of ammunition for loading into the firearm. In loading and dispensing rounds of ammunition in the magazine, the follower plate slides up and down inside the magazine. Pushing downward (with respect to the bottom of the magazine) on the follower plate causes the follower plate to slide down. The force of the spring on the follower plate causes the follower plate to slide up.","The follower plate comprises a convex follower leg and a concave follower leg. The external shape of the convex follower leg and the concave follower leg mirrors the interior profile of the magazine, tracking the interior of the magazine as the follower plate is pushed upward by the spring. By mirroring the interior profile of the magazine, the present system constrains the motion of the follower plate to a well-defined path within the magazine. The present system reduces jamming and high friction points throughout a cycle of loading and dispensing rounds of ammunition. In conventional magazine followers, high friction points cause stress or wear on the magazine follower, further causing the magazine follower to jam or otherwise malfunction.","In one embodiment, the follower plate comprises two convex follower legs. In another embodiment, the follower plate comprises or two concave follower legs. For proper function of the magazine follower, a requirement for the shape of the follower legs is that the follower legs mirror the interior profile of the magazine, whether convex, concave, or flat.","The follower plate comprises a perimeter profile that mirrors the interior profile of the magazine. As before, by mirroring the interior profile of the magazine, the present system constrains the motion of the follower plate to a well-defined path within the magazine. Consequently, the present system reduces jamming and high friction points throughout a cycle of loading and dispensing rounds of ammunition.","The spring is attached to the follower plate by inserting a follower end of the spring into a follower opening in a central stud on the bottom of the follower plate. The spring is designed such that at least one turn of the spring presses against the bottom of the follower plate to provide an evenly distributed force to the follower plate. The spring is attached to the base plate by inserting a base end of the spring into a base opening in a base stud on the top of the base plate. The spring is designed such that at least a portion of a turn of the spring presses against the top of the base plate to provide and evenly distributed force to the follower plate.","The circumferential shape of the spring is elongated such that the spring generally mirrors the profile of the magazine. The method of attaching the spring to the follower plate and the base plate in addition to the shape of the spring keeps the spring from \u201cwobbling\u201d or moving off a vertical axis of the spring as rounds of ammunition are loaded or dispensed. Consequently, movement of the spring is constrained to compression and expansion, further preventing binding or jams within the magazine and improving life of the magazine follower.","The follower plate comprises a composite material that is inexpensive and cost-effective to manufacture. Furthermore, the composite material exhibits high performance characteristics such as, for example, chemical resistance, heat deflection, tensile strength, stiffness, and low temperature impact strength.","It should be understood that the sizes of the different components in the figures may not be in exact proportion and are shown for visual clarity and for the purpose of explanation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIGS. 1A","FIGS. 1A and 1B","FIGS. 1C and 1D","FIG. 1E","FIG. 1F"],"b":["1","1","1","1","1","100","10","100","10","100","100","100","100"]},"The magazine follower  comprises a follower plate , a spring , and a base plate . The base plate  fits into a bottom  of magazine . The spring  is fastened to the base plate  and to the follower plate .

Further, the top plate perimeter  allows easy insertion of the magazine follower  into magazine  for ease of retrofitting magazine  with the magazine follower .","The follower plate  comprises an ammunition-shaped protrusion . The ammunition-shaped protrusion  acts as a visual aid to personnel as they load magazine  with ammunition. The ammunition-shaped protrusion  reduces confusion, prompting personnel to load ammunition into magazine  in proper orientation. It is off center to force the rounds to stack correctly when loaded.","The follower plate  further comprises a central stud . The central stud  comprises a follower opening  through which the spring  is fastened. The central stud  is situated on the bottom of the follower plate  such that the spring  applies uniform load across the follower plate  as the follower plate  is pushed against rounds of ammunition in magazine .","For an exemplary magazine  with a capacity of 30 rounds, the length L  of the follower plate  is approximately 6 cm, the width W  of the follower plate  is approximately 2 cm, and the height H  of the follower legs  is approximately 3 cm. The follower plate  is sized to fit the inside dimensions of magazine  in which the follower plate  is installed. Surfaces of the follower plate  that come in contact with magazine  are filleted or chamfered to enhance the ability of the follower plate  to smoothly move within magazine , reducing the possibility of binding or jamming within magazine .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 3A","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3B","FIG. 3"],"b":["3","25","25","25","25","25"]},"The base plate  comprises a base plate perimeter  as seen in the top view of the base plate  in .
