{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["Example embodiments relate to conference call systems and methods, and in particular to a method for scheduling a conference call.","During a conference call, voice or media connections are typically made between two or more communication devices such as telephones or mobile phones.","One difficulty with existing systems is that unauthorized participants may attempt to join a conference call. The participants of a conference call are sometimes loosely defined wherein original invitees can forward invitations to others who can then participate. With only rudimentary security procedures such as a conference call dial-in number and access code almost anyone from any location can be a conference call participant, which could compromise security.","For example, in some traditional systems an individual may forward a conference call invite to another if he or she is unable to attend a meeting. However, at the time of the meeting, either person or both people may join the conference call. This could result in larger-than-expected number of participants, which could compromise security. For conference calls which restrict the number of allowed attendees, it would be unclear why there are more people attending than originally scheduled. It may also be difficult to maintain the security of conferences and prevent unauthorized attendees who might participate due to uncontrolled or accidental forwarding of invitations.","Other difficulties with existing teleconferencing systems will be apparent to those skilled in the art in view of the detailed description below.","Similar reference numerals may have been used in different figures to denote similar components.","Some example embodiments generally relate to transferring of conference call invitations for a scheduled conference call.","In some example embodiments, a conference call server may be configured to assign or allocate participant authorizations for eligible client devices, for permitting participation within a conference call. A forwarded conference call invitation can be used to transfer authorization to join the call from a transferor participant client device to a transferee participant client device. In such a case, joining of the conference call may be restricted to the device that currently holds the invitation.","The conference call server may be configured to assign or allocate the participant authorizations for client devices. Upon forwarding of an invitation by the transferor, the conference call server may change the authorization to only allow the transferee to participate and revoke the authorization of the transferor. The transferor would now be prevented from joining the call, even though he or she was originally the invitee. If the transferee is unable to join, he or she may forward the invitation back to the first person (original transferor); in this case participation authorization goes back to the original invitee. Such a process may permit a single joining to the conference call per invitation, in this case either the transferor or the transferee.","In some further example embodiments, the client device may join a conference in a secure fashion so that only authorized devices can join. This may provide a mechanism for a secure join. A unique identifier that is tied to a device, such as a device PIN (personal identification number) or mobile identifier may be used to authenticate the user.","In one example embodiment, there is provided a method for scheduling a conference call, wherein a conference call server includes a memory for storing conference call scheduling information with respect to a scheduled conference call session, the conference call scheduling information including participant authorizations for eligible communication devices of the scheduled conference call session. The method includes receiving, in a first communication device, an invitation message containing at least some of the conference call scheduling information with respect to the scheduled conference call session, displaying an interface in relation to the scheduled conference call session, the interface including an option to transfer participant authorization for the scheduled conference call session to a second communication device, and sending a communication to the conference call server for adding participant authorization of the second communication device and removing participant authorization of the first communication device.","In another example embodiment, there is provided a communication device including: a controller, a communications subsystem for communicating with a conference call server, wherein the conference call server stores conference call scheduling information with respect to a scheduled conference call session, the conference call scheduling information including participant authorizations for eligible communication devices of the scheduled conference call session, the communications subsystem configured for receiving an invitation message containing at least some of the conference call scheduling information with respect to the scheduled conference call session, and a display for displaying an interface in relation to the scheduled conference call session, the interface including an option to transfer participant authorization for the scheduled conference call session to a second communication device. The controller controls the communications subsystem to send a communication to the conference call server for adding participant authorization of the second communication device and removing participant authorization of the communication device.","In yet another example embodiment, there is provided a non-transitory computer readable medium having recorded thereon statements and instructions for execution by one or more devices for scheduling a conference call, wherein a conference call server includes a memory for storing conference call scheduling information with respect to a scheduled conference call session, the conference call scheduling information including participant authorizations for eligible communication devices of the scheduled conference call session, said statements and instructions comprising code for performing the method.","In yet another example embodiment, there is provided a conference call server including a memory for storing conference call scheduling information with respect to a scheduled conference call session, the conference call scheduling information including participant authorizations for eligible communication devices of the scheduled conference call session, a communications subsystem for communicating with communication devices, and a controller. The controller is configured for: sending, to a first communication device, an invitation message containing at least some of the conference call scheduling information with respect to the scheduled conference call session, receiving, from the first communication device, a communication to transfer participant authorization for the scheduled conference call session to a second communication device, adding participant authorization of the second communication device, and removing participant authorization of the first communication device.","Example embodiments relate to the control and management of conference call communications. Although reference may be made to \u201ccalls\u201d and \u201ctalk\u201d in the description of example embodiments below, it will be appreciated that some of the described systems and methods may be applicable to session-based communications in general and not limited to voice calls. Reference to calls may for example include shared data (e.g. presentation content) as well as media sessions which may for example include video and\/or audio. The various communications may include both synchronous and asynchronous communications to implement such \u201ccalls\u201d.","Reference is now made to , which shows, in block diagram form, an example system, generally designated , for the control and management of communications. The system  includes an enterprise or business system , which in many embodiments includes a local area network (LAN). In the description below, the enterprise or business system  may be referred to as an enterprise network . It will be appreciated that the enterprise network  may include more than one network and may be located in multiple geographic areas in some embodiments.","The enterprise network  may be connected, often through a firewall , to a wide area network (WAN) , such as the Internet. The enterprise network  may also be connected to a public switched telephone network (PSTN)  via direct inward dialing (DID) trunks, primary rate interface (PRI) trunks, or SIP trunks.","The enterprise network  may also communicate with a public land mobile network (PLMN) , which may also be referred to as a wireless wide area network (WWAN) or, in some cases, a cellular network. The connection with the PLMN  may be made via a relay , as understood in the art.","The enterprise network  may also provide a wireless local area network (WLAN) featuring wireless access points. Other WLANs  may exist outside the enterprise network . For example, WLAN may be connected to WAN .","The system  may include a number of enterprise-associated mobile devices  (only one shown). The mobile devices  may include devices equipped with communications modules for cellular communication through the PLMN , mobile devices equipped for Wi-Fi communications over one of the WLANs , or dual-mode devices capable of both cellular and data communications. WLANs  may be configured in accordance with one of the IEEE 802.11 specifications.","It will be understood that the mobile devices  include one or more radio transceivers and associated processing hardware and software to enable wireless communications with the PLMN  and\/or one of the WLANs . In various embodiments, the PLMN  and mobile devices  may be configured to operate in compliance with any one or more of a number of wireless protocols, including GSM, GPRS, CDMA, EDGE, UMTS, EvDO, HSPA, 3GPP, 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE), or a variety of others. It will be appreciated that the mobile device  may roam within the PLMN  and across PLMNs, in known manner, as the user moves. In some instances, the dual-mode mobile devices  and\/or the enterprise network  are configured to facilitate roaming between the PLMN  and a WLAN , and are thus capable of seamlessly transferring sessions (such as voice calls) from a connection with the cellular interface of the dual-mode device  to the WLAN  interface of the dual-mode device , and vice versa.","The mobile devices  may be various types of communication devices. Such mobile devices  may include \u201cClass A\u201d devices, which are able to function continuously as dual-mode devices, capable of both media and data communications. Mobile devices  may also include \u201cnon-Class A\u201d devices, which may function as dual-mode devices for initialization or prior to connection with the enterprise communications platform , but may lose data functionality once a media session (e.g., voice call) is established. The enterprise network  may also include additional client devices which are voice-only or media-only devices, which may be digital or analog for communication with the PSTN or PLMN, and which may not have data capabilities (herein referred to as \u201cvoice-only\u201d or \u201cmedia-only\u201d devices). In other embodiments, the mobile devices  may include any suitable client device configured with the communications functionality described herein, and may for example include computer devices, relays, proxies, gateways and any appropriate User Agents (as defined in SIP).","The enterprise network  typically includes a number of networked servers, computers, and other devices. For example, the enterprise network  may connect one or more desktop or laptop computers  (one shown). The connection may be wired or wireless in some embodiments. The enterprise network  may also connect to one or more digital telephone sets  (one shown).","The enterprise network  may include one or more mail servers, such as mail server , for coordinating the transmission, storage, and receipt of electronic messages for client devices operating within the enterprise network . Typical mail servers include the Microsoft Exchange Server\u2122 and the IBM Lotus Domino\u2122 server. Each user within the enterprise typically has at least one user account within the enterprise network . Associated with each user account is message address information, such as an e-mail address. Messages addressed to a user message address are stored on the enterprise network  in the mail server . The messages may be retrieved by the user using a messaging application, such as an e-mail client application. The messaging application may be operating on a user's computer  connected to the enterprise network  within the enterprise. In some embodiments, the user may be permitted to access stored messages using a remote computer, for example at another location via the WAN  using a VPN connection. Using the messaging application, the user may also compose and send messages addressed to others, within or outside the enterprise network . The messaging application causes the mail server  to send a composed message to the addressee, often via the WAN .","The relay  serves to route messages received over the PLMN  from the mobile device  to the corresponding enterprise network . The relay  also pushes messages from the enterprise network  to the mobile device  via the PLMN .","The enterprise network  also includes an enterprise server . Generally, the enterprise server  is configured to collectively serve the needs of the enterprise network , for example to provide and\/or synchronize messaging, contacts and calendaring information between servers, desktop workstations , and mobile devices . Together with the relay , the enterprise server  functions to redirect or relay incoming e-mail messages addressed to a user's e-mail address within the enterprise network  to the user's mobile device  and to relay incoming e-mail messages composed and sent via the mobile device  out to the intended recipients within the WAN  or elsewhere. The enterprise server  and relay  together facilitate \u201cpush\u201d e-mail service for the mobile device  enabling the user to send and receive e-mail messages using the mobile device  as though the user were connected to an e-mail client within the enterprise network  using the user's enterprise-related e-mail address, for example on computer . The enterprise server  may also relay other messages such as instant messaging or text messaging.","As is typical in many enterprises, the enterprise network  includes a Private Branch eXchange (although in various embodiments the PBX may be a standard PBX, an IP-PBX, or a cloud-hosted PBX, for simplicity the description below uses the term PBX to any or all of these)  having a connection with the PSTN  for routing incoming and outgoing voice calls for the enterprise. The PBX  is connected to the PSTN  via DID trunks or PRI trunks, for example. The PBX  may use ISDN signaling protocols for setting up and tearing down circuit-switched connections through the PSTN  and related signaling and communications. In some embodiments, the PBX  may be connected to one or more conventional analog telephones . The PBX  is also connected to the enterprise network  and, through it, to telephone terminal devices, such as digital telephone sets , softphones operating on computers , etc. Within the enterprise, each individual may have an associated extension number, sometimes referred to as a PNP (private numbering plan), or direct dial phone number. Calls outgoing from the PBX  to the PSTN  or incoming from the PSTN  to the PBX  are typically circuit-switched calls. Within the enterprise, e.g. between the PBX  and terminal devices, voice calls are often packet-switched calls, for example Voice-over-IP (VoIP) calls.","The enterprise network  may further include a Service Management Platform (SMP)  for performing some aspects of messaging or session control, like call control and advanced call processing features. The SMP  may, in some cases, also perform some media handling. Collectively the SMP  and PBX  may be referred to as the enterprise communications platform, generally designated . It will be appreciated that the enterprise communications platform  and, in particular, the SMP , is implemented on one or more servers having suitable communications interfaces for connecting to and communicating with the PBX  and\/or DID\/PRI trunks. Although the SMP  may be implemented on a stand-alone server, it will be appreciated that it may be implemented into an existing control agent\/server as a logical software component. As will be described below, the SMP  may be implemented as a multi-layer platform.","The enterprise communications platform  implements the switching to connect session legs and may provide the conversion between, for example, a circuit-switched call and a VoIP call, or to connect legs of other media sessions. In some embodiments, in the context of voice calls the enterprise communications platform  provides a number of additional functions including automated attendant, interactive voice response (IVR), call forwarding, voice mail, etc. It may also implement certain usage restrictions on enterprise users, such as blocking international calls or 1-900 calls. In many embodiments, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) may be used to set-up, manage, and terminate media sessions for voice calls. Other protocols may also be employed by the enterprise communications platform , for example, Web Services, Computer Telephony Integration (CTI) protocol, Session Initiation Protocol for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions (SIMPLE), and various custom Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), as will be described in greater detail below.","One of the functions of the enterprise communications platform  is to extend the features of enterprise telephony to the mobile devices . For example, the enterprise communications platform  may allow the mobile device  to perform functions akin to those normally available on a standard office telephone, such as the digital telephone set  or analog telephone set . Example features may include direct extension dialing, enterprise voice mail, conferencing, call transfer, call park, etc.","Reference is now made to , which show example embodiments of the enterprise communications system .  illustrates an embodiment intended for use in a circuit-switched TDM context. The PBX  is coupled to the SMP  via PRI connection  or other suitable digital trunk. In some embodiments, the PRI connection  may include a first PRI connection, a second PRI connection, and a channel service unit (CSU), wherein the CSU is a mechanism for connecting computing devices to digital mediums in a manner that allows for the retiming and regeneration of incoming signals. It will be appreciated that there may be additional or alternative connections between the PBX  and the SMP .","In this embodiment, the SMP  assumes control over both call processing and the media itself. This architecture may be referred to as \u201cFirst Party Call Control\u201d. Many of the media handling functions normally implemented by the PBX  are handled by the SMP  in this architecture. Incoming calls addressed to any extension or direct dial number within the enterprise, for example, are always first routed to the SMP . Thereafter, a call leg is established from the SMP  to the called party within the enterprise, and the two legs are bridged. Accordingly, the SMP  includes a digital trunk interface  and a digital signal processing (DSP) conferencing bridge . The DSP conferencing bridge  performs the bridging of calls for implementation of various call features, such as conferencing, call transfer, etc. The digital trunk interface  may be implemented as a plurality of telephonic cards, e.g. Intel Dialogic cards, interconnected by a bus and operating under the control of a processor. The digital trunk interface  may also be partly implemented using a processor module such as, for example, a Host Media Processing (HMP) processor.","The SMP  may include various scripts  for managing call processing. The scripts  are implemented as software modules, routines, functions, etc., stored in non-volatile memory and executed by the processor of the SMP . The scripts  may implement call flow logic, business logic, user preferences, call service processes, and various feature applications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["16","18","18","18"]},"The call control server  is coupled to the PBX , for example through the LAN, enabling packet-based communications and, more specifically, IP-based communications. In one embodiment, communications between the PBX  and the call control server  are carried out in accordance with SIP. In other words, the call control server  uses SIP-based communications to manage the set up, tear down, and control of media handled by the PBX . In one example embodiment, the call control server  may employ a communications protocol conforming to the ECMA-269 or ECMA-323 standards for Computer Supported Telecommunications Applications (CSTA).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["14","18","74","74","18","72","76","72","76","72","74"]},"The SIP server  interacts with the media server  using SIP-based media handling commands. For example, the SIP server  and media server  may communicate using Media Server Markup Language (MSML) as defined in IETF document Saleem A., \u201cMedia Server Markup Language\u201d, Internet Draft, draft-saleem-msml-07, Aug. 7, 2008. The media server  may be configured to perform Host Media Processing (HMP).","Other architectures or configurations for the enterprise communications system  will be appreciated by those ordinarily skilled in the art. For example, in example embodiments the service management platform  may be separate from the PBX ; or the service management platform  may include a cloud-based system.","Reference is now made to , which shows another embodiment of the enterprise communications system  with a Third Party Call Control architecture. In this embodiment, the SMP  is a multi-layer platform that includes a protocol layer , a services layer  and an application layer . The protocol layer  includes a plurality of interface protocols configured for enabling operation of corresponding applications in the application layer . The services layer  includes a plurality of services that can be leveraged by the interface protocols to create richer applications. Finally, the application layer  includes a plurality of applications that are exposed out to the communication devices and that leverage corresponding ones of the services and interface protocols for enabling the applications.","Specifically, the protocol layer  preferably includes protocols which allow media to be controlled separate from data. For example, the protocol layer  can include, among other things, a Session Initiation Protocol or SIP , a Web Services protocol , an Application Programming Interface or API , a Computer Telephony Integration protocol or CTI , and a Session Initiation Protocol for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions or SIMPLE protocol . It is contemplated that the interface protocols - are plug-ins that can interface directly with corresponding servers in the enterprise network , which will be further described below.","Although SIP  may be utilized, it is appreciated that the system  can operate using the above disclosed or additional protocols. As known by those of ordinary skill in the art, SIP is the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) standard for multimedia session management, and more specifically is an application-layer control protocol for establishing, maintaining, modifying and terminating multimedia sessions between two or more endpoints. As further known by those of ordinary skill in the art, the SIP protocol  includes two interfaces for signaling: SIP-Trunk (hereinafter referred to as \u201cSIP-T\u201d) and SIP-Line (hereinafter referred to as \u201cSIP-L\u201d). Specifically, the SIP-T interface is utilized when the endpoint is a non-specific entity or not registered (i.e., when communicating between two network entities). In contrast, the SIP-L interface is utilized when the endpoint is registered (i.e., when dialing to a specific extension). SIP is defined in J. Rosenberg et al., \u201cRFC 3261\u2014Session Initiation Protocol\u201d (June 2002), the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.","The SMP  also includes a plurality of enablers, among other things, a VoIP enabler , a Fixed Mobile Convergence or FMC enabler , a conference services enabler , a presence enabler  and an Instant Messaging or IM enabler . Each of the enablers - are used by corresponding services in the services layer  that combine one or more of the enablers. Each of the applications in the application layer  is then combined with one or more of the services to perform the desired application. For example, a phone call service may use the VoIP or PBX enabler, and an emergency response application may use the phone call service, an Instant Messenger service, a video call service, and email service and\/or a conference service.","The application layer  may include a conference services application  that, together with the conference services enabler , enables multiple communication devices (including desk telephones and personal computers) to participate in a conference call through use of a centralized conference server . As seen in , the conference server  is provided in the enterprise network  and is in communication with the conference services enabler  preferably through the SIP protocol , although it is recognized that additional protocols that control media separate from data may be appropriate, such as the Web Services protocol  or the CTI protocol . As will be described in further detail below, the conference call server  is configured for directing media and data streams to and from one or more communication devices (i.e., mobile devices , telephones , and computers ).","Example conference call systems and methods in accordance with example embodiments will now be described, referring now to , which shows the system  when used or configured as a conference call system. As shown, the enterprise communications platform  includes the conference server  for providing conference call services for a number of client devices such as mobile devices , illustrated as one designated host device and one or more participant devices , , . The mobile devices  may collectively form a conference call group. The host device is generally the mobile device  or associated user who schedules and hosts a conference call session, and may for example be permitted to perform such hosting functions as roll call, mute all, broadcast only, conference lock, etc.","Generally, in accordance with some example embodiments, one of the devices may be a former participant or \u201ctransferor\u201d of a conference call invitation; while one of the other devices may be a \u201ctransferee\u201d of a conference call invitation. In some example embodiments, the enterprise communications platform  may store in memory an assignment or allocation of participant authorizations for the client devices. Upon forwarding of an invitation by the transferor client device , the enterprise communications platform  may change the participation authorization to only allow the transferee client device to participate and revoke the participation authorization of the transferor. The transferor client device would now be prevented from joining the call, even though he or she was originally the invitee. This transfer of participation authorization is illustrated by reference arrow . In some example embodiments, the particular participant authorizations may be stored as a whitelist in the memory of the enterprise communications platform . In some example embodiments, the participant authorizations may also include a blacklist to identify ineligible devices such as the transferor device ","In some example embodiments, if the transferee client device is unable to join, he or she may forward the invitation back to the original transferor client device ; in this case participation authorization goes back to the original invitee client device . Such a process may permit a single joining to the scheduled conference call session per invitation, in this case either the transferor client device or the transferee client device . In some example embodiments, the transferee client device may also forward the invitation (and right to participate) to yet another device (not shown).","The enterprise communications platform  and the associated conference server  may be used for generally executing conference call functions. As described above, in example embodiments, the enterprise communications platform  may include or be coupled to the media server  (), wherein the enterprise communications platform  controls the media handling and media sessions of the media server .","Referring still to , in order to implement some of the conference call functions described herein, the enterprise communications platform  may communicate with the mobile devices  by way of media sessions and\/or control sessions. Specifically, as shown in , the mobile devices  communicates via media sessions  (shown as solid lines) and control sessions  (shown as dashed lines to distinguish from the media sessions ). For example, the designated host device communicates via media session and control session . Participant device communicates via media session and control session . Participant device communicates via media session and control session . In some embodiments, as shown, the participant device may merely communicate via media session over the PLMN  () or PSTN  () only (without an associated control session).","In some example embodiments, the media sessions  may be facilitated by the enterprise communications platform  by way of Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) media sessions, and may include voice calls, video calls, circuit-switched calls or VoIP calls. The media sessions  may further be encrypted, for example using Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP). In order to generate or establish a conference call session, the enterprise communications platform  connects or links at least some of the call legs of each media session . The particular methods and processes for connecting of media sessions  into a conference call session would be understood by those skilled in the art, which may for example be implemented by media shuffling or SDP (Session Description Protocol) media shuffling, etc.","In some example embodiments, a data connection (e.g. the same data connection as used by the control sessions ) can be further used to provide additional data sharing between mobile devices . For example, during a conference call, the host mobile device may provide or transfer a data file to the remaining mobile devices . Data sharing may also include Web Services or sharing of presentation content.","In some example embodiments, during a conference call session, the enterprise communications platform  can receive Global Positioning System (GPS) information from at least some of the participant devices , and can send the received GPS information to the devices , to provide location based positioning services between the devices .","Reference is now made to  which illustrates in detail a mobile device  in which example embodiments can be applied. The mobile device  is a two-way communication device having data and voice communication capabilities, and the capability to communicate with other computer systems, for example, via the Internet. Depending on the functionality provided by the mobile device , in various embodiments the mobile device  may be a handheld device, a multiple-mode communication device configured for both data and voice communication, a smartphone, a mobile telephone or a PDA (personal digital assistant) enabled for wireless communication.","The mobile device  includes a rigid case (not shown) housing the components of the mobile device . The internal components of the mobile device  may, for example, be constructed on a printed circuit board (PCB). The description of the mobile device  herein mentions a number of specific components and subsystems. Although these components and subsystems may be realized as discrete elements, the functions of the components and subsystems may also be realized by integrating, combining, or packaging one or more elements in any suitable fashion. The mobile device  includes a controller comprising at least one processor  (such as a microprocessor) which controls the overall operation of the mobile device . The processor  interacts with device subsystems such as a wireless communication subsystem  for exchanging radio frequency signals with the wireless network (e.g. WAN  and\/or PLMN ) to perform communication functions. The processor  interacts with additional device subsystems including a display  such as a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen or any other appropriate display, input devices  such as a keyboard and control buttons, persistent memory , random access memory (RAM) , read only memory (ROM) , auxiliary input\/output (I\/O) subsystems , data port  such as a conventional serial data port or a Universal Serial Bus (USB) data port, speaker , microphone , short-range communication subsystem  (which may employ any appropriate a wireless (e.g., RF), optical, or other short range communications technology), and other device subsystems generally designated as . Some of the subsystems shown in  perform communication-related functions, whereas other subsystems may provide \u201cresident\u201d or on-device functions.","Display  may be realized as a touch-screen display in some embodiments. The touch-screen display may be constructed using a touch-sensitive input surface connected to an electronic controller and which overlays the visible element of display . The touch-sensitive overlay and the electronic controller provide a touch-sensitive input device and the processor  interacts with the touch-sensitive overlay via the electronic controller.","The wireless communication subsystem  includes one or more communication systems for communicating with wireless WAN base stations  and wireless LAN access points  within the wireless network. The particular design of the wireless communication subsystem  depends on the wireless network in which mobile device  is intended to operate. The mobile device  may send and receive communication signals over the wireless network after the required network registration or activation procedures have been completed.","The processor  operates under stored program control and executes software modules  stored in memory such as persistent memory  or ROM . The processor  can execute code means or instructions. ROM  may contain data, program instructions or both. Persistent memory  may contain data, program instructions or both, in some embodiments is rewritable under control of processor , and may be realized using any appropriate persistent memory technology, including EEPROM, EAROM, FLASH, and the like. As illustrated in , the software modules  comprise operating system software  and software applications .","Software modules  or parts thereof may be temporarily loaded into volatile memory such as the RAM . The RAM  is used for storing runtime data variables and other types of data or information, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Although specific functions are described for various types of memory, this is merely one example, and those skilled in the art will appreciate that a different assignment of functions to types of memory could also be used.","The software applications  may further include a range of applications, including, for example, an e-mail messaging application, address book, calendar application, notepad application, Internet browser application, voice communication (i.e., telephony) application, mapping application, or a media player application, or any combination thereof. Each of the software applications  may include layout information defining the placement of particular fields and graphic elements (e.g., text fields, input fields, icons, etc.) in the user interface (i.e., the display ) according to the application.","The modules  may further include a Global Positioning System (GPS) module or application which is configured for detection of a geographical position of the device , for example by correlating existing satellites. The GPS module may also receive from the enterprise communications platform  the geographical positions of the other devices .","In some embodiments, the auxiliary input\/output (I\/O) subsystems  may comprise an external communication link or interface, for example, an Ethernet connection. The auxiliary I\/O subsystems  may further comprise one or more input devices, including a pointing or navigational tool such as a clickable trackball or scroll wheel or thumbwheel, or one or more output devices, including a mechanical transducer such as a vibrator for providing vibratory notifications in response to various events on the mobile device  (e.g., receipt of an electronic message or incoming phone call), or for other purposes such as haptic feedback (touch feedback).","In some embodiments, the mobile device  also includes one or more removable memory modules  (typically comprising FLASH memory) and one or more memory module interfaces . Among possible functions of the removable memory module  is to store information used to identify or authenticate a user or the user's account to wireless network (e.g. WAN  and\/or PLMN ). For example, in conjunction with certain types of wireless networks, including GSM and successor networks, the removable memory module  is referred to as a Subscriber Identity Module or SIM. The memory module  is inserted in or connected to the memory module interface  of the mobile device  in order to operate in conjunction with the wireless network.","The mobile device  stores data  in a persistent memory . In various embodiments, the data  includes service data comprising information required by the mobile device  to establish and maintain communication with the wireless network (e.g. WAN  and\/or PLMN ). The data  can also include, for example, scheduling and connection information for connecting to a scheduled conference call.","The mobile device  also includes a battery  which furnishes energy for operating the mobile device . The battery may be coupled to the electrical circuitry of mobile device  through a battery interface , which may manage such functions as charging the battery from an external power source (not shown) and the distribution of energy to various loads within or connected to the mobile device . Short-range communication subsystem  is an additional optional component which provides for communication between the mobile device  and different systems or devices, which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example, the short-range communication subsystem  may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components, or a wireless bus protocol compliant communication mechanism such as a BLUETOOTH communication module to provide for communication with similarly-enabled systems and devices.","A predetermined set of applications that control basic device operations, including data and possibly voice communication applications will normally be installed on the mobile device  during or after manufacture. Additional applications and\/or upgrades to the operating system software  or software applications  may also be loaded onto the mobile device  through the wireless network (e.g. WAN  and\/or PLMN ), the auxiliary I\/O subsystem , the data port , the short-range communication subsystem , or other suitable subsystem such as . The downloaded programs or code modules may be permanently installed, for example, written into the program memory (e.g., the persistent memory ), or written into and executed from the RAM  for execution by the processor  at runtime.","The mobile device  may provide two principal modes of communication: a data communication mode and an optional voice communication mode. In the data communication mode, a received data signal such as a text message, an e-mail message, Web page download, or an image file will be processed by the wireless communication subsystem  and input to the processor  for further processing. For example, a downloaded Web page may be further processed by a browser application or an e-mail message may be processed by an e-mail message messaging application and output to the display . A user of the mobile device  may also compose data items, such as e-mail messages, for example, using the input devices in conjunction with the display . These composed items may be transmitted through the wireless communication subsystem  over the wireless network (e.g. WAN  and\/or PLMN ). In the voice communication mode, the mobile device  provides telephony functions and operates as a typical cellular phone.","Reference is now made to , which shows a user interface  displayed on the display  for scheduling a conference call, in accordance with an example embodiment. In the example embodiment shown, the user interface  is for example implemented by a conference call application (as a stand-alone or in combination with other applications) resident on the mobile device  for specifically communicating with the enterprise communications platform . The user interface  may form part of a conference call session scheduling process. In some example embodiments, the user interface may be implemented in other forms, and may include a mobile phone or tablet-based interface, a video interface, a web interface from a dedicated conferencing and\/or mobility server, and\/or a plug-in from a calendar or messaging based client (e.g. Microsoft Outlook\u2122). In some example embodiments, the user interface may include instructions conveyed via voice or video with voice (audio) or Dual-tone multi-frequency signaling (DTMF) responses. In some further example embodiments, the interface may be implemented by communication devices such as set-top boxes or other in-home communications devices.","Still referring to , the user interface  relates to scheduling of a conference call session having a subject and which is to occur at a scheduled time and date. For example, the time and date of the schedule conference call session may be stored within the conference call application or a calendar application. For example, the scheduled conference call has a subject field of \u201cWeekly status meeting XYZ Corp Inc.\u201d and has a scheduled date field of \u201cJan. 1, 2011 at 13:00\u201d. The user interface  may be manually triggered by launching and subsequently operating the conference call application.","As shown in , the user interface  also includes an options menu  to perform functions such as editing the existing scheduled conference call, scheduling new conference calls, and inviting new participants. Conference call scheduling information is sent from the device  to the enterprise communications platform , which stores the information in a memory and sends an invitation message to the specified participants with the conference call scheduling information. In some example embodiments, the mobile device  sends an invitation message directly or indirectly to the recipient invitees.","The enterprise communications platform  also maintains tracking information of the participants, and updates the host device  accordingly with the tracking information shown in . In some example embodiments, the enterprise communications platform  tracks participation by way of the number of sent invitation messages. For example, each invitation message may be assigned its own identifier, and each authorized participant is tracked by assigning to particular invitation messages.","At the time of the scheduled conference call, or a specified time beforehand, the enterprise communications platform  may contact each of the devices  to join the media sessions together. In example embodiments, the devices  may also dial or link into the enterprise communications platform  using dialing or address link information received during scheduling.","As shown in , the user interface  includes a title bar , a status icon , an options menu , and participant icons (each or individually ) which represent the status of each participant for the conference call. The participant icons  can, for example, be a photo or avatar of the individual user. A cursor  is also shown for indicating which item(s) on the user interface  are to be selected (e.g., controllable by a user input device such as a touchscreen, touch scrollball or mouse). The status icon  displays the present status of the conference call, for example \u201cScheduled CC\u201d (Conference Call) as shown.","Referring now to the participant icons , in the example shown, the user interface  is displayed on the host device , indicated as \u201cYou (host)\u201d as shown in icon . The participant icon is indicated as \u201cAccepted (TRANSFERRED IN)\u201d, while participant icon is indicated as \u201cBlocked (TRANSFERRED OUT)\u201d. This means that the client device associated with \u201cDavid\u201d has transferred out his participant authorization right to join the scheduled conference call; and that the client device associated with \u201cKevin\u201d has accepted and been transferred a participant authorization right to join the scheduled conference call. In example embodiments, this may be accomplished by \u201cDavid\u201d transferring or forwarding a conference call invitation message to \u201cKevin\u201d.","The remaining participant icons , represent additional participant devices  (\u201cJohn\u201d and \u201cSally\u201d, respectively, as shown). Contact information such as e-mail address or phone number for the participants can be pre-stored in association with the participant names (or can be manually entered, as appropriate). The status of each participant icon  can also be shown, for example, as Accepted, Tentative, Declined, or Blocked.","As shown in , in some example embodiments the host device can also select a menu  to designate the scheduled conference call as a \u201cclosed\u201d conference call. In a \u201cclosed\u201d call, only the specified or eligible participant devices  designated by the host device may join the call. Additionally, for example, only a specified number of participants may join the call. In some example embodiments, in a \u201cclosed\u201d call further authentication of those participant devices  may be performed when attempting to access the scheduled conference call. As shown, the host device also has the option to use the menu  to set the scheduled conference call as an \u201copen\u201d conference call, wherein any participant device  (designated as eligible or not) may join.","Generally, in some example embodiments, as part of the conference call session scheduling process, after the conference call scheduling information is configured by the host device , the same information is sent and stored to the enterprise communications platform . The enterprise communications platform  subsequently communicates with each device  for inviting to the scheduled conference call and for provisioning at least some of the conference call scheduling information. Each device  has an option to Accept, Decline, Tentative, or Transfer. If the device  selects Accept, this means that the device  will participate in the scheduled conference call. If the device  selects Decline, for example, the host device is notified by the enterprise communications platform  that the scheduled conference call has been declined by the particular device . The notification may be made by phone call, data message, email, etc. If the host device Declines, then the entire scheduled conference call may be cancelled and the other devices  notified accordingly. If the device  selects Tentative, then the enterprise communications platform  notifies the host device accordingly.","Thus, reference is now made to , which shows a user interface  for displaying a received invitation message  on a non-host participant device . The device  first receives the invitation message  from the enterprise communications platform  with respect to a scheduled conference call. As shown, the message  as displayed can include a number of fields  which relate to conference call scheduling information. The fields  include Subject, Start time, End time, Recurrence, Host\/Organizer, Web Information, and Audio Conference Information.","The invitation message  may be received as an e-mail message designating the participant's e-mail address, but can also be in other forms such as short message service (SMS), SIP message, instant messaging, or calendar invite. Note that, in other example embodiments, the message  may alternatively be received directly or indirectly from the host device , rather than from the enterprise communications platform .","As shown on the interface , a number of response options  may be selected in order to respond to the invitation message . As shown, the response options  include Accept, Tentative, or Decline, as described above. Upon selection, the response is sent to the enterprise communications platform  for tracking purposes. In further example embodiments, selection of the Accept option may result in the details of the invitation message  being stored in a calendar application of the device . As shown, the response options  can also include an option to Transfer  to a new participant client device (\u201ctransferee\u201d), thus giving up the right to participate within the scheduled conference call. In some example embodiments, the Transfer  option can be further restricted depending on whether the new participant client device is permitted to join the conference call (for a closed call), for example limiting participants to those associated with a same enterprise.","As shown in , the invitation message  also includes \u201cWeb Information\u201d which includes an option to select an address link  to activate a \u201cJoin Now\u201d or \u201cMeet Now\u201d function. At the scheduled date and time of the conference call, the device  may receive a user input selecting the address link  to request joining the conference call session. If the conference call is a closed call, the enterprise communications platform  may then authenticate the device , for example by authenticating the particular persistent device identifier of the device . The device  is also verified to determine whether it has properly received participant authorization (e.g., has not transferred the participant authorization away). Upon authentication, a conference call session can be established between the device  and the enterprise communications platform , which can include a media session  ().","As can be appreciated, in some example embodiments the address link  identifies the enterprise communications platform  as well as the scheduled conference call session and\/or the participant identifier, and can include a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), or other suitable address.","Reference is now made to , which shows an example user interface  displayed on the display  of a mobile communication device  as a consequence of selection of the Transfer  option, in accordance with an example embodiment. As shown, selection of the Transfer  option may result in displaying an address interface  which includes an address field  which can receive, for example, a recipient e-mail address, subscriber identifier, phone number, etc. The recipient will be considered the \u201ctransferee\u201d in such an embodiment. Alternatively, the \u201cTO\u201d option  may be selected, for populating the address field  from an address book of the device .","In some example embodiments, a default transferee may be specified within the particular device . For example, a user may always wish to always delegate any conflicting meeting requests to a same individual, for example a particular assistant, secretary, staff member, etc. The contact information of the transferee may be pre-populated in the address field  in such embodiments. In other example embodiments, a last-used address is pre-populated in the address field .","As shown in , the interface  may include an appropriate warning or notification to the user, for example \u201cYou have selected TRANSFER. If you SEND, you will lose your right to participate in this conference call.\u201d The interface  may receive selection of the Send  option to effect transferring of the call invitation, thereby revoking the right to join the conference call as a participant. In some example embodiments, selection of Send  results in the device  sending a communication or message to the enterprise communications platform . In some other example embodiments, the device  sends an invitation message directly or indirectly to the transferee device .","Selection of the Cancel  option may result in no action being taken and the interface  being restored to the original invitation message  ().","Reference is now made to , which shows an example conversation  between the enterprise communications platform , a transferor device , and a transferee device , in accordance with an example embodiment. Generally, in the example embodiment shown, the enterprise communications platform  is responsible for sending a forwarded invitation message to the transferee device . The enterprise communications platform  includes a communications subsystem and a memory for storing conference call scheduling information with respect to a scheduled conference call session. For example, the conference call scheduling information includes participant authorizations for eligible communication devices of the scheduled conference call session . The participant authorizations can be stored with an identifier of the eligible participant device. Further, particular invitation messages may be tracked and stored within the memory. At step , the enterprise communications platform  sends to the transferor device an invitation message containing at least some of the conference call scheduling information with respect to the scheduled conference call session. The transferor device displays an interface in relation to the scheduled conference call session, for example the interface  (). The interface includes an option to transfer participant authorization for the scheduled conference call session to the transferee device ","At step , upon selection of the option through the interface, the transferor device sends a communication to the enterprise communications platform  that a transfer is to be performed to the transferee device . The communication can include an identifier or address of the transferee device , for example an e-mail address. In response, the enterprise communications platform  adds the participant authorization with respect to the transferee device , and removes participant authorization with respect to the transferor device ","At step  the enterprise communications platform  sends a invitation message to the transferee device . For example, this may include generating and sending new \u201cWeb Information\u201d to the transferee device . This could include, for example, a new address link  () which includes a different identifier. For example, the new invitation message to the transferee device may also include generating and sending new \u201cAudio Information\u201d, such as new Dialing information, Participant code, or Password. At step , the transferee device can accept the invitation message. Additional transferring or forwarding of invitation messages may be performed as part of this conference call scheduling process.","At step , at the time of the scheduled conference call (or beforehand), the transferee device may send a join now request to the enterprise communications platform  with respect to the scheduled conference call. For example, this may be accomplished by selecting a \u201cjoin now\u201d link, or by simply dialing into the enterprise communications platform . This may be performed using an identifier of the transferee device , for example an e-mail address, a Personal Information Number (PIN), or a telephone number (e.g. identified using call display). The enterprise communications platform  then determines whether there is participant authorization with respect to the transferee device .
