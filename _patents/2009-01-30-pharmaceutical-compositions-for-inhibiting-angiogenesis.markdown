Mitochondrial function is linked to angiogenesis, because mitochondria are major sites of oxygen consumption and angiogenesis is an oxygen concentration-sensitive process (Andreyev, A. Y., Kushnareva, Y. E., and Starkov, A. A. (2005). Mitochondrial metabolism of reactive oxygen species. Biochemistry (Mosc.) 70, 200-214; and Maulik, N., and Das, D. K. (2002). Redox signaling in vascular angiogenesis. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 33, 1047-1060). Further, it is known that changes in the mitochondrial redox state stimulate production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during hypoxia and mitochondrial ROS activate transcription of proangiogenic proteins (Chandel, N. S., Maltepe, E., Goldwasser, E., Mathieu, C. E., Simon, M. C., and Schumacker, P. T. (1998). Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species trigger hypoxia-induced transcription. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95, 11715-11720). According to articles published in scientific journals, production of ROS at the mitochondrial complex III is a necessary and sufficient condition for triggering of HIF-1\u03b1 stabilization during hypoxia (Brunelle, J. K., Bell, E. L., Quesada, N. M., Vercauteren, K., Tiranti, V., Zeviani, M., Scarpulla, R. C., and Chandel, N. S. (2005). Oxygen sensing requires mitochondrial ROS but not oxidative phosphorylation. Cell Metab. 1, 409-414; Chandel, N. S., McClintock, D. S., Feliciano, C. E., Wood, T. M., Melendez, J. A., Rodriguez, A. M., and Schumacker, P. T. (2000). Reactive oxygen species generated at mitochondrial complex III stabilize hypoxia-inducible factor-1 during hypoxia. J. Biol. Chem. 275, 25130-25138; Guzy, R. D., Hoyos, B., Robin, E., Chen, H., Liu, L., Mansfield, K. D., Simon, M. C., Hammerling, U., and Schumacker, P. T. (2005). Mitochondrial Complex III is required for hypoxia-induced ROS production and cellular oxygen sensing. Cell Metab. 1, 401-408; and Mansfield, K. D., Guzy, R. D., Pan, Y., Young, R. M., Cash, T. P., Schumacker, P. T., and Simon, M. C. (2005). Mitochondrial dysfunction resulting from loss of cytochrome c impairs cellular oxygen sensing and hypoxic HIF-alpha activation. Cell Metab. 1, 393-399). Cells deficient in mitochondrial DNA and electron transport activity (\u03c1o cells) exhibit no increase of ROS or no upregulation of HIF-1\u03b1 target genes during hypoxia. Complex III inhibitors suppress mitochondrial ROS production during hypoxia and inhibit stabilization and transcriptional activity of HIF-1\u03b1. These findings suggest that ROS production at the mitochondrial complex III is a crucial event in signaling of cellular hypoxia. From the fact that structural components of the mitochondrial complex III take part in cellular oxygen sensing, it is believed that low-molecular weight compounds inhibiting such a cellular oxygen-sensing pathway will be useful means for inhibition of hypoxia-induced angiogenesis.","Meanwhile, biological screening tools are useful for identification of natural compounds capable of inducing alterations of certain phenotypic traits (Kwon, H. J. (2003). Chemical genomics-based target identification and validation of anti-angiogenic agents. Curr. Med. Chem. 10, 717-726; and Liu, J., Farmer, J. D. Jr., Lane, W. S., Friedman, J., Weissman, I., and Schreiber, S. L. (1991). Calcineurin is a common target of cyclophilin-cyclosporin A and FKBP-FK506 complexes. Cell 66, 807-815). In order to find compounds capable of inhibiting angiogenic responses in response to proangiogenic stimuli (such as hypoxia) in endothelial cells, the present inventors extensively conducted large-scale screening of microbial extracts. As a result, the present inventors succeeded in identification of bicyclo sesterterpene, e.g. terpestacin and found that terpestacin is a candidate material capable of inhibiting angiogenic responses at a concentration below a toxic threshold (Jung, H. J., Lee, H. B., Kim, C. J., Rho, J. R., Shin, J., and Kwon, H. J. (2003). Anti-angiogenic activity of terpestacin, a bicyclo sesterterpene from . J. Antibiotics 56, 492-496).","Terpestacin strongly inhibits angiogenic responses of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in vitro, and strongly inhibits angiogenesis of embryonic chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) in vivo. Further, terpestacin is known to inhibit the formation of syncytium during HIV infections and can be chemically synthesized (Chan, J., and Jamison, T. F. (2004). Enantioselective synthesis of (\u2212)-terpestacin and structural revision of siccanol using catalytic stereoselective fragment couplings and macrocyclizations. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 126, 10682-10691; Myers, A. G., Siu, M., and Ren, F. (2002). Enantioselective synthesis of (\u2212)-terpestacin and (\u2212)-fusaproliferin: clarification of optical rotational measurements and absolute configurational assignments establishes a homochiral structural series. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 124, 4230-4232; and Oka, M., Iimura, S., Tenmyo, O., Sawada, Y., Sugawara, M., Ohkusa, N., Yamamoto, H., Kawano, K., Hu, S. L., Fukagawa, Y., and Oki, T. (1993). Terpestacin, a new syncytium formation inhibitor from sp. J. Antibiotics 46, 367-373).","The mitochondrial complex III consists of eleven protein subunits. Essential components of the complex III, e.g. cytochrome b, cytochrome c1, Rieske iron-sulfur protein and ubiquinone are functionally well understood (Crofts, A. R., and Berry, E. A. (1998). Structure and function of the cytochrome bc1 complex of mitochondria and photosynthetic bacteria. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 8, 501-509; and Smith, J. L., Zhang, H., Yan, J., Kurisu, G., and Cramer, W. A. (2004). Cytochrome be complexes: a common core of structure and function surrounded by diversity in the outlying provinces. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 14, 432-439). In addition, specific inhibitors, for example, antimycin A, stigmatellin and myxothiazol have been widely used in functional studies of the complex III (Xia, D., Yu, C. A., Kim, H., Xia, J. Z., Kachurin, A. M., Zhang, L., Yu, L., and Deisenhofer, J. (1997). Crystal structure of the cytochrome bc1 complex from bovine heart mitochondria. Science 277, 60-66; Zhang, Z., Huang, L., Shulmeister, V. M., Chi, Y. I., Kim, K. K., Hung, L. W., Crofts, A. R., Berry, E. A., and Kim, S. H. (1998). Electron transfer by domain movement in cytochrome bc1. Nature 392, 677-684). Unfortunately, these compounds are not suitable as inhibitors of tumor angiogenesis, because they exhibit disadvantages such as inhibition of electron transport, abolition of oxidative phosphorylation, and induction of cellular apoptosis. For these reasons, there is a need for development of novel compounds deleting oxygen sensing functions of the complex III while not causing disruption of ATP production. Therefore, this is attracting a great deal of interest particularly from cancer biologists who have been focused on inhibition of adaptive responses (for example, expression of vascular endothelial growth factor) to hypoxia.","Throughout the specification, numerous scientific articles and patent publications are cited and citations thereof are identified.

The inventive compound HDNT (200 \u03bcM) and the compound terpestacin (200 \u03bcM) binding to QP-C were each added to the culture (6\u00d710pfu\/mL) of the amplified QP-C-expressing bacteriophage T7, followed by stirring at room temperature for 1 hour. Biotin and biotinylated terpestacin (5 \u03bcM), dissolved in TBS buffer (pH 7.5), were each immobilized on streptavidin-coated 96-well plates, and the reaction mixture solution of the QP-C phage and the compound was added to the biotinylated terpestacin-immobilized wells. Following stirring at room temperature for 1 hour, QP-C-expressing bacteriophage T7 particles not bound to the biotinylated terpestacin were washed three times with TBS buffer to remove non-bound phage particles. The QP-C-expressing bacteriophage T7 particles bound to the biotinylated terpestacin were eluted for 1 hour with addition of terpestacin (100 \u03bcM) dissolved in TBS buffer. The eluted QP-C-expressing bacteriophage T7 particles were infected into strain BLT5615 cultured on LB agar medium. The thus-formed bacteriophage plaques were counted and the results were compared between the treated group and the control group (see ).","3. Competitive Binding Assay by Fluorescent Staining","Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were seeded on a 24-well plate (2\u00d710cells\/well) and cultured in EBM-2 (LONZA\u00ae) medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (INVITROGEN\u00ae). Then, the cells were washed with PBS buffer (pH 7.4), and the culture medium was replaced with a fresh one. The inventive compound HDNT (10 \u03bcM) or the compound terpestacin (30 \u03bcM) binding to QP-C was added to each well and the cells were incubated for 24 hours. A fluorescent dye coumarin (20 \u03bcM) and coumarin-conjugated terpestacin (20 \u03bcM) were each added to the control group and the treated group, followed by incubation for another 2 hours. The cells were washed with PBS buffer. Fluorescent intensity was observed under an IX70 fluorescent microscope (OLYMPUS\u00ae) and a microscopic image was taken (see ).","4. Competitive Binding Assay by Surface Plasmon Resonance","Biotin or biotinylated terpestacin (100 \u03bcM) was sequentially immobilized on flow cells of a streptavidin-coated sensor chip (BIACORE\u00ae AB). The inventive compound HDNT (25 \u03bcM) or the compound terpestacin (25 \u03bcM) binding to QP-C was added to HBS-EP buffer (pH 7.4, 10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA) of the purified QP-C protein (25 \u03bcM) which was then poured on a surface of the sensor chip at a flow rate of 30 \u03bcl min.","The binding sensorgram containing association and dissociation curves was obtained by BIACORE\u00ae 2000, and 50 mM NaOH (5 \u03bcl) was poured on the sensor chip surface to result in regeneration. Herein, the binding sensorgam was obtained by deducting a biotin-QP-C protein binding curve from a binding curve between the biotinylated terpestacin and the QP-C protein. A surface plasmon resonance response curve was analyzed using BIACORE\u00ae Evaluations software, version 3.1 (see ).","Experimental Results","Angiogenesis-Inhibitory Activity of HDNT","Angiogenesis is essential for a variety of physiological processes such as embryonic development, wound healing, and tissue or organ regeneration (Risau, W. 1994. Angiogenesis and endothelial cell function. 44: 416-417). However, continuous uncontrolled angiogenesis is pathogenically responsible for the occurrence of angiogenic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, diabetic retinopathy, solid tumor, hemangioma and psoriasis (Carmeliet, P. and R. K. Jain. 2000. Angiogenesis in cancer and other diseases. 407: 249-257). Therefore, a novel anti-angiogenic compound of the present invention can be developed as therapeutic agents for angiogenesis-related cancers and other human diseases. In order to confirm whether the inventive compound HDNT exhibits anti-angiogenic activity, a representative in vitro angiogenesis assay, i.e. measurement of tube formation and invasion of HUVECs, was carried out. As shown in , HDNT inhibited VEGF-mediated tube formation and invasion of HUVECs in a concentration-dependent manner. Further, from the fact that the cells where angiogenesis was inhibited by the compound of the present invention were not stained with trypan blue, it can be seen that anti-angiogenic activity of HDNT was not attributable to the cytotoxicity thereof. These results show that HDNT can be developed as a novel anti-angiogenic agent.","Determination of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential","With recent reports, it was revealed that mitochondrial dysfunction provides important pathogenic causes for chronic degenerative diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and dementia, as well as carcinogenesis (3. Szewczyk, A. and L. Wojtczak. 2002. Mitochondria as a pharmacological target. 54: 101-127). According to previous reports, it was known that production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the mitochondrial electron transfer system triggers angiogenesis essential for cancer metastasis and proliferation (Guzy, R. D., B. Hoyos, E. Robin, H. Chen, L. Liu, K. D. Mansfield, M. C. Simon, U. Hammerling, and P. T. Schumacker. 2005. Mitochondrial Complex III is required for hypoxia-induced ROS production and cellular oxygen sensing. 1: 401-408). In order to examine whether anti-angiogenic activity of the inventive compound HDNT was due to regulation of the mitochondrial function, effects of HDNT on mitochondrial membrane potential changes of HUVECs were investigated. Changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential were measured using JC-1 that is a lipophilic cationic fluorescent marker. JC-1 forms a red fluorescent complex when the mitochondrial membrane potential is in a normal range (\u2212140 mV), whereas it has a tendency to form a green fluorescent monomer when the mitochondrial membrane potential is disrupted (\u2212100 mV). As shown in , the red fluorescence intensity becomes weak but the green fluorescence intensity becomes strong as a treatment concentration of HDNT increases. From these results, it can be seen that HDNT disrupts the mitochondrial membrane potential. Such results suggest that HDNT can modulate the mitochondrial function.","Competitive Binding Assay by Phage Display","Terpestacin, a natural substance having anti-angiogenic activity, binds to QP-C to thereby inhibit production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). In order to confirm whether HDNT regulates the mitochondrial function through binding with QP-C, a phage display-based competitive binding assay was carried out using QP-C-expressing bacteriophage T7. As shown in , biotin did not bind to QP-C-expressing bacteriophage T7, whereas biotinylated terpestacin, the compound that binds to QP-C, specifically bound to QP-C-expressing bacteriophage T7. However, when an excess of terpestacin was first reacted with QP-C-expressing bacteriophage T7, the binding between the biotinylated terpestacin and the QP-C-expressing bacteriophage T7 was significantly inhibited by competitive binding. On the other hand, when HDNT was first reacted with QP-C-expressing bacteriophage T7, the binding between the biotinylated terpestacin and the QP-C-expressing bacteriophage T7 was effectively inhibited, similar to when terpestacin was first reacted. These results suggest that HDNT binds to the QP-C protein.","Competitive Binding Assay by Fluorescent Staining","In order to demonstrate that the inventive compound HDNT binds to QP-C, a competitive binding assay experiment was carried out using a fluorescent derivative of terpestacin, a known compound that binds to QP-C. As shown in , treatment of HUVECs with coumarin-terpestacin resulted in intense blue fluorescence in the cytoplasm where mitochondria are present, unlike coumarin treatment. When the cells were first treated with terpestacin before treatment with coumarin-terpestacin, the binding between the coumarin-terpestacin and the mitochondrial protein QP-C was inhibited by competitive binding, thus resulting in significant attenuation of blue fluorescence in the cytoplasm. On the other hand, when the cells were first treated with HDNT, blue fluorescence was significantly decreased similar to first treatment with terpestacin, thus confirming that HDNT binds to QP-C.","Competitive Binding Assay by Surface Plasmon Resonance","In order to further demonstrate that the inventive compound HDNT binds to QP-C, a competitive binding assay experiment was carried out using a surface plasmon resonance technique that is capable of confirming direct binding of biological substances on the real-time basis, through the measurement of changes in a refractive index. When biotin and biotin-terpestacin were sequentially immobilized on flow cells of a streptavidin-coated sensor chip and then a reaction mixture of terpestacin and QP-C protein was then poured on a surface of the sensor chip, up to 60% of the binding between the biotin-terpestacin and the QP-C protein was inhibited by competitive binding (). On the other hand, when a reaction mixture of HDNT and QP-C protein was poured on a surface of the sensor chip, the binding between the biotin-terpestacin and the QP-C protein was inhibited by 40%, similar to the results obtained upon terpestacin treatment. These results demonstrate that HDNT directly binds to QP-C.","According to the above experimental results, it can be seen that the compound of the present invention, i.e. HDNT, selectively targets the mitochondrial protein QP-C to thereby regulate the mitochondrial function. Therefore, HDNT can be developed as therapeutic agents for treatment of angiogenic diseases including cancers.","Although the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been disclosed for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as disclosed in the accompanying claims.","The compounds used as an active ingredient in the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention bind to QP-C to provide effective prevention of angiogenesis and can be effectively used for prevention and\/or treatment of angiogenesis-related diseases or disorders. Further, the active compounds of the present invention inhibit biological functions of QP-C, which consequently leads to inhibition of angiogenic responses without the risk of cellular apoptosis, thus significantly improving safety of the drug."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 8"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
