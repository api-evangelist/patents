{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention relates to the field of email messaging. In particular, the invention relates to highlighting email recipients.","Many email messages, both within organizations and outside the firewall, are directed to a large amount of recipients. While in some cases, it is not very interesting for the recipient of an email message to be aware of other recipients of the message, in many other cases the recipient of the message is interested to know who else that he\/she knows received the message. For example, a manager wants to see if any of his employees received the message; or a user wants to observe whether any of his close friends received the message as well.","For emails addressed to many recipients, the recipient list in the \u201cTo\u201d and\/or \u201cCc\u201d header field gets harder to digest for the reader as those headers become larger. Thus, finding specific people on those lists becomes a time-consuming problem.","According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for highlighting email recipients, comprising: receiving an email message at a user's email client, the email message having multiple recipients, one of the recipients being the user; obtaining a social network list for the user; comparing the social network list for the user with the email message recipients; and highlighting recipients in the email message who are also in the social network list; wherein any of said steps are implemented in either of computer hardware or computer software embodied in a computer-readable medium.","The method may include determining if a received email message has greater than a threshold number of recipients and activating the highlighting step.","In one embodiment, obtaining a social network list for the user may include accessing a contact list from one or more of the user's resources. The method may include combining multiple contact lists from the user's resources to obtain a social network list for the user.","In an alternative embodiment, obtaining a social network list for the user may include aggregating social network information from sources external to the user. Aggregating social network information may include weighting relationships between contacts. This may include restricting the social network information to a given time range.","The method may include: receiving notification from a server of highlighted recipients who have read the email message; and providing additional highlighting of recipients of the email message who have read the email message.","The method may further include adapting the social network list according to the context of the email message.","According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of providing a service to a customer over a network, the service comprising: obtaining a social network list for a user; comparing the social network list for the user with email message recipients of a received email message; and highlighting recipients in the email message who are also in the social network list; wherein any of said steps are implemented in either of computer hardware or computer software embodied in a computer-readable medium.","According to a third aspect of the present invention there is provided a computer program product for highlighting email recipients, the computer program product comprising: a computer readable medium; computer program instructions operative to: receive an email message at a user's email client, the email message having multiple recipients, one of the recipients being the user; obtain a social network list for the user; compare the social network list for the user with the email message recipients; and highlight recipients in the email message who are also in the social network list; wherein said program instructions are stored on said computer readable medium.","According to a fourth aspect of the present invention there is provided a system for highlighting email recipients, comprising: an email client application at which an email message is received having multiple recipients, one of the recipients being the user, the email client including: a social network retrieval component for obtaining a social network list for the user; a comparison component for comparing the social network list for the user with the email message recipients; and a display component for highlighting recipients in the email message who are also in the social network list; wherein any of said email client application, social network retrieval component, comparison component, and display component are implemented in either of computer hardware or computer software and embodied in a computer readable medium.","The system may include a user interface for setting parameters regarding the highlighting of recipients.","The system may include an activation component for determining if a received email message has greater than a threshold number of recipients and activating the highlighting step.","In one embodiment, the social network retrieval component may include accessing contact lists from one or more of the user's resources. The social network retrieval component may combine multiple contact lists from the user's resources to obtain a social network list for the user.","In another embodiment, the social network retrieval component may aggregate social network information from sources external to the user. The social network retrieval component may aggregate social network information including weighting relationships between contacts. The social network retrieval component may also include restricting the social network information to a given time range.","The system may include: a server for receiving read events for email messages by recipients; the email client application including a recipient read notification mechanism for receiving notification from the server of highlighted recipients who have read the email message; and the display component providing additional highlighting of recipients of the email message who have read the email message.","The system may also include a context component for adapting the social network list according to the context of the email message.","In email messages addressed to a large amount of people, it is often hard for a recipient of the message to observe other relevant co-recipients who appear on the message. Highlighting of recipients is proposed from the user's social network who also appear as recipients of the message.","It is proposed that email clients are adapted to highlight for the user, recipients who are found to be related to him. In this way, the user can easily detect who he knows who also received the message.","It will be appreciated that for simplicity and clarity of illustration, elements shown in the figures have not necessarily been drawn to scale. For example, the dimensions of some of the elements may be exaggerated relative to other elements for clarity. Further, where considered appropriate, reference numbers may be repeated among the figures to indicate corresponding or analogous features.","In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. However, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, and components have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the present invention.","Upon viewing an email message in a user's email client, the described method and system allow highlighting of recipients within the user's social network. The highlighting can be done in any appropriate manner, for example, by using a larger font (bold) and\/or a different color. An option mechanism such as a button or menu option is provided that allows the user control over the highlighting feature.","The default of the highlighting of recipients can be one of three options:","1). No social network highlighting is set and upon user selection, highlighting will occur.","2). Social network highlighting for all messages is set and upon user selection, highlighting will stop.","3). Social network highlighting for messages with above X recipients is set, for example, X=20. Upon user selection highlighting\/un-highlighting will occur. Controlling X can be allowed to the user through user preferences.","The core of the highlighting mechanism is retrieving the appropriate social network for the user, according to which highlighting will occur. Two possible embodiments are described for this.","The first embodiment uses an unweighted social network list that can be retrieved from the user's contact lists in the user's own sources. For example, the user's contact lists may include his address book, instant messaging (IM) buddylist, or a social network service (SNS) contacts (for example, IBM's (IBM is a trade mark of International Business Machines Corporation) internal Enterprise Social Network Site (see Dimicco, J. M., Geyer, W., Millen D. R., Dugan, C. and Bronholtz B., \u201cPeople Sensemaking and Relationship Building on an Enterprise Social Network Site\u201d, 2009, 1-10) or Facebook (Facebook is a trade mark of Facebook, Inc.). The social network list can be retrieved as the contact list from one of the user's sources or it can be retrieved by using combinations of the user's sources by union or intersection. The final outcome is a flat list of user IDs. These user IDs will be highlighted upon receiving of messages on whose header they co-occur with the user.","A second embodiment uses an aggregating social network system, for example, a system such as SONAR (SOcial Networking ARchitecture) (see reference \u201cHarvesting with SONAR\u2014The Value of Aggregating Social Network Information\u201d I. Guy, M. Jacovi, E. Shahar, N. Meshulam, V. Soroka, S. Farrell, In proc. of CHI 2008). An aggregating social network system such as SONAR can provide a weighted social network list with scores representing the strength of relationships based on various data sources. The data source may be from across an organization or other social network sources. Using SONAR to retrieve the user's social network, more parameters can be taken into account while making a decision of which recipients to highlight. These parameters may include:\n\n","Referring to , a block diagram shows an email system  as described. The email system  includes an email client application  hosted by a user's system  which retrieves email messages  from a remote email server  via a network . The email client application  receives email messages  which include a recipient list  in the email message's header in the \u201cto:\u201d and \u201ccc:\u201d fields. The email client application  also includes an address list  of the email addresses used by the user.","The email client application  is extended to include a social network highlighting mechanism  as described. The social network highlighting mechanism  includes an activation component  to determine if the social network highlighting is to be activated when an email message  is received. The social network highlighting mechanism  also includes a social network retrieval component  for retrieving a social network list  to be used by the highlighting mechanism . The highlighting mechanism  includes a comparison component  for comparing the recipient list  of an email message  with the social network list . The social network highlighting mechanism  also includes a display component  for changing the display of the recipients in the email message . A user settings component  is provided in the social network highlighting mechanism  in order for the user to set user preferences relating to the highlighting.","The user system  may also include other sources of contact information such as an instant messaging application  including a contacts list . The user system  may also include a web browser application  for accessing other sources of contact information such as social network services  via a network .","In one embodiment, the social network retrieval component  of the highlighting mechanism  uses user's sources of contact information (such as the email address list , an instant messaging contact list  and social network service  contact lists) to determine the social network list .","In another embodiment, the social network retrieval component  of the highlighting mechanism  uses external sources of contact information such as an aggregating social network system  which gathers and weights social network information relating to the user from external sources as described further below.","While the social network highlighting mechanism  may provide appropriate defaults for the parameters of the highlighting, the user may have control over them as well by inputting preferences in the user settings component . A preference menu is provided in which the user can control parameters, such as the strength threshold, the time window to consider, and the data sources to take into account. This is shown further in relation to .","After automatically retrieving the user's social network by the social network retrieval component , the user may be given manual control over the list by removing or adding people.","In each of the two embodiments (unweighted and weighted social networks), the IDs of the people on the entire network are mapped to email addresses. Based on these addresses, highlighting takes place.","An extension to the highlighting feature may be provided to display information about which recipients in the user's social network have already read an email message. This can be done by a second, different form of highlighting (font and\/or color). Providing this information may facilitate collaboration for the user around the subject of the message and in some cases may even spare him the need to read the whole message.","The general case is considered where the email client application and the social network from which information about relationships is drawn are different. In this case, the email client application would store in a server information per user and per message for which the user is a recipient which will indicate whether the user has already read the message. This will be done based on events sent to the server upon opening a message on the client side. Then, when one of the message recipients opens it and ask for the feature of highlighting the social network as well as highlighting who from the social network has read the message, the email client application would issue a call for the server with all the relevant people (the recipients of the message who are part of the user's social network). The server will return for each of the individuals the read\/unread status per the information stored. Based on this information, highlighting of read\/unread is performed.","Read notification highlighting is very useful in the workplace in fostering collaboration around email messages. In some cases, it may help a user in deciding whether to skip reading a message. A second line manager may be able to get an indication of which of his first liners have already read the message. A project team member can also get an indication of whether a message has been read by other team members.","Referring to , the email system  of  is shown with the extension of a recipient read notification mechanism  provided in the email client application .","A read notification server  is provided which maintains a record of users - and email messages -. Email recipients ,  of an email message  send read events ,  for the message  to the read notification server  which updates its records of users - who have read a message -.","The recipient read notification mechanism  at the user's email client application  calls  the read notification server  with the social network list  to find out which of the recipients on the social network list  have read the email message . A return status  is returned allowing the social network highlighting mechanism  of the user's email client application  to additionally highlight recipients of the email message  in the user's social network list  who have read the email message .","A further embodiment is provided in which the social network based on which the highlighting occurs is adapted to the specific context of the email message. For differing types of messages, differing highlighting will take place. This can be implemented with an aggregating social network system such as SOcial Networking ARchitecture (SONAR) and a search engine, as implemented in Social Networks and Discovery (SaND) (see reference: Ronen, I., Shahar, E., Ur, S., Uziel, E., Yogev, S., Zwerdling, N., Carmel, D., Guy, I., Har'el, N., and Ofek-Koifman, S., \u201cSocial networks and discovery in the enterprise (SaND)\u201d, In 2009, 836.","The SaND system allows combining social network and content information and supports querying for a user's social network within a given context. The context can be described by a search query by combining several keywords (e.g.: \u201crecommender systems\u201d). Using a system like SaND, which is an extension to SONAR, the email application may ask for the social network of the user with respect to the context of the email message. The context of the email message can be derived, for example, by the title or by extracting the most meaningful keywords from the message's body. The user can then choose to highlight the social network with or without the context of the message.","Referring to , an exemplary system for implementing the described systems is shown includes a data processing system  suitable for storing and\/or executing program code including at least one processor  coupled directly or indirectly to memory elements through a bus system . The memory elements can include local memory employed during actual execution of the program code, bulk storage, and cache memories which provide temporary storage of at least some program code in order to reduce the number of times code must be retrieved from bulk storage during execution.","The memory elements may include system memory  in the form of read only memory (ROM)  and random access memory (RAM) . A basic input\/output system (BIOS)  may be stored in ROM . System software  may be stored in RAM  including operating system software . Software applications  may also be stored in RAM .","The system  may also include a primary storage means  such as a magnetic hard disk drive and secondary storage means  such as a magnetic disc drive and an optical disc drive. The drives and their associated computer-readable media provide non-volatile storage of computer-executable instructions, data structures, program modules and other data for the system . Software applications may be stored on the primary and secondary storage means ,  as well as the system memory .","The computing system  may operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers via a network adapter .","Input\/output devices  can be coupled to the system either directly or through intervening I\/O controllers. A user may enter commands and information into the system  through input devices such as a keyboard, pointing device, or other input devices (for example, microphone, joy stick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner, or the like). Output devices may include speakers, printers, etc. A display device  is also connected to system bus  via an interface, such as video adapter .","Referring to , a flow diagram  is shown as carried out by an email client application implementing the described social network highlighting of recipients in an email message.","An email message is opened  in a window on the user's system. The window shows a single message or a preview of it that includes all recipients. The email application checks  if social network highlighting is selected and, optionally, checks the number of recipients if the highlighting is dependent on the number. It is determined  if highlighting is required. If it is not required, the email message is displayed  without social network highlighting.","If the highlighting is required, the email application accesses  the user's social network list for highlighting as it retrieved according to the description above and considering the corresponding parameters. The recipients of the message are compared  to the social network list. The recipients of the message also in the user's social network list are highlighted  and the message is displayed .","Optionally, information can be obtained  of highlighted recipients who have read the message and an additional form of highlighting applied  to the recipients who have read the message.","Referring to , flow diagrams ,  show two embodiments of methods of obtaining the social network lists as accessed in step  of .","In the flow diagram  of , contact lists are retrieved  from user's sources, for example, the email address list, instant messaging contacts list, and social network service contact lists to which the user subscribes. The contact lists are combined  using any required combination method, for example, a union of the list, or an intersection of the lists. The overall user's social network list is obtained  on which the highlighting is to be based and sent  to the social network highlighting mechanism.","In the flow diagram  of , contact lists are retrieved  for the user and aggregated by a system from various sources. The sources may be from a single organization such as organizational charts, internal address lists, etc. Alternatively, the sources may be from publicly available sources. The sources may, optionally, be restricted . The contacts obtained for the user from the sources are evaluated  by the strength of relationship to the user. The evaluation may be restricted by date . The evaluation may also be restricted to a context  of the message. The overall user's social network list is obtained  on which the highlighting is to be based and sent  to the social network highlighting mechanism.","In one embodiment, a social network aggregating service such as SONAR (SOcial Networking ARchitecture) is used. SONAR is an API and architecture for retrieving and sharing social network data in an organization and aggregating it across applications. SONAR extracts information on who's connected to whom, with what strength, and based on what evidence. SONAR is implemented as a service using a REST API and can be used by various clients. It is currently in use by a Lotus Sametime client (SonarBuddies) (Lotus and Sametime are trade marks of International Business Corporation) and the web client of an employee profile application.","SONAR adheres to privacy restrictions, thus data extracted from emails and chats will be exposed only to their owner(s). \u25a1SONAR aggregates the data retrieved from its sources and extracts a weighted social network of a person and the artifacts connecting the people in that network. The weight factor expresses the strength of the connection between people. SONAR can also enable the extraction of a person's network according to a specific topic.","Referring to , a graphical user interface  is shown of an email client with the described functionality of highlighting social network recipients.","An email message  has a header  with a \u201cfrom:\u201d field , a \u201cto:\u201d field , and a \u201ccc:\u201d field . The \u201cto:\u201d and \u201ccc:\u201d fields ,  each have a selection button ,  for selecting to highlight recipients who are on a user's social network list. The selection button ,  may include an activation (for example, a right-click of the button) to open a preference page . Multiple recipients -, - in the \u201cto:\u201d and \u201ccc\u201d fields ,  then include some recipients , , ,  highlighted as belonging to the user's social network list. In addition, a second form of highlighting  shows the recipient belongs to the user's social network list and has read the email message .","The preference page  includes one or more of the following user setting options. An option  is provided to turn the highlighting on or off. A threshold option  for the number of recipients above which the highlighting is activated. An option  is provided to manually add or remove recipients from the social network list by the user. The option  to manually add or remove recipients includes a browse button  to select recipients to add or remove.","In addition, the preference page  may include social network source selection option . The social network sources may be selected from user sources or external sources and a browse button  is provided to select sources. A combination type option  for the combination of social network sources is provided with options of different types of combination.","For weighted social network systems, a relative strength threshold option  is provided. A time range option  to include in source selection is also provided.","Finally, a read notification option  may be selected by a user to activate a second form of highlighting to highlight recipients on the user's social network list that have read the email message .","The described features are added to existing email applications, which adapts email to Web 2.0 where social network information is ubiquitous. The system highlights people from within the user's network over email messages.","Many user's address books provide fairly sparse information, whereas social network sites are becoming more and more popular providing social network information for a user. The described method and system tap into external social network information to enrich the user's social network based on which highlighting in an email message takes place.","A social network highlighting system for email applications may be provided as a service to a customer over a network.","The invention can take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, or an embodiment containing both hardware and software elements. In a preferred embodiment, the invention is implemented in software, which includes but is not limited to firmware, resident software, microcode, etc.","The invention can take the form of a computer program product accessible from a computer-usable or computer-readable medium providing program code for use by or in connection with a computer or any instruction execution system. For the purposes of this description, a computer usable or computer readable medium can be any apparatus that can contain, store, communicate, propagate, or transport the program for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus or device.","The medium can be an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system (or apparatus or device) or a propagation medium. Examples of a computer-readable medium include a semiconductor or solid state memory, magnetic tape, a removable computer diskette, a random access memory (RAM), a read only memory (ROM), a rigid magnetic disk and an optical disk. Current examples of optical disks include compact disk read only memory (CD-ROM), compact disk read\/write (CD-R\/W), and DVD.","Improvements and modifications can be made to the foregoing without departing from the scope of the present invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The subject matter regarded as the invention is particularly pointed out and distinctly claimed in the concluding portion of the specification.
