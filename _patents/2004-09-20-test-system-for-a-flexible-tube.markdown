title: Test system for a flexible tube
abstract: A system is provided for testing a flexible tube. First and second hollow mandrels are inserted into opposing ends of the tube. Each mandrel has a conically tapered portion at one end thereof and a cylindrical portion extending from the conically tapered portion. The cylindrical portion has a plurality of annular indentations formed thereabout. Each of a plurality of clamps encircle the tube in line with one annular indentation to sealably engage the tube. A fluid delivery system is coupled between the cylindrical portions of the mandrels to deliver a flow of fluid through the tube via the mandrels. A measured strain producing load, continuous or cyclical, is applied by an apparatus which controllably moves the first mandrel relative to the second mandrel such that a cross-sectional shape of the tube between the mandrels is altered.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for Governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","(1) Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to testing of flexible tubes, and more particularly to a system for testing a flexible tube, e.g., biomedical tubes, that minimizes unwanted stress on the tube while simulating an actual use environment.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","In many applications involving the use of flexible tubing, it is desirable to determine the tube's mechanical properties and to know how the tubing will react under load conditions. Accordingly, sample lengths of the purposed tubing must be tested in either actual use or in a test environment. In cases where tube performance is critical (e.g., shock testing, environmental and hazardous material testing, biomedical tube applications to include artificial arteries and other biofluid ducts), testing in an actual use environment is not an option. Thus, many types of flexible tubing must rely on lab testing.","Currently, it is difficult to grip materials such as thin-walled tubing in a manner that does not distort the cylindrical shape. Conventional lab testing techniques generally pinch the ends of the tube such that the resulting shape is no longer cylindrical. The shape distortion causes stress concentrations to develop in the gripping area that can lead to premature failure. However, the shape change in the gripping area can also negatively affect areas along the test section of the tube. In addition, there are no practical test means of holding flexible tubes while applying an internal pressure to them for the purposes of testing the tube's fluid transport performance while under a loaded condition.","Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a system for testing a flexible tube.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a system for testing a flexible tube that minimizes unwanted tube distortion.","Still another object of the present invention is to provide a system for testing the fluid handling performance of the flexible tube as the flexible tube experiences load conditions.","Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become more obvious hereinafter in the specification and drawings.","In accordance with the present invention, a system for testing a flexible tube includes first and second hollow mandrels inserted into opposing ends of the tube undergoing test. Each mandrel has a conically tapered portion at one end thereof within the tube and a cylindrical portion extending from the conically tapered portion. The cylindrical portion has an outside surface that undulates such that a plurality of annular indentations are formed thereabout within the tube. Each of a plurality of clamps encircle the tube in line with one annular indentation to circumferentially compress the tube into the respective annular indentation. In this way, the outside surface of each mandrel is sealably engaged with the tube. A fluid delivery system is coupled between the cylindrical portions of the mandrels for pumping a fluid through the tube via the mandrels. A loading apparatus controllably moves the first mandrel relative to the second mandrel such that a cross-sectional shape of the tube between the mandrels is altered.","Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to , a system is shown for testing a flexible tube  (shown in phantom) and is referenced generally by numeral . System  includes mandrels ,  supported by respective bases , . Coupled to each base ,  is a respective hose lead ,  connected to pump  which can be a constant-pressure or cyclic-pressure pump for pumping fluid through tube  as will be explained further below.","System  can also include an apparatus or mechanism for causing tube  to experience strain causing load conditions, e.g., tension, compression, etc. For example, if tube  were to be used as an artificial artery or as part of any dynamic solid, liquid or gaseous transport system, a test machine capable of applying tensile or compressive cyclic loads could be coupled to bases , . In general, the test machine would include a stationary platen  to which base  is attached and a moveable platen  to which base  is attached. The movement of platen  relative to platen , indicated by arrow , delivers the desired-load, e.g., constant tension, constant compression or cyclical tension and compression.","Referring additionally now to , a preferred embodiment construction of mandrel  and base  will be explained in greater detail. It is to be understood that similar construction details exist for mandrel  and base . Mandrel  is hollow with a bore or passage  extending therethrough along the central longitudinal axis . One end  is smoothly tapered while the main body portion  extending from (tapered) end  is generally cylindrical. However, the outside surface of main body portion  undulates along the length thereof to form at least one and, preferably, a plurality (two are shown) of annular indentations or grooves ,  about the perimeter of main body portion . Typically, the annular indentations lie in planes that are perpendicular to central longitudinal axis . The largest outside diameter D of the combination of tapered end  and main body portion  is equal to or slightly less than the inside diameter of tube  when tube  is in its relaxed state. In this way, mandrel  does not stress or distort the shape of tube  as mandrel  is inserted in an end thereof.","To couple mandrel  to base , mandrel  is threaded at end  as shown. A mating threaded connection  is provided at base . To form a good fluid seal between mandrel  and base , an O-ring  is provided at end  (or alternatively can be provided within threaded connection ). A passage  through base  couples a mounting conduit  to the open area of connection  and, ultimately, to passage  of mandrel . Hose lead  is coupled to mounting conduit .","Referring again to , each mandrel ,  is inserted partially or fully into tube  such that the annular indentations thereof, e.g., annular indentations , , are within tube . The tapered ends of the mandrels, e.g., end , facilitates the initial insertion of each mandrel into tube  while the diameter of each main body portion permits them to slide easily into position within tube . The smooth taper of end  also allows tube  to be deformed (i.e., stretched) without damage to the inner walls of tube . In other words, when the cross-section of tube  is reduced about end , the inner surface of tube  does not contact any rough or sharp edges of mandrel .","Once in position within tube , each of mandrels ,  is fixed relative to tube  by means of at least one and, preferably, a plurality of clamps that cooperate with tube  and the annular indentation(s) ,  on each mandrel , . In the example of , clamps  and  are provided for mandrel  and clamps  and  are provided for mandrel . Each of clamps , , ,  is a \u201ccircular\u201d clamp capable of applying a generally even circumferential pressure about tube  at a respective annular indentation of one of the mandrels. In this way, tube  is positively engaged with the mandrels to provide a good mechanical coupling and a good fluid seal. The mechanical coupling allows tube  to have loads applied thereto while the fluid seal allows tube  to be tested simultaneously for fluid handling performance. In addition, clamps , ,  and  can be selected to be the same type of clamp that would be used in an actual use environment. For example, if tube  is an artificial artery, each of clamps , ,  and  could be a suture clamp. In this way, testing is extended to include the support components related to tube  as they would be used in the actual application.","In operation, once each mandrel is secured with its respective clamps to tube , pump  and moveable platen  can be operated in a desired fashion. For example, pump  could be operated cyclically to simulate blood being pumped through tube  (via the hose leads, bases and mandrels), while the combination of stationary platen  and moveable platen  applied various loads to tube  via mandrels , .","The advantages of the present invention are numerous. The design of each mandrel minimizes any unwanted stress or distortion of the tube sample during test set-up and test runs. The combination of circular clamps cooperating with the annular indentations on each mandrel provides both mechanical and fluid seal coupling necessary to test the tube dynamically.","With the present invention installed in a suitable test machine such as in Instron Universal Test Machine Model 4206 manufactured by Instron Corporation, Canton, Mass., loads and strains can be monitored as a function of flow rates and pressures. It provides for a simple means of evaluating the mechanical behavior of tube materials without having to destroy the actual tube geometry. Extensometers and strain gages can be used to outfit the tube samples such that strains in all directions can be monitored. The invention can also be designed small enough to fit inside conventional temperature or pressure chambers which can provide other degrees of accuracy in terms of simulating the actual use environment.","It will be understood that many additional changes in the details, materials, steps and arrangement of parts, which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention, may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING(S)","p":["Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent upon reference to the following description of the preferred embodiments and to the drawings, wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
