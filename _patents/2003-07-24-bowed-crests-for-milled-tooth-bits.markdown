title: Bowed crests for milled tooth bits
abstract: A method of forming milled teeth on a roller cone of a milled tooth roller cone rock bit includes shaping a crest of a chisel shaped milled tooth on the roller cone. The crest is shaped such that the crest has a convex profile from one corner to an opposite corner of the crest. Such a crest is adapted to produce at least one of a convex axial stress distribution, a substantially even axial stress distribution, and a substantially smooth axial stress distribution. Further, the forming includes radiusing each of the corners at the ends of the crest of the chisel shaped milled tooth.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT","BACKGROUND OF INVENTION","SUMMARY OF INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a divisional application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/931,517, entitled \u201cBOWED CREST FOR MILLED TOOTH BITS,\u201d filed Aug. 16, 2001, inventor Amardeep Singh, and herein incorporated by reference.","Not applicable.","1. Field of the Invention","The invention relates generally to earth-boring bits used to drill a borehole for the ultimate recovery of oil, gas or minerals. More particularly, the invention relates to roller cone rock bits and to an improved cutting structure for such bits. Still more particularly, the invention relates to a cutter element having a bowed crest geometry which provides for a more uniform stress distribution.","2. Background Art","The success of rotary drilling enabled the discovery of deep oil and gas reserves. The roller cone rock bit was an important invention that made that success possible. The original roller-cone rock bit, invented by Howard R. Hughes, U.S. Pat. No. 930,759, was able to drill the hard caprock at the Spindletop field, near Beaumont, Tex.","That invention, within the first decade of the twentieth century, could drill a scant fraction of the depth and speed of modern rotary rock bits. If the original Hughes bit drilled for hours, the modern bit drills for days. Bits today often drill overall improvement in the performance of rock bits.","Roller-cone rock bits typically are secured to a drill string, which is rotated from the surface. Drilling fluid or mud is pumped down the hollow drill string and out of the bit. The drilling mud cools and lubricates the bit as it rotates and carries cuttings generated by the bit to the surface.","Roller-cone rock bits generally have at least one, and typically three roller cones rotatably mounted to a bearing on the bit body. The roller cones have cutters or cutting elements on them to induce high contact stresses in the formation being drilled as the cutters roll over the bottom of the borehole during drilling operation. These stresses cause the rock to fail, resulting in disintegration and penetration of the formation material being drilled.","Operating in the harsh down hole environment, the components of roller-cone rock bits are subjected to many forms of wear. Among the most common forms of wear is abrasive wear caused by contact with abrasive rock formation materials. Moreover, the drilling mud, laden with rock chips or cuttings, is a very effective abrasive slurry.","Many wear-resistant treatments are applied to the various components of the roller-cone rock bit. Among the most prevalent is the application of a welded-on wear-resistant material or \u201chardfacing.\u201d This material can be applied to many surfaces of the rock bit, including the cutting elements.","U.S. Pat. No. 4,262,761 discloses a milled steel tooth rotary rock bit wherein one or more holes are drilled into the crest of the tooth-shaped cutting structure. Tungsten carbide rods are positioned in the holes and hardfacing is applied to the tooth. The hardfacing is applied across the top of the tooth crest and acts to hold the tungsten carbide rods in place. The rods are inserted in holes parallel and close to one flank of the tooth so that the entire length of the carbide rods can be attached to the hardfacing by burning the hardfacing through to the carbide rods. Wear on the tooth will proceed along the side of the tooth not reinforced with the carbide rods and a self-sharpening effect is enhanced by the strength of the carbide rods. The carbide rods and holes therefore can be relatively inexpensive, since close tolerance finishing is not required.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,152,194 discloses a milled tooth roller cone rock bit consisting of chisel crested milled teeth with generously radiused corners at the ends of the crest. A concave depression is formed in the crest between the radiused ends. A layer of hardfacing material formed over each tooth is thicker at the corners and in the concave depressions in the crest to provide a means to inhibit wear of the hardfacing as the bit works in a borehole.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,311,958 discloses an earth-boring bit that is provided with three cutters, two of the three cutters are provided with heel disk cutting elements defined by a pair of generally oppositely facing disk surfaces that generally continuously converge to define a circumferential heel disk crest. One of the two cutters having heel disk elements is further provided with an inner disk cutting element.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,492,186 discloses an earth boring bit rotatable cutter having a first hardfacing composition of carbide particles selected from the class of cast and macrocrystalline tungsten carbide dispersed in a steel matrix deposited on the gage surface of at least some of the heel row teeth. A substantial portion of these particles are characterized by a high level of abrasion resistance and a lower level of fracture resistance. A second hardfacing composition of carbide particles selected from the class of spherical sintered and spherical cast tungsten is dispersed in a steel matrix deposited over at least the crest and an upper portion of the gage surface to cover the corner that tends to round during drilling. A substantial portion of the particles of this composition are characterized by a high level of fracture resistance and a lower level of abrasion resistance.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,868,213 discloses a steel tooth, particularly suited for use in a rolling cone bit, includes a root region, a cutting tip spaced from the root region and a gage facing surface therebetween. The gage facing surface includes a knee, and is configured such that the cutting tip is maintained at a position off the gage curve. So positioned, the cutting tip is freed from having to perform any substantial cutting duty in the corner on the borehole corner, and instead may be configured and optimized for bottom hole cutting duty. The knee on the gage facing surface is configured and positioned so as to serve primarily to cut the borehole wall. It is preferred that the knee be positioned off gage, but that it be closer to the gage curve than the cutting tip.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,206,115 discloses an earth-boring bit having a bit body with at least one earth disintegrating cutter mounted on it. The cutter is generally conically shaped and rotatably secured to the body. The cutter has a plurality of teeth formed on it. The teeth have underlying stubs of steel which are integrally formed with and protrude from the cutter. The stubs have flanks which incline toward each other and terminate in a top. A carburized layer is formed on the flanks and the top to a selected depth. The stub has a width across its top from one flank to the other that is less than twice the depth of the carburized layer. A layer of hardfacing is coated on the tops and flanks of the stub, forming an apex for the tooth.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,241,034 discloses a cutter element for a drill bit. The cutter element has a base portion and an extending portion and the extending portion has either a zero draft or a negative draft with respect to the base portion. The non-positive draft allows more of the borehole bottom to be scraped using fewer cutter elements. The cutter elements having non-positive draft can be either tungsten carbide inserts or steel teeth.","Referring now to , which illustrates a milled tooth roller cone rock bit generally designated as . The bit  consists of bit body  threaded at pin end  and cutting end generally designated as . Each leg  supports a rotary cone  rotatively retained on a journal, optionally cantilevered from each of the legs (not shown). The milled teeth generally designated as  extending from each of the cones  may be milled from steel. Each of the chisel crested teeth  forms a crest , a base , two flanks , and tooth ends .","Hardfacing material may be applied to at least one or each of the teeth . In one embodiment, the application of hardfacing is applied only to the cutting side of the tooth as opposed to the other flanks  and ends  of the teeth . In another embodiment, the hardfacing may be applied to all the flanks  and ends  of the teeth .","The rock bit  may further include a fluid passage through pin  that communicates with a plenum chamber (not shown). In one embodiment, there are one or more nozzles  that are secured within body . The nozzles direct fluid from plenum chamber (not shown) towards a borehole bottom. In another embodiment, the rock bit  has no nozzles . In another embodiment, the upper portion of each of the legs may have a lubricant reservoir  to supply a lubricant to each of the rotary cones  through a lubrication channel (not shown).","Turning now to the prior art of , conventional hardfaced chisel crested teeth generally designated as , when they operate in a borehole for a period of time, wear on the corners  of the teeth. The prior art tooth consists of a crown or crest  having hardfacing material  across the crest and down the flanks  terminating near the base  of the tooth .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 2C","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2C"],"b":["40","50"]},"As heretofore stated the hardfacing material  transitioning from the crest  towards to the flanks  may be very thin at the corners of the conventional teeth . Consequently, as the tooth wears, the hardfacing, since it may be very thin, may wear out quickly, and thus expose the underlying steel  of the tooth . Consequently, erosion voids (not shown) could invade the base metal  since it is usually softer than hardfacing material .","According to one aspect of one or more embodiments of the present invention, a method of forming milled teeth on a roller cone of a milled tooth roller cone rock bit comprises: shaping a crest of at least one chisel shaped milled tooth such that the crest comprises at least one convex profile from one corner to an opposite corner of the crest, where the convex crest is adapted to produce at least one of a convex axial stress distribution, a substantially even axial stress distribution, and a substantially smooth axial stress distribution; and radiusing each of the corners at the ends of the crest of the at least one chisel shaped milled tooth.","Turning now to one embodiment illustrated in , the chisel tooth generally designated as  consists of, for example, a steel foundation , forming flanks , ends  and a crest . Between rounded corners  is a convex portion  on the crest  of the tooth. The convex portion  enables hardfacing material  to be thicker at the corners  of the crest , therefore providing for more durable cutting corners . Each of the corners  has a sufficient radius so that the thickness of the hardfacing material is assured as it transitions from the crest  towards the ends  and the flanks  of the tooth . The hardfacing material may terminate at the base  of each of the teeth . The base  provides a termination point for the hardfacing material  as it is applied over the crest ends and flanks of each of the teeth .","By providing a convex portion  or rounded geometry and rounded corners  at the end of the crested tooth, the hardfacing material may be applied more generously at the corners  of the crest and at a sufficient thickness in the center of the crest to produce a generally flat crest . The geometry at the corners  assures a thick application of hardfacing material at a vulnerable area of the tooth.","One suitable hardfacing material and a method of its application is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,836,307 to Keshavan et al and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Referring now to the cross-sectional example of , a typical tooth  formed from a cone of a 9\u215e inch diameter milled tooth roller cone rock bit could, for example, have a tooth height \u201cA\u201d of about 0.5 to about 1.5 inches, in one embodiment, 0.72 inches, and a width \u201cB\u201d of about 0.5 to about 1.0 inches, in one embodiment, 0.62 inches across the chisel crown of the tooth . The radius at the corners  may be between about 0.02 and about 0.20 inches, in one embodiment, about 0.08 inches. The convex radius  may be between about 0.15 and 1.0 inches, in one embodiment, 0.50 inches. The depth \u201cC\u201d of the convex radius may be between about 0.02 inches and about 0.20 inches, in one embodiment, about 0.05 inches.","In one embodiment, the crest  of the tooth  may be substantially flat between radiused corners, the tooth having a varied hardfacing  thickness between radiused corners. In another embodiment, the crest  of the tooth  may be convex between radiused corners, the tooth having a constant hardfacing thickness between radiused corners. In another embodiment, the crest  of the tooth  may be convex between radiused corners, the tooth having a varied hardfacing  thickness between radiused corners, wherein the hardfacing  is thicker at the radiused corners.","The hardfacing  may have a thickness along the ends , flanks  and corners  between about 0.02 and about 0.18 inches, in one embodiment a thickness of about 0.10 inches.","The thickness of the hardfacing at depth \u201cD\u201d and along the crest  may be between about 0.04 and about 0.18 inches, in one embodiment a depth of about 0.10 inches (with respect to the example of ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"],"b":["120","124","129","127","124","125","126","132","124","132","126","129","127","18","124","124","126"]},"In another embodiment of the present invention (not shown), the chisel crest tooth, generally designated as  forms a crest  that transitions into ends  and flanks . Crest  forms a convex shape , in one embodiment a bow, between corners  that allows a gradually decreasing thickness of hardfacing material  across the crest , so that the thickness of the hardfacing material  is thickest across the corners and less thick in the middle between the corners. The hardfacing material  can also maintain a relatively thick layer across the corners  and down the ends  and flanks  towards the cone  (shown in ). One advantage may be to maintain a uniform axial stress profile across the crest , or a convex stress profile across the crest . Another advantage may be to provide a robust or thick hardfacing material across the flanks  and ends  such that the tooth as it operates in a borehole retains its integrity and sharpness as it works in a borehole.","In another alternative embodiment, the flanks  and\/or the ends  may have a depression or concave portion (not shown) whereby the hardfacing material is thicker at the concave portion thus providing a thicker area along the flanks  and\/or the ends . In another alternative embodiment, the flanks  and\/or the ends  may have a convex portion (not shown) or a bow, whereby the hardfacing material is either the same thickness or thinner at the convex portion (not shown). Hardfacing may terminate at base  at each of the mill teeth . A convex portion on the flanks  and\/or the ends  may provide increased tooth strength due to the larger amount of tooth substrate material. A concave portion on the flanks  and\/or the ends  may provide increased hardfacing thickness and increased tooth durability due to the larger amount of tooth hardfacing material.","In another alternative embodiment, the tooth may have more than one convex portions, or bows, along the crest, the corners may be rounded in much the same manner as in , , and  in order to assure a thickness at the corners of the tooth. In another alternative embodiment, the flanks and\/or the ends may have a concave portion, a convex portion, or multiple concave and\/or convex portions. Alternatively, the flanks and\/or the ends may have a series of depressions to assure a robust layer of hardfacing along the ends and flanks. The hardfacing material may terminate on a groove or shoulder or recess at the base of the tooth.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["320","330","332","330","329","327","332","320","324","324","324","332","322","320","322","332","329","327","320","332"]},"In an alternative embodiment, a milled tooth with a convex chisel crest converging at both radiused ends could be hardfaced. In one embodiment, the thickness of the hardfacing could remain substantially constant across the crest as illustrated by the specific example of . In another embodiment, the thickness of the hardfacing could vary across the crest as illustrated by the specific example of .","In an alternative embodiment, a spherical or semi-spherical surface of a milled tooth could be hardfaced as long as the radiuses are within the general parameters set forth in , thereby assuring a minimum thickness of hardfacing and the enhanced durability of the tooth as it works in a borehole.","In an embodiment such as shown in , each tooth , after the hardfacing  is applied, will appear outwardly with relatively straight crest , ends , and flanks , the hardfacing having a uniform termination point at the base  of the milled tooth . In another embodiment, one or more of the crest , ends , and flanks  may have a rounded appearance.","In one embodiment of the invention, as shown in , the teeth  have an axial crest . Axial crests  are so called because the crest  generally is substantially aligned with the axis of rotation of the cone  that the tooth is located on. In an alternative embodiment, the teeth  may have a circumferential crest (not shown). Circumferential crests (not shown) are so called because the crest (not shown) generally is substantially oriented circumferentially about the cone  that the tooth is located on, or substantially aligned with a circumference of the cone  that the tooth is located on. A circumferential crest (not shown) would have different loading properties and stress distribution than an axial crest  because a circumferential crest has a rolling action with the rock formation downhole where only a portion of the crest interacts with the rock formation at one time, while for an axial crest , substantially the entire crest penetrates the rock formation at the same time. In another embodiment of the invention (not shown), the teeth  have a crest  that is neither axial nor circumferential, but the crests  are substantially aligned with a line that is between the axis of rotation of the cone  that the tooth is located on and the circumference of the cone  that the tooth is located on. In another embodiment, the crests  are substantially aligned with a line that is within about 40\u00b0 (in any direction) of the axis of rotation of the cone  that the tooth is located on. In another embodiment, the crests  are substantially aligned with a line that is within about 30\u00b0 (in any direction) of the axis of rotation of the cone  that the tooth is located on. In another embodiment, the crests  are substantially aligned with a line that is within about 15\u00b0 (in any direction) of the axis of rotation of the cone  that the tooth is located on.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 3","FIG. 7"],"b":["20","52","52","24","26","20","52"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 5","FIG. 8"],"b":["120","54","54","124","126","120","54","126"]},"In one embodiment, shown in , the crest geometry is adapted and\/or designed to produce a convex axial stress distribution.
