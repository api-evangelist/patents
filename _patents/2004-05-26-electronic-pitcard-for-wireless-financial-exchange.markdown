No. 60\/540,279 filed on Jan. 29, 2004.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates, in general, to electronic data entry systems, and, more particularly, to a user interface, systems and methods for recording and entering data related to transactions on an trading floor.","2. Relevant Background","Securities, commodities and negotiable instruments are traded on various exchanges that strive to provide an efficient marketplace for the trading of products listed on the exchange. An \u201copen outcry\u201d auction market, such as a commodities exchange, provides floor trading facilities for the buying and selling of listed commodities.","Floor trading is generally confined to specified trading areas that are typically referred to as trading \u201cpits\u201d or \u201crings\u201d. Within a trading ring, floor traders vary in the scope of their trading activities. Some floor traders trade only for their own proprietary accounts or for the proprietary accounts of their employer; other floor traders only execute orders on behalf of others; and some floor traders trade for proprietary accounts and also execute orders for others. For convenience, this document shall use the term \u201cbroker\u201d to refer to floor traders engaging in any or all of the trading activities noted above.","Floor brokers congregate in the trading rings or pits on the exchange floor where they announce a \u201cbid\u201d price for an offer to buy and an \u201cask\u201d price for an offer to sell. A trade in any particular commodity generally will occur at or within the spread for best bid and best ask prevailing in the trading ring at that time. The best ask price is the lowest price that a seller is willing to accept and a best bid price is the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay. Exchange employees confirm transaction prices for executed transactions and also confirm on an ongoing basis throughout the trading session the prevailing best bid and ask prices that are provided by the various brokers. Exchange employees strive to ensure that executed trades are posted with the Exchange and also undertake other activities that facilitate trades and that maintain a fair and orderly market.","In a commodity exchange, using the example of the execution of an order for an off-floor customer, such a transaction is initiated by a customer who places or has previously placed an order to buy or sell a particular commodity. The order is then conveyed to the customer's broker or another trader representing the customer's broker on the trading floor. In the case of a broker trading on the broker's own account, the transaction is initiated by the broker directly. Typically, brokers tend to trade and to specialize in the commodity or commodities that are traded within the same trading ring. Brokers are known to other brokers on the trading floor by an identifying number or short name. The brokers announce offers on the trading floor to implement their customer's orders. For each commodity that is listed for trading at a commodity exchange, the exchange will indicate the number of contract months, which are sometimes referred to as delivery months that are listed for that commodity, and different delivery months may trade separately at separate prices.","At an exchange using a \u201cpitcard\u201d system for entry of executed trades to the exchange, once a buying broker and selling broker agree on a price, the selling broker and\/or buying broker record the transaction on a pad of paper or a multipart form that includes forms that are called \u201cpitcard\u201d and that may include other forms that are sometimes referred to as \u201ctrading cards\u201d. The information that is recorded includes the commodity code, quantity, delivery month, price, as well as the ID number or name for the buyer's broker and seller's broker. At commodity exchanges using the pitcard system, the pitcard is physically thrown into the center of the trading ring by the buyer and\/or seller, where it is collected by an exchange employee, clocked, and delivered to data entry personnel.","The extensive manual operations involved in the conventional trade recording system can lead to trade execution delays, illegibly transcribed orders, dropped slips, delayed delivery, and mismatches between buy-orders and sell orders that are not detected for some time. Although some exchange functions have been computerized, the basic activities of trade entry by brokers have posed problems for computerization. A root problem is that any transaction recordation system must support a peak level of trading volume of the exchange. In a stock exchange there is typically a specialist system in which each trader\/broker handles a stock for a single company. Transactions are conducted between a relatively small number of individuals and so identifying and recording broker names\/identifications is relatively easy. Moreover, in a stock exchange there is little variation in the type of information that must be captured for each transaction. Hence, even at very large transaction volumes the pace at which information is recorded and entered into the trading system is manageable.","In contrast, a commodity exchange such as the New York Mercantile Exchange (\u201cNYMEX\u201d) may be organized as an open system in which many traders (e.g., 100-200 individuals) are gathered at the trading pit for a given commodity. A particular broker may only be actively trading with a subset of 10-20 individuals. Because of the large number of traders, just entering and recording the broker identification for a particular transaction is difficult as compared to many trading floor environments. Further, each given commodity involves contracts in a variety of delivery months, and may involve derivative products such as options. As a result of these factors, the amount of information and pace at which that information must be recorded and entered by brokers\/traders is significantly greater than in trading floor environments such as a stock exchange.","To date, the paper-based workflow described above remains the only effective way to record and enter transaction information in many commodity exchanges. The paper-based workflow relies on transaction information written quickly by traders using various shorthand techniques with symbols and markings that may be intelligible only to particular brokers or exchange employees familiar with the brokers involved in a transaction. In this environment, trying to capture pen strokes in an electronic device is problematic as accurately translating the hurriedly written pen strokes is so complex that only humans have been able to perform the task. On the other hand, having brokers type in information using keyboard\/keypad interfaces is time consuming and does not support the rate at which information needs to be captured.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,625,583 issued to Silverman et al. describes a handheld trading system interface that enables entry of trade information on a trading floor of a financial exchange. The system described by Silverman presents a complex, multi-function interface that is specifically adapted for a stock exchange. Many features of the Silverman order entry interface are intended to emulate or simulate a paper trade recordation system. As a result, the Silverman system is not able to handle order entry at a pace necessary for high transaction volume environments such as a commodity exchange.","Accordingly, a need exists for wireless hand-held computers that can be used to exchange information with floor brokers. Further, there is a need for a trade entry interface that exhibits ease of use and allows brokers to enter trade information at least as fast if not faster than paper-based systems. Consequently, improved hand-held computer systems for trade entry are desired.","Briefly stated, the present invention involves systems and method for facilitating trading on a trading floor by generating a pitcard interface on a wireless handheld computer. The pitcard interface includes a plurality of information display windows; a plurality of user input controls; and a view-specific data window, wherein the selection, order and arrangement of data in the view-specific data window is dependent upon the view currently selected by the user. In particular examples the wireless handheld computer allows a user to customize the particular interface components with shortcuts, hints, and\/or auto-fill capabilities that enable the user to enter transaction information quickly and efficiently. Because these customizations are selected for a specific user, they support the needs of the specific user and are more efficient than direct entry of all transaction information using keyboard\/keypad entry devices.","The present invention is illustrated and described in terms of a wireless trade entry device that is particularly useful for high volume financial trading markets such as commodities exchanges. In these environments users must be able to enter trade information as quickly as possible. At the same time, this trade information must be entered accurately and transmitted reliably to a trade management system. These ends are served by a particularly efficient data entry interface of the present invention. Although the invention is described in terms of commodity trading, the transaction interface of the present invention is readily adapted to support a wide variety of trading activities including a variety of options contracts, futures contracts and the like. Further, the particular examples given herein relate to a physical trading arena, however, the electronic data recording\/entry device in accordance with the present invention is readily implemented by brokers\/traders that are in different physical locations.","The present invention combines a variety of features that allow a user to customize a particular interface device with shortcuts and auto-fill capabilities that enable the user to enter transaction information quickly and efficiently. Because these customizations are selected for a specific user, they support the needs of the specific user and are more efficient than direct entry of all transaction information using keyboard\/keypad entry devices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["101","101","102","103","113","103","102","113","102","103","113"]},"In the example of a commodities exchange, a trading arena called a \u201cpit\u201d  provides a meeting ground for brokers \/ in a particular commodity. Broker  announces an offer to sell a quantity of the particular commodity at a particular price. Conversely, the buyer broker  announces offers to buy with similar particulars. When the brokers \/ agree on terms, they each \u201ccard\u201d the trade by recording the trade particulars (e.g., price, quantity, delivery month, buyer seller broker IDs, and the like) on a piece of paper called a \u201cpit card\u201d . A pit card may be used to record multiple trades.","Depending on the exchange rules, one or both brokers \/ must submit the carded trade(s) within a specified period of time (e.g., one minute). This is accomplished by literally throwing the completed pit card  into the pit  where an exchange employee gathers the cards and submits them to a card clocker . The paper pit card is then given to a data entry clerk  who reads the handwritten trade parameters from the pit card and enters the data into an electronic trade management system.","In the paper-based system of , the rate at which the brokers \/ can enter information onto the pit card has been a limiting factor in periods of high volume trading. While the paper-handling procedures that occur after the pit card is thrown into pit  seem inefficient, with enough manpower exchanges have been able to handle large transaction volumes. The information entry tasks performed by the brokers \/, however, cannot be performed by anyone else, and so remain a limiting factor in how fast an exchange can operate. Because of this factor, it has been very difficult to develop effective electronic trade entry devices, as either the devices themselves or the user interfaces have been more cumbersome than paper-based trade entry systems.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["201","203","205","201","201","201","103","113"]},"Trade entry device  captures data that represents one or more commodities transactions in which a broker \/ has participated. When the broker \/ using the trade entry device  activates a \u201csubmit\u201d control, the trade data is sent to a server  which collects trade data from a number of brokers. In a particular implementation device  sends a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) or secure HTTP request that is addressed to server , which is implemented as a web server in the particular example. The use of HTTP\/web protocols makes available a wide variety of off-the-shelf software and hardware that can be readily adapted for use in the present invention. Proprietary protocols may be substituted in particular applications.","The HTTP request includes parameters having values that represent the transaction data. In addition, the HTTP requests include identification and authentication information such as a user name and password. In this manner, the communication between the entry device  and server  is sessionless which allows each request to be independently authenticated and authorized. Moreover, each request can be definitely associated with a particular broker and entry device  which improves auditability.","Web server  parses the request and uses an XML generator to generate an XML document containing the transaction data. The XML document is represents the transaction data in a format that is both readily extensible and very portable. The form and content of the XML document can be validated against a data type definition (DTD) or XML Schema to ensure correctness.","Web server  may implement a wide variety of auxiliary trade services as well. One advantage of using a web server to implement server  is that the web server APIs are well suited for adding additional services. Examples of such services include services that validate the incoming HTTP request, match requests from buyers  and sellers  to ensure that similar data was recorded by each broker, notify brokers \/ of events and\/or errors, and other trade services that can be accomplished on the trade floor before the trade data is entered into trade management system .","Web server  responds to the HTTP request with an HTTP response indicating the action taken. For example, web server  may send an HTTP response confirming that the trade information was successfully transferred to trade management system . Alternatively, web server  may indicate an error occurred, or notify the broker of other information relevant to the submitted trade information.","Using the wireless trade entry device , the information flow provided by the traditional paper process shown in  can be largely replicated as shown in the flow diagram of . For example, the activities involved in communicating order information in , announcing offers in , and reaching agreement as to transaction terms in  are largely similar to conventional paper processes. In  the brokers enter transaction information into the electronic pit card rather than a paper pit card. As will be seen, the user interface of the present invention implements trading-floor specific features so that the broker is able to enter information is at least as fast as on paper systems. Rather than throwing a paper card into a pit, the broker activates a submit control in  and the carded transaction information is submitted to server  (shown in ) and immediately \u201cclocked\u201d in activity . Data entry  can be implemented automatically as an XML record is generated holding the transaction data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["201","401","403","405","401","406","407","408","409","410","406","410","401","401","406","410"]},"Serial interfaces  communicate with various hardware interfaces  such as RS-232 and RS-485 serial ports. Serial ports  may include proprietary ports as well in combination with any desired serial port interface such as universal serial bus, EEE-1394, and the like. Serial interfaces  in combination with serial ports  enable the trade entry device  to communicate with a variety of auxiliary components such as printers, keyboards, memory and the like.","Network interfaces  communicate with hardware network ports such as category-5 cable, 802.11x wireless ports, Bluetooth ports and the like. Wireless network ports are preferable in the trading floor environment to ease use and installation. Network interface  implements the resources such as buffers and signaling necessary to communicate with the hardware ports.","Graphics subsystem  includes the hardware and software resources to draw images onto touch screen display , and receive input from touch screen display . For example, processor  will execute instructions that manipulate pixels values in touch screen display  and write the results to buffer memory in graphics subsystem . Graphics subsystem  handles the actual pixel manipulation as well as interpreting the position of user interactions with the touch screen display . Optional audio subsystem  and voice interface  may be provided to enable the user to interface using voice commands through microphone  and\/or receive information through speakers  or the like.","As shown in , a graphical user interface in accordance with an implementation of the present invention includes a view-specific display window , a plurality of data display windows , , , ,  and , as well as a plurality of user-selectable graphical controls such as , , , ,  and . Additionally, the trade information entry device  may provide hardware controls  that can be used for navigation and activating particular functions. Although it is contemplated that hardware controls  may be used in conjunction with the order entry features of the present invention, the graphical controls and display windows are principle features of the present invention.","Data display windows , , , , and  are examples of window that display specific items of data as that data is entered by a broker. Window  displays a buy quantity and may include a color coded background (e.g., blue) to make it readily identifiable. Similarly, window  displays a sell quantity and may include a color coded background (e.g., red). A consistent color scheme makes identification of a particular data item faster and more reliable for many users. In a particular embodiment display windows  and  can be activated by a user tapping on the touch screen within the boundaries of the windows \/. Once activated, a numeric entry device such as a virtual keypad, selection list, or dropdown list is drawn into the view-specific data window . Particularly in the case of commodities trading, due to individuals trading patterns, the contract transaction sizes (i.e., trade size or lot size) may become standardized by trade ring practices, and the quick key allows the data to be entered with fewer taps. Presenting a constrained list of options in the form of a selection box is an efficient manner of entering buy\/sell quantities in windows \/, and enabling the user to program the quick key enables sufficient customization to support the variations in individual preferences and\/or trade ring practices.","Commodity code window  displays a commodity code for the current trade. In many cases a broker will be working with a single commodity. In other cases a broker may work at multiple pits switch between commodities frequently. Display window  displays the standard commodity code for the financial exchange, which can be selected by activating one of graphic controls .","Price display window  displays the agreed upon price for the current transaction. In a particular embodiment display window  is activated by a user tapping on the touch screen within the boundaries of the window . Once activated, a numeric entry device such as a virtual keypad is drawn into the view-specific data window . Efficient entry of price data is an important performance feature as it must be entered in each of a large number of transactions. The virtual keypad approach of the present invention enables efficient entry of numeric information without requiring the user to refer to a keypad or keyboard that is outside the field of view, such as is the case with hardware buttons. Further, even though some operating systems may provide keyboard\/calculator applications as built-in features, these applications take over the entire display which interferes with the user's ability to enter data while still viewing the context of the particular transaction. To resolve these issues, the present invention uses a software-implemented graphical keypad that consumes only a portion of the screen area so that the view-independent portions of the screen remain visible.","User broker ID field  displays an identifier or mnemonic for the broker using the trade entry device . Opposing broker ID field  displays an identifier for a broker on the opposite side of the current transaction. Each broker is identified with a code or mnemonic. In a particular embodiment display window  is activated by a user tapping on the touch screen within the boundaries of the window . Once activated, an alphanumeric entry device such as a virtual keyboard (shown in ) may be drawn into the view-specific data window . Like the virtual keypad discussed above, the virtual keyboard of the present invention enables efficient entry of alpha information without requiring the user to refer to a hardware keyboard. Further, even though some operating systems may provide virtual keyboard applications as built-in features, these applications take over the entire display which interferes with the user's ability to enter data while still viewing the context of the particular transaction. To resolve these issues, the present invention uses a software-implemented graphical keypad (shown in ) that consumes only a portion of the screen area so that the view-independent portions of the screen remain visible.","To improve efficiency of entering broker identifications, the present invention enables the user to create a shortlist of frequently encountered broker IDs. The user can select one of these previously entered IDs directly by tapping the appropriate graphical control and avoid typing. In one embodiment the shortlist of frequently encountered IDs is presented as a table in the view-specific data window . In another embodiment the shortlist of IDs is implemented as a most recently used table such that the table is ordered according to how recently the ID was used in a transaction, and as the table fills the least recently used ID will be dropped off the table. Alternatively, the table can be maintained as a most frequently used list.","In addition to the display windows, the present invention contemplates a display with a number of user-selectable graphical controls such as , , ,  and  that support efficient entry of commodity trading information. For example, controls  present commodity codes that can be quickly selected to enable a broker to move from pit-to-pit trading multiple commodities. The order of the commodity code controls  may be static or may change depending on frequency of use or other criteria.","A delivery month keyboard  is implemented as a graphical control that includes a plurality of month codes that are used by the commodities exchange. For example, \u201cF\u201d represents January, \u201cG\u201d represents February and the like. This specialized keyboard is adapted to the commodities trading environment where each transaction requires entry of not only the commodity code, but also the delivery month and year. In particular embodiments the delivery month keyboard  is dynamically displayed so that the current delivery month appears at the left-most portion of the screen. This is advantageous in cases where the majority of transactions involve the current delivery month, or where current delivery month transactions require faster input. Moreover, brokers \/ may perceive the calendar relative to the current month, and the rolling display makes it easier to locate any deliver month. In operation, as the trading month changes from, for example, January to February, the delivery month keyboard  changes from \u201cF\u201d being at the left-most location to \u201cG\u201d appearing the left most position and \u201cF\u201d rolling over to the right-most position and each other month code indexing left one position.","Each trade is performed on behalf of a particular customer account or on behalf of the broker's own account. When working for customer account, brokers may receive new order information from off-floor customers while on the trading floor. List box control  provides a quick tool for selecting a customer identifier when entering order information and for identifying when the broker is trading on their own account. Each broker will have a set of customers that he or she represents and will enter the customer code information, as well as codes indicating the broker's own account(s), in advance into entry device . Customer codes may be standardized or may be unique to each broker. In most cases a broker will have a list of under 20 customers at any given trading session which makes drop-down list box  convenient and efficient for data entry. In a particular implementation control  is activated by tapping on the touchscreen interface of device  and manipulated by tapping on an appropriate selection. The currently selected customer identification is displayed in control . A new order for the currently selected customer is initiated by tapping on the new order control labeled \u201cNEW\u201d in .","In the particular example, a \u201ccard trade\u201d control  causes the current transaction information displayed in windows - to be transferred to a line-item entry in the view-specific data window . The card trade activity is analogous to writing a transaction down onto a paper pit card. Unlike the paper record, however, the broker can have most of the information for the transaction already entered. In contrast, in a paper environment the broker may begin handwriting information onto the card only after the trade is verbally completed. This can save several seconds of broker time as the card trade button  can be activated immediately after the last piece of trade data is entered.","The present invention contemplates a number of action controls  that are activated by a user tapping on the area defined by the control. When activated, the control initiates a particular programmed action. In the particular example, a clear button, labeled \u201cCLR\u201d in , causes information in the display windows - to be cleared. This is useful when a contemplated transaction is not completed and allows the broker to work ahead by entering data even though the transaction may not be carded. A submit control, labeled \u201cSUB\u201d in , causes carded trades appearing in view-specific data window  to be submitted to the server . The action of the submit control is analogous to throwing a paper pit card into the pit.","View-specific display window  is so named because it changes its contents based upon the current state of a transaction and to show a broker \/ different views of various activities. As described above, the view-specific display window  can be used to show carded trade data, and can be used to display special purpose tools such as keypads, keyboards, favorites lists and the like. It is also contemplated that several alternative views may be defined that can be displayed by activation of navigation controls . For example, the CARDS control activates a view in which virtual pit cards can be displayed in display window  on a customer-by-customer basis. A POSITIONS control activates a view in which a customer's net positions (or positions of the trader trading on his\/her own account) are displayed. A SETTINGS control enables the user to affect various settings of the handheld device  itself, program functionality associated with hardware buttons, and the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"b":["31","201"],"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 4"]},"The application programming interface (API) layer comprises various processes that provide access to OS services and augmnent OS services for use by particular applications. For example, the API layer may provide Universal Plug-and-Play (UPnP\u2122) processes that support common protocols and procedures intended to enhance interoperability among network-enabled PCs, appliances, and wireless devices. Flash processes implement services related to Macromedia\u00ae FLASH programming environment and extensions. Platform drivers are similar to hardware drivers, but offer more complex and platform-specific functionality for devices such as hardware switches, LED indicators, and an LCD display.","Each handheld device  may have a distinct set of plug-in components to meet the needs of a particular trading environment where the handheld device  is used. Further, the set of plug-in components can be changed based on specific user preferences. Similarly, the functionality of each component can be altered to increase or decrease the functionality based on the current user of the control panel, or the time of day, or other configurable permissions basis. Any number of third party plug-ins are possible to implement extended functionality. Third party plug-ins are designed to comply with the API layer, or in some cases may interact with the operating system directly.","Sophisticated configurable functionality is implemented by application layer, labeled \u201cAPP\u201d in , and plug-in components. In a particular configuration, handheld device  implements a GUI container containing various GUI components from, for example, MICROSOFT\u00ae.NET connection software. The GUI container may implement JAVA components, FLASH components, or other available or custom GUI components to meet the needs of a particular application. JAVA is a trademark or registered trademark of Sun Microsystems, Inc. in the United States and other countries. FLASH is a trademark or registered trademark of Macromedia, Inc. in the United States and other countries. Microsoft.NET is a trademark or registered trademark of Microsoft Corporation in the United States and other countries. These GUI components interface with various plug-in components. Optionally, a browser user interface is provided to supplement the GUI interface. So much software and plug-in functionality is available for common browser GUIs such as Mozilla, Internet Explorer, and the like that it may be useful to provide a browser interface and web plug ins to perform certain functions that augment and\/or replace various other plug-ins.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 7A","FIG. 7B","FIG. 7A","FIG. 7A"]},"Upon successful completion of the login, a \u201ctrades\u201d screen is presented which includes various navigational controls for both entering trade information (shown generally in ) and for accessing various settings functions as shown in . The \u201cbasic\u201d settings screen at the lower left portion of  allows the user to set default values for trade increments and price increments. These values allow trade information to be entered quickly using increase\/decrease controls rather than keypad entries. Similarly, the brokers setting screen allows users to add and remove broker IDs to and from the shortlist. During appropriate times during trading the shortlist of brokers is presented to the user to allow entry of a broker ID without requiring keyboard entry. As shown in the lower right hand screen, the user may also set up various functions assigned to hardware buttons on the particular handheld device. The setup functions described herein are not exhaustive as a wide variety of features may be customized in preparation of trading. In general, any trading function that involves multiple keystrokes or stylus taps during actual trading may be simplified during the setup customizations using the hot keys, default values, and shortlists options described in reference to . Preferably, settings for a particular user are retained so that they do not need to be entered each time the handheld device  is activated.","Once the settings are entered, the user is ready to begin trading. Referring to , a user may optionally select which pit or trading arena will be the current environment for trading as shown in the upper left hand screen of . The settings described hereinbefore may be implemented separately for each trading pit that the user operates in. A user selects a commodity code (CL in the example) and delivery month (J4 in the example) and then enters price information (3580 in the example). Although the price information can be entered by the keypad, it is preferably entered by selecting from the numeric lists as using the lists can save several keystrokes. If necessary the user may select an account (either a customer account or the brokers own account) using the pull down control shown in the third screen of . If the customer account information is not present it may be entered using a virtual keyboard, however, using the pull down list is preferred as it saves keystrokes and time.","As shown in the upper right hand screen, trade size (10 in the example) is entered to indicate the number of units being traded in the current transaction. When the user is a buyer, the trade size information appears in the upper left hand window of the trades screen, whereas when the user is a seller the trade size information appears in the upper right hand window of the trades screen. As noted before, color coding of the interface elements gives the broker\/trader a continuous indication of whether buy or sell information is being entered. Again, the trade size information is preferably entered using the pull down list.","Opposing broker information can be entered from the short list that appears in the trades window in the upper right hand screen. Alternatively, by tapping on the opposing broker window the screen shown in the lower left of  is presented to allow the user to select an opposing broker using keyboard entry assisted by automatic hints. In the specific example, the user taps on the \u201cM\u201d key which brings up a hint list of broker IDs beginning with the letter M. The user can continue entering information by tapping on letters, or select from the presented hint list at any time. The entered information is transferred to the opposing broker ID window as it is entered.","Once the necessary trade-specific information is entered, a trade is carded by tapping on the card trade button ( in ) at which point the trade information appears in the information window of the trades screen as illustrated by the first entry in the lower left hand screen of .
