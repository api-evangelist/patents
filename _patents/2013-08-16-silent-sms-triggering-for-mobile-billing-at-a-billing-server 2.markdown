{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["1). Field of the Invention","This invention relates to a system and method for processing transactions.","2). Discussion of Related Art","Merchant servers often have stores allowing consumers to use browsers within mobile devices to select goods, virtual goods or services from the merchant server and then to make a purchase from the merchant server. The consumer may be asked to select payment options, such as credit card details, payment via an account having a stored value, or have a charge placed on their phone bill. If the consumer selects their phone bill, the merchant server transmits a payment authorization to a billing server. The billing server is aligned with one or more carrier servers and places a charge on a phone bill of the consumer at the carrier server. There are methods that exist in the art for the billing server to determine a phone number and\/or a carrier corresponding to a consumer mobile phone of the consumer.","The carriers in different countries have different requirement with respect to currency and price points that are supported. In addition, a merchant server may have a number of different options available for purchase at different target prices. For example, a merchant may sell 100 points, 200 points or 300 points. The different levels of service sold by the merchant server may not be in exact multiples due to carrier restrictions with respect to price points. Alternatively, a merchant may wish to provide different levels of service at different price points that are optically more favorable (e.g. $1.99, $2.99 and $3.99) or that factor in discounts for larger purchases.","The invention provides a method of processing transactions with a billing server, including receiving, with the billing server, a transaction request API call from a merchant computer including a msisdn, transmitting, with the billing server, a transaction request response to the merchant computer in response to the transaction request API call, including a transmission ID, receiving, with the billing server, a payment authorization text message from a consumer device at the msisdn including a transaction ID, determining, with the billing server, a match between the transaction ID in the text message with the transaction ID in the transaction request response and if a match is determined between the transaction ID's, transmitting, with the billing server, a charge request to a carrier server to charge an account on the carrier server corresponding to the msisdn.","The method may further include receiving, with the billing server, a charge confirmation from the merchant server and transmitting, with the billing server, in response to the charge confirmation, a callback notification to the merchant computer.","The method may further include receiving, at the billing server, a configuration input from at least one merchant computer, the configuration input configuring a pricing matrix of countries and target prices, the pricing matrix having a set of cells, each cell corresponding to an intersection between a respective country and a respective target price, such that each country has a subset of the set of cells, the subset having different price points, storing, with the billing server, the pricing matrix, receiving, with the billing server, a pricing call from the merchant computer, transmitting, with the billing server, the pricing matrix to the merchant computer in response to the pricing call and determining, with the billing server, a carrier server based on the payment authorization.","The method may further include registering, with the billing server, a public portal account for the merchant computer on the billing server, creating, with the billing server, a service in the account, adding, with the billing server, the countries at the pricing matrix to the service, wherein the pricing matrix is configured by the merchant computer on the billing server and approving, with the billing server, the pricing service.","The method may further include that at least one price point for one of the countries differs from all price points of another country.","The method may further include that the price points for two different countries are in different currencies.","The method may further include that the one target price has a plurality of different price points between countries.","The method may further include that the price points for at least one country is only supported below a predetermined amount.","The method may further include that the price points for at lone country are only supported for a set of predetermined amounts.","The method may further include transmitting, with the billing server, a payment confirmation to a handset at the phone number after transmitting the charge request to the carrier server.","The method may further include that the transaction request API call includes a merchant-id, a service-id, a handset-locale, an mcc (mobile country code) and an mnc (mobile network code).","The method may further include that the transaction request response includes an api-version, a trx-id, a result-code, a result-msg, a price, a product-description, a service-name, a client-message and a client-action.","The invention also provides a non-transitory computer-readable medium having stored thereon a set of instructions wherein, when executed by a processor of a computer performs a method of processing transactions with a billing server, including configuring, with at least one merchant computer, a pricing matrix of countries and target prices, the pricing matrix having a set of cells, each cell corresponding to an intersection between a respective country and a respective target price, such that each country has a subset of the set of cells, the subset having different price points, storing, with at least one merchant computer, the pricing matrix, receiving, with at least one merchant computer, a transaction request from a consumer device, identifying, with at least one merchant computer, a country of the consumer device based on the payment request, matching, with at least one merchant computer, the country of the consumer device with a country in the pricing matrix, determining, with at least one merchant computer, at least one price point for the country that has been matched in the pricing matrix, transmitting, with at least one merchant computer, the price point that has been extracted to the consumer device, allowing a user of the consumer device to make a purchase and receiving, with at least one merchant computer, a transaction callback notification from a billing server in response to the transmission of the price point.","The invention further provides a billing server including a processor, a computer-readable medium connected to the processor and a set of instructions on the computer-readable medium and executable by the processor. The set of instructions includes a transaction application programmable interface management module executing the steps of receiving a configuration input from at least one merchant computer, the configuration input configuring a pricing matrix of countries and target prices, the pricing matrix having a set of cells, each cell corresponding to an intersection between a respective country and a respective target price, such that each country has a subset of the set of cells, the subset having different price points, storing the pricing matrix, transmitting the pricing matrix to the merchant computer in response to the pricing call, and a carrier billing module executing the steps of receiving, with the billing server, a payment authorization based on the price point, determining, with the billing server, a carrier server based on the payment authorization, sending, with the billing server, a charge request to a carrier server to charge an account on the carrier server corresponding to the phone number and transmitting, with the billing server, a transaction callback notification to the merchant computer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["12","14","16","18","20","12","14","14","16","16","18","20","12","16","12"]},"The billing server  includes a transaction application programmable interface (API) management module , a carrier billing module  and a Short Message Service (SMS) messaging module .
