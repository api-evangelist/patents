{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The embodiments herein may be manufactured, used, and\/or licensed by or for the United States Government without the payment of royalties thereon.","1. Technical Field","The embodiments herein generally relate to a LADAR transmitting and receiving apparatus, and, more particularly, to a compact LADAR transmitting and receiving apparatus provided at a reduced cost and with reduced power requirements.","2. Description of the Related Art","Laser Detection And Ranging (LADAR) is an optical remote sensing technology that measures properties of scattered light to find range and\/or other information of a distant target. LADAR may be used in a variety of contexts for elastic backscatter light detection and ranging (LIDAR) systems. Although the acronym LADAR is usually associated with the detection of hard targets and the acronym LIDAR is usually associated with the detection of aerosol targets, there has been no real standard on their use and both acronyms may be used interchangeably to describe the same laser ranging system.","While a LADAR system may perform similar functionality to a radar system, LADAR uses a much shorter wavelength of the electromagnetic spectrum compared to radar. For example, LADAR systems typically operate in the ultraviolet, visible, or near infrared spectrums. This gives a compact LADAR the ability to image a target at a high spatial resolution and allows LADAR systems to be made more physically compact.","In order for a LADAR system target to reflect a transmitted electromagnetic wave, an object needs to produce a dielectric discontinuity from its surroundings. At radar frequencies, a metallic object produces a dielectric discontinuity and a significant specular reflection. However, non-metallic objects, such as rain and rocks produce weaker reflections, and some materials may produce no detectable reflection at all, meaning some objects or features are effectively invisible at radar frequencies.","Lasers provide one solution to this problem regarding non-metallic detection. The beam power densities and coherency of lasers are excellent. Moreover, the wavelengths are much smaller than can be achieved with radio systems, and range from about 10 \u03bcm to around 250 nm. At such wavelengths, the waves are reflected very well from small objects such as molecules and atoms. This type of reflection is called diffuse \u201cbackscattering.\u201d Both diffuse and specular reflection may be used for different LADAR applications.","The transmitter and receiver functions (transceiver) of current LADAR systems typically rely on a mono-static optical system (i.e., the transmitted and received beams are co-axial) that is a complex assembly of beam splitters, polarizers, and steering mirrors. This arrangement is generally expensive, very difficult to align, prone to losing alignment, subject to narcissus, and requiring much more space than desired for a compact LADAR system.","In addition, current compact LADAR systems have generally been flawed by one or more factors including, low pixelization, insufficient range or range resolution, image artifacts, no daylight operation, large size, high power consumption, and high cost. Current LADAR systems frequently use a wide bandwidth photo detector\/amplifier system with a small detector, and a low shunt capacitance, leading to an undesirable signal-to-noise ratio.","In view of the foregoing, an embodiment herein provides a compact Laser Detection And Ranging (LADAR) system comprising a pulse laser generating pulses of light; a transmitter collimating and directing the pulses of light toward a target; a receiver collecting reflected pulses of light, the reflected pulses of light having been reflected from the target, the receiver comprising a tapered fiber bundle; a sensor operatively connected to the tapered fiber bundle, wherein the sensor comprises a photosensitive region and outputs a photocurrent; an amplifier amplifying the photocurrent; and a power divider splitting the amplified photocurrent between a high gain channel and a low gain channel; a radio frequency (RF) interface accepting the high gain channel, the low gain channel, and an undelayed sample of a pulse of light generated from the pulse laser as input; a processing unit accepting output from the RF interface; and a display unit displaying output from the processing unit.","In such a LADAR system, the pulse laser may comprise an Erbium fiber laser. In addition, the amplifier may comprise a microwave amplifier. Furthermore, the sensor may comprise an InGaAs PIN photo detector. Moreover, such a LADAR system may further comprise an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) coupled to the RF interface and the processing unit and sampling input from the RF interface to produce sampling data. Additionally, the processing unit may comprise a field programmable gate array (FPGA) processing sampling data from the ADC. Moreover, the processing unit may comprise a first-in-first-out (FIFO) memory storing sampling data from the ADC.","In such a LADAR system, the transmitter may comprise a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) mirror to direct pulses of light. In addition, the processing unit may control the MEMS mirror. Moreover, such a LADAR system may further comprise a telescope coupled to the MEMS mirror, where the pulses of light generated from the pulse laser are reflected from the MEMS mirror and are amplified in scan angle by the telescope. In addition, such a LADAR system may further comprise a high voltage amplifier producing analog voltages that controls a pointing direction of the MEMS mirror. Additionally, such a LADAR system may further comprise a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) coupled to the high voltage amplifier. Furthermore, the processing unit may be coupled to the DAC, and the processing unit may generate a digital signal to control the pointing direction of the MEMS mirror. Moreover, the processing unit may control the pulse laser in generating the pulses of light.","Another embodiment herein provides an apparatus for receiving pulses of light from a LADAR transmitter comprising a tapered fiber bundle; a plurality of sensors coupled to the tapered fiber bundle, wherein each sensor comprises a photosensitive region and outputs a photocurrent; a plurality of microwave amplifiers, wherein each amplifier is coupled to a sensor and amplifies the photocurrent; a plurality of feedback circuits, wherein each feedback circuit is coupled to an input and output of a microwave amplifier and raises the bandwidth of the circuit comprised of the sensor and the microwave amplifier; and a microwave combiner combining the photocurrent from each of the plurality of microwave amplifiers to a combined output.","In such an apparatus, the feedback circuit may comprise a single capacitor, a single resistor, and a single inductor. Moreover, the feedback circuit may comprise an LC circuit. In addition, the microwave amplifier may comprise a wideband monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) amplifier. Additionally, each of the plurality of sensors may comprise an InGaAs PIN photo detector.","In addition, an embodiment herein provides a method of processing pulses of light from a LADAR transmitter, the method comprising receiving the pulses of light via a tapered fiber bundle; producing a plurality of photocurrents, wherein each photocurrent is produced from a sensor coupled to the tapered fiber bundle and each sensor comprises a photosensitive region to output the photocurrent; amplifying the plurality of photocurrents using a plurality of microwave amplifiers, wherein each amplifier is coupled to a sensor and amplifies a photocurrent; providing a plurality of feedback circuits, wherein each feedback circuit is coupled to an input and output of a microwave amplifier and raises the bandwidth of the circuit comprised of the sensor and the microwave amplifier; combining the plurality of amplified photocurrents using a microwave combiner, wherein the number of inputs the microwave combiner accepts is as least as great as the number of microwave amplifiers; and processing and displaying the combined output.","These and other aspects of the embodiments herein will be better appreciated and understood when considered in conjunction with the following description and the accompanying drawings. It should be understood, however, that the following descriptions, while indicating preferred embodiments and numerous specific details thereof, are given by way of illustration and not of limitation. Many changes and modifications may be made within the scope of the embodiments herein without departing from the spirit thereof, and the embodiments herein include all such modifications.","The embodiments herein and the various features and advantageous details thereof are explained more fully with reference to the non-limiting embodiments that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings and detailed in the following description. Descriptions of well-known components and processing techniques are omitted so as to not unnecessarily obscure the embodiments herein. The examples used herein are intended merely to facilitate an understanding of ways in which the embodiments herein may be practiced and to further enable those of skill in the art to practice the embodiments herein. Accordingly, the examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the embodiments herein.","The embodiments herein provide a LADAR transmitting and receiving apparatus (or a LADAR transceiver), which facilitates the development of a compact, low-cost, and low-power LADAR imager for various applications, including small unmanned ground vehicles, and supports autonomous navigation, obstacle\/collision avoidance, and target detection and identification functions in various applications, including small ground robots. Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to , where similar reference characters denote corresponding features consistently throughout the figures, there are shown preferred embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["1","10","15","20","25","20","20","30"]},"Light backscattered upon hitting a target is collected on the large face of fiber bundle , which may be tapered. Tapering fiber bundle  effectively increases the diameter of photo detector  and thereby increases the signal-to-noise ratio. Photocurrent from photo detector  is fed into amplifier , which may be embodied as a monolithic 50 ohm microwave amplifier. The output of amplifier  is fed into power divider  splits the signal into low gain channel and high gain channel . In radio frequency (RF) interface board , both low gain channel and high gain channel are adjusted in amplitude and limited in amplitude to produce output channels and . In addition, inputs to RF interface board  are summed with a photocurrent from an undelayed sample of the original transmitted light signal, shown as T-zero in . T-zero pulse of the transmitted signal is optionally used as a reference to determine target range. Output channels and are subsequently feed into analog-to-digital converter (ADC) , shown in  as a two channel 8-bit ADC, via input channels and . ADC  optionally samples input channels and at a 1.5 giga-samples-per-second (GSPS) rate. This sampling data is fed to FPGA , which stores the sampling data as a function of time from ADC  in memory . Memory  is optionally a first-in first-out register (FIFO), and starts storing ADC  sampling data upon transmission of the laser  pulse. In addition to storing sampling data from ADC , FPGA  determines the range to the pixel, and formats the data for acquisition by computer  for display. FPGA  also controls the pointing direction of mirror  (e.g., via digital-to-analog converter (DAC) ) and directs the laser  to emit a pulse.","To increase the receiver capture area for a given size of photo detector , a tapered fiber bundle  may be used to magnify the apparent size of a photo detector (e.g., a 1 mm diameter photo detector can theoretically increase its effective diameter to 3.1 mm at the front of a tapered fiber bundle, when the tapered fiber bundle  has a magnification ratio equal to 3.1:1). The theoretical maximal effect of magnifying tapered fiber bundle  is often not reached if photo detector  is a commercially packaged photo detector since the packaging of the commercial photo detectors typically cannot couple the output of tapered fiber bundle  directly against the detector surface of photo detector  to capture all of the light. In addition, the capacitance of photo detector  may limit the output bandwidth of amplifier  (e.g., a photo detector with a 1 mm diameter detecting surface may limit bandwidth to about 85 MHz when fed directly into a 50 ohm microwave amplifier). This issue is addressed via L-C circuit  (shown in ) between photo detector  and amplifier  input to extend the bandwidth with a tolerable level of pulse distortion and stretching.","As shown in , photo detector  may include a PIN InGaAs photo detector. A PIN InGaAs photo detector is preferably used for photo detector instead of an avalanche photo detector. In addition,  shows L-C circuit  with 47 nH inductors 76 and 25 pF capacitors . Those skilled in the art, however, would recognize that L-C circuit  is not limited to what is illustrated in  or described above and could easily modify L-C circuit to other configurations without undue experimentation.","As shown in , photocurrent from photo detector  may be amplified by using one or more amplifiers . Each amplifier  in  is shown as a surface mounted monolithic microwave amplifier, which are typically low-cost. Furthermore, each amplifier  may have a bandwidth ranging from 1 to 7 GHz and yield power gains to 20 db with noise figures around 2.4 db. Although amplifier  is shown in  as a surface mounted monolithic microwave amplifier, embodiments described herein are not to such a configuration, and those skilled in the art could readily devise a different configuration without undue experimentation. Thus,  uses a low power and low noise figure model (as provided by amplifiers ) for the first stage of photocurrent amplification. Output from a first amplifier  is then split by power divider  to create a low gain channel () and a high gain channel (), which is fed into RF interface board .","Recent advances in Erbium fiber lasers have allowed Erbium fiber lasers to be manufactured as physically smaller units, and at a lower cost, than what was previously available. The electrical and optical parameters of these new Erbium fiber lasers are identical to the previous fiber laser technology except that the peak power has been reduced, e.g., the peak power of a low-cost Erbium fiber laser may be one-fourth of the peak power of a current fiber laser.  shows receiver  that compensates for a loss in signal power when using a laser with reduced peak power, according to the embodiments described herein. Similar to ,  includes fiber bundle  to enhance the optical capture area. , however, uses a plurality of chip detectors  instead of a single photo detector . For example, since each PIN chip detector  may be only 1 mm square, four PIN chip detectors  may be coupled to the output of fiber bundle .  illustrates a single PIN chip detector . The output of each PIN chip detector  is fed into a separate microwave amplifier . The output of each microwave amplifier  is fed into an n-way microwave combiner . Microwave combiner  yields target signal that has an improved signal-to-noise ratio compared to the individual output of any of microwave amplifier .","Although  uses a four-way microwave combiner , to match the number of PIN chip detectors  and microwave amplifiers  combinations (only one of which is shown in ), the embodiments described herein are not limited to a four-way microwave combiner and those skilled in the art could readily increase or decrease the number of inputs to microwave combiner  to match increases or decreases in the number of PIN chip detectors  and microwave amplifiers  combinations used.","The circuit shown in  also includes feedback circuit  positioned as a feedback loop for the output of microwave amplifier  to raise the overall bandwidth. In feedback circuit , capacitor  comprises a large capacitor used to decouple DC signal  at amplifier  output from the input. Inductor  (e.g., a 68 nH inductor) cuts-off the feedback path at high frequencies, where the phase shifts in amplifier  may cause conditions for oscillations. In addition, resistor  (e.g., a 360\u03a9 resistor) is effectively the actual feedback element over the bandwidth of interest. To further achieve stable (e.g., non-oscillating) performance, amplifier  may include a wideband monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) amplifier (e.g., to provide gain up to 7 GHz).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 1 through 3","FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["100","35","101","40","102","45","103","92","104","90","105","70"]},"The techniques provided by the embodiments herein may be implemented on an integrated circuit chip (not shown). The chip design is created in a graphical computer programming language, and stored in a computer storage medium (such as a disk, tape, physical hard drive, or virtual hard drive such as in a storage access network). If the designer does not fabricate chips or the photolithographic masks used to fabricate chips, the designer transmits the resulting design by physical means (e.g., by providing a copy of the storage medium storing the design) or electronically (e.g., through the Internet) to such entities, directly or indirectly. The stored design is then converted into the appropriate format (e.g., GDSII) for the fabrication of photolithographic masks, which typically include multiple copies of the chip design in question that are to be formed on a wafer. The photolithographic masks are utilized to define areas of the wafer (and\/or the layers thereon) to be etched or otherwise processed.","The resulting integrated circuit chips can be distributed by the fabricator in raw wafer form (that is, as a single wafer that has multiple unpackaged chips), as a bare die, or in a packaged form.
