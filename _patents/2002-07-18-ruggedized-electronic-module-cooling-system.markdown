{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application relates to the following group of applications filed on the same day herewith. Each application in the group relates and incorporates by reference, each other application in the group. The invention of each application is assigned to the assignee of this invention. The group of applications includes the following:\n\n","The subject matter disclosed relates to ruggedized modular electronics systems. Further, the subject matter disclosed relates to a mechanical packaging system solution for ruggedized modular electronics utilizing a minimum number of electronic subsystems and a chassis. More particularly, the subject matter disclosed relates to a cooling system for ruggedized electronics modules.","Many electronics systems exist for providing radio communications to and from vehicles. Such conventional electronics systems may be ruggedized for use in situations that are exposed to harsh environmental conditions such as dirty conditions, vibrational conditions, etc.","Although ruggedized electronics systems have been developed, these systems do not conventionally include options for reconfiguration of the systems via an exchange of modular components. Conventionally, ruggedized systems use a line replaceable unit (LRU), which is a sealed box containing a plurality of shop replaceable units (SRUs), which are typically electronics cards that may be inserted into the LRU when the sealed LRU is opened.","Conventionally, SINCGARS VHF frequency hopping radios have been used in military and rugged applications. SINCGARS radios are conventionally a single package system in which electronic components are fit into a ruggedized chassis. SINCGARS, however, have the disadvantage of not being easily reconfigurable with a plurality of ruggedized modular components, each having their own ruggedized package. Further, conventional systems do not utilize electronic module sub-systems which are individually sealed and ruggedized. Further still, conventional electronics cooling systems utilize a field of thin columnar cooling pins which are densely packed over a cooling surface or an array of thick bar fins that do not allow airflow in any direction. Such pins are easily bent, broken, or clogged, causing degradation of the cooling effect.","Accordingly, there is a need for a cooling system solution for electronics modules that are ruggedized. There is also a need for an electronic module cooling system that performs in rugged environments including but not limited to military environments and may be easily handled without fear of damage. Further still, there is a need for an electronic module cooling system that performs in both ground and airborne applications. Yet further still, there is a need for an electronic module cooling system for electronics that allows for heat removal associated with the electronic sub-systems and utilizes a ruggedized pin field.","It would be desirable to provide a system and\/or method that provides one or more of these or other advantageous features. Other features and advantages will be made apparent from the present specification. The teachings disclosed extend to those embodiments which fall within the scope of the appended claims, regardless of whether they accomplish one or more of the aforementioned needs.","One example of the invention relates to a ruggedized electronics sub-system module. The ruggedized electronics sub-system module includes a ruggedized housing and an electronic device supported by the housing. The ruggedized electronics sub-system module also includes an electrical connector coupled to the electronic device and supported by the housing. The ruggedized electronics sub-system module further includes a plurality of ruggedized cooling pins extending from the housing. The plurality of pins are spaced so as to allow for natural convective currents to be used for cooling the electronic device and the plurality of pins are spaced so as not to substantially impede the natural convective currents.","Another example of the invention relates to a cooling pin disposed on the outer surface of an electronics module. The cooling pin includes a base portion coupled to the outer surface of the electronics module. The base portion has a diameter. The cooling pin also includes a solid upstanding portion extending from the base. Further, the cooling pin includes a rounded tip portion coupled to the solid upstanding portion. The combination of the solid upstanding portion and the tip portion form a height.","Yet another example of the invention relates to an electronics module housing. The electronics module housing includes an outer surface encasing an electronic device. The electronics module also includes a plurality of cooling pins sparsely disbursed on the outer surface and extending therefrom. The plurality of cooling pins are integrally formed with the outer surface and a ruggedized configuration that allows for natural convective currents to be used for cooling the electronic device and the plurality of pins are spaced so as not to substantially impede the natural convective currents around the module when the module is placed next to another module.","Alternative examples of the invention relate to other features and combination of features as may be generally recited in the claims.","Referring to , an exemplary embodiment of an electronics system, for example, a modular electronic radio system , is depicted. Modular radio system  includes a chassis  (platform adapter or vehicular adapter) which supports a plurality of modular electronic components . Chassis  includes, in an exemplary embodiment, a power source  having a plurality of cooling fins  extending from a power source housing . Power source  provides power to the plurality of electronic modules .","In an exemplary embodiment, chassis  may be coupled to a mount  that provides for attachment to a vehicle, or other surface, and may be configured with damping devices to provide for vibration suppression and damping of vibrations which may be imparted from the mounting surface, such as a vehicle, to electronic modules . In the exemplary embodiment depicted, chassis  may be coupled to mount  via any of a plurality of means including, but not limited to, clamps  and further secured by screws and\/or other fasteners through apertures  for securing mount  and chassis . In an exemplary embodiment, chassis  may be formed of any of a variety of materials, including, but not limited to, aluminum. Chassis  may alternatively be formed of other adequately rigid materials, such as, but not limited to, metals, metal alloys, polymers, ceramics, and composite materials.","In the exemplary embodiment depicted in , a plurality of electronic components  are coupled to chassis . Electronic modules  include, but are not limited to, power amplifiers , transceivers , and a Platform Interface Module (PIM) . Each of modular electronic components  is provided in a ruggedized housing formed of aluminum, or other adequately rigid materials and is sealed such that the casing or housing is impermeable by water and\/or other liquids. Further, the housings of electronic modules  are configured such that they are resistant to chemical attack and\/or penetration as well as resistant to dirt and vibrations. Further still, each of electronic modules  includes a plurality of cooling pins  formed on at least one and typically two outer surfaces of electronic modules  to provide for disposal of thermal energy created by electronic components inside each electronics module. Such pins  may be configured in such a manner that they are not easily broken off from the exterior surface of the electronic modules, i.e. the cooling pins have ruggedized characteristics due to their size and geometry, and further, in a preferred embodiment pins  allow for cooling through natural convective currents, i.e. using cooling pins , active cooling modules, e.g. a fan module, may not be required to maintain electronic modules  at or below a desired operating temperature.","System  is a flexible and adaptable electronic packaging system that allows for various combinations of ruggedized electronic modules . System  includes a ruggedized modular electronic platform adaptor or chassis  and a plurality of ruggedized electronic modules . In an exemplary embodiment, a single module mounting position and chassis may not have to be dedicated to a single modular function, but rather may be configured such that it may be equipped with different module functions as required. Further, in an exemplary embodiment, system  may be configured to meet environmental conditions, for example, those required for military applications, including immersion. In an exemplary embodiment, modules  perform radio system functions; however, the concepts disclosed are not limited to radio systems alone, but may be applied to any of a variety of electronics systems. In an exemplary embodiment, electronic modules  may be configured to provide 2-channel to 4-channel communications.","With regard to system , varying types of electronic modules  may be installed in different combinations on chassis  to create various end-item configurations. For example, as depicted in , chassis  includes two power amplifiers , three transceivers , and a PIM . However, chassis  may be configured with more or less modular component sites and, further, may include any of a variety of electronic modules.","Referring now to , a front elevation view of a system  is depicted. System  includes two power amplifiers , three transceivers , and a PIM . Electronic modules , , and  are ruggedized modules having ruggedized housings and are sealed to prevent infiltration of water, dirt, and the like. In a particular exemplary embodiment, modules , , and  may be approximately 7.0 to 7.5 inches high and vary in width from 1.35 to 2.6 inches. However, individual modules , , and , are not limited to the dimensions recited; the dimensions recited are merely exemplary of a particular embodiment. Each of modules , , and  may include, for example, on the front face, control knobs, buttons, or any other input devices. Rear face  may, for example, include input devices and\/or connectors. Further, modules , , and  may include input connectors, such as pinned connectors  and the like, coaxial connectors  and the like, and\/or other types of electrical connectors.","Referring now to , a system  is depicted forming an alternative electronics system configuration. System  includes a single power amplifier , four transceivers , and a PIM .","Similarly, referring now to , a system  is formed by another alternative configuration of electronic modules, including four transceivers  and a PIM .","Referring now to , a system  is depicted. System  is an alternative configuration of electronic modules, including a single power amplifier , three transceivers , and a PIM .","Referring now to , a system  is depicted. System  is yet another exemplary embodiment of an alternative configuration of electronic modules, including two power amplifiers , two transceivers , and a PIM .","Referring now to , a system  is depicted. System  includes a power amplifier , two transceivers , and a PIM . Thus, it is abundantly clear that the ruggedized electronics systems depicted may be configured in any of a variety of manners and may further be reconfigured using a different combination of electronic modules. Further, it should be noted that each of the electronic modules is individually ruggedized, having a ruggedized housing and including ruggedized components and further being sealed from infiltration by water and other contaminants. The systems described above form radio systems, however, the modular ruggedized electronics systems may be used to form other types of electronics systems.","Referring now to , chassis  is depicted. Chassis  includes a power supply  having a plurality of fins  for disposing of thermal energy from chassis  and generated by power source . Chassis  also includes a platform  for supporting electronic modules . Chassis  may also include side portions  which may partially encase the entire electronics package and also may provide rigidity and strength to chassis . Side portions  may be a solid panel as depicted, or further may be a panel including a plurality of apertures and\/or openings as depicted in FIGS.  and \u2013. Chassis  may be an open frame chassis that is designed or configured for installation on existing end platform mounts, for example, an MT-6352 mount  depicted in .","Further, chassis  includes a plurality of connectors and\/or interfaces  and  that are used to interface a variety of electronic modules. In an exemplary embodiment, five of the connectors  are identical with one connector  being different to support a PIM. However, any of a variety of connector configurations may be used depending on the end use. Chassis  is preferably formed of a cast aluminum material, but may be formed of any of a variety of rigid materials, including, but not limited to, other metal and metal alloys, polymers, ceramics, composite materials, and the like. When electronic modules are installed, signaling between each of the electronic modules is distributed in the modular electronics platform adapter . In a particular embodiment, each of the electronic subsystem module positions in chassis  includes a signal interface and connector , which are interconnected for communicating with each other. The rugged electronic subsystem modules may share a common universal signaling interface and connector type. A unique modular position having a unique modular connector  may be used to act as a hub for signals from all of the common module positions.","Because of the modularity of system , rugged modular electronics platform adapter  allows for a large potential number of end user configurations which may be tailored to the specific end user requirements. Further, because of the modularity of system , there are lower life cycle costs, and less costs of maintaining such systems is enabled because fewer total package assembly types need to be stocked.","In a particular exemplary embodiment, multiple modular electronics platform adapters (chassis ) may be used together in a single installation on a vehicle or other installation site, rather than producing a single new chassis and new modules when larger systems are required. Further, the modularity of system  provides for the ability for an existing electronic subsystem module to be replaced with a newer technology or upgraded technology version. Further still, an advantage to using the modular electronics platform adapter  with electronic modules  is that when a single module fails, the module may be simply interchanged without having to remove the entire system  from the vehicle and sent out for repair. Also, some of the functionality of system  may be maintained even while certain modules are being repaired.","Because of the open and modular design of system , either passive natural convection cooling or active forced air cooling techniques may be utilized with the same set of electronic modules . Also, having a modular electronics mounting system approach provides benefits over a single monolithic one box approach in the area of channel-to-channel isolation. Because multiple radios may be used in a single housing, there may be significant channel-to-channel interference concerns with conventional systems. Utilizing a modular approach solves the isolation problem by isolating each radio module from each other and utilizing only a digital interface to the other radio system components (excluding power amplifiers, etc.). Although the disclosed system  may be utilized in military applications on military vehicles, the concepts disclosed and designs disclosed may be applied to other areas that include commercial products.","Referring now to , a rear view of system  is depicted including chassis , power supply , with rear fins . Further, the rear electronic connector  is depicted. Connector  is configured to connect to a mating connector on the vehicle. Connector  is in communication with module  and power supply .","Referring now to , system  is depicted in a vehicle . System  is mounted on a mount  that is coupled to vehicle . Chassis  is coupled to mount . Chassis  holds a plurality of ruggedized electronic modules . In the exemplary embodiment depicted, system  includes a hand set  for voice communications that is coupled to a PIM . In the exemplary embodiment depicted, vehicle  is a Humvee. However, vehicle  may be any of a variety of military or other vehicles including, but not limited to, tanks, jeeps, as well as airborne vehicles such as, but not limited to, helicopters, airplanes, and the like. In further alternative embodiments, system  may be mounted on the exterior of the vehicle, for example, the vehicle rear end, and therefore, be subjected to harsh environmental conditions such as, but not limited to, dirt, dust, water, chemicals, submersion in liquids, and the like.","Referring now to , an exemplary embodiment of chassis  is depicted. Chassis  is depicted having an air mover module  coupled thereto. In an exemplary embodiment, air mover module  has a plurality of openings configured on the unseen side of module  that are used to bring ambient air into module  in direction . The inclusion of an air mover module  may be used particularly in airborne applications. Air entering in direction  will exit via a slit on surface  which is facing chassis  in direction . Air from air mover module  moves air in direction  and chassis  directs the air in direction , as well as in many other directions. Air from air mover module  will exit chassis  through apertures  in direction  and will be dispersed and blown past modules which may be installed on chassis . For example, referring now to FIGS.  and \u2013, chassis  is depicted having a plurality of modules  installed thereon and including an air mover module  and showing apertures  for receiving air in direction  depicted in . Air mover module  is configured to be nested in a PIM  which is formed to surround air mover module  within chassis .","Referring now to , an exemplary depiction  of a plurality of potential pin geometries is depicted. The pin geometries shown, for example, include upstanding conically shaped pins  having a circular base portion , a solid upstanding conical section  and a rounded tip . As depicted, pins  may have any of a variety of heights including substantially tall  to substantially short . The pins are configured in such a manner as to have a base with a diameter which provides for ruggedization such that the pins are not easily broken off, especially by hand, from the exterior surface of the housing . Pins  may be configured with rounded tips  to be optimized for human factors, in particular, for comfort of handling.","In an exemplary embodiment, pins  may having any cross-sectional geometry, including but not limited to circular, oval, square, hexagonal, etc. Preferably, tip  is a rounded top, which prevents harm to an individual or damage to equipment when handling the module. Although grid pin patterns are depicted, e.g., as a regular grid in  and a staggered grid in , any pin pattern may be used as long as the desired thermal performance is achieved. Any combination of size, density, and pattern of pins may be used to achieve desired thermal performance. Further, because of the sparse population of pins , the spaces between pins  may be easily flushed of dirt and debris. Further still, because of the sparse population of pins , the spaces between pins  are not apt to become clogged with dirt and debris.","Referring now to , the exemplary pins depicted in  may be used, for example, with the electronics modules , as depicted in . In an exemplary embodiment, pins  are sparsely distributed such that natural convective airflow is not impeded by the density and\/or configuration of pins .","Referring now to , a thermal modeling of natural convective airflow over the side of an electronic module  is depicted. Squares on the diagram represent pins  having an upstanding rectangular geometry. Arrows on the diagram depict the natural convective airflow through the pin field of module . As depicted, the natural airflow through the pin field is not impeded due to the spacing of pins  as shown by the arrows representing airflow on the diagram. Air is drawn from the front of module  or anywhere else that flow is unimpeded and will exhaust out the top as it is heated.","Referring now to , an electronics module  is depicted having a plurality of pins . Module  is depicted as being exposed to an active air source providing forced air over pins  from a source at an area designated by . Arrows depicted also show that the sparsely spaced pin field does not impede air movement originating from an active airflow module. Accordingly, it has been shown that utilizing various pin geometries with a sparse pin field may be applied to systems with both passive and active airflow configurations and, therefore, may be used to adequately remove heat from within the electronic modules.","Referring now to , a ruggedized electronic modular system  is depicted. System  includes two power amplifiers , three transceivers , and a PIM . Each of electronic modules , , and  include on their outer surface sparsely populated cooling pins having various geometric dimensions as can be noted from the depicted ruler (in units of inches) .","While the detailed drawings, specific examples and particular formulations given describe preferred and exemplary embodiments, they serve the purpose of illustration only.
