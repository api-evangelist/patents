Description of the Related Art","The use of mobile phones, handsets and other wireless devises is becoming a primary means for individuals to stay connected in their personal and professional lives. Mobile handsets and other wireless devised are being targeted by businesses to aid in their marketing efforts, delivering specific content directly to prospective customers. The challenge in any mobile marketing campaign is getting individuals to perform a mobile opt-in that is compliant with the Mobile Marketing Association (\u201cMMA\u201d) guidelines for mobile advertising which requires that mobile communication device users opt-in to receive digital communications related to a mobile marketing campaign. Mobile Marketing as defined by the MMA is \u201ca set of practices that enables organizations to communicate and engage with their audience in an interactive and relevant manner through any mobile device or network.\u201d The MMA guidelines require the individual to initiate the opt-in sequence from the device where marketing messages will be delivered. This is normally accomplished by enticing the end user to text a code to a service shortcode or phone number. Alternately, the process can be initiated by having the individual enter their mobile phone number on a web site and then sending a message to that phone number asking them to confirm a desire to receive marketing messages. The problem with both of these methods is complexity and number of steps.","The prior art discusses various technologies related to companies communicating with personal mobile communication devices.","Vogel et al., U.S. Patent Publication Number 2010\/0124937 for a Method Of Customer Relationship Management Using A Short Range Communications Network discloses a customer subscribing to a service from a business entity and receiving communications when the customer's BLUETOOTH device is detected within a certain range.","Harris et al, U.S. Pat.

The complexity of the current opt-in processes further discourages users and reduces the number of participants in mobile marketing campaigns. What is needed is a simple and easy process to allow end-users (e.g. mobile marketing campaign participants) to opt-in to receive digital communications from an enterprise.","The present invention provides a simple and easy solution needed to motivate (or at least not discourage) end-users to opt-in to receive digital communications from an enterprise.","The present invention enables MMA compliant opt-in to a data service by simply dialing a ten digit phone number, thus reducing complexity for the end user and steps in the opt-in process. An end user uses a mobile handset to place a standard voice phone call to a predefined number which can be advertised by an enterprise as the starting point for a data service subscription. A voice call termination point then captures the caller ID of the mobile originated call. If the system determines that the caller is using a mobile handset, the system then sends the response to the opt-in selection. The response sent from the system is typically a welcome message sent as a SMS message. In much the same way, the system can accommodate a termination of service (opt out), or requests for information in the form of data services, by the end user calling the same ten digit telephone number.","One aspect of the present invention is a method for a user to opt-in to receive digital communications. The method includes receiving a telephone call to a pre-designated telephone number from a telephone number of a user. The method also includes collecting the caller identification of the telephone number of the user at a voice call termination point. The method also includes determining a type and a phone carrier of the telephone number of the user. The method also includes screening the telephone number of the user for association with a data capable phone carrier and communication device. The method also includes determining that the telephone number of the user is associated with a data capable phone carrier and communication device. The method also includes transmitting a confirmation digital communication from a voice opt service site to the data capable communication device associated with the telephone number of the user.","Optionally the method includes receiving a valid selection from the telephone number of the user and terminating the telephone call at a voice termination point.","Optionally, the method further includes requesting and receiving from a mobile communication carrier at least one of: (1) if the mobile communication device is activated (on); (2) what is the type of mobile communication device; (3) does the end user (e.g., owner) have an SMS plan associated with the mobile communication device; and (4) does the end user have a data plan associated with the mobile communication device. The method could include requesting and receiving all of the above mentioned factors. The method further includes transmitting to the mobile communication device appropriate content based on at least one of the carrier, the type of mobile communication device, the SMS plan associated with the mobile communication device, and the structure of the data plan associated with the mobile communication device. The method could transmit content based on all or some of the above factors.","The digital communication of the method is preferably a SMS communication to confirm participation in a mobile marketing campaign. Alternatively, the digital communication of the method is a MMS communication or a content push such as WAP push.","The data capable communication device of the method is preferably a mobile phone such as a smartphone. Alternatively, the data capable communication device is a tablet computer.","Another aspect of the present invention is a method for a mobile marketing association compliant opt-in to a mobile marketing campaign. The method includes receiving a telephone call to a pre-designated telephone number from a telephone number of a user. The method also includes transferring the telephone call from the mobile communication device to a mobile communication service provider. The method also includes transferring the telephone call from the mobile communication service provider to a public network. The method also includes transferring the telephone call from the public network to a voice call termination point. The method also includes collecting the caller identification of the mobile communication device at the voice call termination point. The method also includes confirming that an opt-in option has been selected. The method also includes storing the caller identification of the mobile communication device at a voice opt service site. The method also includes requesting a carrier type and information for the mobile communication device from a SMS gateway. The method also includes receiving the carrier type and information for the mobile communication device from the SMS gateway at the voice opt service site. The method also includes confirming at the voice opt service site that the call is from a mobile communication device. The method also includes transmitting an opt-in confirmation message from the voice opt service site to the mobile service provider. The method also includes transmitting the opt-in confirmation message from the mobile service provider to the mobile communication device.","Those skilled in the pertinent art will recognize that although the method of the present invention includes numerous steps, the end user (caller or mobile marketing campaign participant) only has to call a ten digit telephone number and make a single selection, and then the telephone call ends thereby requiring little time from the end user while the \u201ctelephone call\u201d is further processed to make the end user's selection and to transmit a confirmation to the end user, which is all accomplished without the need for the end user to remain on the telephone call.","Yet another aspect of the present invention is a system for a user to opt-in to receive digital communications. The system includes a communication network, multiple mobile communication devices, and a voice opt service site. Each of the multiple mobile communication devices is capable of accessing the communication network. The voice opt service site is in communication with at least one of the mobile communication devices over the communication network. The voice opt service site is configured to: receive a telephone call to a pre-designated telephone number from a telephone number of a user; to collect the caller identification of the telephone number of the user; to determine a type and a phone carrier of the telephone number of the user; to screen the telephone number of the user for association with a data capable phone carrier and communication device; to determine that the telephone number of the user is associated with a data capable phone carrier and communication device; and to transmit a confirmation digital communication from a voice opt service site to the data capable communication device associated with the telephone number of the user.","Optionally, the voice opt service site is configured to request and receive from a mobile communication carrier: (1) if the mobile communication device is activated (on); (2) what is the type of mobile communication device; (3) does the end user (e.g., owner) have an SMS plan associated with the mobile communication device; and (4) does the end user have a data plan associated with the mobile communication device.

The mobile communication service provider sends the phone number registry information (the type of phone) to the voice opt service site.","A flow chart for a specific method of the present invention is shown in . A call is made from a mobile communication device  to a pre-designated number at block . A call made from a mobile communication device is routed through a mobile communication network (mobile service provider or aggregator) at block  and then to a public network at block . If the call is made from a device other than a mobile communication device, such as a land line, the call would be directly routed to the public network at block . Either call avenue is routed to a termination point at the auto switch board service (IVR) at block  where the phone identification (phone number or caller ID) is captured. Also at block , the auto switch board services, such as Ring Central, provide one or more selection prompts for the caller to select from during the telephone call. The selection is captured at block  and the call is terminated at block  if a valid selection decision is entered by the caller at decision block . The system then identifies which option the caller selected (opt-in Option), (opt out option), (customer support) or (other option), or possibly more or less selection. If the system identifies either option or then the ten digit phone identification is received at the voice opt service site at block  from the switch board. The carrier type and information is requested at block  from the SMS gateway at block . The received carrier type and information is received at block  from the SMS gateway. The carrier type and information is then evaluated at block  to determine whether it is a mobile communication device. If the call is not from a mobile communication device, the ten digit phone identification is saved on the server on an \u201cexception list\u201d at block  for a personal follow up at a later time. If the selection captured was to \u201copt in\u201d at block , an opt in message is sent via the SMS gateway to the phone identification previously captured. If the selection captured was to resign membership (or opt out), an opt out message is sent via the SMS gateway to the phone identification previously captured. If the selection captured was customer support, then the caller is requested to leave a voice mail message identifying their name, problem and cellular number at block  so that a representative may resolve the problem and return the call. The message is saved on the server for future resolution at block  and then the call is terminated at block . If any other support option is selected then other support avenues are exercised at block . If the keypad input at block  is not recognized at block , then the call is returned to the auto switch board service at block  for re-retrieval of the service selection.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","521","522","523","524","525","526","527","529","528"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["102","102","616","617","618","619","620","621","622","623","624","625","626","627","628"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["101","701","102","101","102","101"]},"From the foregoing it is believed that those skilled in the pertinent art will recognize the meritorious advancement of this invention and will readily understand that while the present invention has been described in association with a preferred embodiment thereof, and other embodiments illustrated in the accompanying drawings, numerous changes modification and substitutions of equivalents may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention which is intended to be unlimited by the foregoing except as may appear in the following appended claim.
