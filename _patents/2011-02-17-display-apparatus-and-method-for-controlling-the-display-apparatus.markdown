Field","One or more embodiments described herein related to managing and displaying information on an electronic device.","2. Background","A display apparatus have been developed which integrate the display of broadcast and internet-related information. Unfortunately, these devices only have a finite amount of memory, which limits their capability. Also, displaying this information requires payment of costly access fees. Improvements are needed to address these and\/or other drawbacks.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","20","30","40","40","100","100"]},"The content provider  manufactures various contents and provides them. Examples of the content provider  include a terrestrial broadcaster, a cable system operator (SO), a multiple system operator (MSO), a satellite broadcaster, and an Internet broadcaster, as illustrated in .","Also, the content provider  may provide various applications in addition to broadcast contents, which will be described in more detail later.","The service provider  can provide contents provided by the content provider  by service packaging them. For example, the service provider  of  can package first terrestrial broadcasting, second terrestrial broadcasting, cable MSO, satellite broadcasting, various kinds of Internet broadcasting, application, etc. and provide the packaged one to a user.","Also, the service provider  may provide a service to the client  by using a unicast or multicast mode. The unicast mode is to transmit data between a single transmitter and a single receiver 1:1. In case of the unicast mode, for example, if the receiver requests a server to transmit data, the server can transmit data to the receiver in accordance with the request. The multicast mode is to transmit data to a plurality of receivers of a specific group. For example, the server can transmit data to a plurality of receivers, which are previously registered therewith, at one time. For this multicast registration, IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol) can be used.","The network provider  may provide a network for providing a service to the client . The client  may construct a home network end user (HNED) to receive a service.","In the system of the aforementioned display device, conditional access or content protection can be used to protect contents which are transmitted. For conditional access or content protection, a cable card or downloadable conditional access system (DCAS) can be used.","In the mean time, the client  may provide contents through the network. In this case, the client  may be a content provider contrary to the above. The content provider  may receive contents from the client . In this case, it is advantageous in that bidirectional content service or data service is available.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["100","100"]},"The display device  includes a broadcast interface , a section filter , an AIT filter , an application data processor , a broadcast data processor , a media player , an Internet protocol processor , an Internet interface , and a runtime module , for example.","Application information table (AIT) data, a real-time broadcast content, application data, and stream event are received through the broadcast interface . In the mean time, the real-time broadcast content may be designated as a linear A\/V content.","The section filter  performs section filtering for four kinds of data received through the broadcast interface . Then, the section filter  transmits AIT data to the AIT filter , the linear A\/V content to the broadcast data processor , and stream event and application data to the application data processor .","In the mean time, a non-linear A\/V content and application data are received through the Internet interface . The non-linear A\/V content may be content on demand (COD) application, for example.","The non-linear A\/V content is transmitted to the media player , and the application data is transmitted to the runtime module . The runtime module , as illustrated in , includes an application manager and a browser, for example. The application manager controls a lifecycle for an interactive application by using the AIT data. The browser serves to display and process the interactive application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["301","302","303","304","305","306","307"]},"Hereinafter, the process steps for receiving channel information will be described in more detail. The service provider discovery may mean that service providers, which provide IPTV related services, discover a service discovery (SD) server that provides information on the service providers.","For example, three methods for discovering an address list that can receive information (for example, SP discovery information) on the SD server will be provided as follows. First of all, an address previously set by the display device or an address set by a manual operation of the user can be used. Second, a DHCP based SP discovery method can be used. Third, a DNS SRV-based SP discovery method can be used. Also, the display device accesses a server of an address acquired by any one of the above three methods and receives a service provider discovery record that includes information required for service discovery per SP. Then, the display device performs a service search step by using the received service provider discovery record. The above steps can be performed in a push mode or pull mode.","The display device performs a registration procedure (or service attachment procedure) by accessing the SP attachment server designated by an SP attachment locator of the SP discovery record.","Moreover, after performing a separate authentication procedure by accessing an SP authentication service server designated by an SP authentication locator, the display device may perform a service authentication procedure. After the service attachment procedure is successfully performed, data transmitted from the server to the display device may be a form of a provisioning information table.","The display device transmits the data to the service attachment server during the service attachment procedure, wherein the data includes ID and location information of the display device. The service attachment server can define a service subscribed by the display device, based on the received data. Moreover, address information that can acquire service information desired to be received by the display device is provided in the form of the provisioning information table. The address information corresponds to access information of the master SI table. In this case, it is easy to provide a customized service per subscriber.","The service information includes a master SI table record that manages access information and version on the virtual channel map, a virtual channel map table that provides a package type service list, a virtual channel description table that includes detailed information of each channel, and a source table that includes access information that enables actual access to services.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"Each virtual channel map is uniquely identified by a virtual channel map identifier, and virtual channel map version represents version information of the virtual channel map. If any one of all tables connected to one another along an arrow starting from the master SI table illustrated in  is changed, version of all upper tables (to reach master SI table) is increased together with increase of the corresponding table. Accordingly, it is advantageous in that the display device can identify change on all SI tables directly by monitoring the master SI table.","For example, if there is any change of the source table, version of the source table is increased, and version of the virtual channel description table for reference of the source table is also changed. Accordingly, change of a lower table causes change of an upper table, whereby version of the master SI table is finally changed.","The master SI table may exist per service provider. However, if configuration of the service is varied per location or subscriber (or subscriber group), the service provider is designed to have a plurality of master SI tables, thereby providing a customized service per each unit. In this way, if the service provider is designed, it is possible to efficiently provide a customized service for location of a subscriber and subscription information through the master SI table.","The virtual channel map table may have one or more virtual channels, and includes location information that can acquire detailed information of the channel without including the detailed information in the virtual channel map. Virtual channel description location of the virtual channel map table indicates location of the virtual channel description table that includes detailed information of the channel.","The virtual channel description table includes detailed information of the virtual channel, and can access the virtual channel description table by using the virtual channel description location of the virtual channel map table.","The source table provides access information (for example, IP address, port, AV codec, transport protocol, etc.) per service, wherein the access information is required for actual access to the service.","The aforementioned master SI table, the virtual channel map table, the virtual channel description table, and the source table are transferred through four flows, which are logically divided from one another, in a push mode or pull mode. In the mean time, the master SI table can be transmitted in a multicast mode for version management, and monitors version change by receiving multicast streaming.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0086","num":"0085"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["700","701","702","703","705","704","706","707","708","709","710","712","711","714","713"]},"The network interface  receives packets from a network, and transmits the packets to the network. In other words, the network interface  receives services, contents, etc. from the service provider through the network.","The TCP\/IP manager  is involved in packets received in the display device  and packets transmitted from the display device , i.e., packet transfer from the source to the destination. The TCP\/IP manager  sorts the received packets to correspond to a proper protocol, and outputs the sorted packets to the service delivery manager , the service discovery manager , the service control manager , and the metadata manager .","The service delivery manager  takes the role of control of received service data. For example, if the service delivery manager  controls real-time streaming data, it can use RTP\/RTCP. If the service delivery manager  transmits the real-time streaming data by using RTP, it parses the received packets in accordance with RTP and transmits the parsed packets to the demultiplexer  or stores the parsed packets in the SI&Metadata DB  under the control of the service manager . The service delivery manager  feeds the received information back to a server, which provides a service, by using RTCP.","The demultiplexer  demultiplexes the received packets to audio, video and PSI (Program Specific Information) data and then transmits the demultiplexed data to the audio decoder , the video decoder , and the PSI&(PSIP and\/or SI) decoder , respectively.","The PSI&(PSIP and\/or SI) decoder  decodes service information such as PSI, for example. Namely, the PSI&(PSIP and\/or SI) decoder  receives and decodes PSI section, PSIP (Program and Service Information Protocol) section or SI (Service Information) section, which is demultiplexed by the demultiplexer .","Also, the PSI&(PSIP and\/or SI) decoder  decodes the received sections to make a database for service information, and stores the database for service information in the SI&Metadata DB .","The audio\/video decoders \/ decode the video data and the audio data, which are received from the demultiplexer . Te audio data decoded by the audio decoder  and the video data decoded by the video decoder  are provided to the user through the display .","The UI manager  and the service manager  manage the whole state of the display device , provide a user interface, and manage other managers.","The UI manager  provides a graphic user interface for the user by using an on screen display (OSD), and performs a receiving operation based on a key input from the user. For example, if a key input signal for channel selection is input from the user, UI manager  transmits the key input signal to service manager .","The service manager  controls managers related to the service, such as the service delivery manager , the service discovery manager , the service control manager , and the metadata manager .","Also, the service manager  makes a channel map and selects a channel by using the channel map in accordance with the key input signal received from the UI manager . The service manager  receives service information of the channel from the PSI&(PSIP and\/or SI) decoder  and sets audio\/video PID (Packet Identifier) of the selected channel in the demultiplexer .","The service discovery manager  provides information required to select the service provider that provides services. If a signal related to channel selection is received from the service manager , the service discovery manager  discovers a corresponding service by using the received information.","The service control manager  takes the role of selection and control of the service. For example, if the user selects a live broadcasting service like the existing broadcasting mode, the service control manager  uses IGMP or RTSP. If the user selects a video on demand (VOD) service, the service control manager  selects and controls the service by using RTSP. The RTSP protocol can provide a trick mode for real-time streaming. Also, the service control manager  can initiate and manage a session through IMC gate by using IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). The above protocols are only exemplary, and other protocols may be used depending on embodiments.","The metadata manager  manages metadata related to the service and stores the metadata in the SI&Metadata DB . The SI&Metadata DB  stores the service information decoded by the PSI&(PSIP and\/or SI) decoder , the metadata managed by the metadata manager , and the information required to select the service provider provided by the service discovery manager . Also, the SI&Metadata DB  may store setup data for the system. The SI&Metadata DB  may be implemented by using a NonVolatile RAM (NVRAM) or a flash memory. The IG  is a gateway where functions required for access to IMS based IPTV services are gathered.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0101","num":"0100"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["100","105","135","140","150","170","180","185","190","105","110","120","130","105","110","120","130"]},"On the contrary, the broadcast receiver  may be designed in such a manner that it includes a network interface module  but does not include a tuner  and a demodulation module .","The tuner  selects one of RF (radio frequency) broadcast signals received through an antenna, which corresponds to a channel selected by the user or all previously stored channels. Also, the tuner  converts the selected RF broadcast signal to an intermediate frequency signal or a baseband video or audio signal.","For example, if the selected RF broadcast signal is a digital broadcast signal, the tuner  coverts the selected RF broadcast signal to a digital IF (DIF) signal. If the selected RF broadcast signal is an analog broadcast signal, the tuner  coverts the selected RF broadcast signal to an analog baseband video or audio signal (CVBS\/SIF). In other words, the tuner  can process both the digital broadcast signal and the analog broadcast signal. The analog baseband video or audio signal (CVBS\/SIF) output from the tuner  may directly be input to the control module .","Also, the tuner  can receive RF broadcast signal of a single carrier based on an advanced television system committee (ATSC) mode and RF broadcast signal of multiple carriers based on a digital video broadcasting mode (DVB).","In the mean time, the tuner  sequentially selects RF broadcast signals of all broadcast channels stored through a channel memory function from RF broadcast signals received through the antenna, and converts the selected RF broadcast signals to intermediate frequency signals or baseband video or audio signals.","The demodulation module  receives the digital IF (DIF) signal converted by the tuner  and demodulates the received digital IF signal.","For example, if the digital IF signal output from the tuner  is based on the ATSC mode, the demodulation module  performs 8-vestigal side band (8-VSB) demodulation, for example. Also, the demodulation module  may perform channel decoding. To this end, the demodulation module  may include a trellis decoder, a de-interleaver, and a Reed-Solomon decoder to perform trellis decoding, de-interleaving, and Reed-Solomon decoding.","For example, if the digital IF signal output from the tuner  is based on the DVB mode, the demodulation module  performs coded orthogonal frequency division modulation (COFDMA) demodulation, for example. Also, the demodulation module  may perform channel decoding. To this end, the demodulation module  may include a convolution decoder, a de-interleaver, and a Reed-Solomon decoder to perform convolution decoding, de-interleaving, and Reed-Solomon decoding.","The demodulation module  can output a stream signal (TS) after performing demodulation and channel decoding. At this time, the stream signal may be a signal where a video signal, an audio signal and a data signal are multiplexed. For example, the stream signal may be MPEG-2 Transport Stream (TS) where a video signal of an MPEG-2 specification and an audio signal of Dolby AC-3 specification are multiplexed. Specifically, the MPEG-2 TS may include a 4 byte header and 184 byte payload.","The aforementioned demodulation module  may be provided separately depending on the ATSC mode and the DVB mode. Namely, an ATSC demodulation module and a DVB demodulation module may be provided separately.","The stream signal output from the demodulation module  may be input to the control module . The control module  performs demultiplexing, video\/audio signal processing, etc. and then outputs video to the display module  and audio to the audio output module .","The external device interface module  may connect an external device to the display device . To this end, external device interface module  may include an A\/V input\/output unit (not shown) or a wireless communication unit (not shown).","The external device interface module  is connected to external devices such as Digital Versatile Disks (DVD), Blu-rays, game devices, cameras, camcorders, computers (e.g., notebook computers), etc. through wire\/wireless cables. The external device interface module  transmits a video, audio, or data signal externally input through an external device connected thereto, to the control module  of the display device . Also, the external device interface module  outputs the video, audio or data signal processed by the control module  to the external device. To this end, the external device interface module  may include an A\/V input\/output unit (not shown) or a wireless communication unit (not shown).","The A\/V input\/output unit of the external input circuit may include a USB terminal, a composite Video Banking Sync (CVBS) terminal, a component terminal, an S-video terminal (analog), a Digital Visual Interface (DVI) terminal, a High Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) terminal, an RGB terminal, a D-SUB terminal, etc., to input video and audio signals of the external device to the display device .","The wireless communication unit may perform a short-distance wireless communication with other electronic devices. For example, communication standards such as Bluetooth, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), infrared Data Association (IrDA), Ultra Wideband (UWB), ZigBee, Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA), etc. can be used for the short-distance wireless communication, whereby network connection between the display device  and other electronic devices can be performed.","In addition, the external device interface module  may be connected to various set-top boxes through at least one of the above-mentioned various terminals to perform input\/output operation with the set-top boxes.","Also, the external device interface module  receives an application of a neighboring external device or list of applications and transmits the received application or the list of applications to control module  or the memory module .","The network interface module  provides interface for connecting the display device  with wire\/wireless networks including Internet network. The network interface module  may include an Ethernet terminal, for example, for wire network connection. Also, for example, Wireless LAN (WLAN)(Wi-Fi), Wireless broadband (Wibro), World Interoperability for Microwave Access (Wimax), High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) can be used for the wireless network connection.","The network interface module  transmits or receives data to and from other users or other electronic devices through a network connected thereto or another network linked on the connected network. In particular, the network interface module  can transmit some contents data stored in the display device  to a user or electronic device selected from other users or electronic devices previously registered with the display device .","In the mean time, the network interface module  can access a predetermined web page through a network connected thereto or another network linked on the connected network. In other words, the network interface module  can transmit or receive data to and from a corresponding server by accessing the predetermined web page through the corresponding network. In addition, the network interface module  can receive contents or data provided by the content provider or the network operator.","In other words, the network interface module  can receive contents such as movies, advertisements, games, VOD, broadcast signals, etc. and related information, which are provided from the content provider or the network provider through the network. Also, the network interface module  can receive update information and update files of firmware provided by the network operator. Moreover, the network interface module  can transmit data to the Internet or content provider or the network operator.","Furthermore, the network interface module  can selectively receive a desired one of contents open to the public, through the network. Also, the network interface module  can transmit or receive contents or data of a list of contents to and from a predetermined server through the network.","The memory module  may store a program for processing and controlling each signal of the control module , or may store the processed video, audio or data signal. Also, the memory module  may temporarily store the video, audio or data signal input from the external device interface module  or the network interface module . The memory module  may store information on a predetermined broadcast channel through a channel memory function.","Also, the memory module  may store the application or the list of applications input from the external device interface module  or the network interface module .","Also, the memory module  may store the contents or the list of contents input from the external device interface module  or the network interface module .","For example, the memory module  may include a storage medium of at least one type of a flash memory type, a hard disk type, a multimedia card micro type, a card type memory (for example, SD or XD memory), RAM and ROM (EEPROM, etc.) The display device  can play contents files (moving picture files, still image files, music files, application files, etc.) stored in the memory module  to provide the played contents files to the user.","Although  illustrates that the memory module  and the control module  are provided separately, the embodiments described herein are not to be limited by the embodiment of . The memory module  may be included in the control module .","The user input interface module  transmits the signal input by the user to the control module  or transmits the signal from the control module  to the user. For example, the user input interface module  may receive a control signal such as power on\/off, channel selection and screen setup from the remote controller  or transmit the control signal from the control module  to the remote controller  in accordance with various communication modes such as RF communication mode and IR communication mode.","Also, for example, the user input interface module  may transmit a control signal input by a local key (not shown) such as a power key, a channel key, a volume key, and a setup key to the control module .","Also, for example, the user input interface module  may transmit a control signal input by a sensing unit (not shown), which senses gesture of the user, to the control module , or may transmit the signal from the control module  to the sensing unit. In this case, the sensing unit may include a touch sensor, an audio sensor, a position sensor, an action sensor, etc.","Also, for synchronization and search of the contents stored in the display device, the user input interface module  may receive predetermined synchronization target content, a selection signal of the display device for synchronization, a content keyword, and a synchronization command from the user.","The control module  demultiplexes an input stream and processes the demultiplexed stream through the tuner , the demodulation module  or the external device interface module  to generate and output a signal for a video and audio output.","The video signal processed by the control module  may be input to the display module , so that the video signal may be displayed as image corresponding to the video signal.
