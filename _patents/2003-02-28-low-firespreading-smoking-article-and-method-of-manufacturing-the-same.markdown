Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a low fire-spreading smoking article, the burning of which is continued under the ordinary smoking state, but, where the smoking article is put on a burnable material, which prevents the fire from spreading onto the burnable material, and a method of manufacturing the same.","2. Description of the Related Art","In recent years, various requirements are raised against a smoking article such as a cigarette. One of these requirements is to suppress the generation of a sidestream smoke. Recently, the smoking article, which continues its combustion under the ordinary smoking state, is required to be extinguished, when the smoking article is put on a burnable material, so as to prevent the burnable material from catching fire.","Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 11-151082 discloses a low fire-spreading cigarette, in which a plurality of annular processed regions (burn control regions) are formed apart from each other in the longitudinal direction of a cigarette rod by coating a wrapping paper sheet for wrapping the cigarette rod in an annular shape with a suspension prepared by suspending an inorganic loading material such as chalk, clay or titanium oxide in a solvent-soluble cellulose polymer dissolved in a nonaqueous solvent.","However, the conventional low fire-spreading cigarette, which is disclosed in the prior art quoted above, is manufactured by introducing a wrapping paper sheet having the burn control regions formed in advance into a cigarette making machine, wrapping the tobacco filler material with the wrapping paper sheet so as to prepare a long rod body, and cutting the long rod body into the individual cigarettes. Therefore, it was difficult to allow the predetermined pattern of the burn control regions in the individual cigarette to coincide with the pattern of the burn control region in the individual cigarette actually manufactured by cutting the rod body. In addition, the manufacturing cost is increased, since the wrapping paper sheet is coated with the burn control region in the step of manufacturing the wrapping paper sheet.","Under the circumstances, an object of the present invention is to provide a smoking article, in which the predetermined pattern of the burn control region in the individual cigarette can be allowed to coincide easily with the pattern of the coating region of an inorganic loading material in the individual cigarette actually manufactured by cutting a rod body, and the capability of suppressing the spread of a fire can be further improved, and a method of manufacturing the particular smoking article.","According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a low fire-spreading smoking article, which is manufactured through supplying a tobacco filler material onto a tobacco wrapping paper sheet that is being transferred, wrapping the tobacco filler material supplied onto the wrapping paper sheet with the wrapping paper sheet so as to prepare a rod body, and cutting the rod body into a plurality of tobacco rods each having a prescribed length, wherein the tobacco filler material contains at least 20% by weight of expanded tobacco material and the tobacco wrapping paper sheet is coated with a burn adjusting agent during transfer of the tobacco wrapping paper sheet.","According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing a low fire-spreading smoking article, comprising a first step of transferring a tobacco wrapping paper sheet, a second step of coating a burn adjusting agent to the wrapping paper sheet being transferred, a third step of supplying a tobacco filler material containing at least 20% by weight of expanded tobacco material onto the wrapping paper sheet coated with the burn adjusting agent, a fourth step of wrapping the tobacco filler material supplied onto the wrapping paper sheet with the wrapping paper sheet so as to prepare a rod body, and a fifth step of cutting the rod body into a plurality of tobacco rods each having a prescribed length.","In a preferred embodiment, the tobacco wrapping paper sheet is coated with the burn adjusting agent in synchronism with the cutting of the rod body.","In the present invention, the burn adjusting agent may be coated in the form of a plurality of stripes formed apart from each other and extending in the longitudinal direction of the tobacco rod, in the form of a plurality of annuluses formed apart from each other and extending in the circumferential direction of the tobacco rod, or in the form of dots formed apart from each other.","In one embodiment, the tobacco wrapping paper sheet is not coated with the burn adjusting agent in the region covering the tip region of the tobacco rod having a length of 10 mm to 25 mm from the tip.","Various embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. Throughout the drawings, like elements are denoted by like reference numerals.","A smoking article according to the present invention can be prepared through supplying a tobacco filler material onto a tobacco wrapping paper sheet that is being transferred, preparing a rod body by wrapping the tobacco filler material supplied onto the wrapping paper sheet with the wrapping paper sheet, and cutting the rod body into a plurality of tobacco rods each having a predetermined length. The tobacco wrapping paper sheet is coated with a burn adjusting agent, described below, during transfer of the wrapping paper sheet.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00036","num":"00036"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"As shown in , a cigarette  includes a tobacco rod  consisting of a tobacco filler material  wrapped or wound in the shape of a column with a tobacco wrapping paper sheet . The tobacco wrapping paper sheet  may be an ordinary tobacco wrapping paper sheet made of, for example, a hemp pulp and to have an inherent air permeability of 10 to 100 CORESTA units. The tobacco rod  has generally a circumferential length of 17 mm to 26 mm and an axial length of 49 mm to 90 mm. An ordinary filter  may be attached to the proximal end , i.e., downstream edge in the inhaling direction, of the tobacco rod  by the ordinary method by using a tip paper .","In the present invention, the wrapping paper sheet  is coated with a burn adjusting agent during the transferring step of the wrapping paper sheet, and the tobacco filler material  contains at least 20% by weight of expanded tobacco shreds, as described herein later. In this case, the wrapping paper sheet of the individual smoking article after the cutting step is coated with the burn adjusting agent as designed. In addition, it has been found unexpectedly that the spread of a fire from the resultant cigarette to a burnable material can be further suppressed, compared with the case where the tobacco filler material does not contain the expanded tobacco shreds. The expanded tobacco shreds used are not particularly limited. However, it is possible to use in general the expanded tobacco shreds having a bulk density of 140 to 170 mg\/cm. Incidentally, non-expanded shreds have a bulk density of 200 to 300 mg\/cm. In general, the tobacco filler material  is loaded at a density of about 150 to 300 mg\/cm.","The tobacco wrapping paper sheet is coated with a burn adjusting agent during the transfer of the tobacco wrapping paper sheet. The tobacco wrapping paper sheet may be coated with the burn adjusting agent in the form of, for example, a plurality of stripes extending in the longitudinal direction of the tobacco rod. For example, 2 to 10 stripes of burn control regions  are formed on one surface (usually, the inner surface of the tobacco wrapping paper sheet  in contact with the columnar tobacco filler material ) of the tobacco wrapping paper sheet . The burn control regions  are formed apart from each other in the circumferential direction of the tobacco rod  and extend continuously in the longitudinal direction of the tobacco rod . As a result, regions  consisting of the wrapping paper sheet  alone and having no burn control region thereon are formed between the adjacent burn control regions . Since the region  is formed of the portion of the wrapping paper sheet , the region  can burn under the ordinary smoking state like the wrapping paper sheet  itself. It follows that the region  generally performs the function of the burn region. In general, the stripe of the burn control region  has a thickness of 2 to 10 \u03bcm.","As shown in , each of the stripes of the burn control regions  may be formed in a manner to extend from the tip of the wrapping paper sheet  corresponding to the tip of the tobacco rod , i.e., from the upstream edge in the inhaling direction, to reach a region in the vicinity of the proximal end of the tobacco rod . Alternatively, each stripe of the burn control region  may be formed in a manner to extend from a position that is a distance d of 10 mm to 25 mm away from the tip of the tobacco rod to reach a region in the vicinity of the proximal end of the tobacco rod , as shown in FIG. . In general, the tip portion where no burn control region is formed also constitutes a burn region , and may correspond to the region that burns in the first puff or second puff of a cigarette, maintaining the taste of the smoking of the ordinary cigarette in the initial smoking state. In any case, it is not particularly necessary to form the burn control region  on the inner surface of that region of the wrapping paper sheet  which is covered with the tip paper .","The burn control region  can be formed by the coating of a burn adjusting agent. The burn adjusting agent used in the present invention preferably includes, for example, proteins such as gelatin, casein, albumin, and gluten; polysaccharides performing a thickening function such as starch, xanthane gum (echo gum), locust bean gum, guar gum (guar pack), tragacanth, tara gum, tamalindo seed polysaccharides (glyroid), karaya gum, gum arabic, pulran, dextrin, cyclodextrin (oligoseven), and gutty; polysaccharides performing a gelling function such as carrageenan, curdlan, agar, gelatin, farselran, pectin, jeram gel, and kelco gum; lipids such as lecithin; natural high molecular weight derivatives such as carboxymethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, propylene glycol alginate ester, and a processed starch such as starch phosphate; synthetic high molecular weight compounds such as poly(sodium acrylate) and various high molecular weight emulsifying agents; inorganic ammonium salts such as ammonium chloride, ammonium phosphate, ammonium hydrogen phosphate, ammonium dihydrogen phosphate, ammonium bromide and ammonium sulfate; inorganic hydroxides such as barium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, and aluminum hydroxide; and inorganic salt flame retardants such as sodium borate, boric acid, zinc chloride, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride and sodium sulfate. These burn adjusting agents can be used singly or in the form of a mixture of at least two of these burn adjusting agents.","The striped burn control region  can be formed on the wrapping paper sheet  by transferring a solution or dispersion prepared by dissolving or dispersing a burn adjusting agent in, for example, water by using a prescribed roller. Alternatively, an aqueous solution or dispersion of the burn adjusting agent can be applied to the wrapping paper sheet  by using a plurality of pressurizing nozzles. It is also possible to apply a screen printing method for forming the striped burn control region .","If the cigarette  is ignited at the edge of the cigarette rod  and sucked to burn the cigarette, the cigarette can burn like an ordinary cigarette in which no burn control region  is formed because the burn region  extends in general in the burning direction. As a result, the smoking can be tasted. Also, the natural combustion is essentially continued so as to prevent the cigarette from being extinguished. In other words, the burning is essentially continued under the ordinary smoking state in the cigarette of the present invention. However, where the cigarette under the ignited state is put on a burnable material or item such as a carpet, a tatami mat, a wooden article, cloths or garments, the burn control region  essentially extending in the combustion direction, the heat absorption performed by the burnable material, and the expanded tobacco shreds contained in the tobacco filler material collectively serve to extinguish the cigarette  so as to suppress the spread of a fire to the burnable material.","Under the circumstances, it is desirable for the burn control region  to have a width in the circumferential direction of the tobacco rod  of 1 mm to 6 mm. It is also desirable for the adjacent burn control regions  to be apart from each other by 2 mm to 20 mm. In other words, it is desirable for the ordinary burn region  to have a width falling within a range of 2 mm to 20 mm.","The present invention also provides a method of manufacturing a low fire-spreading smoking article, comprising a first step of transferring a tobacco wrapping paper sheet, a second step of coating a burn adjusting agent to the wrapping paper sheet that is being transferred, a third step of supplying a tobacco filler material containing at least 20% by weight of a expanded tobacco material to the wrapping paper sheet coated with the burn adjusting agent, a fourth step of preparing a rod body by wrapping the tobacco filler material supplied onto the wrapping paper sheet with said wrapping paper sheet, and a fifth step of cutting the rod body into pieces each having a prescribed length. Preferably, the wrapping paper sheet is coated with a burn adjusting agent in synchronism with the cutting of the rod body.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00046","num":"00046"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"The construction of the cigarette making machine shown in  is equal to the construction of the conventional cigarette making machine except an apparatus  for manufacturing a low fire-spreading cigarette wrapping paper sheet and an apparatus  for inspecting the low fire-spreading cigarette wrapping paper sheet.","The cigarette making machine shown in  comprises an air permeable transfer means  for transferring a tobacco filler material. An air permeable transfer belt is used as the tobacco filler material transfer means . A tobacco filler material supplying passageway member  extends from a tobacco filler material supply source (not shown) to the tobacco filler material transfer means . A tobacco filler material containing at least 20% by weight of a expanded tobacco material is transferred by utilizing an air stream from the tobacco filler material supply source to the tobacco filler material transfer means  through the tobacco filler material supply passageway member .","The tobacco filler material supplied from the tobacco filler material supply source is pressed against the upper region of the tobacco filler material transfer means  at the end of the tobacco filler material supply passageway member  in the form of a slender band having a prescribed width along the center line in the transfer direction (longitudinal direction) of the tobacco filler material transfer means .","The end of the main portion of a wrapping paper sheet transfer means  for transferring a cigarette wrapping paper sheet from a cigarette wrapping paper sheet supply source  is positioned at the end E in the transfer direction of the tobacco filler material transfer means . In the embodiment shown in the drawing, a roll  of a long web used as a material of the wrapping paper sheet before the wrapping paper sheet is cut into small pieces for wrapping the individual cigarettes is rotatably arranged in the wrapping paper sheet supply source , and the long web withdrawn from the roll  by the main portion of the wrapping paper sheet transfer means  is transferred to the end portion noted above via a slackening preventing means.","In the embodiment shown in the drawing, the main portion of the wrapping paper sheet transfer means  includes a large number of pairs of tension rollers, pairs of guide rollers and pairs of driving rollers.","An additional roll \u2032 is also arranged rotatable, together with the roll , in the wrapping paper sheet supply source . An automatic joining means  permits the starting end of a web \u2032of the additional roll \u2032 to face the long web  a withdrawn from the roll  by the wrapping paper sheet transfer means . If the end of the web  supplied from the roll  is detected by the automatic joining means , the automatic joining means  permits the starting end of the web \u2032of the additional roll \u2032 to be connected to the trailing end of the web of the roll . As a result, the web \u2032of the additional roll \u2032 is transferred toward the end of the main portion of the wrapping paper sheet transfer means  in succession to the web of the roll .","The wrapping paper sheet transfer means  also comprises a wrapping paper supporting and transferring means  arranged downstream of the end of the main portion. In the embodiment shown in the drawing, a transfer belt supported by a plurality of guide rollers and driving rollers is used as the wrapping paper sheet supporting and transferring means  such that the web or \u2032coming from the end of the main portion is transferred by the transfer belt arranged in the horizontal transfer portion above the transfer belt ","A scraper (not shown) is arranged in the terminal E in the transfer direction of the tobacco filler material transfer means  such that the tobacco filler material is forcibly scratched off by the scraper at the terminal E onto the web or \u2032on the upper horizontal transfer portion of the transfer belt . The transfer direction of the web  or \u2032on the upper horizontal transfer portion of the transfer belt is equal to the transfer direction of the tobacco filler material transferred by the tobacco filler material transfer means  such that the center line in the transfer direction of the tobacco filler material transfer means  corresponds in a vertical direction to the center line in the transfer direction of the upper horizontal transfer portion of the transfer belt . It follows that the tobacco filler material forcibly scratched off from the terminal E in the transfer direction of the tobacco filler material transfer means  onto the web  or \u2032on the upper horizontal transfer portion of the transfer belt is deposited to form a slender band on the web  or \u2032, said slender band extending along the center line in the transfer direction of the web or \u2032","A winding device  is arranged along the upper horizontal transfer portion of the transfer belt . The web or \u2032on which the tobacco filler material is deposited to form a slender stripe on the upper horizontal transfer portion of the transfer belt is wound up by the winding device  in the shape of a cigarette, i.e., in the form of an oblong cylinder, in accordance with progress of the upper horizontal transfer portion of the transfer belt ","The winding device  includes wind-up means , arranged in the transfer direction of the upper horizontal transfer portion, a paste attaching means , a paste drying means  and a cutting means . The wind-up means  a serves to pull up the both side portions of the web or \u2032on which the tobacco filler material is deposited to form an oblong band on the upper horizontal transfer portion so as to form a substantially U-shaped cross section and, then, to bend further one of the side portions so as to wrap the tobacco filler material on the oblong band-like tobacco filler material. The paste attaching means  serves to attach a paste to the edge of one of the side portions of the web or \u2032that have been pulled upward. The remaining wind-up means serves to bend tubular one side portion of the web or \u2032, to which a paste is already attached, toward the edge of the other side portion that is already bent tubular as described above so as to attach the edge of said one side portion to the edge of the other side portion with the paste. As a result, the web or \u2032is formed into a rod CB of a cylindrical oblong cigarette having the tobacco filler material loaded therein.","The rod CB of the oblong cigarette is passed through the paste drying means  so as to dry the paste contained in the rod CB of the oblong cigarette and, then, the rod CB is cut into a plurality of pieces each having a prescribed length by the cutting means  so as to obtain a cigarette CG having a prescribed length. Needless to say, the wrapping paper sheet is consecutively transferred throughout the process steps described above so as to be supplied for each operation. The cutting means  is operated so as to cut the rod CB of the cigarette at the time when the rod CB of the cigarette is moved forward by a prescribed length.","Needless to say, the transfer direction of the long web or \u2032of the wrapping paper sheet, which is transferred by the wrapping paper sheet transfer means , is the direction in which the long web or \u2032of the wrapping paper sheet extends in the longitudinal direction under the state that the web or \u2032is wound in the form of a cigarette.","The construction of the cigarette making machine shown in  under the state described above is equal to the construction of a conventional cigarette making machine.","The apparatus  for manufacturing the low fire-spreading cigarette wrapping paper sheet, which is a novel construction included in the cigarette making machine shown in , comprises means  for forming a stripe of a burn adjusting agent, said means  being used in combination with the main portion of the wrapping paper sheet transfer means .","Such being the situation, the construction of the means  for forming the stripe of the burn adjusting agent will now be described in detail with reference to , which shows in a magnified fashion the periphery of the means  for forming the stripe of the burn adjusting agent included in the cigarette making machine shown in , in addition to FIG. .","The means  for forming the stripe of the burn adjusting agent serves to form a plurality of stripes of the burn adjusting agent, which has already been described, on the surface of the side forming the inner surface when the long web or \u2032of the wrapping paper sheet transferred by the main portion of the wrapping paper sheet transfer means  is wound in the shape of a cigarette in a manner to extend in the direction forming the longitudinal direction when the web or \u2032is wound in the shape of a cigarette.
