title: Underwater acoustic vector sensor using transverse-response free, shear mode, PMN-PT crystal
abstract: The present invention is directed to an acoustic vector sensor, also called particle velocity sensor. <111> direction poled, shear mode, relaxor single crystals are used as the sensing elements. In addition, these crystal plates are cut at a special orientation such that they provide zero or minimum responses in the transverse directions, but have a maximum piezoelectric response in sensing direction. The piezoelectric sensor contains a proof mass, a base, and an aforementioned relaxor crystal. Three of the sensors are mounted orthogonally with a rigid case, and they are designated to sense the acoustic particle velocity in three designated directions, say X, Y, and Z. To solve the adverse lateral constraint problem (also known as clamping effect) associated with the relaxor crystal; reduced bonding area between the proof mass and the relaxor crystal are introduced. This feature greatly reduced the percentage of the bonding area for the crystal; consequently the free-state piezoelectric properties of the relaxor crystals are preserved.

No. 60\/486,170 Filed Jul. 11, 2003","The work leading to the present invention was supported in part by Navy ONR, Contract No. N66604-03-C-1039. The United States Government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention is directed to an acoustic vector sensor, specifically an underwater acoustic vector sensor.","Inertial accelerometers have been used as the sensing elements in underwater acoustic pressure gradient (vector) sensors. Conventionally, PZT piezoelectric ceramics were used as the sensing material. Due to reduced piezoelectric properties compared to a relaxor single crystal, vector sensors using PZT resulted in low signal-to-noise ratios and narrow bandwidths.","It has recently been attempted to exploit a relaxor single crystal in a vector sensor design. Without good solutions to mitigate the adverse effects of the relaxor crystal, such as lateral constraint effect and large transverse responses, these efforts have so far ended in a vector sensor having little improvement and\/or very fragile sensing structures.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,038,924 to Lee et al. discloses a seismic accelerometer comprising three piezoelectric sensing elements, with each element sensing inertial forces applied to the accelerometer from a particular direction, X, Y, or Z. Each sensing element also has a stacking construction having a base, a piezoelectric sensing element, and a mass.","U.S. Pat. No. 4,928,263 to Armstrong et al. discloses an accelerometer-based hydrophone using piezoelectric ceramic as the active material. The hydrophone comprises orthogonally arranged accelerometers that share an inertial mass and housed in a pressure vessel.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,370,084 to Cray discloses an acoustic vector sensor comprising an acoustics sensing tri-axial accelerometer, a body of syntactic foam encasing the accelerometer, a body of viscoelastic rubber encasing the body of syntactic foam, and a rigid plastic coating encasing the body of viscoelastic rubber. The viscoelastic body is acoustically transparent and isolates the accelerometer and syntactic foam sphere from the mount, and insulates the accelerometer from structure-borne flexural vibrations from supporting structures near the sensor.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,697,302 to Cray et al. discloses an underwater acoustic sensor that measures up to seven quantities of acoustic field at a collocated point. The quantities measured by the acoustic receiver sensor are acoustic pressure, three orthogonal components of acoustic particle acceleration, and three spatial gradients of the acceleration vector. These quantities are then combined to provide improved directivity of the acoustic receiver sensor.","All previous solutions suffer from high noise level and narrow frequency bandwidth.","It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a sensor having the advantages of a relaxor crystal without the disadvantages of high noise levels and narrow bandwidths. To achieve the above and other objects, the present invention uses a shear mode (d15) relaxor single crystal. Other improvements also include reduced bonding areas on the relaxor crystal to alleviate the adverse clamping effect, and a cutting orientation of the crystal given by a rotation angle around the X axis of",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"\u03b1","mo":"=","mrow":{"mi":"arctan","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"msub":[{"mo":"\u2146","mn":"16"},{"mo":"\u2146","mn":"15"}]}}}}}},"br":{}},"The piezoelectric sensor of the present invention comprises a proof mass, a base, and a piezoelectric crystal sandwiched therebetween. The bonding surfaces of the proof mass and the base are preferably castellated. And the piezoelectric crystal is preferably a shear mode (d) relaxor single crystal.","The acoustic vector sensor of the present invention comprises three piezoelectric sensors orthogonally mounted on a rigid housing. Each of the three piezoelectric sensor measures acoustic energy from one of the three different, orthogonal, axial directions (X, Y, and Z).","In an embodiment of the present invention, by utilizing a shear mode (d) relaxor single crystal which possesses the highest piezoelectric coefficient, coupled with the lateral constraint (clamping effect) alleviation mechanism and the identified optimal orientation of the relaxor crystal of the present invention, a vector sensor with much higher signal to noise ratio and wider frequency band can be realized.","The present invention exploits the exceptionally high piezoelectric shear coefficient (d) of a relaxor single crystal, and it employs unique approaches to eliminate the adverse effects, i.e. lateral constraint (clamping) effect and transverse response effect. Consequently, a miniature vector sensor with high signal-to-noise ratio and wide bandwidth is achieved.","A simple shear mode, piezoelectric, inertial stack is selected as the basic sensing element. This stack, which is shown in  as , includes a proof mass , a shear mode relaxor crystal plate  and a base . Two unique features are incorporated in the stack design, which are illustrated in , which shows a stack  including a proof mass , a shear mode relaxor crystal plate  and a base . The first feature is that the bonding surfaces ,  are castellated, i.e., raised protrusions are made on the mass and base gluing surfaces. Castellated patterns can be fabricated on the bonding surface in accordance with U.S. Pat. No. 6,715,363 to Deng et al., which is incorporated herein by reference. Even though this feature resembles that of the Deng et al patent just cited, the function and characteristics are fundamentally different. The height and pattern of the protrusions are not critical, whereas the percentage of the bonding area is the most important parameter. Instead of amplifying the strain in the piezoelectric crystals, as in the Deng et al patent just cited, this feature is intended to greatly reduce the bonding area on the crystal, and doing so will effectively mitigate the lateral constraint adverse effect of the relaxor crystal. As a consequence, the piezoelectric output of the sensing structure is significantly improved. The second feature is that the relaxor shear crystal plate  is cut in a special orientation so that it only produces a maximum piezoelectric response in one direction (Y axis in ) and minimum piezoelectric outputs in the other two orthogonal directions (X and Z axes in ). The detailed information about this special orientation will be set forth below.","Three of the aforementioned stacks  are mounted orthogonally to each other onto a rigid housing (base) , which is depicted in , to form a vector sensor . Each of the stacks  measures acoustic energy from one of the three different, orthogonal, axial directions (X, Y, and Z). Moreover, the sensor housing  is preferably more rigid than the rest of the stacks  (or has higher resonance than that of the stacks). In an embodiment of the present invention, as shown in , the housing  can also serve as a base for the stacks . Alternatively, however, a separate base can be constructed for each stack and mounted onto the housing . The enclosed housing  is preferably designed to maintain approximate neutral buoyancy in water. In a preferred embodiment, the feature size of the enclosed sensor  is equal to or smaller than the half wavelength of the highest frequency of interest. Once submerged in water, the sensor  can freely float, and thereby follows the acoustical particle movement. Consequently, the pressure gradient (acceleration) of the acoustical wave can be measured by the three correspondent stacks (X, Y, Z sensing directions in ).","The old methods employed three independent piezoelectric inertial sensors and potted them together in the material which is much lighter than water. By contrast, the current invention mounts three piezoelectric sensing structures directly on a rigid, enclosed house. The resonance of the mounting structure and housing, which are integrated as one piece, is designed to be higher than the sensing structure itself. More importantly, there are two important features that are incorporated in the shear mode sensing stack: first is the reduced bonding area through the recessed valleys and protrusions, and the second is the optimal cut crystal plate. Both these features can be employed together or independently depending on the design of the sensor.","The simple, compact sensing structure enables the most weight efficient design. The castellated bonding surfaces effectively alleviate the lateral constraint effect of relaxor crystal and still ensure a good bonding integrity. The optimal cut of the relaxor crystal plate guarantees a good sensing directivity which is crucial to a vector sensor.","The following describes the particular crystal orientation to produce a maximum piezoelectric response in one direction and minimum piezoelectric outputs in the other two orthogonal directions:","The exceptional piezoelectric property of the shear mode relaxor (PMN-PT) crystal is shown in the following Table 1:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Typical Piezoelectric Properties of the Three Modes"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"77pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Material","Piezoelectric Charge","Piezoelectric"]},{"entry":[{},"Properties","d Coefficients (pC\/N)","Coupling Factor"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"8"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Symbol","d","d","d","k","k","k"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"8"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"PZT-4","\u2212130","300","500","33%","68%","71%"]},{"entry":[{},"PMN-PT","\u2212900","2000","4600","53%","90%","97%"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"Among all of the modes, the shear mode piezoelectric coefficient dhas the highest value.
