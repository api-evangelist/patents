title: Method and system for electronic content storage and retrieval with galois fields on cloud computing networks
abstract: A method and system for electronic content storage and retrieval with Galois Fields on cloud computing networks. The electronic content is divided into plural portions and stored in plural cloud storage objects. Storage locations for the plural cloud storage objects are selected using a Galois field and the plural cloud storage objects are distributed across the cloud network. When the electronic content is requested, the plural portions are retrieved and transparently combined back into the original electronic content. No server network devices or target network devices can individually determine locations of all portions of the electronic content on the cloud communications network, thereby providing layers of security and privacy for the electronic content on the cloud communications network.

No. 13\/097,227 filed Apr. 29, 2011, the contents of which is incorporated by reference.","This invention relates to retrieving electronic information over a computer network. More specifically, it relates to a method and system for electronic content storage and retrieval with Galois fields on cloud computing networks.","\u201cCloud computing\u201d is a term used to identify the delivery of computing requirements as a service to a heterogeneous community of end-recipients. The term cloud theoretically signifies abstraction of technology, resources and locations that are used in building an integrated computing infrastructure (including networks, systems, applications, etc.). All Cloud computing models rely heavily on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economies of scale similar to a utility (like a grid for electricity) over a network.","Cloud computing provides services with a user's data, software and computation on over multiple networks. End users access cloud based applications through a web browser or a light weight desktop or mobile application while the rest of the application software and data are stored on servers at remote locations. Cloud computing provides a same or better service and performance with cloud software programs as if al the cloud software programs were actually installed locally on end-user devices.","At the foundation of cloud computing is the broader concept of infrastructure convergence and shared services. This type of cloud computing environment allows enterprises to get their applications up and running faster, with easier manageability and less maintenance, and enables the enterprise to more rapidly adjust resources (such as servers, storage, and networking) to meet fluctuating and unpredictable business demand.","However, there are a number of problems associated with electronic content storage and retrieval on cloud computing network.","One problem is how to efficiently store and retrieve electronic content on cloud computing networks.","Another problem is providing proper privacy and security for electronic content stored and retrieved on cloud computing networks.","Another problem is where to store and retrieve electronic content on a cloud computing network.","Thus, it is desirable to solve some of the problems associated with content storage and retrieval with cloud computing networks.","In accordance with preferred embodiments of the present invention, some of the problems associated with electronic content storage and retrieval on cloud computing networks are overcome. A method and system for electronic content storage and retrieval on cloud computing networks is presented.","The electronic content is divided into plural portions and stored in plural cloud storage objects. Storage locations for the plural cloud storage objects are selected using a Galois field and the plural cloud storage objects are distributed to various locations across the cloud network. When the electronic content is requested, the plural portions are retrieved and transparently combined back into the original electronic content. No server network devices storing the plural cloud storage objects can individually determine locations of all portions of the electronic content on the cloud communications network, thereby providing a first layer of security and privacy for the electronic content on the cloud communications network. No target network devices requesting the electronic content can determine where the electronic content is stored, thereby providing a second layer of security and privacy for the electronic content on the cloud communications network.","The foregoing and other features and advantages of preferred embodiments of the present invention will be more readily apparent from the following detailed description.

WEP is cryptographic privacy algorithm, based on the Rivest Cipher 4 (RC4) encryption engine, used to provide confidentiality for 802.11b wireless data.","RC4 is cipher designed by RSA Data Security, Inc. of Bedford, Mass., which can accept encryption keys of arbitrary length, and is essentially a pseudo random number generator with an output of the generator being XORed with a data stream to produce encrypted data.","One problem with WEP is that it is used at the two lowest layers of the OSI model, the physical layer and the data link layer, therefore, it does not offer end-to-end security. One another problem with WEP is that its encryption keys are static rather than dynamic. To update WEP encryption keys, an individual has to manually update a WEP key. WEP also typically uses -bit static keys for encryption and thus provides \u201cweak encryption,\u201d making a WEP device a target of hackers.","The IEEE 802.11 Working Group is working on a security upgrade for the 802.11 standard called \u201c802.11i.\u201d This supplemental draft standard is intended to improve WiLAN security. It describes the encrypted transmission of data between systems 802.11X WiLANs. It also defines new encryption key protocols including the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP). The IEEE 802.11i draft standard, version 4, completed Jun. 6, 2003, is incorporated herein by reference.","The 802.11i is based on 802.1x port-based authentication for user and device authentication. The 802.11i standard includes two main developments: Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) and Robust Security Network (RSN).","WPA uses the same RC4 underlying encryption algorithm as WEP. However, WPA uses TKIP to improve security of keys used with WEP. WPA keys are derived and rotated more often than WEP keys and thus provide additional security. WPA also adds a message-integrity-check function to prevent packet forgeries.","RSN uses dynamic negotiation of authentication and selectable encryption algorithms between wireless access points and wireless devices. The authentication schemes proposed in the draft standard include Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP). One proposed encryption algorithm is an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption algorithm.","Dynamic negotiation of authentication and encryption algorithms lets RSN evolve with the state of the art in security, adding algorithms to address new threats and continuing to provide the security necessary to protect information that WiLANs carry.","The NIST developed a new encryption standard, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to keep government information secure.

Hashing is used to index and retrieve items in a database because it is faster to find the item using the shorter hashed key than to find it using the original value. It is also used in many encryption algorithms.","Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), is used for computing a secure condensed representation of a data message or a data file.
