The government may have certain rights in the invention.","The present invention describes methods of treating cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL), peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) and head and neck cancers. The present invention provides methods of selectively inducing terminal differentiation, cell growth arrest and\/or apoptosis of neoplastic cells, and\/or inhibiting histone deacetylases (HDAC) administration of pharmaceutical compositions comprising HDAC inhibitors. The oral formulations of the pharmaceutical compositions have favorable pharmacokinetic profiles such as high bioavailability and surprisingly give rise to high blood levels of the active compounds over an extended period of time.","Throughout this application various publications are referenced by arabic numerals within parentheses. Full citations for these publications may be found at the end of the specification immediately preceding the claims. The disclosures of these publications in their entireties are hereby incorporated by reference into this application in order to more fully describe the state of the art to which this invention pertains.","Cancer is a disorder in which a population of cells has become, in varying degrees, unresponsive to the control mechanisms that normally govern proliferation and differentiation. For many years there have been two principal strategies for chemotherapeutic treatment of cancer: a) blocking hormone-dependent tumor cell proliferation by interference with the production or peripheral action of sex hormones; and b) killing cancer cells directly by exposing them to cytotoxic substances, which injure both neoplastic and normal cell populations.","Cancer therapy is also being attempted by the induction of terminal differentiation of the neoplastic cells (1). In cell culture models differentiation has been reported by exposure of cells to a variety of stimuli, including: cyclic AMP and retinoic acid (2,3), aclarubicin and other anthracyclines (4).","Despite many advances in the field of oncology, the majority of solid tumors remain incurable in the advanced stages. Cytotoxic therapy is used in most cases, however, it often causes significant morbidity to the patient without significant clinical benefit. Less toxic and more specific agents to treat and control advanced malignancies are being explored.","There is abundant evidence that neoplastic transformation does not necessarily destroy the potential of cancer cells to differentiate (1,5,6). There are many examples of tumor cells which do not respond to the normal regulators of proliferation and appear to be blocked in the expression of their differentiation program, and yet can be induced to differentiate and cease replicating. A variety of agents, including some relatively simple polar compounds (5,7-9), derivatives of vitamin D and retinoic acid (10-12), steroid hormones (13), growth factors (6,14), proteases (15,16), tumor promoters (17,18), and inhibitors of DNA or RNA synthesis (4,19-24), can induce various transformed cell lines and primary human tumor explants to express more differentiated characteristics.","Early studies identified a series of polar compounds that were effective inducers of differentiation in a number of transformed cell lines (8,9). Of these, the most effective inducer was the hybrid polar\/apolar compound N,N\u2032-hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) (9). The use of this polar\/apolar compound to induce murine erythroleukemia cells (MELC) to undergo erythroid differentiation with suppression of oncogenicity has proved a useful model to study inducer-mediated differentiation of transformed cells (5,7-9). HMBA-induced MELC terminal erythroid differentiation is a multi-step process. Upon addition of HMBA to MELC (745A-DS19) in culture, there is a latent period of 10 to 12 hours before commitment to terminal differentiation is detected. Commitment is defined as the capacity of cells to express terminal differentiation despite removal of inducer (25). Upon continued exposure to HMBA there is progressive recruitment of cells to differentiate. The present inventors have reported that MELC cell lines made resistant to relatively low levels of vincristine become markedly more sensitive to the inducing action of HMBA and can be induced to differentiate with little or no latent period (26).","HMBA is capable of inducing phenotypic changes consistent with differentiation in a broad variety of cells lines (5). The characteristics of the drug-induced effect have been most extensively studied in the murine erythroleukemia cell system (MELC) (5,25,27,28). MELC induction of differentiation is both time and concentration dependent. The minimum concentration required to demonstrate an effect in vitro in most strains is 2 to 3 mM; the minimum duration of continuous exposure generally required to induce differentiation in a substantial portion (>20%) of the population without continuing drug exposure is about 36 hours.","The primary target of action of HMBA is not known. There is evidence that protein kinase C is involved in the pathway of inducer-mediated differentiation (29). The in vitro studies provided a basis for evaluating the potential of HMBA as a cytodifferentiation agent in the treatment of human cancers (30). Several phase I clinical trials with HMBA have been completed (31-36). Clinical trials have shown that this compound can induce a therapeutic response in patients with cancer (35,36). However, these phase I clinical trials also have demonstrated that the potential efficacy of HMBA is limited, in part, by dose-related toxicity which prevents achieving optimal blood levels and by the need for intravenous administration of large quantities of the agent, over prolonged periods.","It has been reported that a number of compounds related to HMBA with polar groups separated by apolar linkages that, on a molar basis, are as active (37) or 100 times more active than HMBA (38). As a class, however, it has been found that the symmetrical dimers such as HMBA and related compounds are not the best cytodifferentiating agents.","It has unexpectedly been found that the best compounds comprise two polar end groups separated by a flexible chain of methylene groups, wherein one or both of the polar end groups is a large hydrophobic group. Preferably, the polar end groups are different and only one is a large hydrophobic group. These compounds are unexpectedly a thousand times more active than HMBA and ten times more active than HMBA related compounds.","Histone deacetylase inhibitors such as suberoylanilide hydroxamide acid (SAHA), belong to this class of agents that have the ability to induce tumor cell growth arrest, differentiation and\/or apoptosis (39). These compounds are targeted towards mechanisms inherent to the ability of a neoplastic cell to become malignant, as they do not appear to have toxicity in doses effective for inhibition of tumor growth in animals (40). There are several lines of evidence that histone acetylation and deacetylation are mechanisms by which transcriptional regulation in a cell is achieved (41). These effects are thought to occur through changes in the structure of chromatin by altering the affinity of histone proteins for coiled DNA in the nucleosome. There are five types of histones that have been identified in nucleosomes (designated H1, H2A, H2B, H3 and H4). Each nucleosome contains two of each histone type within its core, except for H1, which is present singly in the outer portion of the nucleosome structure. It is believed that when the histone proteins are hypoacetylated, there is a greater affinity of the histone to the DNA phosphate backbone This affinity causes DNA to be tightly bound to the histone and renders the DNA inaccessible to transcriptional regulatory elements and machinery. The regulation of acetylated states occurs through the balance of activity between two enzyme complexes, histone acetyl transferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC). The hypoacetylated state is thought to inhibit transcription of associated DNA. This hypoacetylated state is catalyzed by large multiprotein complexes that include HDAC enzymes. In particular, HDACs have been shown to catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from the chromatin core histones.","The inhibition of HDAC by SAHA is thought occur through direct interaction with the catalytic site of the enzyme as demonstrated by X-ray crystallography studies (42). The result of HDAC inhibition is not believed to have a generalized effect on the genome, but rather, only affects a small subset of the genome (43). Evidence provided by DNA microarrays using malignant cell lines cultured with a HDAC inhibitor shows that there are a finite (1-2%) number of genes whose products are altered. For example, cells treated in culture with HDAC inhibitors show a consistent induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (44). This protein plays an important role in cell cycle arrest. HDAC inhibitors are thought to increase the rate of transcription of p21 by propagating the hyperacetylated state of histones in the region of the p21 gene, thereby making the gene accessible to transcriptional machinery. Genes whose expression is not affected by HDAC inhibitors do not display changes in the acetylation of regional associated histones (45).","It has been shown in several instances that the disruption of HAT or HDAC activity is implicated in the development of a malignant phenotype. For instance, in acute promyelocytic leukemia, the oncoprotein produced by the fusion of PML and RAR alpha appears to suppress specific gene transcription through the recruitment of HDACs (46). In this manner, the neoplastic cell is unable to complete differentiation and leads to excess proliferation of the leukemic cell line.","Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas and peripheral T-cell lymphomas are forms of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas are a group of lymphoproliferative disorders characterized by localization of malignant T lymphocytes to the skin at presentation. CTCL frequently involves the skin, bloodstream, regional lymph nodes and spleen. Mycosis fungoides (MF), the most common and indolent form of CTCL, is characterized by patches, plaques or tumors containing epidermotropic CD4CD45RO helper\/memory T cells. MF may evolve into a leukemic variant, Sezary syndrome (SS), or transform to large cell lymphoma. The condition causes severe skin itching, pain and edema. Currently, CTCL is treated topically with steroids, photochemotherapy and chemotherapy, as well as radiotherapy. Peripheral T-cell lymphomas originate from mature or peripheral (not central or thymic) T-cell lymphocytes as a clonal proliferation from a single T-cell and are usually either predominantly nodal or extranodal tumors. They have T-cell lymphocyte cell-surface markers and clonal arrangements of the T-cell receptor genes. Approximately 16,000 to 20,000 people in the U.S. are affected by either CTCL or PTCL. These diseases are highly symptomatic. Patches, plaques and tumors are the clinical names of the different presentations. Patches are usually flat, possibly scaly and look like a \u201crash.\u201d Mycosis fungoides patches are often mistaken for eczema, psoriasis or non-specific dermatitis until a proper diagnosis of mycosis fungoides is made. Plaques are thicker, raised lesions. Tumors are raised \u201cbumps\u201d which may or may not ulcerate. A common characteristic is itching or pruritis, although many patients do not experience itching. It is possible to have one or all three of these phases. For most patients, existing treatments are palliative but not curative.","According to the National Cancer Institute, head and neck cancers account for three percent of all cancers in the U.S. Most head and neck cancers originate in the squamous cells lining the structures found in the head and neck, and are often referred to as squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (SCCHN). Some head and neck cancers originate in other types of cells, such as glandular cells. Head and neck cancers that originate in glandular cells are called adenocarcinomas. Head and neck cancers are further defined by the area in which they begin, such as the oral cavity, nasal cavity, larynx, pharynx, salivary glands and lymph nodes of the upper part of the neck. It is estimated that 38,000 people in the U.S. developed head and neck cancer 2002. Approximately 60% of patients present with locally advanced disease. Only 30% of these patients achieve long-term remission after treatment with surgery and\/or radiation. For patients with recurrent and\/or metastatic disease, the median survival is approximately six months.","U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,369,108, 5,932,616, 5,700,811, 6,087,367 and 6,511,990, issued to some of the present inventors, disclose compounds useful for selectively inducing terminal differentiation of neoplastic cells, which compounds have two polar end groups separated by a flexible chain of methylene groups or a by a rigid phenyl group, wherein one or both of the polar end groups is a large hydrophobic group. Some of the compounds have an additional large hydrophobic group at the same end of the molecule as the first hydrophobic group which further increases differentiation activity about 100 fold in an enzymatic assay and about 50 fold in a cell differentiation assay. Methods of synthesizing the compounds used in the methods and pharmaceutical compositions of this invention are fully described the aforementioned patents, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.","The aforementioned patents do not disclose specific oral formulations of the HDAC inhibitors or specific dosages and dosing schedules of the recited compounds. Importantly, the aforementioned patents do not disclose oral formulations that have favorable pharmacokinetic profiles such as high bioavailability which gives rise to high blood levels of the active compounds over an extended period of time.","The class of compounds of the present invention may be useful for selectively inducing terminal differentiation, cell growth arrest and\/or apoptosis of neoplastic cells and therefore aid in treatment of tumors in patients. Thus there is an urgent need to discover suitable dosages and dosing schedules of these compounds, and to develop formulations, preferably oral formulations, which give rise to steady, therapeutically effective blood levels of the active compounds over an extended period of time.","The present invention provides a method of treating cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL), peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) or head and neck cancers by administering an effective amount of an HDAC inhibitor, such as suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA). SAHA can be administered in a total daily dose of up to 800 mg, preferably orally, once, twice or three times daily, continuously (every day) or intermittently (e.g., 3-5 days a week).","Oral SAHA has been safely administered in phase I and phase II clinical studies to patients suffering from in cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, peripheral T-cell lymphomas or head and neck cancers.","Furthermore, the present invention provides a method of treating cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, peripheral T-cell lymphomas or head and neck cancers by administering an effective amount of an HDAC inhibitor as described herein. The HDAC inhibitors can be administered in a total daily dose of up to 800 mg, preferably orally, once, twice or three times daily, continuously (i.e., every day) or intermittently (e.g., 3-5 days a week).","The present invention also provides methods for selectively inducing terminal differentiation, cell growth arrest and\/or apoptosis of neoplastic cells, thereby inhibiting proliferation of such cells, as well as methods of treating cancer and of chemoprevention in subjects in need thereof, by administering to said subject an effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition comprising a HDAC inhibitor or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or hydrate thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. An effective amount of an HDAC inhibitor in the present invention can be up to a total daily dose of 800 mg.","The present invention further provides a safe, daily dosing regimen of the formulation of pharmaceutical compositions comprising an HDAC inhibitor which are easy to follow and to adhere to. These pharmaceutical compositions are suitable for oral administration and comprise a compound useful for treating cancer, chemoprevention, selectively inducing terminal differentiation, cell growth arrest and\/or apoptosis of neoplastic cells, and\/or which is a potent inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC). The pharmaceutical compositions are further comprised of microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium and magnesium stearate.","The present invention is a method of treating CTCL, PTCL and head and neck cancers such as SCCHN, or other cancers by administering an HDAC inhibitor, such as SAHA, which is represented by the structure described herein as formula 4, pyroxamide, which is represented by the structure described herein as formula 6, or other hydroxamic acids represented by formulas 1-3, 5 and 7-52 described herein. The HDAC inhibitor can be administered once daily (QD), or divided into multiple daily doses such as twice daily (BID), and three times daily (TID).

The terms \u201cintermittent\u201d or \u201cintermittently\u201d as used herein means stopping and starting at either regular or irregular intervals. For example, intermittent administration of an HDAC inhibitor may be administration one to six days per week or it may mean daily administration for two consecutive weeks, then no administration for one week or it may mean administration on alternate days.","SAHA or any of the HDAC inhibitors are administered to the patient at a total daily dosage of between 25-4000 mg\/m. A currently preferred treatment protocol comprises continuous administration (i.e., every day), once, twice or three times daily at a total daily dose in the range of about 200 mg to about 600 mg.","Another currently preferred treatment protocol comprises intermittent administration of between three to five days a week, once, twice or three times daily at a total daily dose in the range of about 200 mg to about 600 mg.","In one particular embodiment, the HDAC inhibitor is administered continuously once daily at a dose of 400 mg or twice daily at a dose of 200 mg.","In another particular embodiment, the HDAC inhibitor is administered intermittently three days a week, once daily at a dose of 400 mg or twice daily at a dose of 200 mg.","In another particular embodiment, the HDAC inhibitor is administered intermittently four days a week, once daily at a dose of 400 mg or twice daily at a dose of 200 mg.","In another particular embodiment, the HDAC inhibitor is administered intermittently five days a week, once daily at a dose of 400 mg or twice daily at a dose of 200 mg.","In one particular embodiment, the HDAC inhibitor is administered continuously once daily at a dose of 600 mg, twice daily at a dose of 300 mg, or three times daily at a dose of 200 mg.","In another particular embodiment, the HDAC inhibitor is administered intermittently three days a week, once daily at a dose of 600 mg, twice daily at a dose of 300 mg, or three times daily at a dose of 200 mg.","In another particular embodiment, the HDAC inhibitor is administered intermittently four days a week, once daily at a dose of 600 mg, twice daily at a dose of 300 mg, or three times daily at a dose of 200 mg.","In another particular embodiment, the HDAC inhibitor is administered intermittently five days a week, once daily at a dose of 600 mg, twice daily at a dose of 300 mg, or three times daily at a dose of 200 mg.","In addition, the HDAC inhibitor may be administered according to any of the schedules described above, consecutively for a few weeks, followed by a rest period. For example, the HDAC inhibitor may be administered according to any one of the schedules described above from two to eight weeks, followed by a rest period of one week, or twice daily at a dose of 300 mg for three to five days a week. In another particular embodiment, the HDAC inhibitor is administered three times daily for two consecutive weeks, followed by one week of rest.","It should be apparent to a person skilled in the art that the various dosages and dosing schedules described herein merely set forth specific embodiments and should not be construed as limiting the broad scope of the invention. Any permutations, variations and combinations of the dosages and dosing schedules are included within the scope of the present invention.","The compositions of the present invention may be formulated in any unit dosage form (liquid or solid) suited for oral administration, for example, in the form of a pellet, a tablet, a coated tablet, a capsule, a gelatin capsule, a solution, a suspension, or a dispersion. In a preferred embodiment, the composition is in the form of a gelatin capsule.","Any inert excipient that is commonly used as a carrier or diluent may be used in the formulations of the present invention, such as for example, a gum, a starch, a sugar, a cellulosic material, an acrylate, or mixtures thereof. A preferred diluent is microcrystalline cellulose. The compositions may further comprise a disintegrating agent (e.g., sodium croscarmellose) and a lubricant (e.g., magnesium stearate), and in addition may comprise one or more additives selected from a binder, a buffer, a protease inhibitor, a surfactant, a solubilizing agent, a plasticizer, an emulsifier, a stabilizing agent, a viscosity increasing agent, a sweetener, a film forming agent, or any combination thereof. Furthermore, the compositions of the present invention may be in the form of controlled release or immediate release formulations.","The present invention further provides a safe, daily dosing regimen of these formulations, which is easy to follow and to adhere to. The formulations of the present invention are useful for selectively inducing terminal differentiation, cell growth arrest and\/or apoptosis of neoplastic cells and therefore aid in treatment of tumors in patients.","The term \u201ctreating\u201d in its various grammatical forms in relation to the present invention refers to preventing, (i.e., chemoprevention ), curing, reversing, attenuating, alleviating, minimizing, suppressing or halting the deleterious effects of a disease state, disease progression, disease causative agent (e.g., bacteria or viruses) or other abnormal condition. For example, treatment may involve alleviating a symptom (i.e., not necessary all symptoms) of a disease or attenuating the progression of a disease. Because some of the inventive methods involve the physical removal of the etiological agent, the artisan will recognize that they are equally effective in situations where the inventive compound is administered prior to, or simultaneous with, exposure to the etiological agent (prophylactic treatment) and situations where the inventive compounds are administered after (even well after) exposure to the etiological agent.","Although the methods of the present invention can be practiced in vitro, it is contemplated that the preferred embodiment for the methods of selectively inducing terminal differentiation, cell growth arrest and\/or apoptosis of neoplastic cells will comprise contacting the cells in vivo, i.e., by administering the compounds to a subject harboring neoplastic cells or tumor cells in need of treatment.","The methods of the present invention may also comprise initially administering to the subject an antitumor agent so as to render the neoplastic cells in the subject resistant to an antitumor agent and subsequently administering an effective amount of any of the compositions of the present invention, effective to selectively induce terminal differentiation, cell growth arrest and\/or apoptosis of such cells, or to treat cancer or provide chemoprevention.","The antitumor agent may be one of numerous chemotherapy agents such as an alkylating agent, an antimetabolite, a hormonal agent, an antibiotic, colchicine, a vinca alkaloid, L-asparaginase, procarbazine, hydroxyurea, mitotane, nitrosoureas or an imidazole carboxamide. Suitable agents are those agents that promote depolarization of tubulin. Preferably the antitumor agent is colchicine or a vinca alkaloid; especially preferred are vinblastine and vincristine. In embodiments where the antitumor agent is vincristine, the cells preferably are treated so that they are resistant to vincristine at a concentration of about 5 mg\/ml. The treating of the cells to render them resistant to an antitumor agent may be effected by contacting the cells with the agent for a period of at least 3 to 5 days. The contacting of the resulting cells with any of the compounds above is performed as described previously. In addition to the above chemotherapy agents, the compounds may also be administered together with radiation therapy.","The method of the present invention is intended for the treatment of human patients with tumors. However, it is also likely that the method would be effective in the treatment of tumors in other mammals. The term tumor is intended to include any cancer caused by the proliferation of neoplastic cells, such as T cell lymphoma, cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, peripheral T-cell lymphomas, head and neck cancers such as squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, lung cancer, acute lymphoid myeloma, leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, bladder melanoma, renal carcinoma, breast carcinoma, prostate carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma or colorectal carcinoma.","The administration of the pharmaceutical compositions can be carried out in unit dosages which may be administered orally once a day, twice a day, three times a day and the like. Currently preferred embodiments are once-daily administration, twice-daily administration, three-times daily administration, either continuously or intermittently.","Histone Deacetylases and Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors","Histone deacetylases (HDACs), as that term is used herein, are enzymes that catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from lysine residues in the amino terminal tails of the nucleosomal core histones. As such, HDACs together with histone acetyl transferases (HATs) regulate the acetylation status of histones. Histone acetylation affects gene expression and inhibitors of HDACs, such as the hydroxamic acid-based hybrid polar compound suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) induce growth arrest, differentiation and\/or apoptosis of transformed cells in vitro and inhibit tumor growth in vivo. HDACs can be divided into three classes based on structural homology. Class I HDACs (HDACs 1, 2, 3 and 8) bear similarity to the yeast RPD3 protein, are located in the nucleus and are found in complexes associated with transcriptional co-repressors. Class II HDACs (HDACs 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9) are similar to the yeast HDA1 protein, and have both nuclear and cytoplasmic subcellular localization. Both Class I and II HDACs are inhibited by hydroxamic acid-based HDAC inhibitors, such as SAHA. Class III HDACs form a structurally distant class of NAD dependent enzymes that are related to the yeast SIR2 proteins and are not inhibited by hydroxamic acid-based HDAC inhibitors.","Histone deacetylase inhibitors or HDAC inhibitors, as that term is used herein are compounds that are capable of inhibiting the deacetylation of histones in vivo, in vitro or both. As such, HDAC inhibitors inhibit the activity of at least one histone deacetylase. As a result of inhibiting the deacetylation of at least one histone, an increase in acetylated histone occurs and accumulation of acetylated histone is a suitable biological marker for assessing the activity of HDAC inhibitors. Therefore, procedures that can assay for the accumulation of acetylated histones can be used to determine the HDAC inhibitory activity of compounds of interest. It is understood that compounds that can inhibit histone deacetylase activity can also bind to other substrates and as such can inhibit other biologically active molecules such as enzymes. It is also to be understood that the compounds of the present invention are capable of inhibiting any of the histone deacetylases set forth above, or any other histone deacetylases.","For example, in patients receiving HDAC inhibitors, the accumulation of acetylated histones in peripheral mononuclear cells as well as in tissue treated with HDAC inhibitors can be determined against a suitable control.","HDAC inhibitory activity of a particular compound can be determined in vitro using, for example, an enzymatic assays which shows inhibition of at least one histone deacetylase. Further, determination of the accumulation of acetylated histones in cells treated with a particular composition can be determinative of the HDAC inhibitory activity of a compound.","Assays for the accumulation of acetylated histones are well known in the literature. See, for example, Marks, P. A. et al., J. Natl Cancer Inst., 92:1210-1215, 2000, Butler, L. M. et al., Cancer Res. 60:5165-5170 (2000), Richon, V. M. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 95:3003-3007, 1998, and Yoshida, M. et al., J. Biol. Chem., 265:17174-17179, 1990.","For example, an enzymatic assay to determine the activity of a histone deacetylase inhibitor compound can be conducted as follows. Briefly, the effect of an HDAC inhibitor compound on affinity purified human epitope-tagged (Flag) HDAC1 can be assayed by incubating the enzyme preparation in the absence of substrate on ice for about 20 minutes with the indicated amount of inhibitor compound. Substrate ([H]acetyl-labelled murine erythroleukemia cell-derived histone) can be added and the sample can be incubated for 20 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. in a total volume of 30 \u03bcL. The reaction can then be stopped and released acetate can be extracted and the amount of radioactivity release determined by scintillation counting. An alternative assay useful for determining the activity of a histone deacetylase inhibitor compound is the \u201cHDAC Fluorescent Activity Assay; Drug Discovery Kit-AK-500\u201d available from BIOMOL\u00ae Research Laboratories, Inc., Plymouth Meeting, Pa.","In vivo studies can be conducted as follows. Animals, for example, mice, can be injected intraperitoneally with an HDAC inhibitor compound. Selected tissues, for example, brain, spleen, liver etc, can be isolated at predetermined times, post administration. Histones can be isolated from tissues essentially as described by Yoshida et al., J. Biol. Chem. 265:17174-17179, 1990. Equal amounts of histones (about 1 \u03bcg) can be electrophoresed on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and can be transferred to Hybond-P filters (available from Amersham). Filters can be blocked with 3% milk and can be probed with a rabbit purified polyclonal anti-acetylated histone H4 antibody (\u03b1Ac-H4) and anti-acetylated histone H3 antibody (\u03b1Ac-H3) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Levels of acetylated histone can be visualized using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:5000) and the SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). As a loading control for the histone protein, parallel gels can be run and stained with Coomassie Blue (CB).","In addition, hydroxamic acid-based HDAC inhibitors have been shown to up regulate the expression of the p21gene. The p21protein is induced within 2 hours of culture with HDAC inhibitors in a variety of transformed cells using standard methods. The induction of the p21gene is associated with accumulation of acetylated histones in the chromatin region of this gene. Induction of p21can therefore be recognized as involved in the G1 cell cycle arrest caused by HDAC inhibitors in transformed cells.","Typically, HDAC inhibitors fall into five general classes: I) hydroxamic acid derivatives; 2) Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs); 3) cyclic tetrapeptides; 4) benzamides; and 5) electrophilic ketones.","Thus, the present invention includes within its broad scope compositions comprising HDAC inhibitors which are 1) hydroxamic acid derivatives; 2) Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs); 3) cyclic tetrapeptides; 4) benzamides; 5) electrophilic ketones; and\/or any other class of compounds capable of inhibiting histone deacetylases, for use in inhibiting histone deacetylase, inducing terminal differentiation, cell growth arrest and\/or apoptosis in neoplastic cells, and\/or inducing differentiation, cell growth arrest and\/or apoptosis of tumor cells in a tumor.","Non-limiting examples of such HDAC inhibitors are set forth below. It is understood that the present invention includes any salts, crystal structures, amorphous structures, hydrates, derivatives, metabolites, stereoisomers, structural isomers, polymorphs and prodrugs of the HDAC inhibitors described herein.\n\n","Preferred hydroxamic acid based HDAC inhibitors are suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), m-carboxycinnamic acid bishydroxamate (CBHA) and pyroxamide. SAHA has been shown to bind directly in the catalytic pocket of the histone deacetylase enzyme. SAHA induces cell cycle arrest, differentiation and\/or apoptosis of transformed cells in culture and inhibits tumor growth in rodents. SAHA is effective at inducing these effects in both solid tumors and hematological cancers. It has been shown that SAHA is effective at inhibiting tumor growth in animals with no toxicity to the animal. The SAHA-induced inhibition of tumor growth is associated with an accumulation of acetylated histones in the tumor. SAHA is effective at inhibiting the development and continued growth of carcinogen-induced (N-methylnitrosourea) mammary tumors in rats. SAHA was administered to the rats in their diet over the 130 days of the study.

After the mixture was thoroughly stirred, the stirrer was turned off, and the mixture was allowed to settle. The mixture was then filtered through a pad of Celite (4,200 g) (the product was filtered to remove the neutral by-product (from attack by aniline on both ends of suberic acid). The filtrate contained the salt of the product, and also the salt of unreacted suberic acid. The mixture was allowed to settle because the filtration was very slow, taking several days.). The filtrate was acidified using 5 L of concentrated hydrochloric acid; the mixture was stirred for one hour, and then allowed to settle overnight. The product was collected by filtration, and washed on the funnel with deionized water (4\u00d75 L). The wet filter cake was placed in a 72 L flask with 44 L of deionized water, the mixture heated to 50\u00b0 C., and the solid isolated by a hot filtration (the desired product was contaminated with suberic acid which is has a much greater solubility in hot water. Several hot triturations were done to remove suberic acid. The product was checked by NMR [DDMSO] to monitor the removal of suberic acid). The hot trituration was repeated with 44 L of water at 50\u00b0 C. The product was again isolated by filtration, and rinsed with 4 L of hot water. It was dried over the weekend in a vacuum oven at 65\u00b0 C. using a Nash pump as the vacuum source (the Nash pump is a liquid ring pump (water) and pulls a vacuum of about 29 inch of mercury. An intermittent argon purge was used to help carry off water); 4,182.8 g of suberanilic acid was obtained.","The product still contained a small amount of suberic acid; therefore the hot trituration was done portionwise at 65\u00b0 C., using about 300 g of product at a time. Each portion was filtered, and rinsed thoroughly with additional hot water (a total of about 6 L). This was repeated to purify the entire batch. This completely removed suberic acid from the product. The solid product was combined in a flask and stirred with 6 L of methanol\/water (1:2), and then isolated by filtration and air dried on the filter over the week end.

The effect is mediated in part by inhibition of histone deacetylase. SAHA is a potent histone deacetylase inhibitor that has been shown to have the ability to induce tumor cell growth arrest, differentiation and apoptosis in the laboratory and in preclinical studies.","Objectives: To define a safe daily oral regimen of SAHA that can be used in Phase II studies. In addition, the pharmacokinetic profile of the oral formulation of SAHA was be evaluated. The oral bioavailability of SAHA in humans in the fasting vs. non-fasting state and anti-tumor effects of treatment were also monitored. Additionally, the biological effects of SAHA on normal tissues and tumor cells were assessed and responses with respect to levels of histone acetylation were documented.","Patients: Patients with histologically documented advanced stage, primary or metastatic adult solid tumors that are refractory to standard therapy or for which no curative standard therapy exists. Patients must have a Karnofsky Performance Status of \u226770%, and adequate hematologic, hepatic and renal function. Patients must be at least four weeks from any prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy or other investigational anticancer drugs.","Dosing Schedule: On the first day, patients were first treated with 200 mg of intravenously-administered SAHA. Starting on the second day, patients were treated with daily doses of oral SAHA according to Table 1. Each cohort received a different dose of SAHA. \u201cQD\u201d indicates dosing once a day; \u201cQ12 hours\u201d indicates dosing twice a day. For example, patients in Cohort IV received two 800 mg doses of SAHA per day. Doses were administered to patients daily and continuously. Blood samples were taken on day one and on day 21 of oral treatment.
