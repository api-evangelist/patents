The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.","This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e) to U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61\/332,011 filed May 6, 2010, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The present invention relates to a system that provides a managed website and a method of providing an enterprise managed employee website that is accessible by external networks such as the internet and that also may function as part of an intranet.","Internet-based systems are available that encourage individuals to network with others. Commonly used social networking systems include Facebook, MySpace, Linked-In, and the like. One problem with all of such systems is that they are controlled by the individual that sets up the account with the social networking service provider. Despite the opportunities afforded by such systems for developing business relationships, many businesses discourage or prohibit accessing social networking sites from company computers. The lack of control over these social networking sites is a serious detriment to their use in business. For example, social networking sites may provide a channel for the disclosure of confidential information. Employment services have been known to use such networking sites to hire away employees. Employees may post damaging content on a networking site that may present a risk to company or brand reputation. Employees do not generally use their social networking site as a reference on business cards or in e-mails due to the lack of professionalism denoted by using such networking sites in connection with business endeavors.","Businesses generally derive no benefit from the use of social networking or business networking sites as they currently exist. There is no practical way to include advertising or a public relations piece on an employee's networking site. There is also no way to use networking sites to track employee communications or to control content of communications sent by employees. Current networking sites do not facilitate development of work groups or teams and do not provide an efficient way to share content directly with other members of a team. Social networking sites also do not allow an employer to access employee networking sites to determine the special skills, expertise, and knowledge of its employees. Networking sites also fail to provide any mechanism for a business or other entity to prohibit objectionable content from being posted on employee websites. In addition, networking sites do not provide an efficient way for a business or other entity to obtain feedback relative to the number of sites visited, the extent of use of the site, or surveying customers as to their experience on visiting a site.","Company websites are generally impersonal in tone and context in that they fail to convey information that emphasizes the talents and contributions made by individuals who are employed by the company. Websites maintained by companies also fail to reflect the specific interests of individuals within the enterprise that may be important to persons searching the company website. For example, if a company is interested in working with another company that has highly skilled engineers who also speak a particular language, there would be no way to learn this information by simply visiting a company's website.","Company websites are expensive to create and maintain. Most companies retain an outside consultant or contractor to develop a website. Websites become out-of-date soon after they are established especially if the websites include specific information relating to employees and specific projects and accomplishments of the organization. Development of websites generally requires extensive programming skills to code the website content. In addition, most currently available websites do not facilitate creation of secure or hidden pages or provide an easy-to-use mechanism for limiting distribution of information contained on selected pages or portions of the website.","Many businesses have intranets that are intended to facilitate communication within an organization that are not normally accessible from outside of an organization. An employee may be able to add content or provide profiles for some intranet systems. However, it is difficult to motivate employees to populate their personnel profiles on the internet. This handicaps the company from providing a knowledge map of an organization that may be used by human resources professionals or management to select employees for a particular assignment or job based upon their experience and accomplishments.","Current intranets do not provide a mechanism for a business or other entity to reward employees who are effective in generating traffic to an enterprise website.","These and other problems and shortcomings associated with prior art social networking systems, websites, and intranets are addressed by the system and method described in the following detailed description.","A system and method for developing websites for members of an organization include configuring and storing organization content using a server computer associated with the organization, configuring and storing member content associated with the members of the organization using the server computer, screening member content based by applying an organization policy stored on the server computer to prohibit specified information from being included in member content, and delivering a web page having the enterprise content arranged with member content in response to a request by a user for viewing a webpage having a URL corresponding to one of the members of the organization. The systems and methods may also include storing a visibility level for specified member content that limits access to the specified member content only to authorized users within the organization, in a specified group, by password, or private to the member and system administrator, for example. Embodiments may also include predefined applications, modules, or widgets that may be selected and positioned by particular members to provide modular customization of the member or associate portion of the member's webpage.","In various embodiments, a website sponsored by an enterprise is disclosed that affords a measure of control over employees' or agents' use of the website to provide a professional content web page. Most, if not all, of the web pages include a designated portion that provides content relating to and\/or controlled by the enterprise.","Another aspect of the disclosure is that the enterprise may exercise control over the content of employee or member web pages posted on the website by applying a policy or filter including rules that prohibit the inclusion of specified information, which may include proprietary information or profanity, for example. The enterprise may establish one or more policies that include rules automatically applied by the web server computer or other web page development computer that prevent the inclusion of profanity, pornography or offensive language on an employee website or webpage. Alternatively, or in combination, member content may be automatically held pending review and approval by an administrator or supervisor before being accessible for viewing by other users.","The modular customization concept embodied in the disclosure facilitates development of a professional website employing any combination of available pre-existing widgets or applications that may function as templates for the website content provided by employees or agents of an enterprise. No coding or formatting is required when selecting, configuring, and placing existing widgets to produce a personalized, yet professional, web page that is fully featured with interesting content. Systems and methods according to the present disclosure provide a convenient way to assemble a personal website that may be developed from proprietary or public domain sources and\/or from internally developed custom widgets.","The system and method disclosed provide a hierarchical management model on which a group administrator manages the website(s) of an organization. For larger organizations, department administrators may be responsible for management of a sub-set of the websites or web pages. If necessary, additional layers of administrators may be added and the management structure can be organized in the manner of an organization chart, for example.","The system and method may also permit monitoring of employee web page content and track visits to all of the enterprise's employees' web pages or websites. Hits may be tracked to determine which employee's web page is effective in generating web traffic to the enterprise with each employee acting as an affiliate of the enterprise. The system and method may also monitor the extent of web page usage and gather user feedback by providing surveys or questionnaires.","Another feature of various embodiments of the present disclosure is that a composite of the employee web pages may function as part of an intranet based on a visibility parameter that limits access or display of specified web pages to authorized users within the organization. Employee web pages may be selectively shared among employees to foster team work by allowing page content to be shared or jointly developed among work groups or departments, for example. The web pages have content about individual users that can be used for the purpose of knowledge mapping by others, with access being controlled or specified by the company and\/or group administrator. As used herein the term \u201cknowledge mapping\u201d refers to assessing the strengths and weaknesses of a business or other entity in knowledge terms and matching people and jobs accordingly.","Systems and methods according to the present disclosure foster development of a personalized company website that is continually updated with information about employees. The talents and contributions of individuals within the enterprise may be more easily featured and promoted. Visitors to the website can learn about the backgrounds, special skills, and achievements of employees.","Another aspect of the disclosure is that web pages or portions thereof may be inaccessible or hidden from others, whether inside or outside of the enterprise or organization based on a corresponding visibility level associated with specified employee or member content. For example, financial reports may be developed and shared jointly by authorized personnel in the accounting department, but hidden from other employees using a corresponding visibility parameter, flag, etc. When the financial reports are completed on a web page, they may be first made available to management for approval and then released publicly. This approach facilitates teamwork while maintaining control over sensitive information.","One of ordinary skill in the art to which this disclosure is directed will readily appreciate many other applications and advantages that may be obtained by various embodiments of a system or method according to the disclosure.","Referring to , an enterprise-managed website system is generally identified by reference numeral . System  will be described initially with reference to  that follows the steps that may be typically used to initiate the use of the system by one enterprise for one associate to prepare a representative web page as shown in . The functional elements of system  are described in greater detail below with reference to the diagram of .","Referring to , the enterprise initially subscribes to a managed website plan . As used herein, the term \u201centerprise\u201d \u201ccompany\u201d, \u201corganization\u201d and the like should be understood to include businesses, agencies, charities, schools, government agencies, or the like. When an enterprise subscribes to a plan at , the enterprise establishes an account. Various pages are available to the company administrator to configure the enterprise account and provide status information for the company  and the administrator , such as information relating to an overview of the account as shown by the \u201cOverview\u201d tab  selected within the user interface  depicted in .","Various overview and\/or status information for the account may be displayed as shown in . For example, the representative overview illustrated includes the plan details , such as the number of active users (14) currently authorized, the number of users available to be authorized (115) with the current plan, and the plan billing mode (monthly) and date (21). Plan information may be edited or managed by clicking on the associated \u201cmanage\u201d button. The number of company \u201cFollowers\u201d or subscribers (74,670), which may receive notifications when the company website is updated, for example, is displayed in a different color or grayed-out (as represented by dashed lines) at  and cannot currently be managed from the illustrated view. Company page views and related history is displayed at  with additional tracking statistics available by clicking the associated \u201cMore\u201d button. Similar information is available for the user\/administrator , such as account information  that may include the account status (Active) and current visibility setting (Public), which may be changed by selecting the corresponding \u201cManage\u201d button. Associate follower information is displayed at  with associate web page view statistics and history displayed at . Other administrator functions may be accessed by selecting corresponding tabs or links. For example, the representative interface  includes tabs to access functions to configure\/edit data associated with the Company , Departments , Associates , Content , and Statistics . Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the administrator utilities, tools, or functions illustrated and described, as well as the particular user interface used to access the functions, may vary depending upon the particular application and implementation and is generally independent of the invention as claimed.","The administrator may optionally assign one or more group\/department administrators using interface  and selecting the \u201cDepartments\u201d tab  such as shown in . The group administrator also provides company information or metadata to permit indexing the site established for the enterprise and provides the information to the website host server computer  for use by the website host search engine during knowledge mapping or other searching as described in greater detail herein. The group administrator may use a computer, such as a personal computer, to interact with the website host via an internal local area network (LAN) and\/or an internal or external wide area network (WAN) such as the internet, for example. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the website host server computer(s) generally represented at  may be controlled by the organization, a third-party web hosting service, or a combination thereof without departing from the spirit or scope of the claims of this disclosure. In various embodiments, systems or methods of managed website development and deployment according to the present disclosure are implemented according to the SaaS (software as a service) model so that the website host , including related hardware and software are owned and licensed by a third-party provider relative to the enterprise or organization. However, the implementation may vary depending on the particular application.","The representative user interface for the \u201cDepartments\u201d tab  includes various tools to add a department or group and specify its status and visibility as represented at . A listing of current departments  identifies a department administrator , status , visibility , and provides icons or buttons  to edit or delete a previously created department. As described in greater detail herein, a visibility level, generally indicated at  may be specified for designated content associate content corresponding to a department or group. The visibility level may include a number of settings depending on the particular implementation such as the private (internal to the enterprise) and public (available to internal and external users) settings shown in . Additional visibility levels may be provided to provide more granularity in controlling access to designated web pages. For example, in one embodiment, five (5) visibility levels are provided to limit or restrict access to particular associate content to authorized users: public (available to all internal and external users), internal (available to anyone within the enterprise), department\/group (available to anyone associated with a specified group), password-protected (available to anyone with the proper password, and private (available only to the user\/associate that created the content). Of course, the number of visibility levels and access definitions may vary by application.","Referring again to , a number of licensed seats associated with the subscription plan is assigned to the enterprise as represented by block . The number of seats may then be divided among members, associates, or users of the enterprise and may include one or more departments as determined by the group administrator during configuration as previously described. Depending upon the size and structure of an enterprise, one or more secondary group administrators or department administrators may be designated as being responsible for managing seats assigned to a corresponding functional group or department within the enterprise, i.e. payroll, accounting & finance, sales & marketing, engineering, etc. depending on the particular needs or desires of the enterprise.","The group administrator (or another designated user or users) configures and stores the enterprise or company content associated with the enterprise as indicated at block  for subsequent display on associate web pages as described herein. The administrator may also select various enterprise applications or widgets to include in a widget library that may be used by organization associates (members or employees) to customize the enterprise and\/or associate content that appears on an associate's website using a corresponding user interface such as the representative user interface illustrated in , for example. As previously described, company tab  may be used to access the user interface and associated tools to configure and store the company or enterprise content displayed on each associate's webpage. The user interface includes a display area  for identifying an image or graphic file which is uploaded and displayed in box . The image\/graphic file may be used to display a company logo, slogan, tagline, etc. Tools or buttons for selecting the image or graphic file  and uploading the file  may also be provided. Company or enterprise content may also include a color scheme for consistent display or branding of the various borders, backgrounds, etc. In the representative embodiment illustrated in , the administrator may select a company accent color  and background color  for the company\/enterprise content portion of the web page development system. In addition, company links may be associated with the content as represented generally at , which may include links to associate directories, the website host, and\/or links to external third-party sites that may be accessed through the enterprise portion of the web page. The link title and corresponding URL may be specified as generally indicated at .","As also shown in , the administrator can specify a content policy that includes rules that may be automatically applied to screen content submitted by individual associates that prohibit or prevent display of specified information as generally represented by the default controls and filters at block . Default controls and filters may include setting up a language filter that will ensure that profanity or designated proprietary or confidential words, codenames, phrases, etc. are filtered out or removed from any content available on any web pages generated by associates of the company. Alternatively, or in combination, the screening process implemented by the policy may include a manual review and approval by an administrator or department manager. For example, content of an associate web page may be automatically screened for designated words or phrases, and if found, forwarded for review by an administrator. If the submitted content is not flagged by the policy, then the content may be published for display to authorized users based on an associated visibility level as previously described. The content policy implemented by the default controls may also designate which widgets may be used by all of the users of the managed website development and deployment system and which widgets may be used only by selected users based on a user ID and\/or password, department\/group affiliation, or other similar parameter. As used herein, the term \u201cwidgets\u201d is understood to mean applications or pre-programmed templates or modules that include code, scripts, and\/or software to provide a modular display area with any associated controls (such as buttons, media players, drop-down lists, input boxes, etc.) that may be selected and positioned on an associate's personal web pages. The widgets facilitate personal web page customization by the associates as a modular \u201cdrag and drop\u201d component without requiring any knowledge of coding, programming, or scripting languages. Content may be added to a widget (such as a survey widget, for example) to further customize the web page depending on the particular implementation. Where content may be added, the enterprise policy should be applied to the widget content as well as surrounding content of an associate's web page.","The administrator may log into the system to manage the enterprise account and may create, delete or modify licensed seat assignments for corresponding associates using the representative user interface illustrated in . The associate functions may be accessed via \u201cAssociate\u201d tab . The administrator may add an associate as represented at  and provide identifying information as generally indicated at . The information may include username or login, first\/last name, title, role or job function, email address, status, group\/department, and password, for example. A listing of currently assigned associates for a particular department or the entire organization is requested using a drop-down menu as indicated at  with corresponding designated data fields displayed as indicated at . The administrator may modify management rules applying to the system. The administrator may also designate statistics that may be monitored regarding web traffic generated by the enterprise through the system or by specific associates or departments.","As previously described, the group or enterprise administrator has access to various tools allowing management of the system configuration and enterprise content and enterprise policy. References to \u201ctools\u201d should be understood to refer to software or code that may be used to control certain aspects and features of the system. For example, a tool may simply comprise a control or switch that enables or disables a specific feature of function. The administrator may alter or block any content created on the system within the enterprise account. The administrator may edit, delete or add text, images or links that may be included as part of the content of the web pages developed and deployed or published using the system. For example, the administrator may block or permit links to any internal or external web-based utility.","Referring to , an example of a company administration page is shown that lists the available widgets  and permits an administrator to enable or disable one or more widgets for an associate or group of associates as represented at . The group administrator may, in this way, specify which widgets may be used with the approval of the enterprise on the web pages developed by the associates and deployed by the system. As generally illustrated in , each widget  in the widget library may include a name, a brief description  and one or more visibility parameters  to enable or disable display of a particular widget for selection by an associate during development or modification of the associate's website. Various other tools (not specifically illustrated) may be used to manage widget availability, such as a drop-down menu or list of available departments, for example, depending on the particular application and implementation. The administrator may also be provided with tools that permit monitoring of associates' activities, such as log-in status and identification of all widgets displayed on an associate's web page, for example.","The administrator may also determine what statistics should be collected or displayed relative to an associate's website using the representative user interface illustrated in . Such controls may also be modified to monitor web traffic through all or a designated group of the web pages developed by the associates of the enterprise. In the representative user interface of  accessed via the \u201cStatistics\u201d tab , statistics corresponding to total page views , average page views per day , unique visitors , and average unique visitors per day  are tracked and displayed. In addition, various statistics may be displayed in a graphical format as generally indicated at , such as widget views, profile views, and current page views over a specified period of time, such as six (6) days in the illustrated example. Of course, the statistics tracked and displayed as well as the type of graphical display may vary depending on the particular application and implementation.","Management responsibilities and tools available to the administrator may also be delegated to department administrators as previously described. Department administrators may be provided with authorizations and tools that are limited to the department to which they have been assigned by the enterprise administrator. When the department administrators are logged into the system, they may be enabled to designate or revoke department administrator designations or end user designations. Department administrators may also control widget usage permissions. For example, a department administrator may determine what widgets or applications may be used by associates within a given department. The department administrators also may edit the enterprise portion of the associate web pages that are visible on all of the web pages generated by associates within a particular department. The department administrator may also edit, delete or add any text, media or link to content that is external to the system. Statistics may be collected relating to web traffic for an entire department or for one or more associates. The department administrator may be also permitted to view usage of the system by each user within the department.","Referring again to , after configuring and storing various enterprise information, content, and settings on website host , a welcome kit may be provided or downloaded at  for each associate as authorized by the enterprise or department administrator. The associate may download the welcome kit by selecting a download option on the user computer's graphical user interface.

Upon receiving the welcome kit at  on the associate's personal computer, the associate may then begin to select application pages for the personalized web page at . Components or functional blocks of a representative associate or member web page delivered by website host computer(s)  to an authorized user based on one or more associated visibility levels is illustrated in .","As previously described, associates are provided with tools to facilitate development and customization of content for one or more personal web pages. The representative associate or personal web page  illustrated in  includes an associate menu bar  with various tabs that may be customized by the associate for easier navigation among multiple web pages that together form the associate's personal web site. Alternatively, or in combination, the associate menu bar may be specified by the enterprise to provide a consistent look and feel for all associate web sites and to encourage population of particular recommended content. For example, some menu tabs may be required with others optionally added by the associate depending on the particular implementation.","The associate may populate an associate content area or region of the web page as generally indicated at , with enterprise or company content  determined as previously described. Associates may not modify the company content , which may include company selected widgets , a company logo , and company links , for example, as well as the company color scheme as previously described. Website host  () may also provide tools or navigational aids  for accessing the website development and management system from a \u201clive\u201d webpage.","Associate content may be provided via one or more widgets ,  selected from a library of widgets available to a particular associate based on a corresponding visibility level as previously illustrated and described with reference to . The associate is permitted to select and position any widget that is not disabled by the enterprise or department administrator. The associate may add widgets from the widget tray or library to populate the associate's portion  of the page that is shown in conjunction with the company portion  of the page. An associate may also remove widgets ,  if they no longer wish to use the widget. Widgets may also be edited by accessing the widgets within the associate's options menu. Widgets may be added to an associate's page by clicking on an \u201cAdd\u201d button in the content browser. After a widget is added it may be moved by simply dragging and dropping the widget from the widget table or grid and moving it to the associate's portion  of the web page, which may be saved with all content and settings being saved to the web site host computer(s) . Widgets may be shared among associates with their added content and settings that will permit the widgets to be dynamically updated so that multiple members of a team may work with the widgets including content and settings as previously defined.","Referring again to , the associate may complete web page templates with personalized information as represented at . Some personal information may be automatically populated, such as the associate's name and position . Various associate links, tools, or navigational aids may also be provided, such as the \u201cShare\u201d and\/or \u201cFollow Me\u201d buttons .","A number of widgets may be provided for use by associates.
