No. 60\/739,528 filed Nov. 23, 2005 and Ser. No. 60\/764,128 filed Feb. 1, 2006, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","This work was supported by National Science Foundation grant DMR-0221993 thus the U.S. government may have certain rights in the invention.","The present application relates generally to the fields of chemistry, optoelectronics, silicon-germanium alloys, semiconductor structures, and related methods and devices.","Heteroepitaxial GeSilayers on Si(100) with high Ge contents are of interest due to many applications in key technologies such as solar cells, MEMS, quantum cascade lasers and Si-based photonicsincluding high speed modulators and photodetectors.However, these materials are much less developed in spite of this high impact potential in IR optical devices. In addition, they serve as virtual substrates for growth of high mobility, strained Si and Ge device channels, and are also considered as a potential pathway to monolithic integration of III-V based devices with Si technologies.The best current route to these materials is complicated and fraught with difficulties, requiring both high temperature growth of thick (>10 \u03bcm) compositionally graded films and a chemical-mechanical planarization step to relieve the misfit strain between the GeSiepilayer and Si substrate and produce a flat surface, respectively.","To circumvent these difficulties we have recently developed new chemical vapor deposition (CVD) heteroepitaxy to produce device quality strain-relieved Ge-rich films on Si without the need for graded compositions.Our strategy involves depositions of single source hydride precursors with direct Si\u2014Ge bonds such as the (HGe)SiH(x=1-4) family of compounds. These are routinely synthesized with semiconductor grade purity via straightforward methodologies utilizing commercially available starting materials.Their physical and chemical properties such as high volatility and facile reactivity make them particularly useful as reagents in low temperature film growth by CVD and gas source molecular beam epitaxy (GSMBE). Our initial growth experiments have yielded single crystal films with compositions SiGe, SiGe, SiGeand SiGe, precisely matching those of the corresponding precursors SiHGeH, (HGe)SiH, (HGe)SiH and (HGe)Si.Our results demonstrate that exact control of the composition, structure and strain at the atomic level can be achieved via incorporation of the entire Si\u2014Ge framework of the precursors into the film. The resulting films are of much higher quality than those previously reported using conventional sources and grow at much lower temperatures that are compatible with CMOS technology.","Within this compositional range the SiGesemiconductor system is of particular importance because it possesses the ideal lattice dimensions to integrate fully strained Si channels exhibiting high electron mobilities into metal oxide silicon field effect transistors (MOSFETS). Thus these materials are ideally suited for immediate technological applications in high-speed devices. However, in our experiments we have observed that stoichiometric SiGe, with the required device quality properties (surface planarity, low defect densities), can only be grown near a maximum temperature of \u02dc450\u00b0 C. at a growth rate of only 0.2 nm\/min which is too low to be practical for high throughput device fabrication. Negligible film growth was observed at lower temperatures via HGeSiH, while films with rough surfaces and high dislocation densities were obtained above \u02dc500\u00b0 C. due to the thermal mismatch with the substrate.","The synthesis of new compounds with increased reactivities and improved properties for device fabrication relative to HGeSiHwould be of great value in the art.","In this study we synthesize and fully characterize the butane-like (GeH)(SiH)(1) compound containing highly reactive \u2014HSi\u2014SiH\u2014 functionalities (rather than SiH). The HSi\u2550SiHdimeric unit has been identified as the dominant reactive intermediate in high temperature CVD via decomposition of conventional Si-hydrides. These species lead to highly efficient growth of homoepitaxial Si.Precursor (1) is specifically designed to incorporate these necessary \u2014HSi\u2014SiH\u2014 building blocks and provide a new low temperature route for development of a broad range of Si-containing materials. Here we demonstrate the utility of (1) to produce device quality SiGealloys at unprecedented low temperatures of 350\u00b0 C. A 10-fold improvement in the growth rate (\u02dc2.0 nm\/min) is achieved at 350\u00b0 C. relative to growth (0.2 nm\/minute) at 450\u00b0 C. via SiHGeHleading to uniformly stressed or strain-relaxed thin films directly on Si with planar surfaces and remarkably reduced dislocation densities. En route to (1) we have produced the isobutane analog (GeH)SiH(SiH) (2) and have also isolated and fully characterized the Ge-rich derivative (GeH)(SiHGeH) (3). The latter is a moderately volatile liquid, with potential applications in low temperature synthesis of Ge-rich optoelectronic alloys.","In one aspect, the present invention provides compounds comprising a silicon-germanium hydride of formula I:\n\n(SiH)(GeH),\n","wherein x is 2, 3 or 4;","wherein y is 1, 2, or 3;","wherein x+y is 3, 4, or 5;","wherein n1 is independently 0, 1, 2, or 3 for each Si atom in the compound, to satisfy valency; and","wherein n2 is independently 0, 1, 2, or 3 for each Ge atom in the compound, to satisfy valency;","with the proviso that n2 is not 0 when y is 1;","with the further proviso that when x is 3 and y is 1, then n2 is 2 or 3; and","with the further proviso that when x is 2 and y is 1, then n2 is 3.","In a second aspect, the present invention provides semiconductor structures, comprising a substrate and an Si\u2014Ge layer formed by introducing near the surface of a substrate a gaseous precursor comprising one or more compounds according to formula I.","In further aspect, the invention provides semiconductor structures, comprising a substrate and an Si\u2014Ge layer comprising a backbone of one or more compounds according to formula I.","In a third aspect, the present invention provides methods for synthesizing one or more silicon-germanium hydrides of formula I, comprising combining a compound selected from the group consisting of a nonafluorobutane-sulfonic substituted disilane and a triflate substituted disilane, with a compound comprising a GeHligand under conditions whereby the silicon-germanium hydride is formed.","In a fourth aspect, the present invention provides methods for depositing a Si\u2014Ge material on a substrate in a reaction chamber, comprising introducing into the chamber a gaseous precursor comprising one or more compounds according to formula I, under conditions whereby a layer comprising a Si\u2014Ge material is formed on the substrate.","In a fifth aspect, the present invention provides methods for depositing an epitaxial Si\u2014Ge layer on a substrate, comprising introducing at or near a surface of the substrate a gaseous precursor comprising one or more compounds of formula I, and dehydrogenating the precursor under conditions whereby epitaxial Si\u2014Ge is formed on the substrate.","In a sixth aspect, the present invention provides a compound comprising (SOCF)(SiH).","In a seventh aspect, the present invention provides methods for synthesizing (SOCF)(SiH)comprising combining (p-tolyl)(SiH)and HSOCFunder conditions whereby the (SOCF)(SiH)is formed.","All publications, patents and patent applications cited herein are hereby expressly incorporated by reference for all purposes.","As used herein, the singular forms \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.","In one aspect, the present invention provides compounds comprising or consisting of a silicon-germanium hydride of formula I:\n\n(SiH)(GeH),\n","wherein x is 2, 3 or 4;","wherein y is 1, 2, or 3;","wherein x+y is 3, 4, or 5;","wherein n1 is independently 0, 1, 2, or 3 for each Si atom in the compound, to satisfy valency; and","wherein n2 is independently 0, 1, 2, or 3 for each Ge atom in the compound, to satisfy valency;","with the proviso that n2 is not 0 when y is 1;","with the further proviso that when x is 3 and y is 1, then n2 is 2 or 3; and","with the further proviso that when x is 2 and y is 1, then n2 is 3.","As used herein, the phrase \u201cto satisfy valency\u201d means to maintain tetra-valency of each Si and Ge atom in the compounds of the invention.","As demonstrated herein, compounds according to formula I can be used, for example, in controlled depositions to produce stoichiometric SiGe films possessing desired properties for semiconductor applications including perfectly crystalline and epitaxial microstructures, smooth morphologies, and uniformly strain-relaxed states.

Incorporation of Sn can yield materials with novel optical properties such as direct emission and absorption leading to the formation of Si-based lasers and high sensitivity infrared photodetectors.","In further aspect, the invention provides semiconductor structures, comprising a substrate and an Si\u2014Ge layer comprising or consisting of a backbone of one or more compounds according to the formula I. Preferred embodiments are as described above.","In a further aspect, the invention provides a composition, comprising one or more compounds according to formula I in an inert gas. Such inert gases include, but are not limited to H, He, N, and argon. Preferred embodiments are as described above.","By using the compounds of formula I as precursors for preparing semiconductor substrates, the semiconductor substrate will comprise an Si\u2014Ge layer comprising or consisting of a backbone of the compounds of the invention. By using the compounds of the invention, as opposed to the separate use of Si and Ge sources for deposition, the resulting Si\u2014Ge layer comprises highly defined and uniform bonding arrangements and strain compensated Si\u2014Ge atomic patterns, as opposed to the random nature of prior Si\u2014Ge films in which the Si and Ge atoms can exist as an intimate mixture of several (or multi) atom Si and Ge clusters leading to inhomogeneous bonding and locally stressed configurations. In mismatched heteroepitaxy applications these materials exhibit copious dislocations (at levels unacceptable for most device applications), strain non-uniformities and high surface roughness. A distinct and important advantage of our compounds, films, and methods over conventional ones is that the incorporation of the entire Si\u2014Ge molecular core promotes the formation of exceptionally uniform bonding arrangements over the entire crystal, leading to relaxed (or uniformly stressed) films with planar surface morphology (no surface ripples). A crucial advantage is the unprecedented low growth temperatures which reduce surface mobility of the Si and Ge atoms and prevent mass segregation thereby resulting in highly uniform compositional and strain profiles at the atomic level.","The intact incorporation of the massive Si\/Ge cores into the film also leads to low surface diffusion and high sticking coefficients compared to the conventional low mass compounds. The high reactivity permits promotes high growth rates which increase systematically with the mass of the precursors","Furthermore, the incorporation of the entire Si\/Ge framework of the gaseous precursor into the lattice is particularly important in the formations of SiGe nanoscale systems (quantum dots and wires) because it allows precise control of morphology, tunable composition, and structure that cannot be accomplished by vapor deposition of separate silanes and germanes, or by molecular beam epitaxy of solid Si and Ge sources. The precise control of composition and corresponding morphology, both of which ultimately determine the physical properties of these nanoscale materials is a crucial issue. Any compositional variations that exist within and among individual nanostructures will have a significant impact on the optical and electronic properties and on the performance of devices. In the MBE case an average concentration is assigned on the basis of the flux ratio utilized to grow the materials. In the CVD approach the local stoichiometry on the scale of the nanostructure size is even less certain because reactions of various molecular sources cannot be simultaneously controlled at every site throughout the sample. Thus neither technique can guarantee systematic growth of Si\u2014Ge nanoscale structures with controllable composition, strain and size.","Such highly defined patterns can be determined using standard methods in the art, such as neutron diffraction","An example of an Si\u2014Ge layer comprising a backbone of the compounds of the invention can be found in , which shows an exemplary sequence of macromolecular, polymeric units of the invention, based on interconnected (GeH)(SiH)monomers (a-d), en route to a diamond cubic Si\u2014Ge lattice with concentration GeSi(SiGe) (e).

The compositional, vibrational, structural and thermochemical properties of these compounds were studied by FTIR, multinuclear NMR, mass spectrometry, Rutherford backscattering, and density functional theory (DFT) simulations. The analyses indicate that the linear (GeH)(SiH)(1) and (GeH)(SiHGeH) (3) compounds exist as a mixture of the classic normal and gauche conformational isomers which do not seem to interconvert at 22\u00b0 C. The conformational proportions in the samples were determined using a new fitting procedure, which combines calculated molecular spectra to reproduce those observed by varying the global intensity, frequency scale and admixture coefficients of the individual conformers. The (GeH)(SiH)(1) species was then utilized to fabricate SiGesemiconductor alloys reflecting exactly the Si\/Ge content of the precursor.

The starting materials (4) and (5) were prepared via reactions of the corresponding sulfonic acids HSOCFand HSOCFwith 1,2-(p-tolyl)(SiH)(Eq 3 and 4, respectively).\n\n(SOCF)(SiH)+2KGeH\u2192(HGe)(SiH)+2K SOCF\u2003\u2003(1)\n\n(SOCF)(SiH)+2KGeH\u2192(HGe)(SiH)+2KSOCF\u2003\u2003(2)\n\n(p-tolyl)(SiH)+2HSOCF\u2192(SOCF)(SiH)+2(toluene)\u2003\u2003(3)\n\n(p-tolyl)(SiH)+2HSOCF\u2192(SOCF)(SiH)+2(toluene)\u2003\u2003(4)\n\nThe route described by (Eq 1) consistently produces pure, single-phase (HGe)(SiH)(1) as a colorless, pyrophoric liquid. Here the replacement of\u2014SOCFby GeHoccurs exclusively at the 1,2-substitution sites of (SOCF)(SiH)(4), as expected. However, the route described by (Eq 2) yields a mixture of products () including (GeH)(SiH)(1), the isobutane analog (GeH)SiH(SiH) (2), and the Ge-rich derivative (GeH)(SiHGeH) (3) depending on reaction conditions. Specifically, low temperature (T<\u221210\u00b0 C.) reactions of (SOCF)(SiH)(5) with KGeH(Eq 2) afforded predominately (1) and impurity levels of (3). These species are separated by distillation and the minor low volatility fraction (vapor pressure of \u02dc1 Torr at 22\u00b0 C.) was characterized by a variety of spectroscopic methods as the Ge-rich derivative (3) possessing a heteronuclear HSi\u2014GeHcore (). In contrast to the low temperature pathways, the reaction of (SOCF)(SiH)(5) with KGeHat T\u226722\u00b0 C. yields predominately combinations of the positional isomers (1) and (2) in varying proportions (a small amount of (3) is also produced but this is readily separated form the bulk via fractional distillation from the (1) and (2) mixture). In this case the replacement of SOCFby GeHinitially occurs at the 1-substitution site of (SOCF)(SiH)(5) as expected. The second replacement likely produces germyl disilane, SiHSiHGeH, and a stable germylene intermediate (GeH) rather than the 1,2-digermyldisilane, (HGe)(SiH)(1). Insertion of GeHinto SiHSiHGeHthen may yield (GeH)SiH(SiH) (3) as shown in Eq 6.

Its (p-tolyl)(SiH)starting materials has been produced via coupling reactions of (p-tolyl)SiHCl with powdered lithium.In the present work we adopt a more convenient, analogous approach using readily available sodium fragments as the coupling agent. Compound (5) is obtained as a highly reactive liquid, which is difficult to fully handle and purify. Consequently its reactions with KGeHare complex and produce mixtures of products as described above. In contrast the newly prepared compound (4) is readily crystallized as a robust molecular solid that is completely isolated from the reaction byproducts and other contaminants, thereby leading to high purity (HGe)(SiH)in subsequent steps according to (Eq 1). The compositional, vibrational and structural properties of the newly synthesized compounds (1), (2), (3) and (4) are presented below.","(HGe)(SiH)(1): The (HGe)(SiH)(1) species is prepared as described by the reactions depicted in (Eq 1,2) and was isolated and purified by fractional distillation (vapor pressure of \u02dc8-10 Torr at 22\u00b0 C.). The FTIR, Si NMR (proton-coupled) and mass spectra indicate a 1,2-digermyldisilane with a butane-like structure as shown in . The IR spectrum shows the Si\u2014H and Ge\u2014H stretching modes at 2147 and 2073 cm, respectively, and a set of absorption bands between 910 and 442 cmcorresponding to the bending modes of the molecule. These assignments are consistent with those made previously for the (HGe)SiH(x=1-4) family of silyl germanes.A more detailed interpretation of the full IR spectrum is obtained from quantum chemical calculations and the data show fixed combinations between the butane-like normal and gauche conformers of (1) (see section below for details). The H NMR spectra reveals a quartet at 3.29 ppm and a triplet at 3.11 ppm corresponding to the Si\u2014H and Ge\u2014H protons, respectively, which is consistent with a HGe\u2014SiH\u2014SiH\u2014GeHmolecular structure. This structure is further confirmed with 2D H COSY and H\u2014Si HMQC NMR experiments. The 2D H COSY spectrum showed cross-peaks that correlate to Si\u2014H and Ge\u2014H resonances at 3.29 and 3.11 ppm, respectively, indicating the H\u2014Si\u2014Ge\u2014H connectivity. A proton-decoupled H\u2014Si HMQC spectrum showed that the H atoms at 3.29 ppm are directly attached to Si atoms at \u2212105 ppm. The mass spectra revealed an isotopic envelope at 210-196 amu as the highest mass peak corresponding to the parent ion, (SiGeH). The associated fragmentation pattern is consistent with the proposed structure. The existence of (1) was further corroborated by Rutherford backscattering (RBS) analysis of monocrystalline films produced by single source MBE depositions of the compound at 350\u00b0 C. (Eq 8). The Si\/Ge elemental content of the films was consistently 1:1 reflecting precisely the composition of the SiGecore of the molecule.\n\n(HGe)(SiH)(gas)\u21922SiGe(film)+5H(gas)\u2003\u2003(8)\n","(GeH)SiH(SiH) (2): The isobutane-like structure of (2) was determined by Si and H NMR studies. The proton NMR resonances are present as a multiplet centered at 3.049 ppm due to \u2014SiH, and two doublets centered at 3.213 and 3.404 ppm corresponding to the (\u2014GeH)and \u2014SiHprotons, respectively. The integrated peak intensity ratios of the \u2014SiH, (\u2014GeH)and \u2014SiHare 1:6:3, respectively, as expected. The peak intensities, the coupling patterns and the position of the peaks in the spectrum, collectively point to the isobutane-like structure in which an Si center is terahedrally bonded to two GeHgroups one SiHgroup and an single H atom. This structure is further confirmed by 2D H COSY and H\u2014Si HMQC NMR measurements. The 2D H COSY spectrum showed cross-peaks that correlate to the central SiH, and terminal GeHand SiHresonances at 3.049, 3.213 and 3.404 ppm, respectively, indicating a HSi\u2014SiH-(GeH)connectivity, which is consistent with the proposed isobutane structure. A proton-decoupled H\u2014Si HMQC spectrum showed that the H atoms at 3.049 and 3.404 ppm are directly bonded to Si atoms at \u2212121 and \u221293 ppm, respectively. The Si chemical shift (\u2212121 ppm, in CD) due to the central Si atom in this molecule is similar to those found for SiH(GeH)(\u2212113 ppm in CDCl) and Si(GeH)(\u2212128 ppm, in CDCl). A close correspondence is also found between the Si chemical shift (\u221293 ppm) due to the terminal Si atom and those of the terminal SiHgroups (\u221292 ppm) for HSiGeH.","Gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry experiments (GCMS) of samples containing (1) (HGe)(SiH)and (GeH)SiH(SiH) (2) indicated the presence of two major fractions that displayed slightly different retention times in the GC column, which is consistent with a mixture of (1) and (2) possessing slightly different boiling points. Furthermore, these fractions displayed essentially identical mass spectra. The highest mass peak is observed in the 210-196 amu range corresponding to the (SiGeH) parent ions of (1) and (2). Samples of the mixture were further characterized using IR spectroscopy. The spectra are essentially a simple admixture of the individual (1) and (2) components. The spectrum of (2) was theoretically determined since the compound could not be completely separated in pure form from (1) via our distillation method due to the similarity in their boiling points. The contributions of the each compound in the experimental IR spectra were then determined using a fitting procedure involving both the observed and the calculated spectra.","(GeH)(SiHGeH) (3): Compound (3) is a byproduct of the reaction described by Eq 2. Its gas-phase IR spectrum shows the Si\u2014H and Ge\u2014H stretching bands centered at 2145 and 2073 cm, respectively. The intensity of the Ge\u2014H peak in the spectrum is significantly stronger than the Si\u2014H due to the greater number of Ge\u2014H bonds relative to Si\u2014H bonds. The H NMR spectra showed a set of two sextets at 3.30 and 3.03 ppm ensconcing two triplets at 3.23, 3.13 ppm. The integrated peak intensity ratios of the sextet-triplet-triplet-sextet sequence are 2:3:3:2. The integrated intensities the coupling patterns and the position of the peaks in the NMR spectrum collectively point to a HGe\u2014SiH\u2014GeH\u2014GeHmolecular structure in which a central SiHGeHcore is bonded with two terminal GeHmoieties. In particular, the sextets at 3.30 and 3.03 ppm can be associated, respectively, with the SiHand GeHprotons of the central \u2014SiHGeH\u2014 while the triplets at 3.23, 3.13 ppm correspond to terminal GeH3 protons. The SiHand GeHNMR frequencies in this case correlate well with those in the previously reported (HGe)SiHand GeHGeHSiHcompounds.The assignment of the sextet at 3.30 ppm to the SiHprotons was further corroborated by a H\u2014Si HMQC NMR spectrum, which indicates a direct coupling to a single Si resonance found at \u221298.2 ppm. In addition, a 2D H COSY NMR spectrum was used to unequivocally establish the specific ordering of the Ge\u2014Si\u2014Ge\u2014Ge backbone constituents. Cross-peaks correlate an Si\u2014H and three Ge\u2014H resonances at 3.30, 3.23, 3.13 and 3.03 ppm. These correspond, respectively, to SiH, GeH(terminal) connected to GeH, Ge\u2014H(terminal) connected to SiH, and GeH. The mass spectra showed an isotopic envelope at 256-238 amu as the highest mass peak corresponding to the parent ion, (SiGeH) and a fragmentation pattern consistent with the molecular structure.","(CFSO)(SiH)(4): Compound (4) is isolated at 95% yield as a colorless, pyrophoric solid with a melting point of 68\u00b0 C. It is readily soluble in ethers, CHCl, CHCland slightly soluble in toluene. The H NMR spectrum showed a singlet centered at 5.08 ppm (\u03b4 Si\u2014H) due to SiHand Si satellite peaks. These exhibit a triplet of triplets with a 1-bond Si\u2014H coupling of 272 Hz and a H\u2014H 3-bond coupling of 3.6 Hz. This indicates the presence of a second SiHgroup consistent with the \u2014SiHSiH-core. Furthermore, a proton decoupled H\u2014Si HMQC showed that the proton resonance at 5.08 ppm is directly attached to a Si atom at \u221230.1 ppm. These values are consistent with those observed for the triflate analog (SOCF)(SiH)(5).Compound (4) was further characterized by FTIR, mass spectrometry and C, H, F elemental analysis and the data are fully consistent with the proposed structure (see experimental section).","Ab Initio Simulations of Molecular Properties","Structural and thermochemical properties: In order to corroborate the identification of the (GeH)(SiH), (GeH)SiH(SiH) and (GeH)(SiHGeH) described above we simulated the structural, energetic and vibrational trends of these compounds. In prior studieswe demonstrated that B3LYP hybrid density functional theory (DFT) simulations provide an excellent account of the ground state structural, thermochemical and vibrational properties of the (HGe)SiHfamily of molecular hydrides. In particular use of the 6-311G++(2d,2p) basis set yielded small typical bond length and frequency discrepancies (on the order of 0.4% and 1.4%, respectively). Accordingly, our first attempt at reconciling the observed IR spectra with those calculated was based on the same procedure, and on the assumption that the fundamental structures are n-butane like. Although this approach provided a close match to most of the main spectral features observed, several strong low-frequency features remained unaccounted for in the calculated IR pattern. In view of the prior success of B3LYP approach we concluded that n-butane like molecular structures alone could not account for the spectrum of the synthesized compounds. We therefore expanded our calculations to include the gauche conformational isomers in which a terminal GeHgroup is rotated out of the Ge\u2014Si\u2014Si\u2014Ge (or Ge\u2014Si\u2014Ge\u2014Ge) skeletal plane, as well as the iso-butane like positional isomer i-Si(SiGeGe) (). These isomers are completely analogous to those previously reported in tetrasilane, and related molecules, and in subsequent discussion we simply refer to them as n-GeSiSiGe, g-GeSiSiGe, n-GeSiGeGe and g-GeSiGeGe, and i-Si(SiGeGe), as shown in . Our results indicate that the observed spectra of both the primary products and the minor impurity compounds are completely accounted for by a linear admixture of the n-, g-, and i-type conformations.","Initial basis set convergence tests showed that a full resolution of differences in the calculated properties of the conformational\/positional isomers requires an even more stringent treatment than that used in the prior studies on (HGe)SiHhydrides, particularly with regards to calculated vibrational properties. Accordingly all of the calculations described in the present work were carried out at the B3LYP\/6-311G++(3df,2pd) level as implemented in the Gaussian03 code.","The results of the structural optimizations, obtained using \u201ctight\u201d convergence criteria, are presented in . The figure lists the bond length, bond angle and bond torsion data for n-GeSiSiGe, g-GeSiSiGe, n-GeSiGeGe, g-GeSiGeGe and i-Si(SiGeGe). In all molecules, the skeletal structure exhibits typical Si\u2014Si and Si\u2014Ge bonds with the gauche conformations exhibiting slightly (0.002 \u212b) longer\/shorter Si\u2014Si\/Si\u2014Ge bonds than their linear counterparts. In the iso-butane like isomer i-Si(SiGeGe) the Si\u2014Si bond lengths (2.351 \u212b) are found to be intermediate to those in the other isomers while the Si\u2014Ge bond is dilated to a value 2.400 \u212b. All the Si\u2014Si values, 2.350-2.352 \u212b, correspond closely (\u02dc0.1%) to that found in bulk silicon a\u221a{square root over (3)}\/4=2.352 \u212b where a (5.431 \u212b) is the lattice constant of crystalline Si in the diamond structure. The Ge\u2014Ge values found in n-GeSiGeGe and g-GeSiGeGe, 2.446 \u212b, is also close to that of bulk germanium (2.449 \u212b). The heteronuclear skeletal Si\u2014Ge bond lengths exhibit a distribution in the range 2.396-2.400 \u212b and represent an average of the Si\u2014Si and Ge\u2014Ge values (2.399 \u212b).","The Si\u2014H and Ge\u2014H bond lengths occur exclusively as central SiHmoieties and terminal GeHgroups in the n- and g-GeSiSiGe isomers, with values of 1.486 \u212b and 1.539 \u212b, respectively. In the corresponding GeSiGeGe isomers the Si\u2014H bonds associated with the SiHmoiety has essentially the same value, 1.485 \u212b, while the GeHmoiety exhibits a slightly longer Ge\u2014H bond (1.542-1.548 \u212b) than in a GeHterminal group, as expected. Due to its unique structure the i-Si(SiGeGe) isomer possesses both terminal SiHand GeHgroups and a single SiH moiety. Here the Ge\u2014H bond lengths associated with the terminal GeHgroups have the same value (1.539 \u212b) as in GeHgroups of other isomers, while the corresponding terminal group Si\u2014Hbond lengths are slightly contracted (1.483 \u212b). The longest Si\u2014H bond length is associated with the central SiH moiety and has a value 1.488 \u212b. Collectively, these bond length trends are consistent with those found previously in the heaviest members of the (HGe)SiH(N=3,4) family of molecules.","The data presented in  also shows that the inter-metallic skeletal bond angles, as well as those involving hydrogen-metal bonds, are essentially unchanged between all isomers studied. The only exception is found in the H\u2014Ge\u2014Si bond distributions, which possess several values in the linear n-GeSiSiGe isomer and a unique value in all of the others. The Ge\u2014Si\u2014Si\u2014Ge bond torsion in the linear molecules is 180\u00b0, indicating that the metal atoms are confined to a common plane, while the gauche conformations exhibit torsion angles of 66\u00b0 and 64\u00b0 in Ge\u2014Si\u2014Si\u2014Ge and Ge\u2014Si\u2014Ge\u2014Ge, respectively.

Both the high- and low-frequency regions are shown. It should also be noted that frequency scaling typically employed to reconcile the slight frequency overestimates obtained using this level of theory, has not been applied to the calculated spectra shown in these plots. The interpretation of the high-frequency spectral features () is straightforward: the lower frequency pairs of peaks designated nand nin n-GeSiSiGe ()), gand gin g-GeSiSiGe ()), and iand iin i-Si(SiGeGe) ()), correspond to symmetric and anti-symmetric Ge\u2014H stretching vibrations, respectively. Similarly, the symmetric and anti-symmetric Si\u2014H stretching vibrations are designated nand n9 in n-GeSiSiGe ()), gand gin g-GeSiSiGe ()), and iand iin i-Si(SiGeGe) ()), respectively. The calculated splitting (13-14 cm) between the symmetric and anti-symmetric bands (in either Si\u2014H or Ge\u2014H) is approximately the same in all isomers, however, all of these bands are systematically lower (\u02dc4-5 cm) in frequency in the gauche isomer. In addition to these features the high-frequency spectrum of the positional isomer i-Si(SiGeGe), shown in ), also exhibits an isolated vibrational feature near 2077 cm(designated by iin )), which corresponds to the central Si\u2014H stretching vibration.","The low-frequency non-skeletal vibrational structure, also shown in , is considerably more complex and involves in- and out-of-plane, symmetric and antisymmetric Si\u2014H\/Ge\u2014H wagging vibrations. The most striking difference between the spectra of n-GeSiSiGe and g-GeSiSiGe (parts (a) and (b) of , respectively) is that four distinct features (n-n) of the linear isomer are effectively split in its gauche counterpart. For example, the strongest band in n-GeSiSiGe, n, corresponding to highly symmetric Si\u2014H wagging vibrations parallel with the molecular backbone, is split into three bands denoted by g, gand gin the gauche isomer exhibiting very strong Si\u2014H wagging parallel to the Si\u2014Si bond. Among these ginvolves the least \u201ccrowded\u201d protons in the molecule and accordingly exhibits the greatest intensity. The weak shoulder indicated by gin the g-GeSiSiGe spectrum is the anti-symmetric counterpart to mode g. Finally, the distinct feature near 925 cmin the n-GeSiSiGe, n, corresponds to Si\u2014H wagging vibrations perpendicular to the Si\u2014Si axis involving symmetric H\u2014Si\u2014H bending motion. In the gauche isomer this band is split into symmetric and anti-symmetric counterparts denoted by gand g. Only a few bands appear to be common to both isomers. In particular features (n:g) near 430 cm(asymmetrical wagging of the terminal Ge\u2014H protons), (n:g) near 800 cm(symmetrical terminal Ge\u2014H wagging parallel to the Si\u2014Si bond) and (n:g) near 876 cm(terminal Ge\u2014H wagging perpendicular to the Si\u2014Ge bonds). The weak band designated gin the ) involves symmetrical terminal Ge\u2014H wagging, and has a silent counterpart in the n-GeSiSiGe molecule.","The low-frequency spectrum of i-Si(SiGeGe), shown in ), has a slightly simpler structure due the molecule's higher symmetry. The lowest frequency wagging modes found in the g-GeSiSiGe {g, g} are effectively split into asymmetrical pairs {i,i}, and {i,i}, respectively, in i-Si(SiGeGe). The dominant features near 800 cm(iand i) correspond to in-phase and anti-phase symmetrical Ge\u2014H wags of the terminal GeHgroups while feature iis the asymmetrical analog to these vibrations. In the SiHterminal group the Si\u2014H wagging vibrations (i) occur at \u02dc951 cm. Finally, features iand iare unique to the i-Si(SiGeGe) molecule, and involve perpendicular Si\u2014H wags of the SiH moiety.","SiGeHmolecules: For the n- and g-(GeH)(SiHGeH) isomers we corroborate the NMR characterization by directly comparing the observed IR spectrum with that calculated for a \u02dc1:3 mixture of n-GeSiGeGe and g-GeSiGeGe conformations (a detailed explanation is given in the following section). The calculated IR spectra for both the n- and g-isomer, convoluted with a Gaussian of width \u02dc20 cmto simulate experimental broadening, are given in . Both the high- and low-frequency regions are shown (no frequency scaling has been applied). Peaks in the simulated spectrum originating from n-GeSiGeGe or g-GeSiGeGe conformations are denoted by Nand G, respectively.","The high-frequency Si\u2014H stretching bands are similar to those found in the GeSiSiGe analogs, exhibiting calculated splitting of 13-14 cmbetween the symmetric and anti-symmetric bands and a systematic overall \u02dc4-5 cmshift to lower frequency in the gauche isomer. Here (N:G) and (N:G) correspond to asymmetric and symmetric Si\u2014H stretches, respectively. However, a simple comparison for corresponding Ge\u2014H stretching vibrations for these isomers is vitiated by the lower symmetry of GeSiGeGe isomers. For example the asymmetrical Ge\u2014H stretch (N) in n-GeSiGeGe is split into contributions G, Gand Gin the gauche isomer while the symmetric Ge\u2014H stretch, Nin the n-GeSiGeGe, is split into bands Gand G.","In the low-frequency range of the spectrum we find a strong correspondence between mode assignments of the n- and g-isomers above 700 cm. Specifically, the asymmetrical H\u2014Si\u2014H wagging vibrations Nin n-GeSiGeGe appears as Gin g-GeSiGeGe, with a frequency near 731 cm. As in our earlier discussion we designate such corresponding pairs between isomer conformations as (N:G). Intense Ge\u2014H wagging vibrations (N:G) associated with terminal GeHgroups appear near 808 cm. Similarly, H\u2014Ge\u2014H \u201cscissor\u201d modes at 866 cmare designated as (N:G), while their H\u2014Si\u2014H counterparts (N:G) appear at 936 cm(the frequency of the corresponding mode in the GeSiSiGe isomers was \u02dc925 cm). The features denoted (N:G) consist of asymmetrical \u201cscissor\u201d-like vibrations associated with the terminal GeHgroups.","The most significant differences between the IR spectra of the n- and g-isomers are found below 700 cm. The most intense spectral feature in n-GeSiGeGe (N) is associated with a highly symmetric wagging of the protons bound to the GeHmoiety parallel to the molecular backbone. In the gauche isomer this mode is split into three features denoted G, Gand G, corresponding to asymmetrical Ge\u2014H wagging of combinations of individual protons in the GeHmoiety. Finally, the mode N, in the n-isomer, consisting of concerted symmetrical wagging of terminal GeHprotons at both ends of the molecule, is split into two modes Gand Gin the gauche isomer in which symmetrical wagging occurs independently in the two GeHterminal groups.","Isomer Admixture Analysis: To estimate the molar concentration of the conformational and positional isomers in the observed spectra, we adopt an approach commonly employed in \u201cmulti-phase\u201d fitting of x-ray spectra, in which a normalized admixture of known pure-phase candidate spectra is fitted to an unknown observed spectrum of the combined molecules. Using the same procedures as in our prior studies on Si\u2014Ge hydrides we have calculated the spectra of 10 digermyl-disilyl positional\/conformational isomers (to be described elsewhere). These calculated spectra serve as a proxy for the unknown pure isomer candidate spectra normally supplied by experiment. A comparison of our calculated spectra with that of the synthesized compounds suggests the presence of simple admixtures of conformational {n-GeSiSiGe, g-GeSiSiGe} and positional {i-Si(SiGeGe), g-GeSiSiGe} isomers for the SiGeHfamily. To proceed with the analysis all of the required theoretical spectra (n-, g- and iso-isomers, see ) are first calculated on a fine frequency grid (1 cmspacing), and then partitioned into low-frequency (0-1600 cm) and high-frequency (1600-2600 cm) regions. We denote the low-frequency spectra of the {n-GeSiSiGe, g-GeSiSiGe} pair by {I(\u03c9), I(\u03c9)} and those of {i-Si(SiGeGe), g-GeSiSiGe} by {I(\u03c9), I(\u03c9)}. The corresponding observed spectrum of the synthesized compound, I(\u03c9), produced on a discrete frequency grid {\u03c9} by the spectrometer, is then used to construct an objective function (Eq 9).

A completely analogous fitting procedure to that above yields, in this case, an admixture parameter \u03b3=0.235 (i.e., 23.5% n-GeSiGeGe) indicating that the gauche conformation (g-GeSiGeGe) is dominant in the gas phase. As in the GeSiSiGe analysis, we find that fitting parameters obtained from the low-frequency spectrum (\u03c9<1600 cm) yields an excellent account of the high-frequency stretching bands using the reduced frequency scale factor 0.975 ()).","We have observed that the proportions derived for the conformational isomers are essentially constant between different samples. To elucidate this observation we calculated the potential energy surface (PES) of the butane-like GeSiSiGe as a function of the Ge\u2014Si\u2014Si\u2014Ge backbone torsion angle. The linear conformation corresponds a torsion angle of 180\u00b0 while the gauche modification occurs at \u02dc66\u00b0 (see ). For each fixed value of the torsion angle all remaining structural degrees of the freedom are optimized resulting in a \u201crelaxed\u201d PES.  compares the torsional PES for butane, tetrasilane and GeSiSiGe at the DFT B3LYP\/6-311G++(3df,2pd) and ab initio CCSD\/LANL2DZ levels of theory. In all cases the value of the linear or trans-configuration is chosen as the reference energy. The plots reveal that all three molecules exhibit very similar energy-torsion profiles with a global minimum at 180\u00b0, a n-g barrier (E) at \u02dc120\u00b0, a local minimum at the gauche configuration (E) near 66\u00b0 and a maximum value corresponding to the eclipse saddle point (E). Using the DFT B3LYP\/6-311G++(3df,2pd) description we obtain \u0394E=0.942, \u0394E=0.362 and \u0394E=1.628 kcal\/mol for GeSiSiGe, while the corresponding tetrasilane values are 0.895, 0.360 and 1.591 kcal\/mol, respectively. At this level of theory the conformational energy structure of GeSiSiGe and butane-like tetrasilane is essentially identical. This is not unexpected in view of their very similar bond character. At the same level of description we find that the analogous PES for butane shares the same qualitative form as that of tetrasilane and GeSiSiGe, but with significantly larger rotational barriers \u0394E=3.235, \u0394E=0.884 and \u0394E=5.713 kcal\/mol.","It should be noted that our B3LYP\/6-311G++(3df,2pd) tetrasilane values for \u0394Eand \u0394Eare qualitatively different from those calculated by Albinsson et alat the MP2\/6-31* level for the same molecule. In particular the latter authors predict a symmetric n-g barrier and a near identity of gauche and linear conformation energy (\u0394E\u02dc0.588, \u0394E, \u02dc\u22120.04 and \u0394E\u02dc1.236 kcal\/mol). Unfortunately, because the basis set levels and model chemistries in our two approaches both differ, the origin of this discrepancy is ambiguous. We therefore carried out a series of coupled cluster calculations at the CCSD\/LANL2DZ level for the sequence butane, tetrasilane and GeSiSiGe. The results, shown as solid lines in , are remarkably consistent with the B3LYP-based DFT calculations (dashed lines in the figure), and indicate that the linear butane-like conformation is the ground state structure, with a gauche value of \u0394E\u02dc0.2-0.4 kcal\/mol. Furthermore, the magnitude of the barrier connecting the gauche and linear conformations in GeSiSiGe is reduced to 0.36 kcal\/mol (\u02dc188 K) in the CCSD\/LANL2DZ calculations. This small value of the torsional barriers in tetrasilane and GeSiSiGe is consistent with the facile low-temperature conformational interconversions observed experimentally.","It should be noted that the 68% value obtained for the positional isomeric spectrum, shown in , is characteristic of one particular sample. Unlike the conformational isomers, which exhibited a constant proportion between samples, the proportions of the positional isomers sensitively depend on the specific reaction conditions. This suggests that once the {i-Si(SiGeGe), g-GeSiSiGe} mixture has been isolated no inter-conversion between positional isomers occurs. Chain cleavage and spontaneous isomerization are observed in the closely related tetrasilane SiHsystem during photochemical matrix isolation experiments producing trisilane (SiH) and silylene (SiH).The formation i-SiHobserved as a mixture with n-SiHis then believed to follow from SiHinsertion into the Si\u2014H bonds of trisilane. As discussed in detail by Jasinski et al. this insertion reaction is one of the characteristic mechanisms in gas phase polysilane chemistry, possessing a slight negative activation energy and a very high collisional efficiency.We surmise that an analogous low energy germylene insertion reaction channel is present in our synthesis route (see Eq. 2) involving the triflate-substituted disilanes at T>22\u00b0 C., leading to the condensation of i-Si(SiGeGe). One plausible mechanism could involve the replacement of \u2014SOCFby GeHat the 1-substitution site of (SOCF)(SiH)(5), followed by insertion of GeHin the Si\u2014H bonds of the central SiHsite in the \u2014SiH\u2014SiH\u2014GeHintermediate.","Deposition Studies","The deposition experiments were conducted on a clean Si(100) substrates in ultra-high vacuum system equipped with a low energy electron microscope (LEEM) that allowed in situ real time observation of the growth process. The (HGe)(SiH)gaseous precursor reacted on the Si surface via complete Helimination at partial pressures in the range of 10-10Torr. Initially, the reaction growth kinetics was investigated using LEEM and the activation energy (E) of the compound with respect to Hdesorption from the Si surface was measured. It is known that for conventional silanes and germanes the Eis much lower on a Ge containing surface (including SiGe) than on pristine Si. Thus, an accurate determination of Ecan only be obtained from measuring the growth rate of the first monolayer, (which grows directly on pure Si) and not that of subsequent layers, which grow on Ge containing surfaces and have higher growth rates. In this regard LEEM is particularly unique because its dynamic imaging differentiates the Si(001)-(2x1) surface from the SiGeepilayer and thus provides unambiguous means for the correct determination of Eon Si by measuring the growth rate of the first SiGemonolayer vs. temperature.","For comparison the growth rates of GeHand HGeSiHwere also determined using the same method. For these and for HGe)(SiH)the first monolayer took longer to complete on pristine Si than subsequent monolayers.  is a graph showing plots of the temperature dependence of the first layer growth rates. The activation energies were determined using the relation R\u02dcexp(\u2212E\/kT). The data are consistent with the first-order Hdesorption kinetics and yield Eof 1.95, 1.66 and 1.42 eV, for HGeSiH, GeHand (HGe)(SiH), respectively. This indicates that the latter it is not only more reactive than HGeSiH, but is also more reactive than pure GeHdespite the presence of strong Si\u2014H bonds in the molecular structure. Accordingly, it represents a unique high-reactivity species suitable for low temperature (300-400\u00b0 C.) rapid growth of thick layers (100-500 nm) with stoichiometry SiGereflecting that of the corresponding precursor. Below we describe the deposition procedure and key results regarding morphology, microstructure, composition and strain for the films.","The synthesis of SiGefilms was investigated in the 350\u00b0 C.-500\u00b0 C. range via dehydrogenation of (HGe)(SiH). The highest temperature that yields planar layers is \u02dc450\u00b0 C. The growth rate is \u02dc4 nm\/min and decreases to 2 nm\/min at 350\u00b0 C. No appreciable growth was observed below 300\u00b0 C. (1\u00d710Torr) due to the reduced reactivity of the compound. Thick films with rough surfaces and defective microstructures were produced at 500\u00b0 C. with growth rates as high as 15 nm\/min. The composition and heteroepitaxial character of the films were investigated by random and channeling Rutherford backscattering (RBS), which in all cases indicate a highly stoichiometric material aligned with the substrate. The ratio of the aligned versus the random peak heights (\u03c7), which measures the degree of crystallinity, decreases from 15% at the interface to 6% at the surface indicating a dramatic reduction in dislocation density across the thickness of the film. This is confirmed by high resolution XTEM, which revealed commensurate SiGe\/Si interfaces and perfectly monocrystalline layer microstructures. A survey of TEM samples showed no defects penetrating through the layers within a field of view of \u02dc2.5 \u03bcm in the micrographs indicating an upper limit in the threading dislocation density of \u02dc10\/cm(). Most of the defects due to the lattice mismatch are concentrated near the interface region. In fact, a number of these appear to originate at the SiGe\/Si interface and show a propensity to propagate downward into the substrate (). Occasional edge dislocations spaced by \u02dc150 nm are also observed in the vicinity of steps on the Si surface (). These are parallel to the interface plane and may provide stress relief between the film and the substrate. The presence of edge dislocations is unusual since SiGe-based materials typically display (111)-threading dislocations and stacking faults. X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed highly aligned layers with mosaics spreads as low as 0.1 degrees and relatively strain free microstructures. Raman scattering experiments conducted with several Ar+ laser lines revealed a high degree of vertical uniformity in concentration and strain.The Raman analysis indicated that the composition agrees well with the RBS value and that the strain relaxation is 75% and 95% for films with thickness of 200 and 500 nm, respectively which similar to those obtained by XRD.","Atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies show that films with thickness of 50 and 750 nm display RMS values of 0.5 and 1.5 nm, respectively, for 10\u00d710 \u03bcmareas, indicating highly planar surfaces for samples grown at T<450\u00b0 C. as shown ). For layers grown at T>450\u00b0 C. the AFM images [)] show a classic \u201ccross hatched\u201d surface pattern caused by misfit dislocations produced during strain relaxation. It has been shown that both defect induced interface and bulk alloy scattering considerably reduces the electron mobilities in these samples and degrades the device performance.Nevertheless conventional CVD at ultra low pressure is known to produce SiGematerials with significantly lower cross hatching patterns leading to higher quality electrical properties. In contrast to these methodologies, which typically involve low-order silanes and germanes (SiH, SiH, GeH, GeH), the present route utilizes the highly reactive and more massive (HGe)(SiH)compound. The direct incorporation of the SiGemolecular unit into the film leads to low surface diffusion compared to the conventional low mass compounds. Furthermore, the high reactivity permits low growth temperature and promotes high growth rates at pressures of \u02dc10Torr leading to device quality films devoid of cross hatched surface morphologies.","The thermal properties of the films were investigated between 450\u00b0 C. and 750\u00b0 C., a range well within device processing temperatures. The XRD lattice constant, the RBS \u03c7values, and the AFM roughness were measured for the annealed samples and compared with the corresponding values of the as-grown materials. Samples with a thickness as low as 200 nm did not show any increase in surface roughness even after annealing at 750\u00b0 C. indicating that the surface planarity of our samples is thermally robust. The XRD and RBS aligned spectra were essentially identical before and after annealing. This result also confirms full relaxation in the as-grown layers at T<450\u00b0 C.","We have demonstrated the synthesis of the butane-like compounds with molecular formulas (GeH)(SiH)(1) (GeH)SiH(SiH) (2) and (GeH)(SiHGeH) (3) and their conformational isomers. Detailed characterization of the products was conducted via a range of spectroscopic and analytical methods including quantum chemical simulations. A new fitting procedure was developed, based on the admixture of normal and gauche calculated spectra, to obtain the proportions of the individual conformers in the product sample at 22\u00b0 C. Controlled depositions of (1) have produced stoichiometric SiGe films possessing the desired properties for semiconductor applications including perfectly crystalline and epitaxial microstructures, smooth morphologies, and uniformly strain-relaxed states. Unique practical advantages associated with this low temperature (\u02dc350-450\u00b0 C.) rapid growth include: (i) short deposition times compatible with preprocessed Si wafers, (ii) selective growth for application in high frequency devices, and (iii) negligible mass segregation of dopants, which is particularly critical for thin layers. Finally we have found that these compounds are remarkably stable over extended periods of time, with evidence of decomposition, and thus represent viable molecular sources for potential industrial applications.","Experimental Section","All manipulations were carried out under inert conditions using standard Schlenk and drybox techniques.
