title: System and method for automated migration from Windows to Linux
abstract: A system and method for automating the migration of configuration settings and data from computer systems running the Windows速 operating system to computer systems running the Linux速 operating system. The method utilizes data from one or more sources to create the configuration of the target system, and translates between settings related to the Windows速 systems and Linux速 systems involved. As a result, it simplifies the otherwise complex and time-consuming task of migrating from one server to another, specifically when migrating between two operating systems that provide similar functionality but are configured in distinctly different ways.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND INFORMATION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The field of invention relates generally to a system and method for the automated migration of a system running a member of the Windows\u00ae family of operating systems to a system running a member of the Linux\u00ae family of operating systems.","It can be appreciated that a large number of server computers in operation today run a member of the Microsoft Windows\u00ae family of operating systems, such as Windows\u00ae Server 2003 Data Center Edition and Windows\u00ae NT 4.0. These operating systems provide services to client computers, such as access to data stored in shared directories, access to printers connected to the server, user authentication services, networking services, directory services, etc.","It can also be appreciated that various versions of the Linux\u00ae operating system, including Red Hat Enterprise Server AS 3 and Novell SuSE Professional Linux\u00ae 9 are becoming more popular and more widely deployed.","One skilled in the art will recognize that operating system services and applications are typically configured according to the user's needs, and that such configuration settings are stored through a persistent mechanism, such as an on-disk file, so that when the system is reset or restarted, the configuration settings can be read and the service or application can run with the stored settings; in this way the user does not have to reconfigure the settings from scratch.","Windows\u00ae and Linux\u00ae operating systems provide many similar functions, such as the ability for client computers to access data on a server and to display text and graphics on a computer screen. On Windows\u00ae operating system, for example, file and print sharing via the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol and user authentication via the NT LAN Manager protocol (NTLM) is provided by the operating system itself. Similar functionality is provided on Linux\u00ae operating system, but requires additional modules to be installed. Advanced Server for UNIX, ported to Linux\u00ae operating system, is one application that provides file, print, and authentication via the SMB and NTLM protocols. Samba is another application that provides such functionality. Syntax Totalnet Advanced Server is a third such product.","Although the functions provided are similar between the two operating systems, often they are provided or configured in different and incompatible ways. For example, configuration settings related to file shares are stored in a set of data files called the system registry on Windows\u00ae operating system, while configuration settings related to file shares are stored in text based configuration files on Linux\u00ae operating system, e.g. a format that is different from its counterpart on Windows\u00ae operating system. Similarly, data related to directory services, which, as the name suggests, deals with information about the people and resources available on a given computer system or network, is stored in the Active Directory on Windows\u00ae operating system, but is stored using OpenLDAP or other software on Linux\u00ae operating system. Likewise, configuration settings for Internet Information Server (IIS), a web server that runs on Windows\u00ae operating system are stored in the Windows\u00ae operating system registry, while configuration settings for Apache, a web server often deployed on Linux\u00ae operating system are stored in a text file named HTTPD.CONF.","While the Linux\u00ae operating system has existed for a number of years, it is only recently that it has reached a point of viability and stability that system administrators will consider deploying a server running Linux\u00ae operating system where they might today or in the past have run Windows\u00ae operating system. With the functionality provided by the two operating system families becoming more and more similar, system administrators running the Windows\u00ae operating system desire, for financial, technical, and other reasons, to migrate the services provided and data stored on servers running the Windows\u00ae operating system to Linux\u00ae operating system.","Due to the incompatibility in the ways in which the two operating system families are configured and the ways in which they store configuration settings, however, this task is a difficult, time-consuming, and error-prone manual process. In particular, an administrator must understand the particular settings in question on Windows\u00ae operating system, and the corresponding settings on Linux\u00ae operating system. Often, administrators are hampered by their lack of experience on one or the other of the two operating systems, the difficulty of finding the appropriate settings on either system, the challenge of translating between the settings of the two systems, and the need to install and configure additional software and to write and configure scripts on the Linux\u00ae system to have it provide the equivalent functions as the Windows\u00ae system.","The problem of migration is not a new one, as administrators have been confronted with the problem of moving from an old version of an operating system to a new version for years. Alternatively, administrators have been forced to move from one physical machine to another to take advantage of new hardware capabilities or because of a desire to move off an old piece of hardware. However, these migrations have been relatively simple given the relative compatibility in settings between the old and new operating system versions or between the two machines, which may even be running the same version of the operating system.","The present invention addresses the aforementioned problem by automating the migration process from Windows\u00ae operating system to Linux\u00ae operating system, as it relates both to configuration information and to data.","In accordance with aspects of the present invention, systems and methods are disclosed that address the foregoing computer system migration, translation, and configuration problems, and more specifically but not exclusively relate to a set of software tools, wizards, translation modules, discovery modules, installation and configuration modules, and processes used to automate the currently manual process of migrating from Windows\u00ae operating system to Linux\u00ae operating system.","According to one set of techniques, a source discovery wizard determines the services running on a Windows\u00ae machine. Then, if a target system already has Linux\u00ae operating system installed on it, a target discovery wizard module determines if any additional services need to be installed on the target system and\/or if any services must be removed for the target system to provide the services required as indicated by the discovery wizard. A configuration module generates a list of required modifications. If the target system does not already have Linux\u00ae operating system installed on it, the configuration module creates an installation configuration file for use by the operating system installation program, ensuring that the operating system installation program will install the required software.","According to further aspects of the techniques, a configuration conversion tool translates the settings on Windows\u00ae operating system to their counterparts on Linux\u00ae operating system. Lookup tables are employed to determine the proper mapping between configuration settings on the two systems. Such settings may include, but are not limited to, the names and paths of file shares, printer resources, directory information, user and group settings, etc. The result of the translation is a list of now translated target settings, which may be stored in a variety of forms, including, but not limited to, a text or binary file, or may be communicated directly to another module or application without being stored.","According to another aspect of the techniques, the target installer configures the target system appropriately, with the result that it has the necessary software installed to provide the required services. This may include the automatic downloading of required software from the Internet or from an internal file server or Intranet site, prompting the user to insert various media such as CDs containing the necessary software, etc.","According to another aspect, the target configuration module configures the services on the target system based on the target configuration list or via direct communication from the configuration conversion tool. Configuration includes but is not limited to, the configuration of file and print services, directory services, authentication services, and network services. As part of configuring file services, directories may be created. As part of configuring print services, print drivers may be installed.","According to another aspect, a data move module moves data files from the Windows\u00ae system to the Linux\u00ae system. In one embodiment, the data is stored on an intermediate file server. One skilled in the art will recognize that such a file server could be a server on the Internet, an Intranet web server, or a file server. The data move module may be configured to filter files to be moved based on specified criteria, such as the names or extensions of files, or the size of files. In an innovative technique, the data move module may also scan for viruses or call an external program to scan for viruses as an integrated part of the copy or move operation.","According to further aspects, translated configuration information is stored on a repository server, which stores one or more configurations such that the translated configuration can be deployed to another Linux\u00ae server, for example, in case of failure.","According to other aspects of the techniques, a configuration conversion tool migrates settings from a Windows\u00ae server running the enterprise directory services repository Active Directory to a Linux\u00ae server running the enterprise directory services program OpenLDAP.","In one embodiment, the tools, wizards, and other modules are controlled by the administrator completely from a system running the Windows\u00ae operating system, e.g. the source server, or another system running Windows\u00ae operating system and accessing the same network. This means that the administrator need not interact directly with the Linux\u00ae system, unless desired, at any point during the process. In another embodiment, all tools, wizards, one or more tools, wizards, and modules run on the Linux\u00ae operating system so that an administrator can perform migration without interacting directly with a Windows\u00ae system, unless desired.","Embodiments of methods and apparatus for facilitating migration between operating systems, such as from a Windows\u00ae operating system to a Linux\u00ae operating system are described herein. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth (such as the Perl scripting language) to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of the invention.","Reference throughout this specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d or \u201can embodiment\u201d means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, the appearances of the phrases \u201cin one embodiment\u201d or \u201cin an embodiment\u201d in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","102","122","140","142","150","170","104","106","108","110","190","120","124","126","128","130"]},"Migration Wizard  is installed and run by an administrator on Windows\u00ae Server . Thus commences a migration process  shown in . First, Migration Wizard  presents a graphical user interface to the user in a block , which guides the user through the migration process and controls the operation of the modules associated with the migration process. One skilled in the art will recognize that such an interface could also be presented through a variety of other means, including, but not limited to, text or voice based interfaces. In one embodiment, Migration Wizard  is installed on another system (not shown) running Windows\u00ae operating system that is connected to Network . Such connection can take place via a wired or wireless link, running any of a variety of protocols.","In a block , Source Discovery Module  interrogates Network  to determine the kind of servers running on the network. Source Discovery Module  can also be directed by the user to interrogate a particular system on the network, such as Windows\u00ae Server . Migration Wizard  prompts the user for a username and password, if required, so that it can use those credentials to access the network and one or more systems on the network.","Having discovered the systems on the network or having been directed to a particular server by the user, Migration Wizard  presents a list of servers available for migration in a block . Migration Wizard  displays additional information to the user related to the servers shown, including, but not limited to, the type of each server. Types of servers that are supported and displayed include, but are not limited to, servers running versions of Windows\u00ae NT 4, Windows\u00ae 2000 server, and Windows\u00ae 2003 server. Available Linux\u00ae target servers are also presented to the user or the user may specify a particular system, for example, by name or IP address. In addition, more specific information about each server may be displayed, such as whether it is a Primary Domain Controller, a Backup Domain Controller, a stand-alone server, etc.","Available Linux\u00ae target servers are also presented to the user or the user may specify a particular server as the Linux\u00ae target server, for example, by name or IP address. As used herein, a \u201cLinux\u00ae target server\u201d comprises a target server to which Windows\u00ae operating system configuration information, and optional data files, may be migrated. A Linux\u00ae target server may or may not already have an instance of a Linux\u00ae operating system installed on it prior to initiation of the migration process.","Based on the server the user wishes to migrate, Source Discovery Module  obtains configuration information from one or more Windows\u00ae servers in a block . Windows\u00ae Server  is a Primary Domain Controller (PDC), which contains the master directory services information and permissions data (usernames, passwords, and group names). Windows\u00ae Server  is a File Server that is a member of the Domain but does not itself contain permissions or directory services data. In one embodiment, where Windows\u00ae Server  is the server selected for migration, Source Discovery Module  must obtain information both from Windows\u00ae Server  and Windows\u00ae Server ; from Windows\u00ae Server  it obtains directory services, permissions, and other configuration information; from Windows\u00ae Server  it obtains configuration information specific to Windows\u00ae Server , such as the directories that have been shared on Windows\u00ae Server . Migration Wizard  can support the selection of one or more servers to be migrated, such servers to be migrated one at a time, sequentially, or in parallel.","In one embodiment, the Migration Wizard  now runs Configuration Conversion Tool  in a block . In general, Configuration Conversion Tool  may be implemented as a separate program, as a series of functions in the Migration Wizard , as a dynamic link library, or via a variety of other means. In another embodiment, the configuration conversion tool runs remotely, on another system.","Configuration Conversion Tool  uses information from Source Discovery Module  in combination with Lookup Tables  and  to create Target List  in a block . Target List  specifies not only the translated settings to be configured on the Linux\u00ae target server, such as Linux\u00ae Server , but also the operating system, software modules, and applications required for Linux\u00ae Server  to provide the equivalent services as those that are provided by Windows\u00ae Server  or Windows\u00ae Server .","In a block , Migration Wizard  runs Target Preparation Tool  to evaluate target Linux\u00ae Server . In one embodiment, if target Linux\u00ae Server  is discovered to already be running an operating system in a decision block , then Migration Wizard  attempts to install Target Discovery Module  on target Linux\u00ae Server , as depicted in a block . It should be noted that Migration Wizard  prompts the user, as necessary, for username and password information so that Target Preparation Tool  can access Linux\u00ae Server  with the proper credentials. In another embodiment, the user installs Target Discovery Module  on Linux\u00ae Server  by installing the software from a CD-ROM or other media, or from a server accessible on the network. If Linux\u00ae Server  is discovered not to be running an operating system in block , then Target Preparation Tool  installs the operating system in a block . In general, the operating system can be installed from a variety of sources, such as a computer on the network, media such as a CD-ROM, etc.","Target Preparation Tool  creates various configuration files to automate the installation of the operating system as part of block . In one embodiment, Target Preparation Tool  creates an XML file containing a number of configuration parameters, and passes the name and location of that file to the operating system installation program, which the operating system installation program then uses to properly install on the target system. Once operating system installation is complete, Migration Wizard  installs target discovery module on Linux\u00ae Server  in a block .","In a block , Target Installer  creates a backup of the system configuration of Linux\u00ae Server  prior to installing or removing any components. This operation can be skipped if the user so chooses. Configuration files only, or configuration and system files, e.g. programs, applications, modules, libraries, etc. can be backed up; such backup can occur to media such as a CD-ROM or to another server such as Repository Server .","Target Discovery Module  compares the list of software and modules indicated by Target List  with the operating system, software modules, and applications installed on target Linux\u00ae Server . Based on this comparison, Target Installer  installs necessary components on Linux\u00ae Server , and removes any conflicting components, as depicted in a block .","In a block , Target Configuration Module  configures the operating system services and applications on Linux\u00ae Server  to provide the services indicated by Target List . In one embodiment, Target Configuration Module  configures the Samba file and print serving application to provide file sharing, print, and authentication services. In another embodiment, Target Configuration Module  configures the Advanced Server for UNIX application to provide file sharing, print, and authentication services. In one embodiment, Target Configuration Module  configures Samba or Advanced Server for UNIX to act as a Primary Domain Controller, as a domain member server, or as a stand-alone server. In another embodiment, Target Configuration Module  creates particular file shares, and configures Samba or Advanced Server for UNIX to make the shares accessible to client computers. In yet another embodiment, Target Configuration Module  configures Samba or Advanced Server for UNIX with groups, users, and permission information. One skilled in the art will recognize that Advanced Server for UNIX could be replaced with another application or piece of software capable of providing file, print, and authentication services. Target Configuration Model 130 can configure target Linux\u00ae Server  based on Target List  or based on direct communication from Configuration Conversion Tool , over a network.","Once configuration is completed, according to the user's instructions, Data Move Module  moves or copies files stored on the source server (e.g., Windows\u00ae server  or Windows\u00ae server ) to target Linux\u00ae Server , as provided in a block . As shown by a decision block , in the case of a move, files are deleted from the source server in a block . Optionally, files are backed up prior to or during the copy or move to Intermediate Server  or to Repository Server , or backed up to media inserted into the source system such as a writeable CD-ROM, a secondary disk drive, tape, or other media. In this way, target Linux\u00ae Server  now stores the data originally accessible on the source server (e.g., Windows\u00ae server  or Windows\u00ae server ).","In a block , Data Move Module  may scan for viruses and delete or quarantine infected files prior to, during, or after the move as an integrated part of migration process . It will be recognized that such scanning can occur as a function call within Data Move Module , as a call or an external program such as a commercial anti-virus scanning product, or via other means. In a related technique, Target Preparation Tool  can scan for viruses and delete or quarantine files on target Linux\u00ae Server  as an integrated part of migration process .","After the operations of the migration process so far outlined above have been completed, if so directed by the user in a block , Migration Wizard  can rename the source server to a different name in a block  and then communicate with Target Configuration Module  so that it renames target Linux\u00ae Server  to have the name previously used for the source server. In this way, the user can access the new server  using the same server name as previously used for source server  or  with no change. In another embodiment, the renaming process takes place prior to any migration occurring. It will be recognized by one skilled in the art that the user direction described can occur at any point during the migration process, such as at the beginning, even though the rename takes place at the end of the process.","As part of or separate from the migration process, translated configuration information can be stored on Repository Server . With configuration information stored on Repository Server , servers with the same configuration (but with slight modifications, such as server name) can easily be created, such as Linux\u00ae Server . In the case where a backup server is desired or numerous similar configurations are desired, Repository Server  makes the duplication and deployment with slight modification of configurations easy.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["202","204","202","204"]},"In , Registry  contains a set of data files commonly used by the Windows\u00ae operating system and by applications that run on Windows\u00ae operating system to store configuration data and other settings. File SMB.CONF  is a configuration file used by the Samba program referenced earlier to store its configuration and settings information. Registry  contains settings related to file shares in Name-Value pairs, i.e. Name contains the name of the file share, while Value contains information about the file share, including but not limited to the path and permissions for the share. File SMB.CONF  contains similar information, but in different form. The illustrated embodiment of the present invention uses lookup table  to translate between the settings as stored on Windows\u00ae Server  and Linux\u00ae Server .","After initialization by the user, as shown in , Configuration Conversion Tool  reads Registry  during a conversion process  to obtain the settings related to file shares on Windows\u00ae Server , e.g. the two directories shared by Windows\u00ae Server , \u201c\\print$\u201d and \u201c\\SharedDocs,\u201d as shown in a block . Reading is accomplished by reading the registry directly using file read operations, by using standard system calls, or through other means. In one embodiment, reading is performed remotely, such that Configuration Conversion Tool  runs on a different system than where Registry  resides.","Configuration Conversion Tool  uses Lookup Table  to translate between the Windows\u00ae operating system and Linux\u00ae operating system settings. For each Translation Entry  in the Windows\u00ae portion of the table, there is a corresponding Linux\u00ae Translation Entry . A particular entry may contain a simple translation such as an indicator that a Name value stored in the Windows\u00ae registry should be stored as the same value but written in brackets to the SMB.CONF file on Linux\u00ae operating system. Alternatively, a particular entry may be more complex, including script, commands to execute, programs to run, multiple text configuration files to be modified, etc. Finding lookup table entries for Windows\u00ae Name-Value pairs is performed in a block .","In one embodiment, Configuration Conversion Tool  looks for Translation Entry  \u201cMoveFileShare\u201d in block . Translation Entry  directs Configuration Conversion Tool  to parse the registry value, for each share name in registry block  in a block . In a block , Configuration Conversion Tool  finds the corresponding MoveFileShare Translation Entry  in the Linux\u00ae operating system portion of the table, which directs Configuration Conversion tool  to convert the parsed entries from registry block  into writeable form for Target Configuration Module  in a block .","In a block , each \u201cName\u201d key in registry block  is converted into a corresponding entry in Output Table . In one embodiment, Output Table  is an array of structures containing the text variables Name and Path. One skilled in the art will recognize that Output Table  could be implemented in a variety of forms, such as a linked list, values written to a file, etc.","Next, as directed by Translation Entry , Target Configuration Module  creates a new SMB.CONF file if one does not exist, as indicated at a decision block  and a block  or opens the existing SMB.CONF file for reading and creates a modified file based on the original file and the new entries to be written. That is, if a new file is created, Target Configuration Module  writes entries to the file based on Output Table , as depicted in a block . If a file exists, Target Configuration Module  reads each line of SMB.CONF; if it finds the specified Name entry, it modifies the contents of the section in block ; if it does not find the entry, it adds the section at the end of the file in block . It will be recognized that the section could be written anywhere in the file. Upon completion, it renames the old file to a backup filename, such as SMB.CONF.OLD, and copies the new file to the old file name. SMB.CONF file  now contains the new or modified entries from Output Table . Lastly, Target Configuration Module  causes any necessary services, such as the SMBD file sharing service for the Samba software on target Linux\u00ae Server  to be restarted and\/or to re-read the SMB.CONF file in a block . The result of the process is an automatic migration and translation of settings from Windows\u00ae Server  to Linux\u00ae Server .","In another embodiment, as shown in , Configuration Conversion Tool  migrates Active Directory (a centralized repository for enterprise directory information running on Windows\u00ae Server ) settings to Linux\u00ae Server , as illustrated by the process flow  of . The process begins in a block , wherein Configuration Conversion Tool , running either on Windows\u00ae Server  or on another machine with access to the network, evaluates the Active Directory  database. In one embodiment, this evaluation is performed using the Windows\u00ae operating system provided Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for accessing the data contained within Active Directory . In another embodiment, the Active Directory database files are read directly.","In one embodiment, Configuration Conversion Tool  installs Linux\u00ae operating system software  if necessary, in a block , followed in a block  by OpenLDAP directory services software  if it is not already installed on Linux\u00ae Server . Configuration Conversion Tool  then configures OpenLDAP software , in a block . It will be recognized that OpenLDAP is one directory services application and that a number of such applications could be used, including, but not limited to, Novell eDirectory, or an implementation of Active Directory running on the Linux\u00ae operating system.","Based on user input at a decision block , in one embodiment, Target Configuration Module  configures OpenLDAP repository  to have the same schema as Active Directory repository . That is, both the field types, such as Name, Office, etc. and the structure, such as the relationship between Company and Machines and Users, of repository  are, in an innovative aspect of the invention, automatically replicated into OpenLDAP repository  by Configuration Conversion Tool , as depicted in a block . In another embodiment, Target Configuration Module  configures OpenLDAP repository  with a customized, user-defined, or application-defined schema, or with a pre-defined version of the Active Directory schema, as depicted by a block .","In the case that OpenLDAP repository  was filled via the replication process, the Configuration Wizard reads each item from repository . In a block , it finds the associated Translation Entry  in Lookup Table  and the associated Translation Entry  in the Linux\u00ae operating system portion of Lookup Table . Following the directions of Entry , Target Configuration Module , directed by Configuration Conversion Tool , writes the corresponding entries to OpenLDAP repository  in a block . Thus the Name key and its associated value Steve Jones in User entry  are written by Target Configuration Module  to OpenLDAP repository  resulting in entry  in block .","In the case that OpenLDAP repository  was filled via the writing process, Target Configuration Module  follows the instructions in Entry  to translate the Active Directory entry into an appropriate OpenLDAP repository  entry, and repeats for all entries, as depicted in a block . In one embodiment, the members of the User entry  are translated into the members of the User entry , with Name key in Active Directory entry  translated into NAME key in the OpenLDAP schema, the Office key to OFF, Tel to TEL, and Email to EM. The Target Configuration Module writes the values, such as \u201cSteve Jones,\u201d associated with each key, in block .","For any fields where Lookup Table  does not provide instructions on how to translate a given field in block  or where a migration issue or error occurs in block , at decision block , Configuration Conversion Tool  prompts the user for input in accordance with a block , or, depending on the options selected by the user, automatically creates a new field.","In one embodiment, once the migration or translation process is complete, Configuration Conversion Tool , in conjunction with Target Configuration Module  verifies the configuration in a block , running queries against Active Directory  and OpenLDAP  to ensure the results are the same. Configuration Conversion Tool  presents the user with configuration screens in which the user can configure which validation tests to run. Once the process is complete, Configuration Conversion Tool  presents the user with a summary of the results in a block , with a detailed report also available. The summary indicates what actions were taken, and the success\/failure status of the operations. The detailed report shows similar information, but in more detail, showing each entry that was migrated, details about the schema, etc.","In a block , Configuration Conversion Tool  presents the user with the option to launch a management tool directly, and then launches a management tool in a block , if the user desires to make changes to the configuration or perform other management tasks. Configuration Conversion Tool  also presents the user with the option to turn off Active Directory , in which case if selected at decision block , Configuration Conversion Tool  calls the appropriate APIs to stop Active Directory . Configuration Conversion Tool  also allows the user to undo the migration operation, as depicted by a decision block , and if selected undoes the migration process in a block .","With reference to the flowchart of  and the architecture diagram of , one embodiment of the present invention allows the migration process to be initiated from a system running the Linux\u00ae operating system . The process begins in a block , wherein the Configuration Conversion Tool  is run by a user on Linux\u00ae computer . In a block , Configuration Conversion Tool  interfaces with a specially-developed Active Directory Library for Linux\u00ae operating system  on a Linux\u00ae server that implements function calls typically supported by the Active Directory programming interface on Windows\u00ae operating system. In a block , Active Directory Library for Linux\u00ae operating system  determines whether it can interface with Active Directory  running on Windows\u00ae operating system  on computer  over network  through a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) function call or by simulating a native Active Directory call using wire level protocols. If LDAP calls cannot be used, the library uses wire level protocols to interface with Active Directory, simulating native Active Directory calls, as depicted in a block . If LDAP calls can be used, the library uses LDAP calls to interface with Active Directory  in a block . Using the appropriate calls, Conversion Tool  migrates settings from Active Directory  to OpenLDAP repository , following aspects of the procedure described above with reference to . In another embodiment, Configuration Conversion Tool  interfaces with innovative Active Directory Interface Module , running on Windows\u00ae Operating System , which has access to the native Active Directory programming interfaces.","As illustrated by process flow  in , during or after the migration process, Configuration Conversion Tool  can undo the migration process. In one embodiment, when Configuration Conversion Tool  launches, it checks its internal status logs to determine if any migrations were on-going, as depicted in a block . For example, as a result of a power outage, a migration could be interrupted, resulting in an unknown or non-working state for the source and target systems.","Upon recognizing that a migration was in process at a decision block  or upon indication by the user in accordance with a block , Configuration Conversion Tool  commences the undo process. In one embodiment, during the migration process, Configuration Conversion Tool , in conjunction with Target Configuration Module  keeps a log of all changes made to Linux\u00ae server . More specifically, before a change is made, the change to be made is written to the log file; when the change is completed, the log file is updated. Under one embodiment of the undo process, Configuration Conversion Tool  with Target Configuration Module  reads the log file in accordance with a block . In a block , Configuration Conversion Tool  deletes a user entry from OpenLDAP repository . In a block , Configuration Conversion Tool  reverses the action indicated by each of the remaining log file entries, including, but not limited to, removing files that were installed in a block . In another embodiment, rather than undoing individual actions, Configuration Conversion Tool  replaces all written files with originals from a stored backup. The result is that Linux\u00ae server  returns to its original configuration.","As discussed above, the Windows\u00ae operating system to Linux\u00ae operating system migration functions are implemented via execution of software components. Thus, embodiments of this invention may be used as or to support a software program executed upon some form of processing core (such as the CPU of a computer) or otherwise implemented or realized upon or within a machine-readable medium. A machine-readable medium includes any mechanism for storing or transmitting information in a form readable by a machine (e.g., a computer). For example, a machine-readable medium can include such as a read only memory (ROM); a random access memory (RAM); a magnetic disk storage media; an optical storage media; and a flash memory device, etc.","With reference to , a generally conventional computer server  is illustrated, which is suitable for use in connection with practicing embodiments of the present invention. Computer server  is generally illustrative of source and target servers discussed above. Examples of computer systems that may be suitable for these purposes include stand-alone and enterprise-class servers operating UNIX-based and Linux\u00ae-based operating systems, as well as servers running the Windows\u00ae NT or Windows\u00ae 2000 Server or Windows\u00ae 2003 operating systems.","Computer server  includes a chassis  in which is mounted a motherboard  populated with appropriate integrated circuits, including one or more processors  and memory (e.g., DIMMs or SIMMs) , as is generally well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. A monitor  is included for displaying graphics and text generated by software programs and program modules that are run by the computer server. A mouse  (or other pointing device) may be connected to a serial port (or to a bus port or USB port) on the rear of chassis , and signals from mouse  are conveyed to the motherboard to control a cursor on the display and to select text, menu options, and graphic components displayed on monitor  by software programs and modules executing on the computer. In addition, a keyboard  is coupled to the motherboard for user entry of text and commands that affect the running of software programs executing on the computer. Computer server  also includes a network interface card (NIC) , or equivalent circuitry built into the motherboard to enable the server to send and receive data via a network .","File system storage may be implemented via a plurality of hard disks  that are stored internally within chassis , and\/or via a plurality of hard disks that are stored in an external disk array  that may be accessed via a SCSI card  or equivalent SCSI circuitry built into the motherboard. Optionally, disk array  may be accessed using a Fibre Channel link using an appropriate Fibre Channel interface card (not shown) or built-in circuitry.","Computer server  generally may include a compact disk-read only memory (CD-ROM) drive  into which a CD-ROM disk may be inserted so that executable files and data on the disk can be read for transfer into memory  and\/or into storage on hard disk . Similarly, a floppy drive  may be provided for such purposes. Other mass memory storage devices such as an optical recorded medium or DVD drive may also be included. The machine instructions comprising the software components that cause processor(s)  to implement the operations of the present invention that have been discussed above will typically be distributed on floppy disks  or CD-ROMs  (or other memory media) and stored in one or more hard disks  until loaded into memory  for execution by processor(s) .","The above description of illustrated embodiments of the invention, including what is described in the Abstract, is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed.
