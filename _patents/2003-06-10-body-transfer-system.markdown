{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e) from copending, commonly owned U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 60\/387,545, entitled Bed Buggy Patient Transfer System, filed Jun. 10, 2002.","The U.S. Government has no interest in or to the present invention.","The inventive concepts relate to systems and methods for transferring a body. More specifically, the present invention relates to systems and methods for transferring a body without the need for lifting or pulling by individuals or complicated lifting or pulley mechanisms.","The transfer of patients between hospital beds and stretchers is a significant cause of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) in caregivers within the healthcare sector. Although there is considerable prior art disclosing mechanical means to aid in accomplishing the task, most caregivers still resort to physically lifting the patient between the hospital bed and stretcher or gurney. Gangly, ineffective and time-consuming devices have thus far been used with less frequency to the favor of a simple backboard with hand holds around the perimeter (U.S. Design Pat. No. 329,216). During a patient transfer, the stretcher is placed adjacent to the hospital bed. The patient is rolled on his\/her side and the backboard is slid under the patient. The patient is rolled back on the board. The caregivers must reach over the bed and lift and pull in an outstretched manner that places excessive stress to the back and shoulders. Over time, the caregiver may encounter sudden or progressive MSD injuries.","Transferring patients is not only injury prone, it is also labor intensive. Recent OSHA guidelines for reducing MSD injuries in nursing homes recommends two or more caregivers to accomplish a bed-to-bed transfer. As many as six caregivers may be required for larger non-ambulatory patients. Bariatric patients, severely obese, are moved in their hospital beds and not transferred to a stretcher, as the risk of injury to move them is typically considered too high.","In addition to the injury of the caregiver, injury can occur to the patient during a transfer. An IV pull, a shear injury to a bed sore, bruised or broken bones can result in older and fragile patients.","Additionally, the transfer of patients from a seated position on one surface to a lying position on another surface, or vice versa, is even more complicated. Systems and methods that attempt to address such situations are even more rare. Generally, care givers are left to team up and be as careful as possible in physically lifting and transferring the patient.","As will be appreciated, beyond the transferring of patients, similar issues of moving bodies of significant weight exist. For example, movement of cadavers could pose a similar risk of injury to those attempting to transfer the body. Such bodies could also, in other applications, include animals or large objects.","A system for transferring a body from a first surface to a second surface, the system comprises a housing having a substantially planar top portion configured to support a body and having a substantially planar bottom portion, a bottom translation mechanism disposed at the bottom portion and configured to engage the first surface and the second surface and to translate the system back and forth between the second surface and the first surface, and a top translation mechanism disposed at the top portion and configured to burrow the system between the first surface and the body as the bottom translation means transfers the system from the second surface to the first surface.","The top translation mechanism is configured to rotate the body relative to the top portion, and may include a first translation means and a second translation means, wherein a first translation means speed and direction are controlled by a first drive mechanism and a second translation means speed and direction are controlled by a second drive mechanism. The first drive mechanism may include a first motor and the second drive mechanism may include a second motor. The first translation means may also include a first set of belts driven by the first drive mechanism. The second translation means may also include a second set of belts driven by the second drive mechanism.","The bottom translation mechanism may be configured to rotate the bottom portion relative to the first surface or second surface. The bottom translation mechanism may include a third translation means and a fourth translation means, wherein a third translation means speed and direction are controlled by a third drive mechanism and a fourth translation means speed and direction are controlled by a fourth drive mechanism. The third drive mechanism may include a third motor and the fourth drive mechanism may include a fourth motor. The third translation means may also include a third set of belts driven by the third drive mechanism and the fourth translation means may also include a fourth set of belts driven by the fourth drive mechanism.","The system may also include a control device having a plurality of operator selectable controls configured to control the top translation mechanism and the bottom translation mechanism. The plurality of operator selectable controls may include at least one of a burrow mode control, align mode control, or a transfer mode control. The plurality of operator selectable controls may also include a first direction control configured to cause the system to translate in a first direction and a second direction control configured to translate the system in a second direction, wherein the second direction is substantially opposite the first direction. The plurality of operator selectable controls may also include a clockwise direction control configured to cause the system to rotate in a clockwise direction and a counterclockwise control configured to rotate the system in a counterclockwise direction.","At least one of the top translation mechanism or bottom translation mechanism may include one or more belts, rollers, or wheels. A mat may be disposed between the body and the first surface, wherein the system is configured to burrow between the first surface and the mat and to transfer the body on the mat to the second surface.","In another form in accordance with the present invention, a system for transferring a body from a first surface to a second surface may comprise a housing having an upper portion coupled to a lower portion by a hinge mechanism, wherein the upper portion includes a planar upper top portion configured to support an upper body and a planar upper bottom portion, and wherein the lower portion includes a planar top lower portion configured to support a lower body and a planar bottom lower portion.","The system may also include a lower bottom translation mechanism disposed at the housing lower bottom portion and an upper bottom translation mechanism disposed at the housing upper bottom portion, wherein the lower bottom translation mechanism and the upper bottom translation mechanism cooperate to transfer the system back and forth between the first surface and the second surface. Also included may be a lower top translation mechanism disposed at the housing lower top portion and an upper top translation mechanism disposed at the housing upper top portion, wherein lower top translation mechanism and the upper top translation mechanism are configured to burrow the system between the first surface and the body, as the lower bottom translation mechanism and the upper bottom translation mechanism cooperate to transfer the system from the second surface to the first surface.","The first surface may be comprised of first lower surface at an angle in the range of about 90 to 180 degrees to an adjacent first upper surface and the second surface may be comprised of second lower surface at an angle in the range of about 90 to 180 degrees to an adjacent second upper surface.","The hinge mechanism may include a lock mechanism configured to secure the upper portion at and angle with respect to the lower portion. The lower top translation mechanism may be driven by a first motor and the upper top translation mechanism may be driven by a second motor. The lower bottom translation mechanism may be driven by a third motor and the upper bottom translation mechanism may be driven by a fourth motor. Each translation mechanism may include one or more belts, rollers, or wheels, as examples.","In any of the foregoing, the system may further comprise a translation monitor operatively coupled to the bottom translation mechanism and configured to stop translation of the system in response to a detection of an end of the first surface or the second surface. Alternatively, or additionally, the system may include means to measure the translation distance from the second surface to the first surface and to measure the translation distance from the first surface back to the second surface. In such a case, the translation monitor may be configured to cease translation when the second translation distance is about equal to or greater than the first translation distance.","Also, in any of the foregoing, one or more guard members may be included as a physical barrier to loose items being drawn into the various translation mechanisms.","In accordance with the present invention, a body transfer system and method enable transfer of a body from a first surface to a second surface, without the need for heavy lifting or pulling by individuals or the need for cumbersome pulley or lift systems. The first and second surface may each be substantially flat surfaces, or one or both of the first and second surfaces could be comprised of a plurality of substantially flat surfaces or curved surfaces. To accommodate such surfaces the body transfer system could include one or more pivot, bend or flex points.","FIG. A and  show an embodiment of a body transfer system  in accordance with the present invention. By way of example, and not by limitation, the body transfer system  is sized and shaped to accommodate transfer of a human body, so is shown as being about 5.5 feet to about 6.5 feet or so in length and about 1.5 to 2.5 feet in width. The exact dimensions can be varied, even beyond the exemplary ranges provided here, depending on the size of the bodies intended to be transferred. For example, for unusually tall or wide bodies the length or width or both could be greater. And, as another example, if the size of the bodies intended to be moved are smaller, then the dimensions could be smaller than the ranges provided here. Of course, if the body transfer system is intended for transfer of non-human bodies, e.g., animals, heavy apparatus, and so on, the dimensions would be chosen accordingly.","As can be seen from the perspective view of , at its top surface  the body transfer system  includes a lengthwise central portion  that is substantially flat and also includes two beveled lengthwise outer portions A, B. In the illustrative embodiment, the body transfer system is configured to move in a direction generally normal (or orthogonal) to its length. That is, the body transfer system's motion is generally planar and in the directions of arrows X and Y. Additionally, as will be described in greater detail below, the body transfer system  may also be configured to rotate in the same plane. The outer beveled edges A, B allow the body transfer system  to burrow beneath the body when the body transfer system moves in generally in the direction of arrows X or Y. Although, in other embodiments, if the profile of the body transfer system is sufficiently thin, the beveled edges may be omitted.","The body transfer system  includes a housing that is comprised of a first end  and a second end , with a main housing portion  disposed therebetween. Preferably, the first end  includes a pair of handles A, B to enable easy carrying of the body transfer system. Similarly, the second end  also includes a pair of handles A, B. At least one translation means is disposed at the top surface . The translation means at the top surface  facilitates movement of the body transfer system  relative to the body to be transferred. In the illustrative form, the translation means takes the form of a series of belts. The series of belts is exposed at the top surface  such that they can engage a body or a mat or mattress upon which the body is located. Relative to the body to be transferred, the series of belts causes the body transfer system  to move in a forward direction, such as the direction of arrow X, and in an opposite, or reverse direction, such as the direction of arrow Y.","In this embodiment, the series of belts includes a first set of belts  and a second set of belts . In other embodiments, rather than a series of belts, a single belt could be used. In yet other embodiments, rather than belts, the translation means could be comprised of a series of rollers, wheels or vibratory plates. In the embodiment of , each set of belts  and  includes 3 belts. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, a different number of belts would suffice and it is not imperative that the number of belts in the first set of belts  is the same as the number of belts in the second set of belts . For example, the first set of belts  could be a single belt that could, for example, cover a length of the housing  that is about equivalent to the combined length of the 3 belts that comprise the first set of belts . In other embodiments, a mix of belts and rollers could be used, a mix of belts and wheels could be used, a mix of wheels and rollers could be used or a mix of belts, wheels and rollers could be used. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, there are a variety of combinations of belts, wheels, rollers, vibratory plates or other translation means that could be used alone or in combination, without departing from the present invention.","The translation means includes at least one motor that drives the series of belts. That is, the first set of belts  and second set of belts  could be driven by a single motor. In such a case, rotation of the body transfer system  would not be possible using the single motor. In the preferred form, the first set of belts  is driven by a first motor and the second set of belts  is driven by a second motor. If belts in addition to the first set of belts  and second set of belts  were included at the top portion , then an additional one or more motors could be added, as an example. In an embodiment where there is only a single motor for the top surface translation means, the series of belts could be a single belt that, for example, could cover a length of the housing  that is about equivalent to the span covered by the first and second sets of belts , , i.e., the 6 belts shown.","In the embodiment of , driving the first set of belts  and the second set of belts  with different motors allows rotation of the body transfer system  with respect to the body or mat or mattress upon which the body is located. Rotation is effected by driving each set of belts at different rates or in different directions, or both. Of course, if the translation mechanism included rollers, wheels, vibratory plates or other translation means the number and configuration of motors would be chosen to effect a similar translation result.","As an example, the belts may be seamless semi-elastic polyurethane belts. In this embodiment, where a human body is to be transferred, the tensile strength of the belts is chosen to be about 500 lbs\/inch width with a coefficient of friction of about 0.1 for the inner portion of the belt and about 0.3 for the exposed outer portion of the belt. Although, other types of belts having similar properties may be used, e.g., belts including some amount of rubber or fabric. And, the tensile strength and coefficients of friction may be altered based on any of a variety of factors, for example, the expected coefficient of friction of a mat or mattress that the body transfer system may be intended to burrow under, the range of weights of the bodies intended to be transferred, the geometry of the belts and so on. The belts could be smooth or include protrusions, so long as they are sufficiently contoured to grip and burrow under the body, mat or mattress, as the case may be.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00037","num":"00037"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1B"],"b":["190","100","190","110","110","100","110","110","190","160","170","110","190"]},"The third set of belts  and fourth set of belts  may be comprised of materials having similar properties to those of the first set of belts  and second set of belts . That is, the third set of belts  and fourth set of belts  could be seamless semi-elastic polyurethane belts having a tensile strength of about 500 lbs\/inch width with a coefficient of friction of about 0.1 for the inner portion of the belt and about 0.3 for the exposed outer portion of the belt. Like the first set of belts  and the second set of belts , the third set of belts  and the fourth set of belts  are driven by a third motor and a fourth motor, but different motor arrangements could be used in other embodiments. Having a separate motor drive each of the third and fourth sets of belts allows rotation of the body transfer system  with respect to the surface upon which the body transfer system is located, as discussed above with respect to the first set of belts  and second set of belts .","If separate control of the third set of belts  and forth set of belts  is not desired, then a single motor could be used to drive both sets of belts. Therefore, in a simplified embodiment, one motor could drive the belts at the top surface and a different motor could drive the belts at the bottom surface.","In yet another embodiment, a single motor could drive the belts at the top surface  and the belts at the bottom surface . In such an embodiment, the motor engages each of the top surface belts and bottom surface belts when burrowing underneath, or from underneath, the body, mat, or mattress. In such a case, the top surface belts would move in a first direction (e.g., counter clockwise) and the bottom surface belts would move in an opposite direction (e.g., clockwise) to effect burrowing underneath, or from underneath, the body, mat, or mattress. This can be accomplished with any of a number of typical gear arrangements. When transferring the body from the first surface to the second surface, only the bottom surface belts would be engaged by the motor.","The body transfer system  may also include sheet guards A and B disposed along the length of the outer edges of the bottom surface  that prevent sheets or other materials from getting pulled into the various sets of belts used for transfer and translation. As can be seen from both FIG. A and , the first set of belts  and second set of belts  extend to the outermost edges of the body transfer system , such that they can easily engage and burrow beneath, or from underneath, the body or mat or mattress upon which the body rests.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00042","num":"00042"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["1","140","100","140","140","260","140","140","140","120","110","160","190","120","210","212","160","230","232","140","202"]},"The second end  also includes a first piece A and second piece B that couple to a second end rib (not shown), formed in a manner similar to pieces A and B of the first end . Also, within second end  are disposed two belt drive mechanisms; one to drive the second set of belts  at the top surface  and one to drive the fourth set of belts  at the bottom surface . Each drive mechanism takes the form of a motor assembly. For example, a second motor assembly configured to drive the second set of belts  is comprised of motor  and motor controller .
