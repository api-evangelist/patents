{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to managing media content, and more specifically, to systems, methods and computer products for injecting targeted messages into media content.","2. Description of Related Art","As communication and entertainment technologies continue to evolve, we gain increased access to content of various media types an formats. It would sometimes be useful to have the ability to combine different types of media. However, multimedia mixing has been age old problem. Synchronization, media dynamics, and compatible applications are issues that stand in the way of being able to combine content of differing media types. It is possible to statically mix different media types, either at design-time or at delivery-time, using state-of-art technologies and tools. But the ability to dynamically mix different media types has not been sufficiently addressed.","The inventors recognized the need to mix business content with entertainment Content in a context conducive to business transactions.","Various embodiments of this disclosure overcome the drawbacks of conventional systems and provide the ability to dynamically inject business-content into a media stream based on a current context such as content-context (which segment of the media is being delivered\/rendered), time-context (when the media is delivered\/rendered) or space-context (where the media is delivered\/rendered).","Embodiments disclosed herein address the above stated needs by providing systems, methods and computer products for dynamically obtaining and injecting business-relevant content (such as, advertisement or product advice or training content) into an entertainment content, in a contextual manner, by the content\/media-player. Wherein, the context or features in the entertainment content has been annotated upfront using \u201ctags.\u201d A tag is associated with a program-script (streamed along with the media), which when triggered (based on user-events or timer-event) will obtain the business-relevant content for injection into the entertainment content.","Various embodiments disclosed herein enable dynamic content injection using aspect oriented media programming. Program-scripts (also referred to at scriplets) are embedded in the media content to dynamically obtain and mixing different media types allows the dynamic integration of business-relevant content (such as, advertisement or product advice or training content) and media-based entertainment content. This, in turn, provides businesses with the ability to leverage business-related content in the media. For example, apparel used by an actor in a popular video can be used as the subject of targeted advertisement\/promotion by the promoter of the video. Also, businesses can use the various embodiments to deliver seasonal product advice in the entertainment media. For example, the promoters of the media can dynamically integrate seasonal promotions into the media. Another benefit is the ability to deliver localized product advice in the media. For example, while playing the media at different cities, states or provinces, the locally relevant product advice can be dynamically integrated into the content using one of the various embodiments disclosed herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["107","109","113","115","109","109","123","125","127","123","123"]},"Dynamic content integration by the media rendering components (e.g., Media content orchestrator tool ) or media streaming engines - uses a streaming multimedia format that supports integration of scriplets along with media (audio\/video) content. In addition, a codec  is needed for the scriplets to control the media, and the behavior of the media player. This may be done by providing well defined application programming interfaces (APIs) to be used by the scriptlets. The APIs control the media-player and provide access to other multimedia content-providers from the codec. The APIs can also dynamically mix the media from the other content providers at the media player. Various embodiments also typically feature one or more content hyperlinks configured to execute scriplets based on user-inputs such as mouse-click. Content overlays and mixing may be used to render UI (user interface) components such as HTML Forms, often configured as translucent overlays over the primary media. The content overlays dynamically overlay the secondary media content over the primary media.","The content may be delivered to potential customers in a number of different manners. For example, a user may be able to wirelessly connect to the system and view a menu of available content on a playlist. This allows the users to select the content they most want to experience, thus increasing the likelihood that they may be interested in purchasing products (e.g., cosmetics, clothing, shoes or accessories) featured in the content. Another option for delivery is to allow the users to select from among a playlist of different channels, each with a given theme. For example, music video channels may be provided featuring pop hits, hip-hop, jazz, blues, country and western, classic tunes, or the like.","Various embodiments provide a well defined aspect-oriented framework for media integration that serves to define the join-points and point-cuts in an existing media. The framework also defines advises as scriptlets for controlling the media-player and for dynamic content integration. This may be achieved using an aspect-oriented framework\/architecture where the dynamic business content can be easily interlaced with the existing entertainment oriented media content. The media content may be delivered in a context deemed most effective for selling the product, e.g., an appropriate space or time context. The time-context is the current time of day, year, season, or the like. The space-context is the physical, logical or geographic location of media content delivery.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","201","203","203","203","203","205"]},"In  the system embeds tags into the entertainment content and defines join-points. A media content analysis tool may be used to analyze the content obtained in  and identify features to be tagged. Tagging the content allows the system to distribute business related product advice along with the entertainment content at the proper time or in the correct context within the entertainment content. Tags as mentioned before are bookmark references in time for a digital media that provides information that a spot is available for dynamic content. They are basically in the form of metadata to be associated with the entertainment content which helps to set the context of the content to be delivered. The Content-Orchestrator basically looks into these tags and create\/retrieve the relevant advices\/scriptlets which are to be interlaced with the multimedia content at the content provider end. The \u201cproduct advice\u201d may include an advertisement or information about a product or service for sale, e.g., price or description of the product\/service or its location within a store. Tags strategically positioned at key points in the entertainment content tend to enhance the effectiveness of the product advice associated with the tags, thus increasing the likelihood of making a sale. The products to be advertised may be based on the subject matter currently shown in the entertainment content and\/or a strategically select time within the entertainment content. For example, the entertainment content may be a music video and the product to be advertised may be a pair of shoes worn by the singer that are clearly visible at the point where the tag is inserted. For a time-based tag, the product may not necessarily be visible within the content at the time the tag is inserted, rather, the tag is inserted at a certain point in time\u2014say, 30 seconds from the end\u2014deemed likely to garner a response from potential clients. Join-points are those points that can be used as a reference points (due to content important) and tags are the ways by which join points are implemented in the digital data. When a new media content has to be generated, multiple join points can be combined. This process of combining multiple join points is called point cuts. The tags are associated with product advice for a product to be advertised at a particular point in the entertainment content. In the present context, the \u201cproduct\u201d may be either a good or a service. In some instances the entertainment content may come with one or more tags already embedded. In accordance with various embodiments, the system or organization receiving the content may have the option of using some or all of the existing tags, or adding new tags to the entertainment content.","Upon completing  to embed tags into the entertainment content the method proceeds to . Block  involves the creation of scriplets for the product advice. Upon being executed the scriplets will display (or sound) the product advice into or along with the entertainment content. The product advice may include a picture or video clip of the product (the good or service), a description of the product, its price, its location within the store, and any other relevant information that may increase the likelihood of making a sale. The term scriplet is used throughout this disclosure to mean any sort of software, code, routines or other logic suitable for performing the activities associated with the scriplet. The term scriplet does not imply any particular software language or set of formats. Since product advice may change from time to time the scriplets created in block  are configured to fetch the recent updates. In this way, if the price for the product changes\u2014say, due to a sale being going into effect\u2014the price or other product advice are fetched from a central server by the scriplet to reflect the sale. Upon completing the product advice scriplets in  the method proceeds to .","In block  scriplets are created or otherwise configured for accessing or displaying the product advice. In some embodiments the product advice may be accessed by providing an overlay with a user-selectable access point, for example, a hyperlink that accepts a mouse click to select it. The user-selectable access point may be positioned near the product it is associated with, as it appears in the entertainment content (if at all), or the user-selectable access point may possibly have an arrow or line drawn to the product. The user-selectable access point may include information itself. For example, the hyperlink button itself may be labeled with information about the product, e.g., \u201cshoes on sale, $79.\u201d In other embodiments the product advice may be displayed as a banner ad, a pop-up, or overlay that is seen on top of (or beside) the entertainment content so that the user is not required to take an action (e.g., mouse click on a button) to see the information. In some embodiments there may be one scriplet with the product advice (block ) and another scriplet controlling the way it is seen or accessed (block ). In other embodiments the same scriplet may be used for both the product advice and to control its display\/access. Upon completing  to configure the product advice display overlays or user input access points the method proceeds to .","In block  the scriplets are inserted into the media content. If the media content is streaming media then the scriplets are inserted into an appropriate juncture so as to be available on screen at the appropriate time, e.g., when the associated product is shown or where the tags are positioned. In some embodiments the media player may be configured to load the product scriplets ahead of when they are needed, saving them until the access point or ad is to appear on screen. In other embodiments the scriplets may be inserted into the entertainment content stream at a point near (often slightly before) the point where they are to be active. Once the scriplets are inserted in  the method proceeds to .","Block  monitors for updates to the product advice, tags or other aspects of the content. For example, if a store runs a special promotional sale the price of the product may be reduced, or its position within the store changed, or the product advice may need to be reworded for the promotion. If there is new product advice to display, there are any changes to the current product advice (or to the format in which it is displayed), or product advices is to be deleted, the method proceeds from  along the \u201cModify Advice\u201d path to  to make the desired changes to the existing product advice, or to create a new product advice scriplet. However, if it is determined in  that there is a modification to a tag, or a tag is to be eliminated or added, the method proceeds from  along the \u201cModify Tags\u201d path to modify an existing tag (e.g., change its position) or to add\/delete\/modify a tag. If block  determines that there are no changes then the method proceeds from  along the \u201cNo Updates\u201d path to .","In block  the method determines whether or not the system is to continue distributing the entertainment content with its tags and product advice. If it is determined in  that the entertainment content is to be maintained (e.g., continue airing the streaming video) the method proceeds from  along the \u201cYES\u201d path to . However, if it is determined that the system is to no longer to continue distributing the entertainment content the method proceeds from  along the \u201cNO\u201d branch to . In block  the content is removed from the distribution channel. This may entail, for example, the entertainment content being deleted from the playlist or removed from a rotation of songs being played periodically. Once the content has been removed the method proceeds to  and ends.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["301","303","303","303","305"]},"In block  the system delivers the entertainment content to potential customers. An example of this can be seen in  which depicts a store  with a dynamic content injection system. In some embodiments the system delivers entertainment content by wirelessly streaming it from a broadcast device. In some embodiments the broadcast device is located within the store (e.g., broadcast device  located within store  of ). In other embodiments the broadcasting of entertainment content may be performed from outside of the store. For example, a cellular telephone provider may provide the service to their cellular telephone subscribers. However, In such embodiments the services (e.g., tags with product advice) would be of little use to subscribers not in the vicinity of the store. Therefore, if the broadcasting takes place remotely\u2014that is, from outside the store\u2014then an access means is used to limit access to the entertainment content to those users (potential customers) who are within the store. The access means may be a special code given out in the store needed to receive the remote broadcast, or the access means may be a detection system that detects whether the user is within the store (e.g., cellular signal power level triangulation), or other like system for limiting access to users within the store. Once the system is broadcasting the entertainment content the method proceeds to .","In block  it is determined whether there are any updates for entertainment content, tags or product advice. If there are updates the method proceeds from  along the \u201cYES\u201d path to  to make the appropriate update. Upon completing the update or modification in  (which may include adding new entertainment content, tags or product advice), the method proceeds to  to incorporate the updated content into the playlist. The method then loops back to block . Back in , if it is determined that no updates are needed the method proceeds from  along the \u201cNO\u201d path to .","Block  determines whether to continue delivering content. If content delivery is to continue, as determined in block , the method proceeds from  along the \u201cYES\u201d path back to  to continue broadcasting or otherwise delivering the content. However, if it is determined in  to discontinue content delivery to the users the method proceeds from  along the \u201cNO\u201d path to . In block  the system ceases delivery of the content. The method then proceeds to  and ends.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["401","401","1","3","3"]},"The store  has located within it a dynamic content injection system , various features of which are described in the paragraphs above. The system  is connected to a broadcast device  which is also located within the store . Various embodiments may use different types of broadcast devices, including for example, cellular telephone broadcast devices, wireless computer nodes, infrared broadcast devices, or other like types of communication devices capable of sending signals with information or data. For example, the broadcast device  may be digital or analog, and may be implemented using various encoding schemes or transmission technologies e.g., wi-fi, FDMA, TDMA, CDMA, GSM, IP telephony through wi-fi, or a hybrid or these or other like schemes. The broadcast device  is connected to dynamic content injection system , typically implemented in a computer such as that depicted in . The system  may be connected to an outside communication system, network or other source of data  such as the Internet, PSTN, cable television system, or other such communication system.","In the example of  the broadcast device  sends signals containing the entertainment content to smartphone . In some embodiments users may receive the signals on computers such as laptop computer . The following example about Alice, a typical consumer, highlights the relevance of an aspect oriented media programming framework in today's world. Alice, like many young people of today, enjoys listening to pop songs. Alice is also an avid shopper, visiting store  almost every day. The store  where Alice shops has its own in-house entertainment system  where the shoppers can subscribe to and view\/listen to the latest music and video for free using their mobile-phone. Alice subscribed to the songs of Shania Twain, her favorite artist. In her latest song Shania wore new accessories and new clothing style, all of which store  has picked up for seasonal promotion.","The store  uses an embodiment disclosed herein to promote the new clothing range and accessories by interlacing Shania's video and songs with the related merchandizing content the location of those products in the mall, and possibly other related promotional contents as well. Doing this should help store  reach its sales goals. Upon seeing the video, Alice becomes interested in purchasing the clothing style worn by Shania. The interlaced in-video merchandizing content helps Alice to locate Shania's style of clothing and accessories within store \u2014in this example, Shania's shoes  located on aisle .","In this example, store  was able to provide this functionality by leveraging the pre-defined \u201ctags\u201d (or join-points) in Shania's video. Store  uses a studio (or a tool) to program the video with appropriate \u201cadvice\u201d (or scriplets), for these join-points. In some embodiments these product advices are executed by a specialty designed codec (e.g., codec  of ) of the media-player in response to the media player encountering the tag in the video. In other embodiments the product advices is formatted within the content in such a way that it can be decoded by a standard codec suitable for viewing (or listening to) the entertainment content. This new format of promotion with the streaming media helps merchants to sell predefined items faster by providing an entertaining experience to the customers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","500"]},"Computer system  includes a processor  which may be embodied as a microprocessor, two or more parallel processors, central processing unit (CPU) or other such control logic or circuitry.
