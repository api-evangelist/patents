title: Communicating through a server between appliances and applications
abstract: A method and apparatus for communicating between electrical appliances (e.g. smoke detectors, thermostats, refrigerators, TV program recorders, lawn/garden sprinkler systems, irrigation control systems, etc.) and cloud-based applications (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, email, SMS, etc.) includes a server that translates communications between the communication protocols used by the appliances and applications. The electrical appliances include a minimum complexity necessary to perform their primary functions and to communicate with the server. Additional complexity necessary for the electrical appliances to communicate with the cloud-based applications is enabled by the server remote from the electrical appliances.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["Many home or office electrical appliances or embedded devices (e.g. thermostats, refrigerators, ovens, alarms, etc.) could be enhanced by a connection to the Internet through which these appliances could be updated, monitored and\/or controlled remotely. It has been suggested that such remote access could occur through existing Internet or World Wide Web (WWW) services, such as email, SMS (Short Message Service), Facebook, Twitter, etc. For the electrical appliances to communicate through these services, the various protocols used by these services must be programmed into the electrical appliances. To enable these capabilities, such feature-rich electrical appliances must have relatively large microprocessors with sufficient memory resources to host the various required software and networking services.","Many of these types of electrical appliances have already been developed with microprocessors, memory and other components for controlling the general functions of these appliances without the addition of any networking or external communication capability. These components have, thus, become common core components of such appliances. These components, however, are relatively small and under-powered for the more resource-intensive activities required to adequately handle the types of Internet and WWW services that the appliance manufacturers expect their customers to want in network-capable electrical appliances. It is necessary, therefore, for the appliance manufacturers to undertake a significant redesign of the core components of their electrical appliances in order to add the networking or external communication capability. There is, thus, a trend to increase the internal complexity (greater feature-richness) of many types of electrical appliances. Such increased complexity and redesign efforts often delay the introduction of a new product into the market. Additionally, both the redesign work and the larger more powerful components generally increase the overall cost and size of the electrical appliances, which consumers often prefer to be relatively small and cheap.","Furthermore, since new Internet and WWW services are occasionally developed, customers will expect their existing network-capable appliances to be able to work with the new services, even though the new services may not have even existed when the customers bought the various appliances. Network-capable appliances, therefore, must also have an upgrading or updating capability by which new protocols for the new Internet and WWW services can be added to the appliances after the appliances have been sold into the market and installed in customers' homes or offices. Such upgradability adds an additional layer of complexity and cost to the electrical appliances.","Additionally, a significant degree of uncertainty accompanies such capabilities, since the appliance manufacturers cannot reasonably anticipate all of the new Internet and WWW services that could come into existence after the appliances have entered the marketplace. It is necessary, therefore, for the manufacturers to overdesign the appliances in order to ensure that the appliances can be fully upgraded to the satisfaction of their customers for the reasonably expected lifetime of the product. Otherwise, the appliances will have limited flexibility to support new protocols emerging on the Internet or WWW.","The present invention enables apparently-feature-rich electrical appliances, embedded devices and\/or a server to provide a flexible path for connectivity to Internet or WWW services through existing and emerging (future) communication protocols.","Various embodiments of the present invention generally include electrical appliances (or embedded devices), a server or both to mitigate or eliminate some or all of the above described problems (among others). In contrast to the existing trend to increase the complexity of electrical appliances to be able to communicate with many Web-based applications, the electrical appliances generally communicate only with the server. The server remotely enables the capability to communicate with various Internet or WWW or \u201ccloud\u201d based services or applications en masse.","Since the electrical appliances preferably communicate only with the server, the electrical appliances generally have a relatively minimum degree of complexity necessary to transmit and receive communications in whatever protocol is used between the electrical appliances and the server. When the electrical appliances need to communicate with or through any Internet or WWW or cloud-based services, the server translates the communications between the protocol used by the electrical appliances and the various communication protocols used by the Internet or WWW or cloud-based services.","Since the electrical appliances communicate in such a limited number of protocols (e.g. only one or two), the electrical appliances do not require relatively large or numerous or expensive components, as described above for the prior art feature-rich electrical appliances. Instead, the electrical appliances can generally make do with smaller cheaper microprocessors, memory and other components. (In some embodiments, the electrical appliances can use the relatively small microprocessors used by the prior art electrical appliances that do not have networking or external communication capabilities.) A communication module and an API (application programming interface for the existing microprocessor to operate the communication module) are, thus, the only components that need to be added to such electrical appliances to enable features of the present invention for some embodiments.","The extra complexity needed for the electrical appliances to communicate with the various current and future Internet or WWW or cloud-based services and applications is enabled by the server remote from the electrical appliances. In some embodiments, the electrical appliances do not even need to have any internal means to determine the services and applications with which they communicate. All such controls and settings are preferably managed within the server. Additionally, the ability to upgrade the appliances to be able to communicate with later-introduced applications is preferably handled entirely within the server, so nothing needs to be added to the appliances to enable such upgrades. Therefore, in some embodiments, the appliances can be designed for only a minimal upgrades, e.g. to fix bugs in the API or the communication module.","Server technologies generally enable a high degree of flexibility, scalability, upgradeability and security with an economy of scale unmatchable by having such capabilities or features built in to the electrical appliances. Such issues are, thus, of almost negligible significance or importance in some embodiments of the present invention.","A more complete appreciation of the present disclosure and its scope, and the manner in which it achieves the above noted improvements, can be obtained by reference to the following detailed description of presently preferred embodiments taken in connection with the accompanying drawings, which are briefly summarized below, and the appended claims.","A communication system  incorporating an embodiment of the present invention is shown in . The communication system  generally includes a cloud service server (the server) , a variety of electrical appliances ,  and , a variety of Internet, WWW or cloud-based services (the cloud-based applications) , , ,  and , a variety of electronic devices ,  and  and a management console . The components - generally communicate through the Internet, the World Wide Web (WWW) or a network \u201ccloud\u201d (the cloud) , except where it is appropriate or more convenient to use another communication technique as described herein.","The Internet is generally a global data communications system. It is a hardware and software infrastructure that provides connectivity between computers. In contrast, the Web is generally one of the services communicated via the Internet. It is generally a collection of interconnected documents and other resources, linked by hyperlinks and URLs. In many technical illustrations when the precise location or interrelation of Internet resources is not important, extended networks such as the Internet are often depicted as a cloud (e.g.  in ). The verbal image has been formalized in the newer concept of cloud computing. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides a definition of cloud computing as \u201ca model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.\u201d Although the Internet, the Web and cloud computing are not exactly the same, these terms are generally used interchangeably herein, and they are referred to collectively as the cloud .","The electrical appliances - may be any appropriate devices, such as smoke detectors, thermostats (e.g. ), refrigerators, TV program recorders, lawn\/garden sprinkler systems, irrigation control systems, ovens or stoves (e.g. ), water heaters, clocks and many others. Such devices generally have relatively little computing resources in them. Thus, they are typically very resource-constrained devices. In some cases, they are referred to as embedded devices, since they include a sort of computer system embedded in a device that includes other components for performing specific or dedicated primary functions of the device. Herein, these devices are referred to collectively as the electrical appliances -.","The cloud-based applications - are generally any appropriate services or applications that are accessible through any part of the cloud . Some examples of such applications include Facebook (e.g. ), Twitter (e.g. ), MySpace, email (e.g. ), Short Message Service (e.g. SMS ) and many others.","The electronic devices - are generally any appropriate devices that have access to the cloud , such as personal computers (workstation, desktop, laptop, tablet, iPad, e.g.  and ), cell phones (e.g. ), Kindles, Blackberrys, iPhones, iPods, other PDAs (personal digital assistants), game consoles and many others. These devices - are preferably feature-rich with respect to communication capabilities, i.e. have built in capabilities to access the cloud  and almost any of the cloud-based applications - or can be loaded with, or programmed to have, such capabilities. The electronic devices - generally preferably access any part of the cloud  through industry standard wired or wireless access points, cell phone cells or network nodes. In some embodiments, users preferably register to use the communication system  through their electronic devices - in order to access their electrical appliances -.","The server  is generally any appropriate computer or bank of computers operating server programs that enable access via the cloud  to data and applications stored or running therein. The server  generally implements the features that enable the electrical appliances - to communicate with the cloud-based applications - as described herein. All communications from the electrical appliances - are directed to the server . All communications from the cloud-based applications -, even though these communications typically indicate one of the electrical appliances - as an intended recipient, are also directed to the server .","Depending on the embodiment, users, owners or managers (collectively \u201cusers\u201d) of the electrical appliances - generally include homeowners (and some renters) and businesses (and some owners, managers or employees thereof) that have the electrical appliances - in their homes, offices or any other appropriate facilities. Additionally, in some embodiments, users may also include the designers or manufacturers or sellers of the electrical appliances -. The users access the electrical appliances - either directly at the electrical appliances - (e.g. with a user interface panel or keypad) or with their electronic devices - through the cloud-based applications - and through the server .","Regardless of how a user accesses the electrical appliances -, in various embodiments, some of the functions of the server  are generally invisible to the user. In some such embodiments, therefore, the user may get the impression that the electrical appliances - are feature-rich. In other words, the electrical appliances - may appear to have a level of complexity of functionality greater than is actually built in to the electrical appliances - (i.e. they appear able to perform functions that they are not in fact capable of), such as communicating directly with the cloud-based applications - through the cloud . From another point of view, due to functionality of the electronic devices - in conjunction with functionality enabled by the server  remote from the electrical appliances -, the electronic devices - may present an appearance to the users of communicating directly with, or directly accessing, the electrical appliances - through the cloud-based applications -.","The overall apparent complexity of features of the electrical appliances - is generally similar to or even better than that of the prior art feature-rich electrical appliances. However, the electrical appliances - are significantly simpler and cheaper than the prior art feature-rich electrical appliances, while much of the complexity of features are basically offloaded to the server .","In various preferred embodiments, the server  communicates with the electrical appliances - in just one dedicated specific communication protocol. This limitation ensures that the electrical appliances - have a minimum level of complexity and cost. In some other embodiments, however, the server  and the electrical appliances - may use more than one communication protocol, generally depending on the needs of the manufacturers of the electrical appliances -, but still preferably as few communication protocols as possible. Additionally, in order to maintain the simplicity and hold down the cost of the electrical appliances - in most embodiments (in contrast to the prior art trend of increasing complexity), it is preferable for each electrical appliance - to use only one communication protocol, regardless of the number of protocols the server  uses to communicate with the various types of electrical appliances -. Furthermore, in some embodiments, although the electrical appliances - use only a single protocol to transmit to the server  the application data that is intended for the cloud-based applications -, the electrical appliances - may user other communication protocols to transmit other types of data, such as data for authentication or registration of the electrical appliances -.","Each cloud-based application - generally uses a different communication protocol. The server  is capable of communicating in any of the communication protocols used by the cloud-based applications -. The server , thus, translates communications between the protocols used by the cloud-based applications - and the protocol used by the electrical appliances - whenever any of the electrical appliances - needs to communicate with any of the cloud-based applications -, and vice versa. Therefore, it is generally unnecessary for the electrical appliances - to have the ability to generate communications in any of the various protocols used by the cloud-based applications -.","To enable the protocol translation feature of the server , the server  maintains rules, settings or configuration data (collectively \u201crules\u201d) for each of the electrical appliances -. Whenever the server  receives a communication from an electrical appliance -, the server  looks up the corresponding rules for that electrical appliance - to determine how to handle the received communication. The rules for the sending electrical appliance -, for instance, may indicate one (or more) of the cloud-based applications - (and one or more end users\/customers\/clients of the cloud-based applications -) that is supposed to receive any status updates or other types of communications from that electrical appliance -. The server  then translates the communication into the appropriate protocol and transmits the translated communication to the correct (target) cloud-based application(s) -. Therefore, not only is it generally unnecessary for the electrical appliances - to have the ability to generate communications in any of the various protocols used by the cloud-based applications -, but it is also unnecessary for the electrical appliances - to store (or include in outgoing communications) any information that identifies the target cloud-based applications - (or target users thereof), according to preferred embodiments. In other words, the electrical appliances - are generally \u201capplication agnostic\u201d, i.e. have no knowledge of the cloud-based applications -.","On the other hand, communications from the cloud-based applications - generally need to identify the target electrical appliance -. After all, each of the various cloud-based applications - may routinely communicate with many different electrical appliances -, and the server  needs to have a way to determine the intended recipient of each communication from the cloud-based applications -. Consequently, the cloud-based applications - (or the electronic devices -, depending on the embodiment) preferably maintain some sort of identifier for the electrical appliances - with which they communicate. When the server  receives a communication from one of the cloud-based applications -, therefore, the server  parses the received communication to determine the intended recipient electrical appliance -. Additionally, the server  also preferably looks up the rules for the intended recipient electrical appliance - to determine whether the sending cloud-based application - (or the originating electronic device -, depending on the embodiment) is authorized to communicate with the intended recipient electrical appliance -.","Additionally, when a new cloud-based application is developed and introduced, the server  is preferably upgraded to be able to receive communications in a new communication protocol for the new cloud-based application and to translate communications between the new protocol and the protocol used by the electrical appliances -. The flexibility, scalability and upgradeability of current server technology renders the task of adding new cloud-based application protocols to the server  relatively quick and easy, especially compared to the prior art task of upgrading each of the prior art feature-rich electrical appliances to be able to communicate directly with new cloud-based applications.","Although, according to preferred embodiments, the electrical appliances - communicate directly only with the server , some embodiments may allow the communication protocol of the electrical appliances - to be the same as a communication protocol used by one of the cloud-based applications - or to be a communication protocol useable by one or more types of the electronic devices -. This situation may especially arise if the protocol used by the electrical appliances - is a widely available industry standard communication protocol. Therefore, some embodiments may allow the electrical appliances - to communicate directly with some of the electronic devices - or one of the cloud-based applications - in addition to communicating with or through the server . According to some preferred embodiments, the electrical appliances - are preferably preconfigured at time of manufacture with a communication address (e.g. a URL, an IP address, etc.) for communicating with the server  and may or may not have the ability to upgrade or change or add to the preconfigured communication address. Including the ability to add to or change the target communication address would only slightly (almost insignificantly) increase the complexity and cost of the electrical appliances -.","The management console , according to some embodiments, is generally a Web-based application through which a user may control or manage the server . Additionally, the management console  may be separate from or integrated into the functions of the server . Furthermore, the management console  may communicate with the server  through the cloud  or through a point-to-point connection, a LAN, a WAN or any other appropriate communication technique. Also, different versions of the management console  may be accessible depending on the type of the electronic device - used to access it, e.g. different versions of the management console  may be written specifically for mobile or non-mobile devices, devices with or without keyboards\/pads, devices using different operating systems or Web browsers, etc.","In some embodiments, a new or current user generally browses to a Web site (or set of Web sites or pages) to access the management console . In some embodiments, a new user preferably registers, or creates a user account, upon initially accessing the management console . After registering, the user preferably identifies one or more of the user's electrical appliances -, e.g. by entering one or more unique ID numbers or key codes for the user's electrical appliances -. The user can then enter commands, make selections or configure settings for the user's electrical appliances - whenever the user logs into the appropriate account. Alternatively, the user can make such entries for a particular type of the electrical appliances - (e.g. entering default settings by a manufacturer or seller of the electrical appliances -) or for groups of electrical appliances -. Many of the rules for handling communications to or from the electrical appliances - may thus be set through the management console . Additionally, in some embodiments, before a new electrical appliance - is introduced to the marketplace, a designer or manufacturer of the new electrical appliance - may use the management console  to configure the server  (if necessary) to be able to properly handle communications to or from the new electrical appliance -. Furthermore, in some embodiments, the management console  may be an available means (or the only means) by which a user can initially configure (e.g. set up initial rules for communicating with the cloud-based applications -) a newly purchased and installed electrical appliance - before the first time the user attempts to access the new electrical appliance - through any of the cloud-based applications -.","An example electrical appliance , which may be any of the aforementioned electrical appliances -, incorporating an embodiment of the present invention, is shown in . The electrical appliance  generally includes a communication module , a microcontroller unit (MCU) , a user interface  and various primary function components and circuitry . These particular components - (and those introduced below) of the electrical appliance  are shown for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. Other types or combinations or configurations of components may also be used. Additionally, the illustrated components - may each represent one or more other more specific components, not shown for simplicity. Furthermore, some of the illustrated components - (or subcomponents thereof) may be combined into a single component or integrated circuit (IC) as appropriate.","The communication module , the user interface  and the various primary function components and circuitry  are preferably connected to the MCU  in any appropriate manner, such as by point-to-point connections or via a common bus. The communication module , for example, preferably connects to the MCU  via a separate dedicated bus (e.g. SPI or UART). However, it is understood that the present invention is not so limited. Rather, other forms of interconnection may be used.","The various primary function components and circuitry  generally perform the primary functions of the electrical appliance , such as the customary functions of a thermostat, an oven, a TV program recorder, etc. Among other functions, the MCU  generally controls the various primary function components and circuitry , e.g. turns on an air conditioner unit, sets a temperature of an oven, starts recording a TV program on a desired channel, etc. Among other functions, the user interface  presents a set of displays, buttons, switches, knobs, etc. that a user can use to set the manner in which the main processor unit  controls the various primary function components and circuitry .","According to the illustrated embodiment, the MCU  generally includes a CPU (central processing unit)  and a memory , among other possible components not shown. These particular components  and  are shown for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. Other types or combinations or configurations of components may also be used. Additionally, the illustrated components  and  may each represent one or more other more specific components, not shown for simplicity. Furthermore, some of the illustrated components  and  (or subcomponents thereof) may be combined into a single component or IC as appropriate. The memory , for example, may represent any appropriate combination of one or more RAM, ROM, flash memory, hard drive and\/or any other type of persistent storage or dynamic memory components.","Among other functions, the CPU  generally performs the functions of the MCU  (e.g. controls the various primary function components and circuitry ) according to programs  and settings  stored in the memory . Additionally, the CPU  preferably stores status data generated from the various primary function components and circuitry  in the memory  for later transmission to the server  (and from there to the cloud-based applications - and ultimately to the electronic devices -).","The memory  also preferably contains an API (application programming interface)  that includes drivers that the CPU  uses to control the communication module . Under instructions from the API , the CPU  assembles data to be sent to the server  in periodic status updates or in response to requests from the server  or under any other appropriate situations. The communication module  receives this data and generates the communications in the appropriate protocol and transmits the communications through an available wired or wireless network access point (such as an Ethernet port, an IEEE 802.11 transceiver, etc.) to the cloud  and thus to the server . The communication module  also receives the communications from the server  through the network access point and passes the received communications to the CPU  and\/or the memory  in the MCU . Under instructions from the API , the CPU  uses data or commands in the received communications to control the various primary function components and circuitry , configure the settings  or upgrade the programs  or the API .","In some embodiments, the data to be sent to the server  may also represent instructions or selections provided through the user interface  (by a user) for settings or changes to the rules that the server  uses to determine how to respond to communications between the electrical appliance  and the cloud-based applications -. In some embodiments, the user is not explicitly made aware that the instructions or selections are being passed to the server  without being stored in the electrical appliance . The user may, thus, get the impression that the electrical appliance  has complexity or is capable of functions that it does not actually have. In other words, the offloading of functions or complexity to the server  may be transparent to or hidden from the user.","In some embodiments, the communication module  generally includes a data link layer , a CPU  and a memory , among other possible components. These particular components - are shown for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. Other types or combinations or configurations of components may also be used. Additionally, the illustrated components - may each represent one or more other more specific components, not shown for simplicity. Furthermore, some of the illustrated components - (or subcomponents thereof) may be combined into a single component or IC as appropriate.","The data link layer  preferably includes an appropriate MAC (Media Access Controller) for communicating (wired or wireless) with the network access point. The memory  generally contains programs and data that the CPU  uses to control the functions of the communication module , e.g. generating the outgoing communications in the appropriate protocol, transmitting outgoing and receiving incoming communications and parsing (to whatever extent is appropriate in the communication module ) the incoming messages. Additionally, since the existence of the server  is known prior to manufacturing the electrical appliance , the communication address for the server  can preferably be preloaded into the memory  (alternatively in the memory ), so the electrical appliance  is fully capable of immediately contacting the server  as soon as the electrical appliance  is connected to the network access point and turned on. Furthermore, the memory  is preferably preloaded with a unique ID number or key code that identifies the electrical appliance  and which is included in any communication to the server , so the server  can look up the correct rules upon receiving the communications from the electrical appliance .","In alternative embodiments in which the communication module  is more deeply integrated with other components of the electrical appliance  than is suggested by , the MCU  may perform the functions of the CPU , and the memory  may perform the functions of the memory . In a preferred embodiment, however, the configuration of the communication module  (as illustrated and described) enables a designer or manufacturer of a prior art non-network-capable electrical appliance to perform a relatively simple and easy redesign that merely adds the communication module  (potentially just a single IC chip) and the API  to the existing electrical appliance, along with some relatively minor modifications to the programs . In this manner (in addition to the fact that much of the apparent complexity of the electrical appliance  actually resides in the server ), the development time and costs for bringing the electrical appliance  to market can be minimized or reduced when compared to that for a prior art feature-rich electrical appliance.","A simplified example functional diagram of the server , incorporating an embodiment of the present invention, is shown in . Functional components of the server  generally include an appliance interface , a control interface , an application interface , a description of available applications , one or more protocol translators , a rules manager , one or more rules tables or storage (the rules table)  and a description of available appliances . These particular functional components - of the server  are shown for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. Other types or combinations or configurations of functional components may also be used. Additionally, the illustrated functional components - may each represent one or more other more specific hardware or software components, not shown for simplicity. Furthermore, some of the illustrated functional components - (or subcomponents thereof) may be combined into a single component as appropriate.","The appliance interface  generally represents components and programs that connect to the cloud  to transmit and receive the communications to and from the electrical appliances - and  and that handle the incoming communications from the electrical appliances - and  and generate the outgoing communications to the electrical appliances - and . The application interface  generally represents components and programs that connect to the cloud  to transmit and receive the communications to and from the cloud-based applications - and that handle the incoming communications from the cloud-based applications - and generate the outgoing communications to the cloud-based applications -. The control interface  generally represents components and programs that connect to the management console  (optionally through the cloud ) to transmit and receive the communications to and from the management console  and that handle the incoming communications from the management console  and generate the outgoing communications to the management console . The protocol translators  generally represents components and programs used to offload various compute or memory intensive tasks from the electrical appliances - and , to implement any protocols required to communicate with the cloud-based applications - and to translate communications between the protocol(s) used by the electrical appliances - and  and the protocols used by the cloud-based applications -. The description of available applications  generally includes data and programs used by the protocol translators  to translate the communications between protocols. The rules table  generally contains the rules used by the appliance interface  and the application interface  to determine how to handle or respond to the communications from the electrical appliances - and  and the cloud-based applications -, respectively. The rules manager  generally represents components and programs that update the rules table  when new rules settings are received through any of the interfaces -. The description of available appliances  generally includes data (e.g. lists of operating parameters or lists of allowable cloud-based applications - that may be used for designated types of the electrical appliances - and ) used by the rules manager  to determine allowable rules in the rules table  for the electrical appliances - and .","When a user accesses the management console  to manage rules or settings for a previously registered electrical appliance - or , the management console  retrieves any current rules through the control interface  from the rules table . The user preferably has to login or identify desired electrical appliance - or  in a Web form, so the management console  can look up the correct electrical appliance - or  in the rules table . If the user identifies an electrical appliance - or  for which there is no entry in the rules table , then the management console  may so inform the user and present a blank Web form for the user to register or enter initial information (such as a type designation) for the new electrical appliance - or  in anticipation of the electrical appliance - or  eventually being activated and contacting the server . (After receiving the type designation, the management console  can generate a blank Web form specifically for that type of electrical appliance - or  as determined by allowable rules for the type of electrical appliance - or  retrieved from the description of available appliances .) Alternatively, the management console  may refuse to accept any information for an electrical appliance - or  for which there is no entry in the rules table . (This alternative may prevent hackers from trying to flood the rules table  with bogus entries, perhaps in anticipation of trying to take control of another person's electrical appliance - or  as soon as it is activated and contacts the server .) If there is an entry in the rules table  for the desired electrical appliance - or  (and the user has passed any security measures), then the user may be presented with a Web form showing the current rules. If the user then makes changes to any of the rules, then the management console  preferably transmits the changes through the control interface  to the rules manager . The rules manager  then updates the rules table  with the desired changes (possibly after confirming that the requested changes are allowable, e.g. within a given range for certain parameters, as indicated by the description of available appliances ).","A user (e.g. an employee of a designer or manufacturer of one of the electrical appliances - and ) may access the management console  to manage the description of available appliances . For example, the data for a type of electrical appliance - or  already in the description of available appliances  may have to be updated or upgraded. Also, data for a new type of electrical appliance - or  may have to be added to the description of available appliances .","A user may also access the management console  to manage the description of available applications . For example, the data and programs used by the protocol translators  to translate the communications involving protocols for a cloud-based application - already in the description of available applications  may have to be updated or upgraded. Also, data and programs for the protocol translators  to translate the communications involving new protocols for a new cloud-based application - may have to be added to the description of available applications .","A simplified diagram of example entries in an example rules table  is shown in , according to an embodiment of the present invention. The rules table  generally shows individual appliance entries  and an appliance group entry  with a variety of fields in each. It is understood that these types of rules table entries  and  and fields are for illustrative purposes only and not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. Other types or combinations of rules table entries and fields may depend on the types of electrical appliances - and  and\/or the desires of appliance manufacturers or designers. Additionally, the rules table  may represent multiple databases, each containing different sets of information, but which are combined herein for simplicity of description.","Each individual appliance entry  represents a different corresponding individual electrical appliance - or . Each electrical appliance - or  is preferably identified by a unique ID number or key code (described above) in an appliance ID number field  in each corresponding individual appliance entry . Each entry  preferably has an address field  that contains a communication address, with which the server  can properly address communications intended for the corresponding individual electrical appliance - or . Each entry  also preferably has a type designation field  that contains data that identifies the type of the corresponding individual electrical appliance - or , which can be used, for example, to look up the allowable rules for the type of the electrical appliance - or , as indicated in the description of available appliances . Each entry  also preferably has a security key field  that contains a security key code or password set by the corresponding individual electrical appliance - or  or the manufacturer or user thereof to prevent unauthorized access to the electrical appliance - or . Each entry  also preferably has a sharing rights field  that contains a code that indicates who (e.g. only the user, the user and specified friends, the entire public, etc.) can access the corresponding individual electrical appliance - or  to view the status or settings and\/or to change the settings thereof. Each entry  also preferably has an appliance settings field  that contains data that indicates the operational settings for the corresponding individual electrical appliance - or , e.g. thermostat heating and cooling thresholds, oven baking temperature, water sprinkler duration, etc. Each entry  also preferably has one or more application fields  containing data indicating which of the cloud-based applications - can communicate with the corresponding individual electrical appliance - or . Each entry  also preferably has one or more user fields  containing data identifying the user(s) of the corresponding individual electrical appliance - or .","Each appliance group entry  represents a different corresponding group of electrical appliances - and  that are preferably operated with some or all rules the same. Managing the electrical appliances - and  as a group, therefore, enables a user to make only a few settings in the rules table  through the management console  or the cloud-based applications - in order to quickly and efficiently affect a large number of the electrical appliances - and . Each appliance group entry  preferably has an appliance group ID field  that contains a unique ID number or key code that identifies the corresponding group of electrical appliances - and . Each appliance group entry  also preferably has a list of appliance IDs field  that contains the unique ID number or key code (described above) that identifies each individual electrical appliance - and  in the corresponding group of electrical appliances - and .

Alternatively, the unique ID numbers or key codes contained in the list of appliance IDs field  may point to an entry  for each individual electrical appliance - and  in the corresponding group of electrical appliances - and . This alternative may result in considerable duplication or redundancy in data, but enables the ability to set some of the rules different for selected ones of the individual electrical appliances - and  in the corresponding group of electrical appliances - and .","A simplified flowchart of a process , incorporating an embodiment of the present intention, for the server  to handle a communication received from one of the electrical appliances - or  is shown in .

Other types, combinations, performers or orders of steps are possible.","According to this embodiment, the process  starts (at ) upon identifying a communication as having come from one of the electrical appliances - or  and routing the communication to the appliance interface . After the appliance interface  receives (at ) the communication, the appliance interface  determines (at ) the type of the communication. For example, the communication may be the first communication from the electrical appliance - or , the communication may be a request to set one or more of the rules in the rules table  or the communication may contain data that is destined for one of the cloud-based applications -.","To be the first communication from the electrical appliance - or , as determined at , the communication may specifically identify itself as coming from a new electrical appliance - or  or the appliance interface  may unsuccessfully attempt to look up the electrical appliance - or  in the rules table . In either case, the appliance interface  may respond (if allowed) by causing (at ) an entry  to be generated in the rules table  for the electrical appliance - or . Additionally, the appliance interface  may perform (at ) any appropriate initial default response, such as sending to the electrical appliance - or  any outstanding upgrades for the API  or the programs .","If the communication is a request to set one or more of the rules in the rules table , as determined at , then the appliance interface  preferably instructs the rules manager  to update (at ) the rules table  accordingly. The appliance interface  may then perform (at ) any additional response. For example, the rules table  may have a field in the entry  for this electrical appliance - or  that requires the application interface  to send a communication to a designated cloud-based application - alerting the user of the rules update.","If the communication contains data that is destined for one of the cloud-based applications -, as determined at , then the appliance interface  preferably looks up (at ) the corresponding entry  in the rules table  and selects (at ) the cloud-based application(s) - indicated in the application field(s) . The appliance interface  then preferably causes the protocol translator(s)  to translate (at ) the communication from the protocol used by the electrical appliance - or  into the protocol(s) used by the selected cloud-based application(s) -. The appliance interface  then preferably causes the application interface  to send (at ) the translated communication(s) to the selected cloud-based application(s) -.

After the application interface  receives (at ) the communication, the application interface  determines (at ) whether it can identify (e.g. by a look up in the rules table ) the target electrical appliance - or , the sending cloud-based application - and\/or the sender (e.g. the electronic device -) of the communication. If not, then the application interface  preferably sends (at ) an error message back to the sender, e.g. indicating that the target electrical appliance - or  cannot be found or that the sending cloud-based application - is not supported or that the sender is not a registered user of the communication system .","If the determination at  is positive, then the application interface  preferably further determines (at ) whether the sending cloud-based application - and the sender are authorized to communicate with the target electrical appliance - or . If not, then the application interface  preferably sends (at ) an appropriate error message back to the sender indicating the lack of authorization. However, if the determination at  is positive, then the application interface  preferably further determines (at ) the type of the communication. For example, the communication may simply be to find out whether the target electrical appliance - or  has established a connection to the server , the communication may be a request to set one or more of the rules in the rules table  or the communication may contain data or instructions that is destined for one of the electrical appliances - or .","If the communication is simply to find the target electrical appliance - or , as determined at , then the application interface  preferably performs (at ) a look up in the rules table  to find if there is an entry  for the target electrical appliance - or . The application interface  then performs (at ) whatever response is allowed in this case. For example, if the sender is the user or has sharing rights, then the application interface  may send a response communication back to the sender indicating that the target electrical appliance - or  has been found and supplying any allowable or available details about the status of the target electrical appliance - or . On the other hand, if the entry  for the target electrical appliance - or  does not indicate any users, then the application interface  can treat the current communication as a rightful attempt to establish user authority over the target electrical appliance - or , though the application interface  may require entry of a security code before establishing user authority.","If the communication is a request to set one or more of the rules in the rules table , as determined at , then the application interface  preferably instructs the rules manager  to update (at ) the rules table  accordingly. Confirmation of the update may also be returned to the sender.","If the communication contains data that is destined for the target electrical appliance - or , as determined at , then the application interface  preferably verifies (at ) whether the type of message that is desired to be sent to the target electrical appliance - or  is allowed. If not, then an appropriate error message is preferably sent (at ) back to the sender. However, if the verification at  is positive, then the application interface  preferably causes the protocol translator  to translate (at ) the communication into the protocol used by the target electrical appliance - or .
