title: Calibration apparatus, methods and applications
abstract: An inertial sensor calibration method and inertial sensor calibration apparatus. One or more diffraction patterns are generated by one or more fixed and/or moveable gratings (inertial sensors) illuminated by an atomically stabilized source attached to a base and detected by an imager. The grating and/or inertial sensor has a designed parameter value and an actual respective parameter value, such as motion or distance that can be determined upon ultra-precise measurement. Such ultra-precise measurement can be used to calibrate the grating or inertial sensor.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application is related to, and derives priority from, U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/482,852 filed 5 May 2011, and titled \u201cATOMIC STABILIZED OPTICAL APPARATUS, METHODS AND APPLICATIONS,\u201d the content of which is incorporated herein fully by reference.","This invention was funded under DARPA Grant #N66001-08-1-2074 and US Army-DOD (ARMY) Grant #W31P4Q-12-1-0003. The U.S. Government has certain rights in the invention.","Field of the Invention","Embodiments of the invention relate generally to calibration and metrology apparatus, methods, and applications. More particularly, embodiments relate to apparatus and methods for calibrating actual parameters such as motion and distance, based on respective design parameters, and metrology, on the nanometer and sub-nanometer scale applied, for example but not limited to, inertial sensors such as accelerometers, grating accelerometers, compass sensors, and gyroscopes. Even more particularly, embodiments pertain to the incorporation and utilization of a modified Nano Optical Ruler Imaging System (NORIS) for said calibration and metrology apparatus and methods.","Description of the Related Art","Micro-machined accelerometers and gyroscopes have revolutionized motion sensing in the commercial world. They have also significantly penetrated the needs of the military for offering navigation for weapons and soldier\/vehicle navigation. For most applications though, the sensors have to be complemented with GPS data to enable total inertial sensor based navigation capability. This is because the sensors suffer from biases and scale-factor variations from device to device, and over time. Furthermore, even if one could calibrate the devices after packaging, there are significant scale factor and bias drifts that render the initial calibration ineffective. These drifts occur due to thermally induced creep in packaging and device anchors, environmental vibrations, thermal expansion gradients, electronic noise, shock, and numerous other variables. In particular, when the sensors are placed in weapons which are ejected at high accelerations of >15,000 g, most inertial sensors develop significant bias drifts. Due to the large shocks, or temperature cycling, and the different thermal expansion coefficients of the package layers, stresses onto the small inertial sensors change over time, changing the sensor sensitivity and bias. One way to solve the sensor drift problem is to realize self-calibration techniques directly onto the sensor chip. If one could package a rate table with every sensor, the sensors could be calibrated on-demand. For example, after the sensors are ejected at high accelerations or subjected to repeated temperature cycling, the sensors could be calibrated when they have approached constant velocity or normal operation regime. In the case of pedestrian navigation, the small time during which ZUPTs (zero velocity updates) can be used to reduce effect of bias drifts can also be used to recalibrate the gyro bias, to realize long GPS-denied navigation capability. Provided with such capability, MEMS inertial sensors could truly revolutionize GPS denied navigation for soldiers and weapons, reducing loss of life due to misaim of weapons, and providing a degree of confidence in warfare obtained by knowing where one is at all times. GPS denied navigation is also important for commercial applications such as navigation inside buildings, and between tall buildings in urban environments, where GPS signals cannot be reached.","In the field of inertial sensors, a technique known as carouseling has been historically used to find north for gyro-compassing, and to calibrate the sensors at the same time. Carouseling requires the rotation of the inertial sensor about an axis by 180 degrees. By switching the direction of the gyroscope sensitive axis, the sensitivity of the gyroscope changes to negative of the value in the 180-degree off direction. The bias voltage does not typically change with the angle of orientation, and can be extracted from the two angle readings. The degree to which the bias can be removed depends on the degree to which the angle of rotation can be controlled. If the angle is in error by \u0394\u03b8, then the error in measuring the rotation rate from the gyroscope can be comparable to the bias signal.","Existing carousels used in practice are too big and heavy to be considered for applications such as personal navigation and complementing GPS in automobiles. An insight is that the carousel can itself be made using miniature motion technology such as MEMS actuators themselves.","The inventor has recognized the benefits and advantages of being able to provides solutions to the problems outlined above, particularly by providing apparatus and methods enabling the measurement of distances with parts-per-billion (\u02dc50-1000 ppb) accuracy (e.g., \u22665 nm position accuracy over a 100 mm dimensions; <1 arc-second precision angular position knowledge over 360 degree rotation) resulting in atomically stabilized and calibrated inertial sensors. Accelerometer bias (mg after calibration) of less than 0.01 and gyroscope bias (deg\/hr after calibration) of less than 0.005 are anticipated to be achievable using the invention. It would be highly advantageous if all of these measurements could be performed in a package that is small (e.g., several cubic centimeters or less and consumes little power.","A MEMS carousel can be implemented in many ways as MEMS fabrication techniques can enable miniature rotating platforms or platforms that move in rectilinear motion on the surface of a chip. Thermal, electrostatic, or piezoelectric actuators, for example, can be used to move the platform.","Kohler et al. U.S. Pat. No. 7,066,004 discloses an inertial measurement unit using rotatable MEMS sensors. As disclosed therein, there is a desire within the art to incorporate MEM (microelectromechanical) inertial sensors into an inertial sensor system due to the potential size, weight, and cost savings. However, due to the relatively poor bias stability of currently available MEM inertial sensors (e.g. on the order of 50 degree\/hr, this has not been possible in applications of sensor systems that require an accuracy greater than what currently available MEM sensors can provide. Poor bias stability, also referred to as drift, can lead to errors in the sensor's output, thus yielding errors in the calculated position, or calculated orientation, of a moving body to which the MEM inertial sensor is attached. The '004 patent describes a bias-compensated MEM inertial sensor, sensor system (inertial measurement unit (IMU)), and a method for bias error compensation of a sensor under a dynamic operating condition, in which means are provided for electrically assessing the MEM sensor. However, electrical means as disclosed, e.g., in the '004 patent, themselves contribute noise that prevents sufficient bias reduction or elimination for current and future applications.","Hence, even though it is feasible to make MEMS sensors onto miniature rotating platforms, it is very crucial to measure the position of the platform with high accuracy. Capacitive feedback on the sensor can provide position data but is prone to errors of electrode placement and movement due to substrate thermal expansion. These are the same sources of errors that induce the scale factor drift and biases in inertial sensors to begin with. One way to measure distances and motion accurately is to use optical wavefronts. Optical wavefronts can reflect from or transmit through structures and result in interference fields that can indicate the position of the motion of the structure. For example, a grating on a substrate will reflect a pattern that generates a diffraction pattern that is a Sin c function. A rectangular reflective grating on the rotor-chip will result in a Sin c(x) diffraction pattern at the imager with nodes placed at x=\u03bbz\/g where \u03bb is the wavelength, z is the gap between the aperture and the imager plane, and g is the grating period. For example, with z equal to 2 mm, \u03bb=850 nm, and g=6 \u03bcm, the placement of the first diffraction node will be at x=0.28 mm showing up on the imager plane. The value of z can be estimated from knowing the value of g. Any tilt between the aperture chip and the imager chip can be quantified by the asymmetry of the diffraction pattern measured at the imager chip. As can be seen by the equation above, any changes in the optical wavelength can lead to changes in the pattern as well. If the optical wavelength is fixed, then the other variables are the system dimensions, which can be measured with as much uncertainty as there is in the wavelength stability. Atomic transitions with fixed optical wavelengths can be stable to parts in 10. Such atomic transitions are used in the atomic clocks that interrogate hyperfine-transitions in atoms by lasers. Ready-made technology is available to enable a miniature atomically stable laser source, in the form of chip-scale atomic clocks, enabled by the combination of miniature VCSELs and miniature alkali metal vapor cells.","The inventors have recently used the stability of the wavelength to measure the position of a moving object attached to the camera. Co-owned U.S. application Ser. No. 13\/062,832 entitled OPTICAL GRID FOR HIGH PRECISION AND HIGH RESOLUTION METHOD OF WAFER-SCALE NANOFABRICATION, the subject matter of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, discloses a wafer-scale nano-metrology system for sensing position of a nanofabrication element using a Nano Optical Ruler Imaging System (NORIS) developed by the instant inventor. Further details about NORIS are described in Yoshimizu et al., , OPTICS EXPRESS, Vol. 18, No. 20 (27 Sep. 2010)), the subject matter of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Using NORIS and the stability of the laser, we can measure the position of the rotor with the inertial sensors. The rotor angle and offset are important for inertial sensor characterization, especially for gyro-compassing where the rotor will be rotated by 180 degrees and needs to be at a known angle within an arc-second to achieve ppm bias and scale-factor calculation. To measure the angle of the rotor to 1-arc-second, one must measure the edge-position of a 1 mm radius rotor with <4.84 nm accuracy. A change in the grating average position would translate into a change in the position of the diffraction pattern on the imager, spread over several pixels. By interpolation, the effective resolution of the angle measurement can be very high. One can approximate the measured diffraction patterns with base functions such as polynomials, and cubic splines. The truncation error between the function y=f(x) and the interpolating polynomial y=P(x) between (n+1) data points is proportional to the remainder polynomial of the (n+1)order:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"f","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"x"}},{"msub":{"mi":["P","n"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"x"}}],"mo":"-"}},{"mfrac":{"msub":{"mi":"M","mrow":{"mi":"n","mo":"+","mn":"1"}},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"n","mo":"+","mn":"1"}},"mo":"!"}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"x","mo":"-","msub":{"mi":["x","l"]}}},{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"x","mo":"-","msub":{"mi":"x","mn":"2"}}},{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"x","mo":"-","msub":{"mi":["x","n"]}}},{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"x","mo":"-","msub":{"mi":"x","mrow":{"mi":"n","mo":"+","mn":"1"}}}}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}],"mi":"\u2026"}}}],"mo":"\u2264"},"mo":[",","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mtext":{}},"munder":{"mi":"max","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"M","mrow":{"mi":"n","mo":"+","mn":"1"}},"mo":"=","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"x","mn":"1"},"mo":["<","<"],"mi":"x","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"x","mrow":{"mi":"n","mo":"+","mn":"1"}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"f","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"n","mo":"+","mn":"1"}}},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"x"}}}}}}}}}}},"Here Mis the maximum magnitude of the n+1derivative of f(x).

There have been many implementations of optical readout of motion optically. These methods include interferometric techniques that require precise alignment. Other methods include gratings, in which case the wavelength is not stabilized. In the specific field of inertial sensors there have been attempts to realize optically readout of the proof masks. These techniques have led to the realization that even though the sensors can be made, the long term stability of the sensors suffers much like other miniature inertial sensors, due to drifts in gaps, and no independent standard of nature used to measure these changes.","In addition to measuring motion on the platforms, it is also possible to measure the dimensions of the devices being imaged by interpolating the pattern measured by the imager. In this mode of operation, the stable laser device structure allows in-situ measurement of gaps, masses, and orientation. These measurements can be used in advanced analytical modeling of device performance that can predict the sensitivity and the bias based on learning models. Thus long term stable measurement of a few devices parameters with built in metrology may enable correction of sensor performance.","An embodiment of the invention is an inertial sensor calibration method.

The principal components of apparatus - include a base , a stabilized-output optical source  fixedly attached to the base (see ) so that there is no relative motion between the source and the base, at least one inertial sensor  (three shown) characterized by a designed parameter value and an actual respective parameter value, coupled to the base, at least two fiducials  (in the form of fixed diffraction gratings (four shown), wherein at least one of the diffraction gratings - is connected to the at least one inertial sensor  and at least one diffraction grating  is connected (here, shown integrated) to the base ; and an imager  (either an image sensor or a light-field sensor) disposed above the inertial sensor so as to receive diffracted output source light from at least two diffraction gratings. The designed parameter value and the actual respective parameter value may be either a range of motion value or a distance value.","This and the other exemplary embodiments described herein borrow certain structural components and operational methodology from NORIS, described in the '832 patent and Yoshimizu et al. (id). As in NORIS, the stabilized-output optical source  may be a laser stabilized by an atomic transition, which thus produces a constant-of-nature output; i.e., an illumination pattern providing a distance constant-of-nature that will not change over time, with temperature, or with shock and vibration. Stable optical sources can be accomplished in many ways with the wavelength stability and\/or accuracy improving as the source volume, power and complexity increase. For example, trapped ion optical standards achieve wavelength uncertainties as low as 10, but are typically the size of a small room. A simple (unstabilized) laser, on the other hand, has a wavelength that varies with temperature, injection current, and strain, and is highly dependent on the fabrication process. The wavelength uncertainty of such a source is about 10. Traditional large-scale atomic optical wavelength references use either co-vibrational transitions in polyatomic molecules (I, CH, CH, etc.) or electronic transitions in alkali or alkaline-earth atoms, or ions. Molecular transitions can have very narrow optical linewidths, resulting in good stability and overall uncertainty, but do not lend themselves well to miniaturization because the transitions are very weak. Alkaline earth atoms form the basis for most large-scale modern optical lattice clocks, but require quite high oven temperatures (hundreds of degrees C.) to reach a sufficient atomic density. For a micro-sized, integrated apparatus having demanding simultaneous constraints on size, power and wavelength stability of the optical source, as embodied herein, the saturated absorption spectrum in Rb on the D2 transition (wavelength 780 nm; natural linewidth 6 MHz) or the two-photon transition from the 5sstate to the 5D(wavelength 778 nm, natural linewidth <500 kHz) may provide advantageous sources. The two-photon transition, for example, has been extensively investigated as an optical frequency reference and would provide wavelength stability for nano-calibration as well as for miniaturized optical metrological systems as enabled herein.","While miniaturization of atomically stable lasers continues, an example of a 1 cc system in the form of a Chip-Scale Atomic Clock (CSAC), is commercially available. The system consists of a light source such as a VCSEL, which is incident on a micromachined gas cell of rubidium or cesium vapor. The miniature cell is suspended by tethers to thermally isolate it for low power heating to create metal vapor in cells.","An aperture or other optical component (not shown) may be used to condition the output from the source  so that it illuminates all of the intended structures to generate the desired diffraction patterns.","This and the other exemplary calibration apparatus described herein provide for nanometer and sub-nanometer calibration (parts per billion) by illuminating the diffraction gratings of the inertial sensor and on the base with the optical source output to generate diffraction patterns, which, upon detection (see ), can be analyzed, e.g., as described herein above to measure the actual parameter value and to determine a relationship between the designed parameter value and the actual respective parameter value for calibrating the inertial sensor.","Another inertial sensor calibration apparatus - is illustrated in .

The base  includes a plurality of fixed fiducials  also in the form of diffraction gratings. Referring also to for clarity, the fixed diffraction grating fiducials  on the base are oriented such that when corresponding fixed diffraction grating fiducials - disposed on the platform rotate past the base fiducials, the relative grating orientation is either perpendicular or parallel. The grating accelerometers - also have mutually perpendicular orientations. Although grating accelerometers as shown in  were custom fabricated sensors made using the PolyMUMPS process and integrated into the platform, inertial sensor elements may be units that are commercially available from various inertial sensor manufacturers.","In the art, bias elimination remains challenging. For example, a Kionix 3-axis accelerometer KXM52 exhibits scale factor and bias drifts of a \u02dc0.5%, corresponding to \u02dc5,000 ppm shifts even after temperature and humidity treatment. One way to eliminate biases is to calibrate the biases actively in the sensor package itself. Micro-scale stable rotating platforms with integrated inertial sensors hold the promise of performing in-situ gyroscope and accelerometer sensor calibration by applying known accelerations and rotation rates. The biases can be measured by measuring signals with sensors at known angles. However, for proper calibration of the inertial sensor scale factor, the rotation of the platform needs to be free of secondary features that can complicate sensor signals. For example, a rotating platform needs to rotate smoothly without actuator artifacts such as jerks. Hence, it is critical to rotate the sensor platform without any physical contact. This is equivalent to suspending the rotor during calibration.","Many previous proofs of principles exist for suspending rotating platforms. Magnetic suspension has been shown using diamagnetic rotors. In the magnetic case, high currents are typically needed to generate sufficient magnetic field gradients for levitation. Electrostatic suspension has been achieved in implementing a gyroscope itself, but relatively high voltages and vacuum are needed to achieve flotation and vacuum operation. An alternative to electromagnetic forces is to use fluidic forces to suspend rotating platforms. An alternative to suspended operation is to use viscous drag forces induced by acoustic and dynamical forces. By actuating a plate at its ultrasonic resonant modes, the resulting acoustic streaming and acoustic radiation forces can be used to levitate the rotor.","Upon illumination from a 650 nm laser VCSEL diode (Thorlabs L650P007), a diffraction pattern was recorded and digitally analyzed. The diffraction patterns from gratings  and - are orthogonal to each other and can be used to measure and calibrate the designed motion and the actual motion the grating accelerometer. The change in the accelerometer grating response is measured as a function of rotation rate.","An optical grating accelerometer was implemented on the rotor with built-in self-calibrating gratings. The accelerometer consists of a set of grating reflecting fingers implemented in MUMPS gold that move in circumferential direction as a result of acceleration with springs. In the middle of the moving fingers are fixed gold reflecting lines. The accelerometer provides diffraction patterns () recorded by a CMOS imager (), with interference between light reflecting from the accelerometer and the fixed gratings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0081"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["100","4","100","3"]},"An embodiment of a packaged, self-calibrating inertial sensor system as embodied herein is illustrated in . The overall size of this system can be as small as 2.5\u00d72.5\u00d74 mm to \u02dc1\u00d71\u00d71 cm including the stabilized laser source, imager(s), ultrasonic motor (), inertial sensor(s) and fiducials, base, and electronics. Such a device may be incorporated into portable electronics such as, e.g., cell-phones and GPS receivers. The power consumption of the imager, laser, and the sensor chip will be in the range of only a few, to tens of milliwatts, for a low total power of 10 mw to higher power levels of 100 s of mW. The self-calibration portion of the package, which includes the laser and the imager, can be turned off and used periodically as needed. In this case the rotatable platform could be held in place by normally closed brakes. If the inertial sensors are being used with optical interrogation, the laser will not be turned off. The stabilized laser chip emits the optical beam through an orifice for beam conditioning. The orifice is located within the imager. Typically, imagers are not provided with holes in the center, but can be custom designed such that they will operate even after creating a hole in the center. Traditionally, the wires to access the pixels arranged in a rectangular array are placed in a two-dimensional rectangular grid. However, for an orifice to exist, wires have to be placed to get around the orifice. For this to occur, a special layout of the imager can be done such that the wiring to access the pixels is formed around the orifice. Alternatively, a set of imagers can be concatenated to create an effective orifice. In another aspect, a regular imager can be placed on the sides of the package or on the opposite side of the sensor platform with the sensor platform having orifices to transmit the light. Wires or wirebonds coming off the imager chips provide the power and information lines from the imagers. The light beam is incident on the sensor\/rotor chip, from which the light reflects off and is incident on the imagers. The sensor platform is shown with an integrated ultrasonic motor with integrated grating inertial sensors. A PZT platform is shown with two wires for electrical activation. The PZT platform and the sensor platform can be in the size range of 1 mm\u00d71 mm to 3 mm\u00d73 mm. Imager chips of this size can incorporate many pixels as pixel sizes tend to be 1\u00d71 umto 10\u00d710 umfor imager technologies.","All references, including publications, patent applications, and patents cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties to the extent allowed and as if each reference was individually and specifically indicated to be incorporated by reference and was set forth in its entirety herein.","The use of the terms \u201ca\u201d and \u201can\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d and similar referents in the context of describing the invention (especially in the context of the following claims) is to be construed to cover both the singular and the plural, unless otherwise indicated herein or clearly contradicted by context.
