No. 10\/816,032 entitled Hypergolic Bipropellants by Hawkins et al, filed on 2 Apr. 2004 and also to a patent application entitled Bipropellants Based on Selected Salts by Hawkins et al, filed herewith, both of which are herein incorporated in their entirety by reference.","This invention relates to bipropellants, particularly hypergolic bipropellants.","A conventional, storable bipropulsion system uses a hydrazine (e.g., monomethylhydrazine) as the fuel component. This fuel affords useful performance characteristics and has a fast ignition with the oxidizer. This fast (hypergolic) ignition provides system reliability for on-demand action of the propulsion system. The conventional, storable bipropulsion system is limited by its inherent energy density that can be traced, in large measure, to the density of the fuel. There are significant costs and operational constraints associated with handling the fuel that derives from the fuel's very toxic vapor.","The challenge is made more difficult since the fuel\/oxidizer combination is desired to be hypergolic. Hypergolicity is defined as self-ignition that occurs within milliseconds after contact of fuel with oxidizer, herein \u201cfast ignition.\u201d Hypergolic ignition is valuable because it offers high reliability, eliminates the inert mass of a separate ignition system, and provides an ability to restart for missions that require multipulse operation.","Accordingly, there is need and market for hypergolic bipropellants that overcome the above prior art shortcomings.","Broadly the present invention provides a hypergolic bipropellant that has an ionic liquid (IL) fuel containing a cation with at least two hydrazine moieties, in combination with at least one anion and an oxidizer.","The invention also includes the above IL fuel wherein the anion is dicyanamide [N(CN)] or tricyanomethanide [C(CN)] anions.","Referring to the present invention in detail, advanced bipropellant fuels with fast ignition, upon mixing with storable oxidizer, have been synthesized and demonstrated.","The bipropellant fuels are based upon salts containing the dicyanamide or tricyanomethanide anion (Formulas 1) below. The salts employ at least two hydrazine moieties in the cations (Formula 2) below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"109.22mm","wi":"70.27mm","file":"US08617326-20131231-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Reactivity evaluation of molten hydrazidine (Formula 2) based ILs with white fuming acid and nitrogen tetroxide was performed.

Such IL fuels can provide greater than 40% improvement in density over hydrazine fuels. This confers greater energy density to the bipropulsion system. Also, the negligible vapor pressure of IL fuel provides a means of significantly reducing costs and operational constraints associated with handling the fuel.","Prior to this invention fast igniting IL fuels were limited to the dicyanamide anion and to WFNA\/RFNA\/IRFNA as the only suitable oxidizers. The discovery of hypergolic activity of hydrazidine based ILs in combination with different anions towards NOsignificantly increases the variety of suitable compounds and substantially improves operability and storability of the propulsion system (NOpossesses significant advantages over IRFNA, e.g. less corrosive). In addition new IL fuels with NOcan offer sizeable performance increase over IRFNA.","Also a preferred embodiment of the invention is the employment of pure hydrazidine-based IL as a fast-igniting, bipropellant fuel. However, the use of these IL salt molecules as a component in fuel mixtures to confer fast-ignition and density is also a viable mode of the invention.","A hypergolic bipropellant based upon IL fuel and an oxidizer (NTO\/WFNA\/RFNA\/IRFNA) has potential as a replacement for bipropellants currently used in on-orbit spacecraft propulsion. Other application areas include liquid engines for boost and divert propulsion. The high volumetric impulse that is inherent in the new hypergol lends itself to applications that require high performance from volume limited systems. The low vapor toxicity of the IL fuel is a benefit over toxic hydrazine fuels currently used.","The performance aspects of this new hypergol can find use in commercial applications in satellite deployment and commercial space launch activities."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
