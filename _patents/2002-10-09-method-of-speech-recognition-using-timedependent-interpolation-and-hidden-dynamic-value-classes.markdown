title: Method of speech recognition using time-dependent interpolation and hidden dynamic value classes
abstract: A method of speech recognition is provided that identifies a production-related dynamics value by performing a linear interpolation between a production-related dynamics value at a previous time and a production-related target using a time-dependent interpolation weight. The hidden production-related dynamics value is used to compute a predicted value that is compared to an observed value of acoustics to determine the likelihood of the observed acoustics given a sequence of hidden phonological units. In some embodiments, the production-related dynamics value at the previous time is selected from a set of continuous values. In addition, the likelihood of the observed acoustics given a sequence of hidden phonological units is combined with a score associated with a discrete class of production-related dynamic values at the previous time to determine a score for a current phonological state.

No. 60\/405,971 and filed on Aug. 26, 2002.","The present invention relates to pattern recognition. In particular, the present invention relates to speech recognition.","A pattern recognition system, such as a speech recognition system, takes an input signal and attempts to decode the signal to find a pattern represented by the signal. For example, in a speech recognition system, a speech signal (often referred to as a test signal) is received by the recognition system and is decoded to identify a string of words represented by the speech signal.","Many speech recognition systems utilize Hidden Markov Models in which phonetic units are represented by a single tier of connected states. Using a training signal, probability distributions for occupying the states and for transitioning between states are determined for each of the phonetic units. To decode a speech signal, the signal is divided into frames and each frame is transformed into a feature vector. The feature vectors are then compared to the distributions for the states to identify a most likely sequence of HMM states that can be represented by the frames. The phonetic unit that corresponds to that sequence is then selected.","Although HMM-based recognition systems perform well in many relatively simple speech recognition tasks, they do not model some important dynamic aspects of speech directly (and are known to perform poorly for difficult tasks such as conversational speech). As a result, they are not able to accommodate dynamic articulation differences between the speech signals used for training and the speech signal being decoded. For example, in casual speaking settings, speakers tend to hypo-articulate, or under articulate their speech. This means that the trajectory of the user's speech articulation may not reach its intended target before it is redirected to a next target. Because the training signals are typically formed using a \u201creading\u201d style of speech in which the speaker provides more fully articulated speech material than in hypo-articulated speech, the hypo-articulated speech does not match the trained HMM states. As a result, the recognizer provides less than ideal recognition results for casual speech.","A similar problem occurs with hyper-articulated speech. In hyper-articulated speech, the speaker exerts an extra effort to make the different sounds of their speech distinguishable. This extra effort can include changing the sounds of certain phonetic units so that they are more distinguishable from similar sounding phonetic units, holding the sounds of certain phonetic units longer, or transitioning between sounds more abruptly so that each sound is perceived as being distinct from its neighbors. Each of these mechanisms makes it more difficult to recognize the speech using an HMM system because each technique results in a set of feature vectors for the speech signal that do not match well to the feature vectors present in the training data.","HMM systems also have trouble dealing with changes in the rate at which people speak. Thus, if someone speaks slower or faster than the training signal, the HMM system will tend to make more errors decoding the speech signal.","Alternatives to HMM systems have been proposed. In particular, it has been proposed that the trajectory or behavior of a production-related parameter of the speech signal should be modeled directly. However, none of the proposals have completely modeled the dynamic aspects of speech. In particular, the models have not addressed the time-dependent change in the trajectory that occurs as the speaker approaches a desired target for a phonetic unit. In addition, the models have not provided a decoding means that allows for a probability determination based on continuous values for the trajectory while limiting the search space to a manageable number of trajectory states.","In light of this, a speech recognition framework is needed that explicitly models the production-related behavior of speech in terms of other model variables such that the dynamic aspects of speech trajectory are better modeled and decoding is manageable.","A method of speech recognition is provided that identifies an articulatory dynamics value by performing a linear interpolation between a production-related dynamics value at a previous time and a target using a time-dependent interpolation weight. The production-related dynamics value is then used to form a predicted acoustic feature value that is compared to an observed acoustic feature value to determine the likelihood that the observed acoustic feature value was produced by a given phonological unit.","In some embodiments, the production-related dynamics value at the previous time is selected from a set of continuous values. In addition, the likelihood of the phonological unit is combined with a score associated with a discrete class of production-related dynamic values at the previous time to determine a score for a current state.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100","100"]},"The invention is operational with numerous other general purpose or special purpose computing system environments or configurations.

As shown by Equation 40, when the first time index is reached, a further recursion is performed by evaluating equation 35 using the state at the beginning of the current edge and the time index of the beginning of the current edge. This recursion is indicated by the last term in Equation 40.","The duration models in Equation 39, (P(\u0394t|e) and P(\u0394t\u22121|e), can be trained using a prior art HMM model to segment a training observation sequence. Using the segmented text, durations for each phone are identified and used to construct a duration probability distribution for each phone.","Although shown in a recursive framework above, the decoding of Equations 32\u201342 is performed in an iterative fashion under one embodiment of the present invention as described below with reference to the flow diagram of . In the method shown in , a set of best path scores is determined at each frame of the observed signal. In particular, for each state that is available at a particular frame, a separate H(t,n) value as found in Equation 35 above is determined for each class of trajectory. For example, for the simple state diagram of  that contains four states , , , and , the H(t,n) values of  would be generated, provided that there are only three classes of trajectories. Thus, values , , and  would be generated during the first frame (time index t) for classes c(g), c(g), and c(g), respectively, in state n. Values ,  and  would be generated during the second frame (time index t) for classes c(g), c(g), and c(g), respectively, in state n.  shows the diagram of  during the calculation of scores for the fourth frame of the observed vectors.  is referred to in the description of  below.","In step  of , the first observed vector is selected and the time index is set to 1. At step , states that are available during the time index are identified. A state is available for a time index if the time index is equal to the number of edges between the state and beginning state no of the finite state system. For example, in the simplified state system of , there are four states: , ,  and . During time index , only states  and  are available because there have not been enough observed feature vectors to have at least one feature vector for each edge between state  and state . During time index , states , , and  would all be available.","In other embodiments, states are not considered available if the time index is some amount greater than the number of edges between the state and beginning state n. This reduces the number of computations that are performed by eliminating temporal positions for states that are unlikely to occur.","After the available states have been identified, one of those states is selected at step . A class of trajectories, c(g), is then selected at step . Thus, in , steps  and  result in the selection of state nand class c(g). This is the state and class for which a H(t,n) value will be generated.","At step , an edge into the selected state is selected. For example, edge eof  would be selected for state . After an edge has been selected, a \u0394t is selected at step . These selections identify a previous state at a particular time index. Thus, for example, selecting edge eand \u0394t=3 in steps  and  would result in selecting the occurrence of state n \u0394t time index t as the previous state in .","At step , a g\u2032 is identified that maximizes the calculation shown in equation 36 for the currently selected class of trajectories, the selected edge and the selected At. As shown by equations 39 and 40, the computation of equation 36 is performed recursively along all of the time indices crossed by \u0394t and is dependent on the value of H(t\u2212\u0394t,n) associated with the state at the beginning of the selected edge. Note that the value H(t\u2212\u0394t,n) has been previously calculated using the method of  at an earlier time index and that the value is selected based on the class of the g\u2032 that is optimal for equation 36. Thus, if g\u2032 is in class c(g), then H(t,n) would be used in the calculation of equations 39 and 40 for state Nat time tusing edge eand \u0394t=3 as shown by line  of .","At step , the method determines if there are additional \u0394t to be considered. If there are, the process returns to step  to select a different \u0394t. Step  is then repeated using the new \u0394t to identify a new score using equation 36.","When there are no more \u0394t, the scores calculated using equation 36 are compared to each other and the highest score is selected as the score for the current edge at step . For example, a separate score would be calculated for each of \u0394t=1, \u0394t=2, and \u0394t=3, for edge eas represented by lines , , and  of . The highest score would then be selected at step , thereby selecting a particular alignment between the states and the observed speech frames.","At step , the method determines if there are any more edges that end at the current state. If there are, the process returns to step  and steps , , , and  are repeated to generate an edge score for the newly selected edge. For example, in , an edge score would be generated for edge e.","When there are no more edges that end at the current state at step , the highest edge score is selected as the H(t,n) path score for the selected class and state.","At step , the process determines if there are additional classes that need a H(t,n) path score. If there are, the process returns to step  to select the next class of trajectories. Steps \u2013 are then repeated to generate a H(t,n) path score for the newly selected class. When there are no more classes at step , the process determines if there are any more available states that need to be scored at step . If there are, the process returns to step  to select the next available state and steps \u2013 are repeated to generate a collection of H(t,n) path scores for the state.","When scores have been generated for all of the available states at the current time index, the process determines if there is another observation vector at step . If there is, the process returns to step  where the next observation vector is selected and the time index is incremented by one. Steps \u2013 are then repeated for the new vector and time index. When the last observation vector has been processed at step , the terminal state with the highest score, regardless of class, is selected as the final state in the decoded path. The decoded path is then determined by tracing back along the edge and \u0394t that were used to generate the highest H(t,n) score at each state.","Note that the use of classes of trajectories under the present invention makes it possible to perform the decoding in this manner. Without such classes, a finite state transducer could not be used because there would be an infinite number of states. The reason for this is that the trajectories (g) are continuous and as such can take on any value. By generating a score for a class of trajectories instead of the trajectories, makes it possible to have a finite number of states and thus allows for the decoding described in . Also note that although the class is used to limit the number of scores that are calculated for each state, the optimal trajectory, g\u2032, is selected from the set of continuous values for g\u2032 and is used to generate the scores. (see Equation 41 above). This allows for accuracy in the determination of the score while still allowing the finite state decoding described above.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0110","num":"0109"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["700","704","704","702","704","706"]},"A-to-D converter  converts the analog signal from microphone  into a series of digital values.
