Such compositions contained solvents such as dioxane or dimethylsulfoxide (\u201cDMSO\u201d), which contained water, or an aqueous cyclodextrin solutions to facilitate compound delivery to cells, see, e.g., 1998, 285:876-831986 46:3389-951985 6:333-351981 2:717-7211981 2:683-86. Such compositions are typically delivered to animals by injection or to cells in tissue culture by addition to cell culture medium. European publication number EP 429 187 describes formulations that contain DHEA or BrEA and polyvinylpyrrolidone and crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone. Some of these compositions may have undesired or suboptimal properties. For example, solvents such as dioxane, DMSO or chloroform are generally not preferred or suitable parenteral excipients, particularly for human use. Formulations that contain BrEA or related steroids and that have improved properties, e.g., lower toxicity, improved chemical stability or desirable characteristics for large-scale synthesis are needed.","Mammalian immune responses to infections or other conditions are often characterized by responses mediated by different effector cell populations. In some situations, helper T cells designated Th1 in the murine system, facilitate immune effector functions that are typically dominated by cell-mediated responses. In other cases, helper T cells designated Th2 cells facilitate immune effector functions that are typically dominated by humoral responses. A vigorous Th1 response is usually desirable to help clear infections or to slow the progression of an infection. When a subject's immune response is biased to, or dominated by, a Th2-type response, the cytokines associated with the Th2 response tend to suppress the immune system's capacity to mount a vigorous Th1 response at the same time. The converse is also generally true. When mammalian immune responses begin to result in an increasing Th2 response, the Th1 response to the same condition tends to weaken. Insufficient Th1 responses may be associated with progression of some infections or other conditions, see, e.g., M. Clerici and G. M. Shearer, 14:107-111, 1993; M. Clerici and G. M. Shearer, 15:575-581, 1994. The invention provides compounds and compositions useful to enhance Th1 immune responses.","Hemopoiesis is the formation and development of the various types of blood cells and their progenitor cells. Mature cells are found in circulation or tissues such as the lymph nodes or the thymus. Many of the stem cells that give rise to mature forms reside in the bone marrow, although some may circulate in the blood for some time. Clinical blood cell deficiencies such as thrombocytopenia, neutropenia or erythropenia can arise from causes such as impaired hemopoiesis or abnormal loss or destruction of mature or immature blood cells.","Thrombocytopenia (\u201cTP\u201d), abnormally low platelet counts, can arise from impaired platelet production, sequestration of platelets in the spleen or abnormal loss of circulating platelets. Impaired production can result from causes such as chemotherapies or radiation therapies. Abnormal loss of circulating platelets is often associated with autoreactive antibodies that bind to platelets and reduce their life span. These underlying causes give rise to the various clinical forms of TP, such as autoimmune neonatal TP, immune thrombocytopenic purpra, radiation induced TP, chemotherapy induced TP and amegakaryocitic TP.","A number of treatment options are available and the selection of a treatment typically depends on the source of the disorder and its severity. Treatments include administering one or more of glucocorticoid steroids (e.g., prednisone, prednisolone), human IgG antibodies, anti-Rh(D) antibodies for Rh(D) patients, an androgen such as danazol, vinca alkaloids (e.g., vincristine, vinblastine), thrombopoietin and immunosuppresants (e.g., azathioprine, cyclophosphamide). Splenectomy is also indicated, for example when first line treatments fail. The goal of treatment is typically to increase platelet counts to 20,000 mmor more typically to at least about 50,000 mmand to maintain these levels.","Although the treatment options to increase platelet levels are generally known, they usually have a number of drawbacks. For example, infusion of IgG antibodies is not always effective and the treatment is relatively expensive. Other treatments, such as prednisone are also not always effective and they typically are discontinued or tapered off after several weeks due to toxicity or unwanted side effects. Splenectomy, which is relatively expensive and invasive, is also not always effective.","The sources of thrombocytopenia and treatment options have been described. See, e.g., 3edition, R. Hoffman, E. J. Benz Jr. et al., editors, Churchill Livingstone, N.Y., 2000 (see, e.g., Chapters 126-129 and 131 at pages 2096-2154 and 2172-2186), PCT publication WO 200035466.","Neutropenia (\u201cNP\u201d), is considered to exist clinically when neutrophils drop to below a level considered normal. NP can arise from impaired production of neutrophil precursors or mature neutrophils, movement of neutrophils from the circulation to tissue, abnormal circulating neutrophil loss or a combination of these causes. Impaired neutrophil production can be acquired from, e.g., treatment with a cytotoxic or cytostatic drug, chemotherapy, radiation therapy or an autoimmune response. The abnormal loss of circulating neutrophils in autoimmunity is associated with autoreactive antibodies that bind to the cells and reduce their life span. These underlying causes give rise to the various clinical forms of NP, such as postinfectious NP, drug-induced NP, autoimmune NP, or chronic idiopathic NP.","The sources of NP and treatment options have been described. See, e.g., 3edition, R. Hoffman, E. J. Benz Jr. et al., editors, Churchill Livingstone, N.Y., 2000 (see, e.g., Chapters 19, 41, 51, 79, 134 and 137 at pages 297-331, 720-762, 939-979, 1443-1500, 2220-2248 and 2257-2263).","The use of 3\u03b2-hydroxyandrost-5-ene-17-one, 3\u03b2,17\u03b2-dihydroxyandrost-5-ene and other steroids to modulate immune functions or to stimulate myelopoiesis has been described, see, e.g., M.

Hoffman, E. J. Benz Jr. et al., editors, Churchill Livingstone, N.Y., 2000 (see, e.g., Chapter 14 at pages 154-202), O. J. Borge et al., 1996 88:2859-2870, M. Cremer et al., 1999 78:401-407, Y. Sasaki et al., 1999 94:1952-1960, U.S. Pat. No. 5,879,673. Recombinant IL-6 was shown in model systems to affect platelet counts in peripheral circulation, e.g., Stahl et al., 1991 78:1467-1475, although significant toxicities are associated with its administration to humans, e.g., Andus et al., 1987 221:18, J.

Exemplary ketal and thioketals include \u2014O\u2014C(CH)\u2014O\u2014, \u2014O\u2014C(CH)(heterocycle)-O\u2014, \u2014O\u2014CH(heterocycle)-O\u2014, \u2014O\u2014C(CH)(aryl)-O\u2014, \u2014O\u2014CH(aryl)-O\u2014, \u2014S\u2014C(CH)\u2014O\u2014, \u2014O\u2014CH\u2014CH\u2014O\u2014, \u2014O\u2014C(CH)\u2014CH\u2014O\u2014, \u2014S\u2014C(CH)\u2014CH\u2014O\u2014, \u2014O\u2014C(CH)\u2014CH\u2014S\u2014 and the like. Unless otherwise stated or implied by context, expressions of a percentage of a liquid ingredient, e.g., an excipient, in an invention composition or formulation mean the ingredient's percent by volume (v\/v). Thus, 20% propylene glycol means 20% v\/v propylene glycol is present in an invention composition or formulation. The amount of excipient indicated in invention compositions is not affected by the form used, e.g., NF or USP grade solvent or excipient. Thus, an invention composition that comprises about 30% polyethylene glycol 300 NF can instead comprise a USP counterpart, provided that other limitations, such as the amount of water present, are not exceeded.","As used herein, \u201cinnate immunity\u201d refers to one or more components typically associated with nonspecific immune defense mechanisms in a subject. These components include the alternate complement pathway, e.g., Factor B, Factor D and properdin; NK cells, phagocytes (monocytes, macrophages), neutrophils, eosinophils, dendritic cells, fibrocytes; anti-microbial chemicals, e.g., defensins; physical barriers\u2014skin, mucosal epithelium; and certain interleukins, chemokines and cytokines. Innate immunity plays a role in resistance to intracellular parasite infections, e.g., white blood cell infection, a liver infection, and other infections, e.g., lymph node infections. Enhancement of innate immunity mechanism by formula 1 compounds or method described herein may enhance phagolysosome fusion or movement, which some pathogens, e.g., intracellular bacteria such as mycobacteria, or inhibit.","Terms such as \u201cimmune disregulation\u201d, \u201cimmune disregulation condition\u201d, \u201cunwanted immune response\u201d and the like mean that a subject has or will have an immune response that is not desirable or is suboptimal for the subject's condition. Such disregulation or unwanted responses can arise from various clinical conditions or as a result of treatment of such conditions, e.g., inflammation, autoimmunity, organ or tissue transplant rejection (e.g., allograft, xenograft), infections, cancers, chemotherapy treatments, trauma, allergy conditions or in conditions where a subject mounts a Th1 immune response that is considered to be ineffective, insufficient or suboptimal. Immune disregulation conditions are as described herein or in the cited references.","Terms such as \u201ccellular response\u201d, \u201ccellular activity\u201d, biological response\u201d, \u201cbiological activity\u201d and the like mean a response or activity that is detectably modulated in response to the presence of a formula 1 compound. Such responses or activities can be direct effects or indirect effects on one or more cellular activities or on the expression or level of one or more molecules that the affected cell(s) synthesize or respond to. Such responses or activities include a detectable change in the synthesis or level of one or more cytokines, growth factors, transcription factors (including receptors and their cofactors), enzymes, Th1-associated antibody subtype responses or the like. Typically, the cytokines, growth factors, transcription factors, enzymes or antibodies that are modulated are involved in the amelioration of a pathological condition or in the establishment, maintenance or progression of a pathological condition.","As used herein, references to CD molecules, specific immune cell subsets, immune responses and the like, generally use nomenclature that applies to molecules, cells or the like that are found in humans. Analogs or counterparts of such molecules, cells or the like in other species may have a differing nomenclature, but are included in this invention. A description of the nomenclature and function of various CD molecules and immune cell subsets are as found in the scientific literature. References to Th0, Th1 or Th2 cells and references to Th1 or Th2 immune responses in the context of human patients refers to the human counterparts of the murine Th0, Th1 or Th2 immune cells or responses. For reviews see, e.g., A. K. Abbas et al., editors, , W.B. Saunders Company, third edition, 1997, ISBN 0-7216-4024-9, pages 4-469, and I. Kimber and M. K. Selgrade, editors, , John Wiley & Sons Ltd., 1998, ISBN 0-471-97194-4, pages 1-53.","\u201cImmunosuppressive molecule\u201d means molecules such as cyclosporin, cyclohexamide, mitomycin C, adriamycin, taxol and amphotericin B. These molecules tend to have toxicities toward the immune system and are directly or indirectly immunosuppressive, e.g., they are toxic to dividing cells, they inhibit proliferation of immune cell precursors or they can downregulate immunity.","\u201cSteroid receptor\u201d means a gene product, typically a protein monomer or dimer that can bind to a ligand, e.g., a natural steroid or an analog thereof, such as formula 1 compounds. Steroid receptors include orphan steroid receptors. Orphan steroid receptors are proteins for which the natural ligand or biological function is at least partially unknown. As used here, steroid receptors include homodimers, e.g., SXR and (CAR\u03b2), and heterodimers, e.g., PXR-CAR\u03b2 or RXR-CARR. Steroid receptors also include isoforms, e.g., PXR.1 and PXR.2 for the PXR receptor, and homologs of the steroid receptors, e.g., the homolog of CARR known as MB67. Isoforms are typically generated by different splicing pathways for a nuclear RNA from one gene, while homologs are typically a distinct copy of a steroid receptor gene, where the gene copy encodes only relatively small differences compared to the reference steroid receptor gene product. Such differences are most often found in areas other than the dimerization region and the steroid binding region of the steroid receptor's structure. Typically isoforms and homologs bind the same or similar ligands as the reference gene product or steroid receptor. Steroid receptors may be of human or animal origin, e.g., obtained from cells, tissues or cDNA expression libraries derived from cells or tissues of any primate, rodent (including murine), avian, ovine, bovine, equine, canine or feline species or any of the species or any species within any group (e.g., Family or Genus) of species mentioned elsewhere herein or in any reference cited herein. Modulation of steroid receptors by formula 1 compounds can arise from (1) their direct interaction with a steroid receptor or a cofactor thereof or (2) indirect effects such as generation of a signal or stimulus that leads to modulation of one or more biological activities of the receptor, e.g., detectable inhibition of steroid receptor mediated gene transcription or detectable enhancement of steroid receptor mediated gene transcription.","In the context of a combination of molecules that includes a steroid receptor and a formula 1 compound, \u201cinvention complexes\u201d or \u201ccomplexes\u201d include a complex that comprises a steroid receptor and a formula 1 compound and optionally other molecules. These other molecules include (i) a DNA recognition sequence (\u201cDNARS\u201d hereafter), i.e., a sequence that the steroid receptor specifically recognizes and binds to and (ii) a transcription factor that can bind to the steroid receptor-formula 1 compound complex. As used herein, these complexes can arise in cells in vitro or in vivo, or in cell-free systems. Complexes include, for example, steroid receptor heterodimer-formula 1 compound combinations, steroid receptor homodimer-formula 1 compound combinations, steroid receptor monomer-formula 1 compound combinations, steroid receptor heterodimer-formula 1 compound-DNA (or DNARS) combinations, steroid receptor homodimer-formula 1 compound-DNA (or DNARS) combinations, steroid receptor heterodimer-formula 1 compound-transcription factor combinations, steroid receptor homodimer-formula 1 compound-transcription factor combinations, steroid receptor heterodimer-formula 1 compound-DNA (or DNARS)-transcription factor combinations and steroid receptor homodimer-formula 1 compound-DNA (or DNARS)-transcription factor combinations.","An \u201cagonist\u201d or an \u201cantagonist\u201d is a compound or composition that respectively, either detectably increases or decreases the activity of a receptor, which can lead to increased or decreased transcription of a regulated gene. Receptors, their accessory factors and transcription factors can modulate transcription of their target gene(s) by detectably enhancing transcription or decreasing it.","Amino acid. \u201cAmino acid\u201d means an amino acid moiety that comprises any naturally-occurring or synthetic amino acid residue, i.e., any moiety comprising at least one carboxyl and at least one amino residue directly linked by one, two three or more carbon atoms, typically one (\u03b1) carbon atom. The nature and identity of the intervening structure located between the carboxyl and amino groups can have a variety of structures including those described herein. Typically, amino acids linked to the steroid through the amine group have sufficient conformation and length to be capable of autocatalytic hydrolysis of the amino acid-steroid bond and release of the steroid. This can occur when the free carboxyl is generated in vivo by deesterification, deamidation or peptidolytic cleavage of the precursor containing a linkage between the amino acid's amine group and the steroid. Hydrolysis of the bond between an amino acid's carboxyl or amino group and the steroid can also occur by chemical or enzymatic activity, e.g., esterase cleavage or non-enzymatic hydrolysis.","In general, the amino acids corresponding to the residues employed in the formula 1 compounds are naturally occurring and have no significant pharmacological activity per se. However, optimal pharmacokinetic activity, (substantially complete hydrolysis upon hydrolysis of the distal amide or ester bond) may be achieved by using non-naturally occurring amino acid residues. The intervening structure may be as simple as methylene when the amino acid residue is glycyl, or substituted methylene for other a amino acids. The structure ordinarily contains up to about 5 carbon or heteroatoms in the direct linkage between the amino acid's carboxylcarbon and the amine nitrogen. Thus, amino acids can comprise intervening ethylene, propylene, butylene, or pentylene groups or their substituted analogs, such as for example, oxyesters or ethers in which oxygen replaces carbon and, as appropriate, hydrogen. An example of such an intervening structure would be \u2014CH\u2014O\u2014C(R)(R)\u2014, where Rand Rare independently selected hydrogen or organic moieties as described above for esters. In some embodiments one of Rand Ris hydrogen and the other is a C2-20 organic moiety. Typically the organic moieties contain about 1-20 carbon atoms and 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 independently selected heteroatoms, which are typically selected from oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus. In general, fewer intervening atoms are used when more rapid hydrolysis is desired, although larger structures are suitable if, e.g., they possess sufficient flexibility or have conformations to allow positioning of the carboxyl group in proximity to the amino acid-steroid bond.","Ordinarily, Ris \u2014H, methyl or hydroxymethyl, usually \u2014H, and Ris a side chain or group of a naturally occurring amino acid. Amino acid side chains include analogs where the side chain is a Chomolog of the corresponding natural compound, e.g., methylene, ethylene, propylene, butylene or a substituted derivative thereof, e.g., an alkyl, ether or alkoxy (e.g., methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy) substituted derivative. In general, for carboxyl-containing side chains, if the C atom of the side chain carboxyl is linked by 5 or less atoms to the N then the carboxyl optionally will be blocked, e.g. by esterification or amidation wherein the ester or amide bonds are hydrolyzable in vivo. Ralso is taken together with Rto form a proline residue (\u2014CH\u2014). Thus, Ris generally a side group such as \u2014H, \u2014CH, \u2014CH(CH), \u2014CH\u2014CH(CH), \u2014CHCH\u2014CH\u2014CH, \u2014CH\u2014CH, \u2014CHCH\u2014S\u2014CH, \u2014CHOH, \u2014CH(OH)\u2014CH, \u2014CH\u2014SH, \u2014CH\u2014CHOH, \u2014CH\u2014CO\u2014NH, \u2014CH\u2014CH\u2014CO\u2014NH, \u2014CH\u2014COOH, \u2014CH\u2014CH\u2014COOH, \u2014(CH)\u2014NHand \u2014(CH)\u2014NH\u2014C(NH)\u2014NH. Ralso includes 1-guanidinoprop-3-yl, benzyl, 4-hydroxybenzyl, imidazol-4-yl, indol-3-yl, methoxyphenyl and ethoxyphenyl. The optimal Rgroup is readily selected using routine assays.","In general, the amino acid residue has the structure shown in the formulas below. Ordinarily, n is 1 or 2, Ris \u2014H and Ris a moiety containing one or more of the following groups: amino, carboxyl, amide, carboxyl ester, hydroxyl, C-Caryl, ether (\u2014O\u2014), thioether (\u2014S\u2014), n-, s- or t-alkyl (C-C), guanidinyl, imidazolyl, indolyl, sulfhydryl, sulfoxide, and phosphoryl. The Rand Rsubstituents can have a wide variety of structures including those disclosed herein, e.g., esters, ethers or carbonates.","When the amino acid residues contain one or more chiral centers, any of the D, L, meso, threo or erythro (as appropriate) racemates or mixtures thereof, fall within the scope of this invention. In general, if it is desired to rely on non-enzymatic means of hydrolysis, D isomers should be used. On the other hand, L isomers may be more versatile since they can be susceptible to both non-enzymatic as well as potential targeted enzymatic hydrolysis, and are more efficiently transported by amino acid or dipeptidyl transport systems in the gastrointestinal tract.","Examples of suitable amino acid residues include the following: Glycyl; aminopolycarboxylic acids, e.g., aspartic acid, \u03b2-hydroxyaspartic acid, glutamic acid, \u03b2-hydroxyglutamic acid, \u03b2-methylaspartic acid, \u03b2-methylglutamic acid, \u03b2,\u03b2-dimethylaspartic acid, \u03b3-hydroxyglutamic acid, \u03b2,\u03b3-dihydroxyglutamic acid, \u03b2-phenylglutamic acid, \u03b3-methyleneglutamic acid, 3-aminoadipic acid, 2-aminopimelic acid, 2-aminosuberic acid and 2-aminosebacic acid residues; amino acid amides such as glutaminyl and asparaginyl; polyamino- or polybasic-monocarboxylic acids such as arginine, lysine, \u03b2-aminoalanine, aminobutyrine, ornithine, citruline, homoarginine, homocitrulline, 5-hydroxy-2,6-diaminohexanoic acid (commonly, hydroxylysine, including allohydroxylysine) and diaminobutyric acid residues; other basic amino acid residues such as histidinyl; diaminodicarboxylic acids such as \u03b1,\u03b1\u2032-diaminosuccinic acid, \u03b1,\u03b1\u2032-diaminoglutaric acid, \u03b1,\u03b1\u2032-diaminoadipic acid, \u03b1,\u03b1\u2032-diaminopimelic acid, \u03b1,\u03b1\u2032-diamino-\u03b2-hydroxypimelic acid, \u03b1,\u03b1\u2032-diaminosuberic acid, \u03b1,\u03b1\u2032-diaminoazelaic acid, and \u03b1,\u03b1\u2032-diaminosebacic acid residues; imino acids such as proline, 4- or 3-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidinecarboxylic acid (commonly, hydroxyproline, including allohydroxyproline), \u03b3-methylproline, pipecolic acid, 5-hydroxypipecolic acid, \u2014N([CH]COOR), wherein n is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 and Ris \u2014H or a protecting group, and azetidine-2-carboxylic acid residues; a mono- or di-alkyl (typically C-Cbranched or normal) amino acid such as alanine, valine, leucine, allylglycine, butyrine, norvaline, norleucine, heptyline, \u03b1-methylserine, \u03b1-amino-\u03b1-methyl-\u03b3-hydroxyvaleric acid, \u03b1-amino-\u03b1-methyl-\u03b4-hydroxyvaleric acid, \u03b1-amino-\u03b1-methyl-\u03b5-hydroxycaproic acid, isovaline, \u03b1-methylglutamic acid, \u03b1-aminoisobutyric acid, \u03b1-aminodiethylacetic acid, \u03b1-aminodiisopropylacetic acid, \u03b1-aminodi-n-propylacetic acid, \u03b1-aminodiisobutylacetic acid, \u03b1-aminodi-n-butylacetic acid, \u03b1-aminoethylisopropylacetic acid, \u03b1-amino-n-propylacetic acid, \u03b1-aminodiisoamyacetic acid, \u03b1-methylaspartic acid, \u03b1-methylglutamic acid, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid; isoleucine, alloisoleucine, tert-leucine, \u03b2-methyltryptophan and \u03b1-amino-\u03b2-ethyl-\u03b2-phenylpropionic acid residues; \u03b2-phenylserinyl; aliphatic \u03b1-amino-\u03b2-hydroxy acids such as serine, \u03b2-hydroxyleucine, \u03b2-hydroxynorleucine, \u03b2-hydroxynorvaline, and \u03b1-amino-\u03b2-hydroxystearic acid residues; \u03b1-Amino, \u03b1-, \u03b3-, \u03b4- or \u03b5-hydroxy acids such as homoserine, \u03b3-hydroxynorvaline, \u03b4-hydroxynorvaline and epsilon-hydroxynorleucine residues; canavinyl and canalinyl; \u03b3-hydroxyornithinyl; 2-Hexosaminic acids such as D-glucosaminic acid or D-galactosaminic acid residues; \u03b1-amino-\u03b2-thiols such as penicillamine, \u03b2-thiolnorvaline or \u03b2-thiolbutyrine residues; other sulfur containing amino acid residues including cysteine; homocystine; \u03b2-phenylmethionine; methionine; S-allyl-L-cysteine sulfoxide; 2-thiolhistidine; cystathionine; and thiol ethers of cysteine or homocysteine; phenylalanine, tryptophan and ring-substituted a amino acids such as the phenyl- or cyclohexylamino acids \u03b1-aminophenylacetic acid, \u03b1-aminocyclohexylacetic acid and \u03b1-amino-\u03b2-cyclohexylpropionic acid; phenylalanine analogues and derivatives comprising aryl, lower alkyl, hydroxy, guanidino, oxyalkylether, nitro, sulfur or halo-substituted phenyl (e.g., tyrosine, methyltyrosine and o-chloro-, p-chloro-, 3,4-dichloro, o-, m- or p-methyl-, 2,4,6-trimethyl-, 2-ethoxy-5-nitro, 2-hydroxy-5-nitro and p-nitro-phenylalanine); furyl-, thienyl-, pyridyl-, pyrimidinyl-, purine or naphthylalanines; and tryptophan analogues and derivatives including kynurenine, 3-hydroxykynurenine, 2-hydroxytryptophan and 4-carboxytryptophan residues; \u03b1-amino substituted amino acid residues including sarcosine (N-methylglycine), N-benzylglycine, N-methylalanine, N-benzylalanine, N-methylphenylalanine, N-benzylphenylalanine, N-methylvaline and N-benzylvaline; and \u03b1-Hydroxy and substituted \u03b1-hydroxy amino acid residues including serine, threonine, allothreonine, phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues.","Any one of the foregoing or other known amino acids are suitably employed in this invention. Typically, amino acids are capable of autocatalytically hydrolyzing the amino acid-steroid bond. Thus, they typically contain, or upon being hydrolyzed in vivo, contain a free carboxyl group or amine group.","Also of interest are hydrophobic amino acids such as mono- or di-alkyl or aryl amino acids, cycloalkylamino acids and the like. These residues, together with R-R(R-Rare defined below) can contribute to cell permeability by modulating the lipophilicity of a formula 1 compound. Typically, the residue does not contain a sulfhydryl or guanidino substituent.","Peptide. One, 2, 3 or more of the variable groups such as R-Rcan comprise a \u201cpeptide\u201d, i.e., two or more amino acids as defined above. Typically the amino acids are linked through normal peptide bonds, i.e., \u2014CO\u2014NH\u2014, between adjacent amino acid residues. Peptides comprise dipeptides (dimers), tripeptides (trimers), short peptides of 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 or 15 residues, and longer peptides or proteins having about 100 or more residues. Formula 1 compounds that comprise a peptide can be used as immunogens, prodrugs or as synthetic precursors for other steroid derivatives. In one embodiment, the peptide will contain a peptidolytic enzyme cleavage site at the peptide bond linking the first residue and the next residue distal to the steroid residue. Such cleavage sites are optionally flanked by enzymatic recognition structures, e.g. particular residues recognized by a hydrolytic enzyme, Peptidolytic enzymes are well known, and in particular include carboxypeptidases. Carboxypeptidases digest polypeptides by removing C-terminal residues, and are specific in many instances for particular C-terminal sequences. Such enzymes and their substrate requirements in general are well known. For example, a dipeptide having a given pair of residues and a free carboxyl terminus is covalently bonded through its \u03b1-amino group to the steroid nucleus. It is expected that the peptide will be cleaved by the appropriate dipeptidase, protease or by chemical hydrolysis, leaving the carboxyl of the proximal amino acid residue to autocatalytically cleave the amidate bond.","Examples of suitable dipeptidyl groups (designated by their single letter symbols) are shown in the table

Tripeptides include those where A, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W or Y is linked by a standard peptide bond to the amino or the carboxyl terminus of any of the dipeptides listed above. The sequence \u2014X1-pro-X2-(where X1 is any amino acid and X2 is hydrogen, any amino acid residue or a carboxyl ester of proline) will be cleaved by luminal carboxypeptidase to yield X1 with a free carboxyl, which in turn autocatalytically cleaves the amidate bond. X2 usually will be a benzyl ester of the carboxy group of X2. Other embodiments include tetrapeptides such as ones where any two of the dipeptides listed above, which may be the same or different dipeptides (e.g., AA and AA linked together or, e.g., AA and GI linked together), are linked to each other by a peptide bond through the amino terminus or carboxyl terminus. One, 2 or more tetrapeptides may bonded to the formula 1 or formula 2 compound through the tetrapeptide's amino or carboxyl terminus.","In some embodiments, the formula 1 or formula 2 compound comprises one or more amino acids or peptides having the structure (A), (B) or (C):","(A)))R\u2014NH\u2014{[C(R)(R)]\u2014C(O)\u2014N(R)}\u2014[C(R)(R)]\u2014C(O)\u2014O-steroid,","(B)))R\u2014O\u2014{C(O)\u2014[C(R)(R)]\u2014N(R)}\u2014C(O)\u2014[C(R)(R)]\u2014N(R)\u2014O-steroid, or","(C)R\u2014O\u2014{C(O)\u2014[C(R)(R)]\u2014N(R)}\u2014C(O)\u2014[C(R)(R)]\u2014N(R)\u2014C(O)\u2014O-steroid, wherein (A), (B) or (C) are independently selected and they are bonded to 1, 2, 3 or more of Rthrough R, where each R-Ris independently selected; Rindependently are \u2014H or a C1-20 organic moiety (e.g., Calkyl, e.g. \u2014CHor \u2014CH); Rindependently are the side chain of an amino acid, including the side chain of naturally occurring amino acids as described above, e.g., \u2014H, \u2014CH, \u2014CHCH; Ris \u2014H or a protecting group; Rand Rindependently comprise \u2014H, a protecting group, an ester or an amide where each atom or group is independently chosen; a, b, c and d independently are 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, usually 1; e, f and g independently are an integer from 0 to about 1000, typically they independently are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8; a, b, c and d independently are 1 or 2; e, f and g independently are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.","If the amino acid(s) or residue(s) has 2 or more amine groups, e.g., a lysinyl or arginyl, or ornithinyl residue, then Ris usually \u2014H and Rmay comprise \u2014[C(R)]N(R)\u2014 where n2 is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, Ris \u2014H or a protecting group and each Rindependently is \u2014H, C-Coptionally substituted alkyl, C-Coptionally substituted aryl, C-Coptionally substituted alkylaryl, C-Coptionally substituted arylalkyl, C-Coptionally substituted alkoxy, C-Coptionally substituted aryloxy or hydroxyl. Such compounds will contain a plurality of steroid moieties. For example when both the epsilon (\u03b5) or delta (\u03b4) and alpha (\u03b1) amino groups of lysine or ornithine are substituted with steroid moieties the amidate is believed to be capable of releasing two molecules of active drug, each expected to emerge under different pharmacokinetics and therefore further sustaining the drug release.","Salts of formula 1 compounds. Invention embodiments include salts and complexes of formula 1 compounds, including pharmaceutically acceptable or salts that are relatively non-toxic. Some of the formula 1 compounds have one or more moieties that carry at least a partial positive or negative charge in aqueous solutions, typically at a pH of about 4-10, that can participate in forming a salt, a complex, a composition with partial salt and partial complex properties or other noncovalent interactions, all of which we refer to as a \u201csalt(s)\u201d. Salts are usually biologically compatible or pharmaceutically acceptable or non-toxic, particularly for mammalian cells. Salts that are biologically toxic are optionally used with synthetic intermediates of formula 1 compounds. When a water-soluble composition is desired, monovalent salts are usually used.","Metal salts typically are prepared by reacting the metal hydroxide with a compound of this invention. Examples of metal salts that are optionally prepared in this way are salts containing Li, Na, and K. A less soluble metal salt can be precipitated from the solution of a more soluble salt by adding a suitable metal compound. Invention salts may be formed from acid addition of certain organic acids, such as organic carboxylic acids, and inorganic acids, such as alkylsulfonic acids or hydrogen halide acids, to acidic or basic centers on formula 1 compounds, such as basic centers on the invention pyrimidine base analogs. Metal salts include ones containing Na, Li, K, Ca or Mg. Other metal salts may contain aluminum, barium, strontium, cadmium, bismuth, arsenic or zinc ion.","Salt(s) of formula 1 compounds may comprise a combination of appropriate cations such as alkali and alkaline earth metal ions or ammonium and quaternary ammonium ions with the acid anion moiety of the phosphoric acid or phosphonic acid group, which may be present in invention polymers or monomers.","Salts are produced by standard methods, including dissolving free base in an aqueous, aqueous-alcohol or aqueous-organic solution containing the selected acid, optionally followed by evaporating the solution. The free base is reacted in an organic solution containing the acid, in which case the salt usually separates directly or one can concentrate the solution.","Suitable amine salts include amines having sufficient basicity to form a stable salt, usually amines of low toxicity including trialkyl amines (tripropylamine, triethylamine, trimethylamine), procaine, dibenzylamine, N-benzyl-betaphenethylamine, ephenamine, N,N\u2032-dibenzylethylenediamine, N-ethylpiperidine, benzylamine and dicyclohexylamine.","Salts include organic sulfonic acid or organic carboxylic acid salts, made for example by addition of the acids to basic centers, typically amines. Exemplary sulfonic acids include Caryl sulfonic acids, Cheteroaryl sulfonic acids and Calkyl sulfonic acids such as phenyl sulfonic acid, \u03b1-naphthalene sulfonic acid, \u03b2-naphthalene sulfonic acid, (S)-camphorsulfonic acid, methyl (CHSOH), ethyl (CHSOH), n-propyl, i-propyl, n-butyl, s-butyl, i-butyl, t-butyl, pentyl and hexyl sulfonic acids. Exemplary organic carboxylic acids include Calkyl, Caryl carboxylic acids and Cheteroaryl carboxylic acids such as acetic, glycolic, lactic, pyruvic, malonic, glutaric, tartaric, citric, fumaric, succinic, malic, maleic, oxalic, hydroxymaleic, benzoic, hydroxybenzoic, phenylacetic, cinnamic, salicylic, nicotinic and 2-phenoxybenzoic.","Invention salts include those made from inorganic acids, e.g., HF, HCl, HBr, HI, HSO, HPO, NaCO, KCO, CaCO, MgCOand NaClO. Suitable anions, which are optionally present with a cation such a Ca, Mg, Li, Na or K, include arsenate, arsenite formate, sorbate, chlorate, perchlorate, periodate, dichromate, glycodeoxycholate, cholate, deoxycholate, desoxycholate, taurocholate, taurodeoxycholate, taurolithocholate, tetraborate, nitrate, nitrite, sulfite, sulfamate, hyposulfite, bisulfite, metabisulfite, thiosulfate, thiocyanate, silicate, metasilicate, CN, gluconate, gulcuronate, hippurate, picrate, hydrosulfite, hexafluorophosphate, hypochlorite, hypochlorate, borate, metaborate, tungstate and urate.","Salts also include the formula 1 compound salts with one or more amino acids. Many amino acids are suitable, especially the naturally-occurring amino acids found as protein components, although the amino acid typically is one bearing a side chain with a basic or acidic group, e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine or glutamic acid, or a neutral group such as glycine, serine, threonine, alanine, isoleucine, or leucine.","The invention compositions include formula 1 compounds, their hydrates and the compounds in their un-ionized, as well as zwitterionic form.","Stereoisomers. The formula 1 compounds include enriched or resolved optical isomers at any or all asymmetric atoms as are apparent from the depictions. Both racemic and diasteromeric mixtures, as well as the individual optical isomers can be isolated or synthesized so as to be substantially free of their enantiomeric or diastereomeric partners, and these are all within the scope of the invention. Chiral centers may be found in formula 1 compounds at, for example, one or more of R, R, Rand R.","One or more of the following methods are used to prepare the enantiomerically enriched or pure isomers herein. The methods are listed in approximately their order of preference, i.e., one ordinarily should employ stereospecific synthesis from chiral precursors before chromatographic resolution before spontaneous crystallization.","Stereospecific synthesis is described in the examples. Methods of this type conveniently are used when the appropriate chiral starting material is available and reaction steps are chosen do not result in undesired racemization at chiral sites. One advantage of stereospecific synthesis is that it does not produce undesired enantiomers that must be removed from the final product, thereby lowering overall synthetic yield. In general, those skilled in the art would understand what starting materials and reaction conditions should be used to obtain the desired enantiomerically enriched or pure isomers by stereospecific synthesis.","If a suitable stereospecific synthesis cannot be empirically designed or determined with routine experimentation then those skilled in the art would turn to other methods. One method of general utility is chromatographic resolution of enantiomers on chiral chromatography resins. These resins are packed in columns, commonly called Pirkle columns, and are commercially available. The columns contain a chiral stationary phase. The racemate is placed in solution and loaded onto the column, and thereafter separated by HPLC. See for example, Proceedings Chromatographic Society\u2014International Symposium on Chiral Separations, Sep. 3-4, 1987. Examples of chiral columns that could be used to screen for the optimal separation technique would include Diacel Chriacel OD, Regis Pirkle Covalent D-phenylglycine, Regis Pirkle Type 1A, Astec Cyclobond II, Astec Cyclobond III, Serva Chiral D-DL=Daltosil 100, Bakerbond DNBLeu, Sumipax OA-1000, Merck Cellulose Triacetate column, Astec Cyclobond I-Beta, or Regis Pirkle Covalent D-Naphthylalanine. Not all of these columns are likely to be effective with every racemic mixture. However, those skilled in the art understand that a certain amount of routine screening may be required to identify the most effective stationary phase. When using such columns it is desirable to employ embodiments of the compounds of this invention in which the charges are not neutralized, e.g., where acidic functionalities such as carboxyl are not esterified or amidated.","Another method entails converting the enantiomers in the mixture to diasteriomers with chiral auxiliaries and then separating the conjugates by ordinary column chromatography. This is a very suitable method, particularly when the embodiment contains free carboxyl, amino or hydroxyl that will form a salt or covalent bond to a chiral auxiliary. Chirally pure amino acids, organic acids or organosulfonic acids are all worthwhile exploring as chiral auxiliaries, all of which are well known in the art. Salts with such auxiliaries can be formed, or they can be covalently (but reversibly) bonded to the functional group. For example, pure D or L amino acids can be used to amidate the carboxyl group of invention embodiments that comprise a carboxyl group and then separated by chromatography.","Enzymatic resolution is another method of potential value. In such methods one prepares covalent derivatives of the enantiomers in the racemic mixture, generally lower alkyl esters (for example of carboxyl), and then exposes the derivative to enzymatic cleavage, generally hydrolysis. For this method to be successful an enzyme must be chosen that is capable of stereospecific cleavage, so it is frequently necessary to routinely screen several enzymes. If esters are to be cleaved, then one selects a group of esterases, phosphatases, and lipases and determines their activity on the derivative. Typical esterases are from liver, pancreas or other animal organs, and include porcine liver esterase.","If the enantiomeric mixture separates from solution or a melt as a conglomerate, i.e., a mixture of enantiomerically pure crystals, then the crystals can be mechanically separated, thereby producing the enantiomerically enriched preparation. This method, however, is not practical for large-scale preparations and is of limited value for true racemic compounds.","Asymmetric synthesis is another technique for achieving enantiomeric enrichment. For example, a chiral protecting group is reacted with the group to be protected and the reaction mixture allowed to equilibrate. If the reaction is enantiomerically specific then the product will be enriched in that enantiomer.","Further guidance in the separation of enantiomeric mixtures can be found, by way of example and not limitation, in \u201cEnantiomers, Racemates, and resolutions\u201d, Jean Jacques, Andre Collet, and Samuel H. Wilen (Krieger Publishing Company, Malabar, Fla., 1991, ISBN 0-89464-618-4): Part 2, Resolution of Enantiomer Mixture, pages 217-435; more particularly, section 4, Resolution by Direct Crystallization, pages 217-251, section 5, Formation and Separation of Diastereomers, pages 251-369, section 6, Crystallization-Induced Asymmetric Transformations, pages 369-378, and section 7, Experimental Aspects and Art of Resolutions, pages 378-435; still more particularly, section 5.1.4, Resolution of Alcohols, Transformation of Alcohols into Salt-Forming Derivatives, pages 263-266, section 5.2.3, Covalent Derivatives of Alcohols, Thiols, and Phenols, pages 332-335, section 5.1.1, Resolution of Acids, pages 257-259, section 5.1.2, Resolution of Bases, pages 259-260, section 5.1.3, Resolution of Amino Acids, page 261-263, section 5.2.1, Covalent Derivatives of Acids, page 329, section 5.2.2, Covalent derivatives of Amines, pages 330-331, section 5.2.4, Covalent Derivatives of Aldehydes, Ketones, and Sulfoxides, pages 335-339, and section 5.2.7, Chromatographic Behavior of Covalent Diastereomers, pages 348-354.","General methods. Methods have been described, for example Karl Fischer (KF) and loss on drying (LOD), to determine the content of water or solvents in various compositions. LOD measures all volatiles in a sample, while KF is typically used to measure all water. When water is the only volatile present, LOD values are equal to or less than KF values for a given composition. KF measures water in hydrates of a compound and LOD determines both water and the amount of other volatiles that may be present. Invention compositions and formulations are conveniently assayed for water content by KF titration (e.g., using a Metrohm 684 KF Coulometer or equivalent) according to a published procedure (, vol. 23, 1995, chapter <921>, U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc., Rockville, Md.) and manufacturer's Coulometer instructions. The amount of material used in the assay, about 50-100 mg, is measured using a five place analytical balance (Sartorius, Model RC210D, or a suitable equivalent). The amounts of water specified in invention compositions and formulations is the amount obtained by KF analysis.","Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) methods have been used to characterize various crystalline compounds (see, e.g., , volume 23, 1995, <941>, p. 1843-1845, U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc., Rockville, Md.; Stout et al., -, MacMillan Co., New York, N.Y., 1986). The diffraction pattern, or portions thereof, obtained from a crystalline compound is usually diagnostic for a given crystal form, although weak or very weak diffraction peaks may not always appear in replicate diffraction patterns obtained from successive batches of crystals. Also, the relative intensities of XRD bands, particularly at low angle X-ray incidence values (low Theta), may vary due to preferred orientation effects arising from differences in, e.g., crystal habit, particle size or other measurement conditions. Peaks on XRD spectra are typically defined at a given Theta value +\/\u2212 about 0.1 to 0.2. XRD information from the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or more main intensity XRD peaks, optionally combined with one or more other diagnostic data (melting point, DSC, IR), is usually suitable to characterize or describe a crystalline material such as BrEA hemihydrate from other crystal forms that contain the same compound.","Other techniques that are used to identify or describe a crystalline material such as BrEA hemihydrate include melting point (MP), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and infrared absorption spectroscopy (IR) data. DSC measures thermal transition temperatures at which a crystal absorbs or releases heat when its crystal structure changes or it melts. MP data and DSC thermal transition temperatures are typically reproducible within about 1 or 2\u00b0 C. on successive analyses. IR measures absorption of infrared light that is associated with the presence of particular chemical bonds that are associated with groups, e.g., hydroxyl, that vibrate in response to particular light wavelengths.","BrEA hemihydrate.

As used herein, BrEA hemihydrate or crystalline BrEA hemihydrate refers to solid BrEA and water having an ordered arrangement of substantially all of the constituent molecules in a defined three-dimensional spatial pattern or lattice. Crystalline BrEA hemihydrate may comprise one or more crystal habits, e.g., tablets, rods, plates or needles. BrEA hemihydrate that is substantially free of other forms of BrEA means a dry or substantially dry (where a liquid(s) comprises less than about 10% w\/w of the total weight) solid preparation where more than about 55% w\/w of the BrEA in the preparation is present as BrEA hemihydrate. Such compositions typically comprise at least about 60% w\/w, or at least about 70% w\/w, or at least about 80% w\/w, usually at least about 90% w\/w or at least about 95% w\/w, or at least about 98% w\/w of BrEA hemihydrate, with the remaining BrEA being present as other forms of BrEA such as the amorphous or anhydrous BrEA. Solid BrEA hemihydrate will typically comprise at least about 90% w\/w, usually at least about 97% or about 98% w\/w of the compound and less than about 10% w\/w, usually less than about 3% or 2% w\/w of by-products, which may include the 16\u03b2 isomer of BrEA or one or more by-products of BrEA synthesis. Often the amount of solid BrEA that is present in a solid or a liquid medium will not contain detectable amounts of other forms of BrEA (using standard analytical methods such as, e.g., FTIR, DSC or XRD) and the hemihydrate will may thus comprise about 99-100% w\/w of the total amount of BrEA that is present.","Other invention embodiments include compositions that comprise a substantial amount of BrEA hemihydrate that is present in compositions that comprise one or more other forms of BrEA, e.g., amorphous BrEA or anhydrous BrEA, and optionally one or more additional components, such as any excipient described herein. As used herein, the \u201csubstantial amount\u201d of BrEA hemihydrate in these compositions comprises at least about 15-20% w\/w or at least about 20% w\/w of BrEA hemihydrate of the total amount of BrEA that is present, typically at least about 25% w\/w, more typically at least about 30% w\/w, often at least about 35% w\/w and usually at least about 45% w\/w. These compositions are generally solids, e.g., formulations or unit dosages, but they also include suspensions, precipitates, gels and colloids that contain solid BrEA. Such suspensions or precipitates may arise from, e.g., precipitation of BrEA hemihydrate from a solution that contains water or from addition of solid BrEA to a liquid excipient(s). Obviously, compositions that comprise a substantial amount of BrEA may be substantially free of other forms of solid BrEA as discussed above.","BrEA hemihydrate may conveniently be identified by reference to BrEA hemihydrate characterized by one or more of (1) its melting or decomposition point or range (optionally expressed as +\/\u22122\u00b0 C.), (2) one or more BrEA hemihydrate DSC transition temperatures or ranges (any of which may be optionally expressed as +\/\u22122\u00b0 C.), (3) one or more characteristic BrEA hemihydrate IR absorption bands, (4) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or more of the highest intensity XRD peaks (any one or more of which are optionally expressed as +\/\u22120.1\u00b0 Theta or +\/\u22120.2\u00b0 Theta) obtained from an XRD spectrum of BrEA hemihydrate using Cu\u2014K\u03b1 radiation (e.g., obtained essentially according to the method described at , volume 23, 1995, <941>, p. 1843-1845), (5) the presence of less than about 3% or less than about 2% w\/w of other compounds, (6) a water content of dry BrEA hemihydrate of about 2.5% w\/w (e.g., 2.3-2.7% w\/w), where dry BrEA hemihydrate means compound dried by filtration, optionally washed once with an anhydrous solvent such as hexane, filtered again and dried in vacuo at about 60\u00b0 C. until no further weight loss occurs over 24 hours at about 60\u00b0 C. (e.g., where water content is determined essentially by the Karl Fisher or other method described at , vol. 23, 1995, p 1801-1802 or 1840-1843 methods <731> or <921>), (7) cell constants and the orientation matrix obtained from single crystal X-ray crystallography of BrEA hemihydrate (obtained, e.g., essentially as described in WO 99\/04774 at example 13), (8) a description of crystal shapes as observed at about 100\u00d7 magnification to about 150\u00d7 magnification by polarized light microscopy or (9) average BrEA hemihydrate crystal size and shape descriptions.","Thus, for example, BrEA hemihydrate may be characterized by or one or more of its IR absorption bands, e.g., the carbonyl peaks at 1741 cmand 1752 cm, and either its melting or decomposition point or range and\/or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or more of the XRD peaks (usually the highest intensity peaks) at Theta (X-ray diffraction angle) values of 17.8, 23.8, 24.2, 26.9-27.2, 28.6, 30.1 and 32.2.","BrEA hemihydrate is suitable to prepare compositions comprising an excipient(s) suitable for human pharmaceutical use or for veterinary use. Such compositions are used to prepare formulations and unit dosages. Unit dosages typically comprise tablets, capsules, lozenges or sterile solutions, including sterile solutions for parenteral administration. Solid unit dosage forms typically comprise about 5-1000 mg of BrEA hemihydrate, typically about 20-400 mg, e.g., about 25 mg, about 50 mg, about 100 mg, about 150 mg or about 250 mg per unit dose.","The invention provides a method to make BrEA hemihydrate comprising contacting water, 16\u03b1-bromo-3\u03b2-hydroxy-5\u03b1-androstan-17-one and a C1-C6 alcohol (e.g., methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol) and water. Typically the only one C-C6 alcohol is present, e.g., ethanol, which is anhydrous or which may comprise up to about 2% w\/w water. In some embodiments, the method utilizes a solution that comprises about 5-25% w\/w water, about 30-45% w\/w ethanol and about 30-45% w\/w of a BrEA preparation. Typical BrEA preparations are solid preparations that comprise at least about 80% w\/w, usually at least about 90% w\/w or at least about 95% w\/w of BrEA. The solutions may comprise about 18-22% w\/w water, about 37-43% w\/w ethanol and about 37-43% w\/w of a BrEA preparation. In conducting the precipitation or crystallization method, the solution will typically be at a temperature of about \u221220\u00b0 C. to about 45\u00b0 C., usually at about 0\u00b0 C. to about 20\u00b0 C. The solution is maintained at this temperature range for about 30 minutes to about 12 hours and the solution is optionally agitated using slow to moderate agitation during crystallization.","A related embodiment comprises a method to prepare BrEA hemihydrate comprising precipitating BrEA from a solution comprising at least about 15-25% w\/w water, about 35-45% w\/w of a BrEA preparation and at least about 35-45% w\/w of one or more water-miscible solvents, typically Calcohols (methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol). The BrEA preparation may optionally comprise one or more by-products of BrEA synthesis. Typical BrEA hemihydrate preparations or batches comprise less than about 5% w\/w, usually less than about 3% or about 2% w\/w of other compounds, such as by-products of BrEA synthesis. Aspects of this method include contacting water with an organic solution that comprises BrEA and an organic solvent such as a C1-C6 alcohol (e.g., ethanol) or acetone. Addition of water to such solutions leads to precipitation of BrEA hemihydrate. Solutions that contain BrEA hemihydrate crystals or precipitate are invention embodiments that are used to prepare solid BrEA that is later dried and stored, typically at ambient temperatures and typically under conditions that limits or blocks light that reaches the compound.","Precipitation or crystallization of BrEA hemihydrate from water-containing solutions is accomplished by known methods, e.g., reducing the solution's temperature, using saturated or nearly saturated BrEA solutions, vacuum concentration of saturated or nearly saturated BrEA solutions (which is typically conducted at a relatively low temperature, usually about 15-25\u00b0 C.), seeding with saturated or nearly saturated BrEA solutions with BrEA hemihydrate crystals (e.g., about 10-100 mg per 1-10 L of solution), by heating a saturated or nearly saturated BrEA solution (about 25-35\u00b0 C. for a few minutes followed by allowing the temperature to fall or by actively cooling the solution) and optionally seeding the solution with BrEA hemihydrate crystals or by addition of a liquid, e.g., additional water or ethanol, to a saturated or nearly saturated BrEA ethanol-water solution, which causes the solution to become supersaturated. BrEA may also be precipitated from other solvents or solvent systems, including acetone and acetone-ethanol. Such solvents are typically water miscible. Two-stage precipitation of BrEA may also be used to recover solid BrEA hemihydrate, e.g., initial precipitation and recovery of the solid, followed by either cooling and seeding of the mother liquor or by allowing the mother liquor to stand, e.g., for about one, two or more days at ambient temperature, to obtain a second crop of crystals. Also, BrEA hemihydrate crystals may optionally be recrystallized, essentially as described herein, to further increase the purity of the final solid. Methods for crystallizing organic compounds have been described, e.g., A. S. Myerson, 1993, Butterworth-Heinemann, Stoneham, Mass., p 1-101.","Other related embodiments comprise a product produced by the process of contacting a solution comprising BrEA and an organic solvent with water. Typically the solutions are as described above, e.g., a solution comprising about 3-5% v\/v water and at least about 40% v\/v of one or more water-miscible solvents, typically polar solvents such as Calcohols or ketones (e.g., methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, typically ethanol or acetone). Such processes are accomplished by any one or more of the techniques described in the paragraph above, e.g., cooling of a saturated or nearly saturated BrEA water-ethanol solution and optionally seeding the cooled solution with BrEA hemihydrate. An embodiment related to this comprises solutions or solids that comprise wet BrEA hemihydrate crystals or wet filtered or centrifuged BrEA hemihydrate cakes, which may be obtained after crystallization. Examples of these embodiments include adding water to a BrEA-alcohol solution, e.g., slow addition of about 0.5-1.5 volumes or about 0.8-1.2 volumes of water to about 6 volumes of a BrEA-ethanol solution to obtain BrEA hemihydrate. Other examples of these embodiments include adding water to a BrEA-ketone solvent solution, e.g., slow addition of about 0.5-1.5 volumes or about 0.8-1.2 volumes of water to about 10 volumes of a BrEA-acetone solution to obtain BrEA hemihydrate.","Another related embodiment is BrEA hemihydrate that is milled to an average particle size of about 0.01-200 \u03bcM, or about 0.1-10 \u03bcM or about 0.5-5 \u03bcM. Average particle size or diameter for milled BrEA hemihydrate may thus be relatively small, e.g., about 0.03-2.0 \u03bcM or about 0.1-1.0 \u03bcM, or somewhat larger, e.g., about 0.5-5.0 \u03bcM or about 1-5.0 \u03bcM. Milled BrEA hemihydrate is suitable for preparing solid formulations and parenteral formulations for human or veterinary use. The milled material facilitates dissolution of BrEA hemihydrate in solvents or excipients and facilitates mixing with solids or solid excipients.","While it is possible to administer BrEA hemihydrate as a pure compound to a subject, it is usually presented as a solid formulation or used to prepare a liquid formulation.

Methods of administration and dosages for these compounds are essentially as described herein.","Intermittent dosing protocols or methods. In treating any of the pathological conditions disclosed herein, one can intermittently administer the formula 1 compound(s), e.g., BrEA or a BrEA ester, to a subject suffering from or susceptible to a condition disclosed herein such as an infection, a hyperproliferation condition, an inflammation condition or another condition that is disclosed herein as amenable to treatment with a formula 1 compound without some of the undesired aspects normally associated with discontinuous dosing. Such undesired aspects include development of resistance of a pathogen such as a pathogen disclosed herein, e.g., a virus or bacterium such as HIV or or a parasite such as a parasite, to the therapeutic agent, failure of the patient or subject to adhere to a daily dosing regimen or reduction of the dosages of other therapeutic agents and\/or their associated unwanted side effects or toxicities.","Intermittent dosing embodiments include administration of a formula 1 compound, e.g., orally, topically or parenterally as follows: (1) daily dosing for about 3 to about 190 days (e.g., about 3 to about 20 days), (2) no dosing of the formula 1 compound for about 4 to about 190 consecutive days (e.g., about 4 to about 20 days), (3) daily dosing for about 3 to about 190 days (e.g., about 3 to about 20 days), and (4) optionally repeating the dosing protocol 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 15, 20, 30 or more times. Often, the dosing of steps (1) and (3) will be maintained for about 3-15 consecutive days, usually about 3, 4, 5 or 6 consecutive days. In general, steps (1)-(3) of the dosing protocol recited above, will be repeated at least one time, typically at least 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 times. For infections that tend to remain chronic, e.g., HIV, HCV or other chronic virus or parasite infection, the intermittent dosing protocol is typically maintained over a relatively long time period, e.g., for at least about 6 months to about 5 or more years.","In some embodiments, the number of days of continuous dosing in steps (1) and (3) is the same in each round of treatment, i.e., each time period in step (1) and (3) is the same in the initial and subsequent rounds of the method. In other embodiments they differ. Thus, in some embodiments, step (1) may comprise daily dosing of about 20 mg\/day to about 1500 mg\/day (e.g., about 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 225, 250, 275, 300, 325, 350 or 400 mg\/day) of a formula 1 compound for 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or more consecutive days. Then, step (2) may comprise not administering any formula 1 compound for at least about 4, 5, 6, 7, 14, 21, 28, 42, 56, 84, 98, 112 or more consecutive days. Step (3) could comprise daily administration of about 20 mg\/day to about 1500 mg\/day (e.g., about 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 225, 250, 275, 300, 325, 350 or 400 mg\/day) of a formula 1 compound for 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or more consecutive days. Steps (1) through (3) is optionally repeated for about 1-30 or more times. On days when the formula 1 compound is administered to the subject, it may be delivered in a single dose or in two, three or more subdoses at, e.g., about 12 hour or about 8 hour time intervals. Administration of the formula 1 compound would be by one or more of the routes described herein.","In any of the intermittent dosing protocols described herein, the formula 1 compound(s) can be administered by one or more suitable routes, e.g., oral, buccal, sublingual, intramuscular (i.m.), subcutaneous (s.c.), intravenous (i.v.), intradermal, other parenteral route or by an aerosol. The daily dose in such methods will comprise about 0.05 to about 100 mg\/kg\/day, or about 0.1 to about 10 mg\/kg\/day, including about 0.2 mg\/kg\/day, 0.5 mg\/kg\/day, about 1 mg\/kg\/day, about 2 mg\/kg\/day, about 4 mg\/kg\/day or about 6 mg\/kg\/day. Alternatively, one can administer the formula 1 compound(s) orally using about 4 to about 40 mg\/kg\/day, usually about 6-20 mg\/kg\/day. In some embodiments, the intermittent dosing methods exclude dosing protocols that are commonly used to deliver contraceptive steroids to, e.g., human females, such as daily dosing for 21 days, followed by no dosing for 7 days. In some embodiments, the non-aqueous formulations described herein that comprise a formula 1 compound(s) are administered i.m. or s.c., while aqueous formulations that contain formula 1 compound(s) is administered by i.v., i.m., s.c. or other parenteral routes.","Exemplary embodiments comprise (a) administering a formula 1 compound(s), e.g., BrEA or an ester or carbonate of BrEA, once every other day for about 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 20 or more days, followed by (b) no dosing for about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 70, 84, 98, 112 or more days and then (c) administering the formula 1 compound(s) at least once more on one day, e.g., administering the formula 1 compound(s) once every other day for about 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 20 or more days and (d) optionally repeating (a), (b) and (c) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 times or more. A subset of these embodiments comprise (a) administering a formula 1 compound(s), e.g., BrEA or an ester or carbonate of BrEA, once every other day for about 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 20 or more days, followed by (b) no dosing for at least about 7-190 consecutive days, e.g., about 10-40 days, and then (c) administering the formula 1 compound(s) at least once more on one day, e.g., administering the formula 1 compound(s) once every other day for about 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 20 or more days and (d) optionally repeating (a), (b) and (c) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 times or more. In any of these embodiments, one can administer the formula 1 compound(s) in 2 or 3 subdoses per day.","Other embodiments comprise (a) administering a formula 1 compound(s), e.g., BrEA or an ester or carbonate of BrEA, once every day (or in 2 or 3 daily subdoses) for 3-15 or about 8-12 days, followed by (b) no dosing for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 56, 70, 84, 98, 112 or more days and then (c) administering the formula 1 compound(s) at least once more on one day, e.g., administering the formula 1 compound(s) once per day for about 3-15 or about 8-12 consecutive days essentially as described in step (a) and (d) optionally repeating (a), (b) and (c) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 times or more. A subset of these embodiments are (a) administering a formula 1 compound(s), e.g., BrEA or an ester or carbonate of BrEA, once every day for about 10 days, followed by (b) no dosing for about 10-40 days and then (c) administering the formula 1 compound(s) at least once more on one day, e.g., administering the formula 1 compound(s) once per day for about 10 days and (d) optionally repeating (a), (b) and (c) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 times or more. In any of these embodiments, one can administer the formula 1 compound(s) in 2 or 3 subdoses per day.","One aspect of invention intermittent dosing is monitoring the subject's response to a particular dosing regimen or schedule, e.g., to any intermittent administration method disclosed herein. For example, while dosing a subject who has a viral infection (e.g., HCV, HIV, SIV, SHIV), one can measure the subject's or pathogen's response, e.g., amelioration of one or more symptoms or a change in infectious particles or viral DNA or RNA in the serum or a change in an immune parameter of interest. Once a response is observed dosing can be continued for one, two or three additional days, followed by discontinuing the dosing for at least one day (at least 24 hours), usually for at least about 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 14, 21, 28, 42, 56, 70, 84, 98, 112 or more days. Once the subject's response shows signs of remission (e.g., a symptom begins to intensify, viral serum DNA or RNA begins to increase or an immune parameter, e.g., as described herein, begins to deteriorate), dosing can be resumed for another course. An aspect of the subject's response to formula 1 compound(s) is that the subject may show a measurable response within a short time, usually about 5-10 days, which allows straightforward tracking of the subject's response, e.g., by monitoring viral titer in peripheral white blood cells (\u201cPBMC\u201d), by measuring viral nucleic acid levels in the blood or by measuring a white blood cell population(s) or expression of a cytokine or interleukin by e.g., white blood cells or a subset(s) thereof. One may monitor one or more immune cell subsets, e.g., NK, LAK, dendritic cells or cells that mediate ADCC immune responses, during and after intermittent dosing to monitor the subject's response and to determine when further administration of the formula 1 compound is indicated. These cell subsets are monitored as described herein, e.g., by flow cytometry.","For any of the treatments or methods described herein, prolonged beneficial effects or a sustained immune response by a subject may result from a single administration or a few daily administrations of the formula 1 compound for from intermittent treatment with the formula 1 compound. A single administration means that a formula 1 compound is administered to the subject in one, two, three or more doses within a 24 hour period and no further administration of any formula 1 compound to the subject occurs for at least about 7-90 days, e.g., about for at least about 45 days to about 2 months, or for about 3, 4, 5, 6 or more months. Prolonged beneficial effects or immune responses may also persist after a short course of treatment has been completed (e.g., daily dosing for 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 days) and the subject is no longer receiving any formula 1 compound, or, in some cases, any other therapeutic treatment to treat the primary cause of the subject's pathological condition. Such beneficial effects can persist for more than about 5-30 days, e.g., for at least about 21, 28, 42, 56, 70, 84, 98, 112 or more days.","Other intermittent dosing embodiments comprise administering to a subject having or susceptible to a condition as described herein an effective amount of a formula 1 compound using an initial induction or high dosing regimen. The high dosing regimen may comprise, e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or more daily doses of about 4 to about 40 mg\/kg that are administered daily, every other day, every 3day, every 4day or every 5day. Then, the subject is not dosed with a formula 1 compound for a period, e.g., of about 7, 14, 21, 28, 42, 56, 70, 84, 98, 112 or more consecutive days. Then a lower daily dosing regimen is administered to the subject, e.g., about 0.2 mg\/kg to about 4 or about 6 mg\/kg, essentially as described for the high dosing regimen. Alternatively, this low dosing regimen may comprise 1, 2, 3, 6 or more rounds of a low to moderate initial level, e.g., about 2 to about 10 mg\/kg\/day, optionally followed by subsequent rounds of daily dosing that decrease the initial low to moderate level by about 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% or more in each subsequent round of treatment, which is continued until administration is discontinued.","In some cases, beneficial effects from treatment have been observed for more than 3 months (4 or 5 or more months) after a short course of treatment of a subject with a formula 1 compound. Thus, administration of a formula 1 compound provides a method to help protect a subject against progression of an infection or against adverse consequences of unwanted immune reactions (e.g., inflammation) or against immunosuppression (from infection, chemotherapy, or as disclosed herein), without any dosing of the compound for at least 3 months after an initial dosing protocol, which could be an intermittent or a continuous dosing protocol over, e.g., 1 day to about 4 months (1-15 days, about 1 month, about 2 months, etc).","Invention embodiments include a method to modulate an immune or cellular response in a subject in need thereof comprising administering to the subject, or delivering to the subject's tissues, an effective amount of a compound of formula 1.

For example, esters, of formula 1-10c compounds, such as \u2014O\u2014C(O)\u2014Rwhere Ris a Corganic moiety, are prepared from the steroid alcohol by treatment with the appropriate acid anhydride or acid chloride (R\u2014C(O)\u2014Cl) to form any desired ester. Ethers, such as \u2014O\u2014R, are prepared from alcohols by formation of the alkaline metal alkoxide (Na or K) followed by treatment with a primary or secondary iodide (R\u2014I). Thionoesters, R\u2014C(S)\u2014O\u2014, are prepared by treating the R\u2014C(O)\u2014O\u2014 ester with Lawesson's reagent.","Sulfates, NaO\u2014S(O)(O)\u2014O\u2014, R\u2014O\u2014S(O)(O)\u2014O\u2014, e.g., CH(CH)\u2014S(O)(O)\u2014O\u2014, are prepared by treatment of alcohols with chlorosulfonic acid followed by NaOH or alternatively by oxidation of sulfites using KMnO. If the alkyl (e.g., methyl) ester is desired alkylchloro-sulfonate (methylchloro-sulfonate) can be used. Sulfites HO\u2014S(O)\u2014O\u2014 and ammonium salts NHO\u2014S(O)\u2014O, or RO\u2014S(O)\u2014O\u2014 esters (e.g., CHO\u2014S(O)\u2014O\u2014) are prepared by standard methods. The ammonium salts are prepared by treatment of alcohols with ammonia and sulfur dioxide. The esters such as alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl esters (e.g., methyl ester) are obtained when alcohols are treated with alkylchlorosulfite (e.g., methycholorosulfite), alkenylchlorosulfite or alkynylchlorosulfite in the presence of a suitable base such as triethylamine. Phosphoesters, RO\u2014P(OR)(O)\u2014O\u2014 are prepared by treating the alcohol with diethylchlorophosphate in the presence of NaCO. Alternatively, if the alcohol is treated with phosphoric acid diesters in the presence of triphenylphospine (PPh) and diethylazodicarboxylate (DEAD) the corresponding triesters are formed with inversion (Mitsunobu reaction).","Phosphothioesters, RO\u2014P(SR)(O)\u2014O\u2014 are generated by treatment of alcohols with the monothio analog of diethylchlorophosphate as described for phosphoesters yielding the phosphothioesters. Carbonates, RO\u2014C(O)\u2014O\u2014 are generated from the corresponding steroid alcohol using the chloroformate (R\u2014C(O)\u2014CI), e.g., Calkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl chloroformates (e.g. CH(CH)\u2014C(O)Cl). Carbamates, R\u2014NH\u2014C(O)\u2014O\u2014 are made from steroid alcohols by treatment with isocyanates (RN\u2550C\u2550O) or NaOCN in the presence of trifluororoacetic acid. Aminoacid esters, ZNX\u2014CHY\u2014C(O)\u2014O\u2014 are generated by coupling the steroid alcohol with the acid chloride of the N-protected amino acid.","Oxidation of hydroxyl groups that are linked to the steroid nucleus is used to obtain ketones and related functionalities. For example, conversion of alcohols to ketones can be achieved using a variety of oxidizing agents such as CrOin AcOH, or pyridinium cholorchromate, pyridinium dichromate or oxalyl chloride with triethylamine (Swern oxidation). Thioketones (\u2550S) are prepared by treating ketones with Lawesson's reagent (2,4-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphetane-2,4-disulfide; commercially available from Aldrich). Thioacetals, \u2014C(SR)(SR)\u2014, are prepared from ketones (\u2014C(O)\u2014) by treatment with R\u2014SH thiols under acid catalysis conditions (e.g., HCl). Phosphonoesters, RO\u2014P(OR)(O)\u2014, are generated by addition of the phosphorus acid diester to ketones in the presence of KF to yield hydroxy phosphonoesters. One may optionally remove the hydroxy group using a dehydration and hydrogenation sequence.","Substitution of hydroxyl groups is used to generate a number of functionalities. For example, thiols, \u2014SH, are prepared from alcohols by conversion of the alcohol with inversion to the bromide using PBr. Treatment of the bromide with thiourea followed by NaOH gives the thiol. Thioethers, R\u2014S\u2014,","are prepared from thiols by treatment with NaOH and the required halide, e.g., alkyl halide. Alternatively, alcohol derivatives like tosylates or mesylates can be displaced by thiolate anions, R\u2014S\u2014, to yield the thioether. Thioesters, R\u2014C(O)\u2014S\u2014, are prepared by treating the tosylate (mesylate) of the alcohol with the sodium salt of the thioacid.","Substitution of hydroxyl groups can be used to generate both esters, RO\u2014C(O)\u2014, and amides, NHR\u2014C(O)\u2014, linked to the steroid at carbon atoms. For amides and amines, Ris \u2014H, a protecting group or a Corganic moiety. These are synthesized from the steroid bromide with inversion by displacement with NaCN. The cyanide group can be hydrolyzed to the amide or the acid. The acid is esterified or treated by standard peptide coupling reactions with an acid-protected amino acid in the presence of a suitable carboxyl activating agents such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) to form steroid \u2014C(O)\u2014NH\u2014CHY\u2014C(O)\u2014OR, where Y is the side chain of an amino acid or a C1-C10 organic moiety and R is a protecting group (or hydrogen when deprotected).","Amines and derivatives of amines, e.g., RNH\u2014, R\u2014C(O)NH\u2014, R\u2014C(O)\u2014NH\u2014 or RO\u2014C(O)\u2014CHR\u2014NH\u2014 linked to steroid carbon atoms, are typically prepared by standard methods. For example, amines (NH-steroid) are generally prepared using the Hoffmann rearrangement (Br, NaOH) from the amide (NH\u2014C(O)-steroid) or the Curtius rearrangement (NaN) from the acid chloride of the steroid. The Rsubstituent can subsequently be introduced by alkylation. Steroid alcohols can be used as starting materials under standard Mitsunobu conditions (PPh, DEAD) to yield N-Boc sulfonamides using N-(t-butoxycarbonyl)-p-toluenesulfonamide. One can selectively remove either protecting group. Treatment with trifluoroacetic acid affords the sulfonamide (R\u2014S(O)(O)\u2014NH-steroid). Alternatively, sodium napthalenide deprotects to give the N-Boc compound. Amines (NH-steroid) can be converted to amides (R\u2014C(O)\u2014NH-steroid) using acyl chlorides (R\u2014C(O)\u2014Cl). Treatment with ethyl chloroformate gives the N-carbamate (RO\u2014C(O)\u2014NH-steroid). The amine (NH-steroid) can be alkylated with an \u03b1-bromoester to yield the amino acid substituted steroid (R\u2014O\u2014C(O)\u2014CHY\u2014NH-steroid).","Where reactions such as substitutions give a product mixture, the desired intermediate is optionally separated from other products or at least partially enriched (e.g., enriched at least about 10-fold, usually at least about 50-100-fold) from other products before subsequent reactions are conducted. Substitution at steroid carbon atoms will generally proceed with greatest efficiency at the 3-position, which is relatively sterically unhindered and C-17 is generally somewhat less accessible than the C-3 position. The relative reactivities of the C-3, C-7, C-17 and C-16 positions allows one to use their reactivities to control the sequential introduction of different functional groups into the same steroid molecule. Also, groups, such as hydroxyl at more reactive positions, C-3 or C-17, may be sequentially protected or deprotected to allow introduction of functional groups at other positions, such as C-7 or C-16.","Polymers such as PEG are linked to the compounds essentially as described above. For example, PEG200 or PEG300 is linked to the steroid at the 3, 7, 16, 17 or other positions by an ether linkage (PEG-O-steroid) using a PEG alkoxide (PEG-ONa), to displace the steroid bromide. Alternatively, PEG-Br can be treated with the steroid alkoxide. Polyethylene glycol esters such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,681,964 can also be prepared using a suitable formula 1 compound and the methods described therein. Monosaccharides or polysaccharides and oligonucleotides are linked to steroid hydroxyl groups using known methods, see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,627,270.","Formula 1 steroid analogs that comprise one or more ring heteroatoms are synthesized according to the following methods.","Scheme 11. Formula 1 compounds that comprise two or three ring heteroatoms are prepared as shown in the following schemes. In the scheme, X is \u2014CH\u2014, \u2014NH\u2014, \u2014O\u2014, or \u2014S\u2014; Ris \u2014H or \u2014Br; Ris an organic moiety having about 12 carbon atoms or less, typically C1-C8 optionally substituted alkyl (e.g., methyl, hydroxymethyl, ethyl, propyl, \u2014CH(O), \u2014CH(S)) or C2-C8 optionally substituted alkenyl having a single double bond (e.g., vinyl) with 1, 2, 3 or more independently selected substituents (e.g., \u2014OH, \u2014COOH, \u2014O\u2014) and with any substituents that comprise a functional group generally being protected. Preparation of compound 20 from 19 is accomplished using a glycol such as HOC(CH)C(CH)OH in acid (H) (B. H. Lipshutz et al., 12: 267, 1982). The use of a bulky protecting group facilitates generation of a double bond at the 5-6 position over the 4-5 position.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0389","num":"0538"},"chemistry":[{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00069","num":"00069"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00069","he":"241.64mm","wi":"75.69mm","file":"US08022234-20110920-C00069.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00070","num":"00070"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00070","he":"246.13mm","wi":"75.01mm","file":"US08022234-20110920-C00070.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00071","num":"00071"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00071","he":"95.59mm","wi":"75.27mm","file":"US08022234-20110920-C00071.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}]},"Schemes 12A-12D.

As shown in scheme 11, the bromine atom is ultimately found at the 7-position. The bromine may be converted to a hydroxyl by reaction of the steroid with base (e.g., aqueous KOH), and the hydroxyl may in turn be protected using known methods, e.g., using CH\u2014CH\u2014Br and base (KOH). The alcohol is protected and deprotected essentially using described methods, see, e.g., W. H. Hartung et al., 7: 263, 1953; E. J. Rerst et al., 29: 3725, 1968; A. M. Felix et al., 43: 4194, 1978; D.

Other substituents are linked to the steroids essentially as described in schemes 1-10.","Alternative routes to introduce a functional group into the 7-position are also suitable. For example, formula 1 compounds that have a double bond at the 5-6 position and are unsubstituted at the 7-position are optionally protected, e.g., hydroxyl groups are protected with acetate, and a ketone is introduced into the 7-position by oxidation with chromic acid essentially as described (U.S. Pat. No. 2,170,124). The carbonyl (\u2550O) at 7 is reduced to a hydroxyl using mild conditions, e.g., Al(Oi-Pr), to avoid reducing the 5-6 double bond.","Selective hydrogenation of a double bond at the 16-17 position without reduction of a double bond at 5-6 is accomplished using Hand Pd. In general, ketones (\u2550O) can be protected using a glycol, e.g., reaction with ethylene glycol in p-toluenesulfonic acid and benzene, before subsequent oxidation or reduction reactions are conducted.","Various groups that may comprise the formula 1 compounds described herein, e.g., hydroxyl groups or ketones bonded to the steroid nucleus, or substituted alkyl groups, substituted heterocycles, amino acids and peptides, can contain one or more reactive moieties such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, amino or thiol. Intermediates used to make formula 1 compounds may be protected as is apparent in the art. Noncyclic and cyclic protecting groups and corresponding cleavage reactions are described in \u201cProtective Groups in Organic Chemistry\u201d, Theodora W. Greene (John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1991, ISBN 0-471-62301-6) (hereafter \u201cGreene\u201d) and will not be detailed here. In the context of the present invention, these protecting groups are groups that can be removed from a formula 1 compound without irreversibly changing the covalent bond structure or oxidation\/reduction state of the remainder of the molecule. For example, the protecting group, \u2014R, that is bonded to an \u2014O\u2014 or \u2014NH\u2014 group can be removed to form \u2014OH or \u2014NH, respectively, without affecting other covalent bonds in the molecule. At times, when desired, more than one protecting group can be removed at a time, or they can be removed sequentially. In formula 1 compounds containing more than one protecting group, the protecting groups are the same or different.","Protecting groups are removed by known procedures, although it will be understood that the protected intermediates fall within the scope of this invention. The removal of the protecting group may be arduous or straight-forward, depending upon the economics and nature of the conversions involved. In general, one will use a protecting group with exocyclic amines or with carboxyl groups during synthesis of a formula 1 compound. For most therapeutic applications amine groups should be deprotected. Protecting groups commonly are employed to protect against covalent modification of a sensitive group in reactions such as alkylation or acylation. Ordinarily, protecting groups are removed by, e.g. hydrolysis, elimination or aminolysis. Thus, simple functional considerations will suffice to guide the selection of a reversible or an irreversible protecting group at a given locus on the formula 1 compounds. Suitable protecting groups and criteria for their selection are described in T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Eds. \u201cProtective Groups in Organic Synthesis\u201d 2nd edition, Wiley Press, at pps. 10-142, 143-174, 175-223, 224-276, 277-308, 309-405 and 406-454.","Determination of whether a group is a protecting group is made in the conventional manner, e.g., as described by Kocienski, Philip J.; \u201c\u201d (Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, New York, 1994) (hereafter \u201cKocienski\u201d), Section 1.1, page 2, and Greene Chapter 1, pages 1-9. In particular, a group is a protecting group if when, based on mole ratio, 90% of that protecting group has been removed by a deprotection reaction, no more than 50%, typically 25%, more typically 10%, of the deprotected product molecules have undergone changes to their covalent bond structure or oxidation\/reduction state other than those occasioned by the removal of the protecting group. When multiple protecting groups of the same type are present in the molecule, the mole ratios are determined when all of the groups of that type are removed. When multiple protecting groups of different types are present in the molecule, each type of protecting group is treated (and the mole ratios are determined) independently or together with others depending on whether the deprotection reaction conditions pertinent to one type are also pertinent to the other types present. In one embodiment, a group is a protecting group if when, based on mole ratio determined by conventional techniques, 90% of that protecting group has been removed by a conventional deprotection reaction, no more than 50%, typically 25%, more typically 10%, of the deprotected product molecules have undergone irreversible changes to their covalent bond structure or oxidation\/reduction state other than those occasioned by the removal of the protecting group. Irreversible changes require chemical reactions (beyond those resulting from aqueous hydrolysis, acid\/base neutralization or conventional separation, isolation or purification) to restore the covalent bond structure or oxidation\/reduction state of the deprotected formula 1 compound.","Protecting groups are also described in detail together with general concepts and specific strategies for their use in Kocienski, Philip J.; \u201cProtecting Groups\u201d (Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, New York, 1994), which is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein.

These moieties are optionally bonded to the steroid at one, two or more of the variable groups that are bonded to the rings in the formula 1 compounds, e.g., one or more R-R, R, R, Rand R.","Metabolites. Also falling within the scope of this invention are the in vivo metabolites of the compounds described herein and the use of those compounds for use in the methods described herein. This includes metabolites or products that are novel and unobvious over the prior art as new compounds as such and their uses as described herein or in the cited references. Such products may result for example from the oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, amidation, esterification, glycosidation and the like of the administered formula 1 compound, due to enzymatic or chemical processes. Accordingly, the invention includes novel and unobvious compounds produced by a process comprising contacting a compound of this invention with a subject, e.g., a human, rodent or a primate, for a period of time sufficient to yield a metabolic product thereof. Such products typically are identified by preparing a radiolabeled or mass labeled formula 1 compound that comprises, e.g., 1, 2, 3 or more C, C, H, H, I, P, S or Tc atoms bonded to the compound, and administering it as a trace labeled compound along with the unlabeled compound. The labeled and unlabeled compound is administered by any suitable route (by, e.g., a buccal, sublingual, parenteral, topical or oral route) in a detectable dose (e.g. greater than about 0.1 \u03bcg\/kg, or at least about 10 \u03bcg\/kg or at least about 0.5 mg\/kg of the labeled compound) to a subject, e.g., an animal or mammal such as rat, mouse, guinea pig, primate, or to a human. After administration sufficient time is allowed for metabolism to occur (typically about 30 seconds to 30 hours) and conversion products are isolated from one or more of the urine, blood, plasma, feces or other suitable biological sources. The amount of labeled formula 1 compound that is administered to a subject will vary with the specific activity of the labeled compound. Exemplary metabolic conversions of formula 1 compounds include modification of hydrogen atoms or other moieties that are bonded to, e.g., one or more of the 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 11, 15, 16 or 17 positions. Exemplary conversions at these one or more of positions include hydroxylation of ring atoms, e.g., ring carbon atoms, conjugation of hydroxyl groups that are bonded to one or more of those positions with moieties such as sulfate, phosphate or a monosaccharide or disaccharide such as glucuronic acid and hydrolysis of moieties such as esters or alkoxy groups.","Exemplary radiolabeled and heavy atom labeled formula 1 compounds include ones that comprise 1, 2, 3 or more C, C, H, H, I, P or S atoms that are at (or bonded to), e.g., one, two, three or more of the 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18 or 19 positions. In some embodiments, the molecule comprises only one or two types, e.g., C or H, of labeled atoms. Suitably labeled compounds include any of the compounds disclosed herein, e.g., any formula 1 compound in compound groups 1 through 54. Such labeled compounds may comprise, e.g., a C at the 18 or 19 positions and one two or three H may be bonded to the C atom(s). Other formula 1 compounds may comprise one or two H or H atoms bonded to one or more of the 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 11 or 12 positions and optionally a C at the 18 or 19 position(s).","These products or metabolites are easily isolated since they are labeled (others are isolated, e.g., by the use of antibodies capable of binding epitopes surviving in the metabolite). The metabolite structures are determined in conventional fashion, e.g. by MS, GC-MS, HPLC including reverse phase HPLC, or NMR analysis. In general, analysis of metabolites is accomplished in the same way as conventional drug metabolism studies, which are known to those skilled in the art. The conversion products, especially when they are not otherwise found in vivo, are useful in diagnostic assays for therapeutic dosing of the formula 1 compounds even if they possess only limited therapeutic activity of their own.","Formulations and compositions for preparing formulations. Invention embodiments include formulations described here and elsewhere in this disclosure. While it is possible for the formula 1 compound(s) to be administered alone it is usual to present them as formulations. The formulations, both for veterinary and for human use, comprise at least one formula 1 compound, together with one or more excipients and optionally one or more additional therapeutic ingredients.","This aspect of the invention includes compositions comprising one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients or carriers. The compositions are used to prepare formulations suitable for human or animal use. Suitable administration routes for formulations include oral, rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), vaginal and parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intradermal, intrathecal, intraocular and epidural). In general, aqueous and non-aqueous liquid or cream formulations are delivered by a parenteral, oral or topical route. In other embodiments, such as the invention intermittent dosing methods, the formula 1 compound(s) may be present as an aqueous or a non-aqueous liquid formulation or a solid formulation suitable for administration by any of the routes disclosed herein, e.g., oral, topical, buccal, sublingual, parenteral or inhaled aerosol. It will be appreciated that the preferred route may vary with, for example, the subject's pathological condition or weight or the subject's response to therapy with a formula 1 compound or other therapy that is used or that is appropriate to the circumstances.","The formulations include those suitable for the foregoing administration routes. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods known in the art of pharmacy.

The topical formulations may include a compound that enhances absorption or penetration of the formula 1 compound(s) through the skin or other affected areas. Examples of such dermal penetration enhancers include dimethyl sulphoxide and related analogs.","The oily phase of the emulsions of this invention may be constituted from known excipients in a known manner. While the phase may comprise an emulsifier (otherwise known as an emulgent), it desirably comprises a mixture of at least one emulsifier with a fat or an oil or with both a fat and an oil. A hydrophilic emulsifier may be included together with a lipophilic emulsifier, which acts as a stabilizer. Some embodiments include both an oil and a fat. Together, the emulsifier(s) with or without stabilizer(s) make up the so-called emulsifying wax, and the wax together with the oil and fat make up the so-called emulsifying ointment base which forms the oily dispersed phase of the cream formulations.","Emulgents and emulsion stabilizers suitable for use in the formulations include Tween60\u2122, Span80\u2122, cetostearyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, glyceryl mono-stearate and sodium lauryl sulfate.","The choice of suitable oils or fats for the formulation is based on achieving the desired cosmetic properties.

In preparing any of the compositions or formulations that are disclosed herein and that comprise a formula 1 compound (and optionally one or more excipients), one may optionally mill, sieve or otherwise granulate the compound or composition to obtain a desired particle size, e.g., as described above.","Milling may occur before or after the formula 1 compound is contacted with one or more excipients. For example, one may mill a formula 1 compound such as 16\u03b1-bromoepiandrosterone hemihydrate, to obtain an average particle size (or diameter) of about 0.05-50 \u03bcM or about 0.5-10 \u03bcM (e.g., about 0.04, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 or 120 \u03bcM average particle size or diameter) before contacting the milled formula 1 compound with a liquid or solid excipient. In some cases the formula 1 compound is milled or sieved to obtain an average particle size of about 5 \u03bcm or about 10 \u03bcm before it is contacted with a solid or liquid excipient(s) to obtain a solution or suspension or a powder suitable for making a tablet, capsule or other dosage form as described herein or in the cited references.","As used herein, reference to an average particle size or an average particle diameter means that the material, e.g., a formula 1 compound(s), an excipient(s) or a composition that comprises both, is ground, milled, sieved or otherwise treated so as to comprise the specified average size. It is to be understood that some particles may be larger or smaller, but the composition or the formula 1 compound(s) will comprise a significant proportion of the material with the specified size or within an acceptable range of the specified size. Micronization methods include milling by ball mills, pin mills, jet mills (e.g., fluid energy jet mills) and grinding, sieving and precipitation of a compound(s) from a solution, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,919,341, 5,202,129, 5,271,944, 5,424,077 and 5,455,049. Average particle size is determined by, e.g., transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, light microscopy, X-ray diffractometry and light scattering methods or Coulter counter analysis.","Thus, the formula 1 compounds may comprise a powder that consists of one, two or more of these average particle sizes and the powder may be contacted with a solid excipient(s), suitably mixed and optionally compressed or formed into a desired shape. Alternatively, such a formula 1 compound(s) is contacted with a liquid excipient(s) to prepare a liquid formulation or a liquid composition that is incorporated into a solid formulation. Suitable micronized formulations thus include aqueous or oily solutions or suspensions of the formula 1 compound(s).","Formulations suitable for aerosol administration typically will comprise a fine powder, e.g., having an average particle size of about 0.1 to about 20 microns or any one, two or more of the average particle sizes within this range that are described above. The powder is typically delivered by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage or by inhalation through the mouth so as to reach the bronchioles or alveolar sacs of the lungs.","Formulations suitable for aerosol, dry powder or tablet administration may be prepared according to conventional methods and may be delivered with other therapeutic agents such as compounds heretofore used in the treatment or prophylaxis of viral or other infections as described herein. Such formulations may be administered, e.g., orally, parenterally (e.g., intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intradermal, intrathecal), topically, sublingually or by a buccal or sublingual route.","Micronized formula 1 compound is useful, e.g., to facilitate mixing, dissolution or uniform suspension of the formula 1 compound in one or more liquid or solid excipients, e.g., a PEG such as PEG 300 or PEG 400, or propylene glycol or benzyl benzoate, a complexing agent, such as a cyclodextrin (e.g., an \u03b1-, \u03b2- or \u03b3-cyclodextrin such as hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin). Micronized formula 1 compound is also useful to facilitate uniformly distributing drug substance when the micronized compound is contacted with one or more solid excipients (e.g., a filler, a binder, a disintegrant, complexing agent (e.g., a cyclodextrin such as hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin), a preservative, a buffer or a lubricant).","In related embodiments, suitable compositions or formulations comprise a formula 1 compound that is present in two or more physical forms. For example, a liquid composition or formulation may comprise a formula 1 compound that is present in solution and as undissolved particles, which may be milled as described herein. Alternatively, a solid composition or formulation may comprise a formula 1 compound that is present as an amorphous form and as a crystal or in an encapsulated granule. Such encapsulated granules may comprise a slow release type formulation and the formula 1 compound that is present may be in one or more physical forms, e.g., liquids or solids as described herein, but usually as a solid in tablets or other solid formulations.","The formulations are presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid excipient, for example water for injection, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions are prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets as described above. Unit dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose or unit daily sub-dose, as recited herein, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the formula 1 compound(s).","It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above the formulations of this invention may include other agents or excipients conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question, for example those suitable for oral administration may include flavoring agents.","Formulations made from or comprising a formula 1 compound such as BrEA hemihydrate are optionally stored under conditions that limit the amount of light or water that reaches the formulation, e.g., in a sealed container that holds a formulation or unit dosage form and optionally contains silica gel or activated carbon. Water permeation characteristics of containers have been described, e.g., Containers\u2014Permeation, Chapter, USP 23, 1995, U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc., Rockville, Md., p. 1787. Storage of BrEA hemihydrate or formulations that contain it is typically at about 4-30\u00b0 C.","The invention further provides veterinary compositions comprising at least one formula 1 compound together with a veterinary excipient(s) therefor. Veterinary excipients are materials useful for the purpose of administering the composition and may be solid, liquid or gaseous materials that are otherwise inert or acceptable in the veterinary art and are compatible with the formula 1 compound(s). These veterinary compositions may be administered orally, parenterally or by any other desired route.","Invention formulations include controlled release pharmaceutical formulations containing a formula 1 compound(s) (\u201ccontrolled release formulations\u201d, \u201cslow release formulations\u201d or the like) in which the release of the formula 1 compound(s) is controlled or regulated to allow less frequency dosing or to improve the pharmacokinetic or toxicity profile of a given formula 1 compound(s). Polymers and other materials that are suitable to prepare controlled release formulations that comprise a formula 1 compound have been described, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,652,443, 4,800,085, 4,808,416, 5,013,727, 5,188,840.","Thus, microcapsules, granules or other shaped forms may comprise a formula 1 compound and a slow release polymer or polymer matrix that comprises or consists of one or more of ethylene dimethacrylate, diethylene glycol dimethacrylate, diethylene glycol diacrylate, triethylene glycol dimethacrylate, triethylene glycol diacrylate, tetraethylene glycol dimethacrylate, tetraethylene glycol diacrylate, polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate, polyethylene glycol diacrylate, diethylaminoethyl dimethacrylate, glycidyl methacrylate, epoxy acrylate, glycidyl acrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate, hydroxyethyl acrylate, hydroxypropyl methacrylate, hydroxypropyl acrylate, hydroxybutyl methacrylate, hydroxybutyl acrylate, hydroxyhexyl methacrylate, hydroxyhexyl acrylate, butanediol dimethacrylate, butanediol diacrylate, propanediol dimethacrylate, propanediol diacrylate, pentanediol dimethacrylate, pentanediol diacrylate, hexanediol dimethacrylate, hexanediol diacrylate, neopentyl glycol dimethacrylate, neopentyl glycol diacrylate, trimethylopropane triacrylate, trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate, trimethyloethane triacrylate, trimethylolethane trimethacrylate, polypropyleneglycol diacrylate, and polypropylene glycol dimethacrylate.","An effective dose of formula 1 compound(s) depends in part on one or more of the nature of the condition being treated, toxicity, whether the formula 1 compound(s) is being used prophylactically (generally lower doses) or against an active infection or condition, the method of delivery, and the formulation. For use in humans, the effective dosage will typically be determined by the clinician using conventional dose escalation studies. In other subjects, the dose is obtained by similar dose escalation analyses. For humans, an effective dose can be expected to be from about 0.05 to about 50 mg\/kg body weight per day, e.g., about 2 mg\/kg\/day, about 4 mg\/kg\/day, about 6 mg\/kg\/day, or about 8 mg\/kg\/day. For example, for topical delivery the daily candidate dose for an adult human of approximately 70 kg body weight will range from about 1 mg to about 500 mg, generally between about 5 mg and about 40 mg, and may take the form of single or multiple doses or administration sites. For non-human subjects, e.g., mammals such as rodents or primates, the effective daily dosage may comprise about 0.05 mg\/kg\/day to about 300 mg\/kg\/day, including about 1 mg\/kg\/day to about 100 mg\/kg\/day. As used herein, an \u201ceffective dosage\u201d or an \u201ceffective amount\u201d of a formula 1 compound(s) is one that is sufficient to result in, e.g., a detectable change in a symptom or an immune parameter such as one described herein. An effective dosage (or daily dosage) may be administered to a subject over a period of time, e.g., at least about 1-14 days before a symptom change or an immune parameter detectably changes. Effective dosages may include any of the dosages as described herein.","Embodiments include formulations that comprise a liposome or lipid complex that comprises a formula 1 compound(s), e.g., BrEA or an ester, carbamate, carbonate, amino acid or peptide thereof. Such formulations are prepared according to known methods, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,427,649, 5,043,165, 5,714,163, 5,744,158, 5,783,211, 5,795,589, 5,795,987, 5,798,348, 5,811,118, 5,820,848, 5,834,016 and 5,882,678. The liposomes optionally contain an additional therapeutic agent(s), e.g., amphotericin B, cis-platin, adriamycin, a protease inhibitor, a nucleoside or a nucleotide analog, such as one of those mentioned herein. Formulations that comprise liposomes can be delivered to a subject by any standard route, e.g., oral, aerosol or parenteral (e.g., s.c., i.v. or i.m.).","Liposome formulations can be used to enhance delivery of the formula 1 compound(s) to certain cell types such as tumor cells (see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,714,163) or to cells of the reticuloendothelial system (\u201cRES\u201d). The RES includes macrophages, mononuclear phagocytic cells, Kupfer cells, cells lining the sinusoids of the spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow, and the fibroblastic reticular cells of hematopoietic tissues. In general, RES cells are phagocytic and they are targets for targeted delivery of a formula 1 compound(s) in vitro or in vivo using liposomes, or other compositions or formulations. Thus, one can deliver formula 1 compound to a neoplasm that is derived from reticuloendothelial tissue (reticuloendothelioma). The liposomes may optionally comprise a peptide from an infectious agent such as a malaria parasite, a virus or a tumor associated antigen. The peptides may facilitate the generation of a MHC class II and B cell response.","Invention embodiments include the product made by a process of combining, mixing or otherwise contacting a formula 1 compound such as BrEA hemihydrate and one, two or more excipients. Such products are produced by routine methods of contacting the ingredients. Such products optionally contain a diluent, a disintegrant, a lubricant, a binder, or other excipients described herein or in references cited herein.","Other embodiments include compositions that transiently occur when a method step or operation is performed. For example, when a formula 1 compound such as BrEA, containing less than about 3% water is contacted with an excipient, e.g., a PEG, an alcohol, propylene glycol or benzyl benzoate, the composition before addition of one ingredient with another is a non-homogenous mixture. As the ingredients are contacted, the mixture's homogeneity increases and the proportion of ingredients relative to each other approaches a desired value. Thus, invention compositions, which contain less than about 3% water can comprise about 0.0001-99% of a formula 1 compound such as BrEA and one or more excipients. These transient compositions are intermediates that necessarily arise when one makes an invention composition or formulation and they are included in invention embodiments to the extent that they are useful in the disclosed methods or that they are patentable.","When a formula 1 compound and an excipient(s) is contacted or mixed, the final composition may comprise a homogenous mixture or it may comprise a mixture that is not homogenous for one or more of the compounds that are present in the composition. Compositions and formulations that are either homogenous or non-homogenous are included in the scope of the invention. Non-homogenous compositions can be used to make controlled release formulations.","Invention embodiments include compositions and formulations that comprise less than about 3% water, a formula 1 compound and a compound that is not generally considered suitable for human use but is useful to make an invention formulation for veterinary use. Veterinary formulations are compositions useful for the purpose of administering invention compositions to primates, cats, dogs, horses, cows, rabbits and other subjects and may contain excipients acceptable in the veterinary art and are compatible with formula 1 compounds such as BrEA. These veterinary compositions may not always be suitable for human use because they contain an excipient that is not suitable for human use, e.g., an alcohol other than ethanol such as methanol, propanol or butanol. Typically such excipients will be present at relatively low levels, e.g., about 1-30%, usually about 1-5%.","Invention embodiments include compositions and formulations, e.g., unit dosage forms and sterile solutions, that comprise (1) about 1-100 mg\/mL of a formula 1 compound(s), about 57.5% propylene glycol, about 25% PEG300, about 12.5% ethanol and about 5% benzyl benzoate; (2) about 1-60 mg\/mL of a formula 1 compound(s), about 70% propylene glycol, about 25% PEG300 and about 5% benzyl benzoate; (3) about 1-60 mg\/mL of a formula 1 compound(s), about 25% PEG300, about 35% propylene glycol, about 35% mannitol and about 5% benzyl benzoate; (4) about 1-60 mg\/mL of a formula 1 compound(s), about 57.5% propylene glycol, a mixture comprising about 25% PEG300 and PEG200 (e.g., PEG300:PEG200 in a ratio of about 1:10 to about 10:1), about 12.5% ethanol and about 5% benzyl benzoate; (5) about 1-60 mg\/mL of a formula 1 compound(s), about 75% propylene glycol, a mixture comprising about 25% PEG300 and PEG200 (e.g., a PEG300:PEG200 in a ratio of about 1:10 to about 10:1) and about 5% benzyl benzoate; (6) about 1-60 mg\/mL of a formula 1 compound(s), about 25% PEG300 and PEG200 (e.g., PEG300:PEG200 in a ratio of about 1:10 to about 10:1), about 35% propylene glycol, about 35% mannitol and about 5% benzyl benzoate; (7) any of formulations (1) through (6) where the formula 1 compound(s) is about 40-55 mg\/mL; (8) any of formulations (1) through (6) where the formula 1 compound(s) is about 30-100 mg\/mL; (9) any of formulations (1) through (8) where 1, 2, 3 or 4 formula 1 compounds are present; (10) any of formulations (1) through (8) where 1 or 2 formula 1 compounds are present; (11) any of formulations (1) through (8) where 1 formula 1 compound is present; (12) any of formulations (1) through (11) where the formula 1 compound comprises independently at 1, 2 or 3 of any of the variable groups that are bonded to the formula 1 compounds, e.g., R-R, R, R, Ror R, an independently selected ester, thioester, carbonate, carbamate, amino acid or peptide of 1 or 2 independently selected formula 1 compounds; (13) any of formulations (1) through (12) where the formula 1 compound comprises or is BrEA or BrEA hemihydrate; (14) any of formulations (1) through (13) where the formula 1 compound comprises or is an ester, a sulfate ester, a monosaccharide conjugate or phosphoester of BrEA.","Exemplary embodiments include liquid formulations that comprise a formula 1 compound, one, two, three, four or more excipients and less than about 3% v\/v water, wherein the formulation is optionally disposed in containers that exclude water. These excipients are optionally selected from those disclosed herein. Such formulations optionally comprise less than about 2% v\/v water, less than about 1% v\/v water, less than about 0.5% v\/v water, less than about 0.2% v\/v water or less than about 0.1% v\/v water. Such formulations are suitable for use in methods to modulate an immune response or cellular response in a subject in need thereof comprising administering to the subject, or delivering to the subject's tissues, an effective amount of a compound of formula 1. The subject in need thereof would have, or be subject to, a condition such as one disclosed herein as amenable to treatment, prevention, amelioration using a formula 1 compound, which is optionally combined with the use of another therapeutic treatment or agent as disclosed herein or in the cited references. These formulations are suitable for use in any of the dosing methods or protocols disclosed herein, including the intermittent dosing protocols disclosed herein.","Other embodiments include the product obtained by storing invention compositions or formulations, e.g., unit dosage forms, any of embodiments (1)-(14) above, or compositions used to make formulations, at about 4-40\u00b0 C. for at least about 3 days, e.g., storage at ambient temperature for about 1-24 months. Invention formulations will typically be stored in hermetically or induction sealed containers for these time periods. Invention compositions will typically be held in closed containers. The specification and claims disclose exemplary suitable formulations and unit dosage forms for these embodiments.","Immune modulation. As noted elsewhere, the formula 1 compounds, or the biologically active substances produced from these compounds by hydrolysis or metabolism in vivo, have a number of clinical and non-clinical applications. The compounds are generally useful to regulate immune responses in vertebrate or mammalian subjects, e.g., as disclosed herein. For example, they can enhance Th1 immune responses or reduce Th2 immune responses, or they can reduce inflammation or one or more of its symptoms.","As used herein, reference to Th1 or Th2 immune responses means such responses as observed in mammals generally and not as observed in the murine system, from which the Th1 and Th2 terminology originated. Thus, in humans, Th1 cells preferentially display chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CCR5, while Th2 cells preferentially express the CCR4 molecule and a smaller amount of the CCR3 molecule.","The formula 1 compounds are useful in reestablishing normal immune function in various immune dysregulation or immune suppression conditions. For example, they are useful to treat, slow progression of or to ameliorate one or more symptoms associated with one or more of an autoimmune condition(s), a inflammation condition(s), an infection(s), a cancer(s), a precancer(s), a chemotherapy(ies), radiation therapy, a burn(s), a trauma(s), a surgery(ies), a cardiovascular disease(s) and a neurological or neurodegenerative disease(s). Without being limited to any theory, the formula 1 compounds are believed to act through several mechanisms, including by directly or indirectly modulating steroid receptor activity or by affecting or modulating other biological targets such as transcription factors, steroid binding proteins or enzymes.","Clinical indications that have an association with or have a symptom(s) that is consistent with an excessive Th2 immune response include, e.g., fatigue, pain, fever or an increased incidence of infection, are schizophrenia, acute myelitis, sarcoidosis, burns, trauma (e.g., bone fracture, hemorrhage, surgery) and immune responses to xenotransplantation. This common underlying immune component in at least part of the pathology or symptomology of all of these conditions. This allows a single agent to be effectively used to prevent or treat the condition or to treat or ameliorate one or more symptoms that are associated with these conditions or with insufficient Th1 responses or with excessive Th2 responses. In all of the conditions where an insufficient Th1 response or an unwanted Th2 response is present, amelioration of one or more symptoms associated with the condition is accomplished by administering an effective amount of a formula 1 compound according to the methods described herein. Thus, one may intermittently administer a formula 1 compound using a formulation and a route of administration as described herein.","Typically, unwanted Th2 immune responses are associated with, or caused by, increased expression of one or more cytokines or interleukins such as IL-4 and IL-10. Administration of a formula 1 compound will generally reduce the expression of one or more of the Th2-associated cytokines or interleukins. At the same time, the compounds generally enhance the expression of one or more cytokines or interleukins associated with Th1 immune responses. Because of their capacity to modulate or to balance Th1 and Th2 immune responses, the compounds are useful for a variety of clinical conditions, e.g., infection, immunosuppression or cancer, where an enhanced Th1 immune response is desired. Effects of the formula 1 compounds in treating, preventing or slowing the progression of the clinical conditions described herein can include one or more of (1) enhancing the Th1 character of a subject's immune response or immune status, (2) increasing the intensity of a Th1 or a Th2 immune response or both and (3) decreasing inflammation or a symptom thereof.","Exemplary conditions where an immune imbalance or an excessive Th2 immune response is involved include autoimmune diseases such as SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus), osteoporosis, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, Graves disease, mite-associated ulcerative dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Excessive Th2 immune responses are also associated with an unwanted symptom or pathology, e.g., fatigue, pain, fever or an increased incidence of infection, that is associated with aging, allergy and inflammation conditions such as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in cystic fibrosis patients, atopic asthma, allergic respiratory disease, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, subepithelial fibrosis in airway hyperresponsiveness, chronic sinusitis, perennial allergic rhinitis, Crohn's disease (regional enteritis), ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, fibrosing alveolitis (lung fibrosis). These conditions are further described below.","Aspects of the invention include the use or administration of compositions or formulations that comprise a carrier and an amount of at least one formula 1 compound effective to detectably modulate an immune parameter. For example, to enhance the relative proportion of a desired immune cell subset, e.g., CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, NK cells, LAK cells, neutrophils, granulocytes, basophils, eosinophils or dendritic cells, or to modulate one or more functions of immune cell subsets. Exemplary immune modulation centers on modulating expression of gene(s) that enhance of Th1 immune responses or reduces of Th2 immune responses. Functions that the formula 1 compounds affected include expression of CD molecules or alteration of the proportion of cell subsets, e.g., CD4 or CD8 T cells, or their relative numbers in a subject's blood or tissues. CD molecules participate in the function of various immune cell subsets and can be useful as markers for immune function in vivo. In some aspects, the formula 1 compounds activate immune cells which generally alters (increases or decreases) expression of, or changes the numbers of cells that express one or more of, CD4, CD6, CD8, CD25, CD27, CD28, CD30, CD38, CD39, CD43, CD45RA, CD45RO, CD62L, CD69, CD71, CD90 or HLA-DR molecules. Often, the numbers of cells that express these molecules are increased, e.g., CD25, CD16 or CD69. Typically, such increases are observed as an increased proportion of circulating white blood cells that express one or more of these molecules. In some cases the number of such molecules per cell is detectably altered.","Expression of one or more adhesion molecules CD2, CD5, CD8, CD11a, CD11b, CD11c, CD18, CD29, CD31, CD44, CD49a, CD49b, CD49c, CD49d, CD49e, CD49f, CD50, CD54, CD58, CD103 or CD104 are also detectably affected after administration of the formula 1 compounds to a subject. Often, the numbers of cells that express these molecules are increased, e.g., CD5 or CD56. The adhesion molecules function in various aspects of immune responses, such as binding to class I MHC molecules, transducing signals between cells or binding to molecules in the extracellular matrix associated with endothelial or other cell types. Administration of the formula 1 compounds to a subject also affects the numbers of certain immune cell subsets, e.g., NK cells (e.g., CD8, CD56 or CD8, CD56) or lymphokine activated killer cells (LAK). Increased circulating NK or LAK cells are typically observed, which is reflected in increased numbers of cells that express one or more of CD16, CD38, CD56, CD57 or CD94. Also, increased numbers of circulating dendritic cell precursors are observed, as shown by increases in cells that express one or more of CD11c, CD80, CD83, CD106 or CD123. Although one can observe an increased proportion of circulating white blood cells that express one or more of these molecules, in some instances the number of such molecules per cell is detectably altered. Both the cell numbers and the density of CD molecule per cell can also be detectably modulated. Modulation of immune cell subsets typically occurs on intermittent dosing of a formula 1 compound, but will arise from any suitable dosing regimen, e.g., as described herein. Expression of one or more homing receptors such as CD62L, CLA-1, LFA1 or CD44 may also be detectably affected after administration of the formula 1 compounds to a subject. The numbers of cells that express these molecules, or the relative amounts per cell of, e.g., CD44 or CD62L, may be increased where a desired immune response is desired, e.g., migration of T cells to mucosal tissues or exposure of na\u00efve T cells to antigen in lymph nodes. Alternatively, numbers of cells that express these molecules, or the relative amounts per cell of, e.g., CLA-1, may be decreased where inhibition of an undesired immune response, such as an inflammatory response is desired. The subject's response to such enhanced expression includes migration of cells such as movement of na\u00efve T cells to peripheral lymph nodes in response to modulation of CD62L or other homing receptor expression. Thus, the formula 1 compounds can also facilitate migration of various immune cell types, e.g., dendritic cells, NK cells, LAK cells, macrophages or lymphocytes, from one location to another within a subject. For example, the compounds can enhance dendritic cell or lymphocyte migration from areas such as the skin tissues to the gut associated lymphoid tissue (\u201cGALT\u201d), lymph nodes or spleen. Such migration may facilitate the function of those cell types by increasing their transit to tissues where their effector functions, e.g., antigen presentation by dendritic cells, normally occur. The migration period is often relatively transient (e.g., observable over about 1-7 days) or occasionally longer (e.g., occurring for about 8-40 days), depending on the dosing regimen and other factors. This migration can be observed by standard methods, e.g., by cell staining, by PCR analyses or by determining the presence of a given cell type in circulation or determining a decrease in the number circulating cells. A decrease would generally reflect sequestration of an immune cell population(s) in a tissue(s) where the immune cell normally exercises its effector functions.","Thus, in some embodiments, the migration of one or more immune cell subsets such as CD11C cells from tissue such as skin or lung through the blood to immune tissue such as lymph nodes or GALT is seen as a transient increase in the level of circulating CD11C cells in response to exposure of the subject's tissues to a suitable amount of a formula 1 compound. Thus, the level of CD11C cells in the blood will generally detectably increase, e.g., a statistically significant increase, plateau and then decrease as migration of the cells to immune tissue subsides. In these embodiments, the proportion of the cells of the affected immune cell subset is typically relatively low in most physiological immune states, e.g., normal or abnormal immune conditions, compared to the total white blood cell population in circulation. In other embodiments, the migration of one or more immune cell subsets such as CD123 cells from the circulation to immune tissue such as lymph nodes or GALT results in a decrease. In these embodiments, the decrease in the numbers of circulating immune cells reflects the migration of the immune cells from the blood to immune tissue such as lymph nodes or GALT. Such a decrease may be transient and followed by recovery of the affect immune cell subset(s) over about 2 to 24 weeks. In conducting these embodiments, administration of the formula 1 compound to the subject is accomplished using the formulations or the methods as described herein.","Thus, an aspect of the invention is a method to enhance the migration of one or more immune cell types in a subject from one location (e.g., circulation or a non-lymphoid tissue such as the skin, liver or lung) to another (e.g., a lymphoid tissue such as a lymph node, spleen or a mucosal tissue such as GALT) by administration to a subject as described herein of an effective amount of a formula 1 compound essentially as described by any of the methods disclosed herein. A related aspect is the monitoring, e.g., by suitable blood counts or tissue biopsy, of the subject's response to determine the timing and extent of such immune cell migration.","Other CD molecules that are modulated by the presence of the formula 1 compounds in a subject include cytokine receptor molecules such as CD115, CDW116, CD117, CD118, CDW119, CD120a, CD120b, CD121a, CD121b, CD122, CD123, CD124, CD125 CD126, CDW127, CDW128 or CDW130. Often, the numbers of receptor molecules per cell will be modulated. For example, receptors for cytokines that mediate or facilitate Th1 immune responses or innate immune responses (e.g., one or more of IL-2, IL-12, \u03b3IFN and \u03b1-interferon) will typically increase in or on cells that mediate Th1 immune responses. Modulation of these molecules may be by direct interactions with a receptor(s) in the cell that expresses the cytokine receptor or indirectly by modulation of cytokine synthesis in the affected cells or in other cells, typically immune cells that may interact with the cells whose receptor synthesis is being modulated. Thus, autocrine or paracrine mechanisms may underlie some of the effects associated with administration of a formula 1 compound(s) such as altered cytokine profiles in immune cells or altered immune cell populations. Endocrine cytokine mechanisms may also contribute to desired immune responses.","Treatment of a subject with a formula 1 compound can result in a change of at least about 20-80% or about 25-50% above or below (e.g., at least 30% or at least 40% above or below) the control or basal level of some immune cell subsets. For example, increases of more than about 30% in the total numbers of activated CD8 T cells, e.g., CD8, CD69, CD25 T cells, CD8, CD69, CD25 T cells or CD8, CD69, CD25 T cells, usually occurs by 7 days after a single dose of a formula 1 compound to a subject. Such increases may be greater than 50%, 60% or 100% in the total numbers of activated CD8 T cells or subsets of activated CD8 T cells in individual subjects. Typically such increases are about in the total numbers of activated CD8 T cells or subsets of activated CD8 T cells averages about 30-40%, with individual subjects experiencing increases over 100% in the numbers of activated CD8 T cells per unit blood volume compared to the basal level.","Administration of the formula 1 compounds can affect other immune cell subsets. For example, the concentration of circulating CD4, CD69, CD25 (Th1 helper cells) and CD8, CD16, CD38 LAK cells or CD8, CD16, CD38 LAK cells typically increases during or after the course of dosing a subject with a formula 1 compound. Also, CD8, CD16, CD38 and CD8, CD16, CD38 (ADCC effector cells) and low side scatter Lin, DR, CD123 (dendritic precursors) or low side scatter Lin, DR, CD11c (dendritic cells or precursors) may show modest to significant increases.","In subjects that are immunosuppressed, e.g., from infection (e.g., viral (HIV, HCV), bacterial infection or parasite infection) or from chemotherapy (e.g., an antiviral therapy, a cancer chemotherapy or a radiation therapy), administration of the formula 1 compounds to the subject results in a favorable shift in the balance of Th1 or Th2 responses the subject can mount in the face of immunosuppression. When Th1 responses are suboptimal or insufficient, treatment with a formula 1 compound results in enhancement of Th1 responses or a reduction in Th2 responses. Conversely, when Th2 responses are suboptimal or insufficient, treatment with a formula 1 compound results in enhancement of Th2 responses or a reduction in Th1 responses. The formula 1 compounds can thus be used to shift the nature of a subject's immune response to result in a more balanced immune response from immunosuppression. Alternatively, the compounds can selectively suppress inappropriate or unwanted immune responses. Enhanced Th1 responses appears to be at least partly due to one or more of (i) a reduction in biological restraints, e.g., high levels of IL-4 or IL-10, on Th1 functions by preexisting primed Th1 effector cells, (ii) enhanced differentiation of Th0 cells to Th1 cells or enhanced responses mediated by Th1 cells, (iii) enhanced function of accessory cell function, e.g., antigen presentation by dendritic cells, dendritic precursor or progenitor cells or by macrophages or their precursors or progenitors, (iv) enhanced proliferation and differentiation of Th1 precursor or progenitor cells, (v) enhanced IL-12 expression in dendritic cells or their precursors, which results in enhanced differentiation of Th1 cells from Th0 precursors, (vi) enhanced expression or activity of factors associated with Th1 functions, e.g., IL-2, gamma interferon (\u03b3IFN or IFN\u03b3) or lymphotoxin.","An aspect of the invention methods is an alteration in the expression of IL-4 or IL-10 that occurs after administration of a formula 1 compound, e.g., BrEA, to a subject. A consistent observation is that extracellular IL-4 or IL-10 levels rapidly decrease to levels that are undetectable by ELISA. Intracellular IL-10 levels are reduced to levels that are near or below the limits of detection by flow cytometry. The administration of a formula 1 compound to a subject thus provides a means to inhibit either or both of these interleukins. Such inhibition may be associated with enhancement of Th1 immune responses relative to Th2 or Th0 responses, e.g., in subjects where Th1 responses are suppressed (e.g., from viral, bacterial or parasite infection (HIV, HCV, etc) or chemotherapy) or are otherwise suboptimal. In many subjects, levels of either IL-4 or IL-10, usually IL-10, before dosing with a formula 1 compound is low or undetectable. In these subjects, dosing with the formula 1 compound results in a rapid drop in the interleukin that is detectable, usually IL-4.","Clinical conditions are described in more detail below where the formula 1 compounds are useful for treating, preventing, slowing the progression of, or ameliorating one or more symptoms associated with the described conditions. In any these conditions, any formula 1 compound disclosed herein can be used according to one or more of the dosing methods that are disclosed herein. For these conditions, dosages for the formula 1 compounds, formulations and routes of administration are as described herein. Additional information regarding these and other clinical conditions or symptoms that can be treated, prevented or ameliorated with the formula 1 compounds are found at e.g., 17edition, M. H. Beers and R. Berkow editors, 1999, Merck Research Laboratories, Whitehouse Station, N.J., ISBN 0911910-10-7, or in other references cited herein.","Responses to treatment of a subject having a condition disclosed herein with a formula 1 compound is optionally monitored by observing changes in one or more immune or other appropriate clinical parameters, e.g., as described herein or in D. S. Jacobs et al., editors, 4edition, pages 11-686, Lexi-Comp Inc., Hudson, Ohio, ISBN 0-916589-36-6, or in any of the references cited herein, or by monitoring the progression or severity of the underlying condition according to known methods, e.g., J. B. Peter, editor, 5Edition, pages 1-309, 1998, Specialty Laboratories, Santa Monica, Calif., ISBN 1-889342-13-0.","Infection treatments. In some embodiments, the formula 1 compound(s) is administered to a subject who has a pathogen infection, such as a viral, bacterial, fungal, yeast, intracellular parasite or extracellular parasite infection. The formula 1 compounds can be considered for use in a broad scope of infections (see, e.g., J. B. Peter, editor, 5edition, Specialty Laboratories, Santa Monica, Calif. 90404, 1998, pages 1-271), since the compounds generally enhance Th1 immune responses and\/or reduce Th2 immune responses and\/or reduce inflammation or its symptoms. Difficulty in treating many infections, e.g., progressive toxoplasmic encephalitis, malaria, tuberculosis, leishmaniasis and schistosomiasis, often appear to be associated with one or more of an unwanted Th2 immune responses, a suboptimal Th1 response or the development of resistance of the infectious agent to antimicrobial agents. For example, in disseminated or diffuse tuberculosis, a reduced Th2 response would be desirable to allow a patient to slow progression of the disease or to clear infected cells more efficiently. In treating chloroquine resistant or sensitive malaria, the formula 1 compounds have essentially the same activity.","Exemplary viral infections that the formula 1 compounds can be used to treat, prevent or ameliorate include infections by one or more DNA or RNA viruses such as a genogroup, Glade, isolate, strain or so forth of influenza viruses (e.g., influenza A, influenza B), respiratory syncytial viruses, Rotaviruses, Hantaviruses, animal or human Papillomaviruses (e.g., HPV-16, HPV-18), Poxviruses, Poliovirus, rabies viruses, human and animal Retroviruses (e.g., HIV-1, HIV-2, LAV, human T-cell leukemia virus I (\u201cHTLV I\u201d), HTLV II, HTLV III, SIV, SHIV, FIV, FeLV), Togaviruses and Flaviviruses (e.g., West Nile Virus, Yellow Fever Virus, Dengue viruses), Herpesviruses (e.g., CMV, EBV, Varicella Zoster Virus, Herpes simplex virus 1 (\u201cHSV-1\u201d), Herpes simplex virus 2 (\u201cHSV-2\u201d), human Herpesvirus 6 (\u201cHHV-6\u201d), human Herpesvirus 8 (\u201cHHV-8\u201d)), measles viruses, mumps viruses, rubella virus, Hepadnaviruses or hepatitis viruses, Adenoviruses, Retroviruses, Togaviruses, Alphaviruses, Arboviruses, Flaviviruses, Rhinoviruses and\/or Pestiviruses.

The formulation is delivered intravenously in a single daily dose or two subdoses per day. The patients are dosed with 1 to 10 mg\/kg\/day for 4 to 10 days, followed by no dosing for 5 to 30 days, followed by dosing again with the cyclodextrin formulation for 4 to 10 days. The dosing regimen is repeated one, two or more times. Clinical markers for HCV infection are followed during treatment, e.g., viral nucleic acid in the blood or plasma, liver enzyme levels in the blood or plasma (e.g., AST\/SGOT, ALT\/SGPT, alkaline phosphatase). For these patients, an anti-HCV treatment(s), e.g., \u03b3IFN, \u03b1IFN and\/or ribavirin, is optionally started or continued according to the recommendations of the patient's doctor and with the patient's informed approval.

For example, in subjects who have a viral or parasite infection and are in the course of administration of a formula 1 compound, other treatments can also be administered to the subject, e.g., nucleoside analogs for viral infections or chloroquine for malaria. Subjects suffering from another condition such as an inflammation condition, an autoimmune condition or a cancer are optionally treated using one or more additional treatments. Such additional treatments will typically include standard therapies for the subject's pathological condition(s), but they can also include experimental or other treatments. For example, one can coadminister vitamins (multivitamins, individual vitamins), antioxidants or other agents (vitamin E, allopurinol, folinic acid), nutritional supplements (liquid protein or carbohydrate preparations) or other therapies as the patient's medical condition warrants or as the patient's doctor recommends.

For example, treatment of subjects who are immune suppressed, e.g., from a retrovirus infection, cancer chemotherapy or other cause, generally show improvement of one or more associated symptoms, such as weight loss, fever, anemia, pain, fatigue or reduced infection symptoms that are associated with a secondary infection(s), e.g., HSV-1, HSV-2, papilloma, human cytomegalovirus (\u201cCMV\u201d), (e.g., ) or () infections.","In some embodiments, the formula 1 compound(s) is administered as a nonaqueous liquid formulation as described herein or the formula 1 compound(s) is administered according to any of the intermittent dosing protocols described herein using a solid or liquid formulation(s). In the case of a subject who has a retroviral infection, e.g., a human with an HIV infection, with symptoms that include one or more of, a relatively low CD4 count (e.g., about 10-200, or about 20-100 or about 20-50), one or more additional pathogen infections (HSV-1, HSV-2, HHV-6, HHV-8, CMV, HCV, a HPV, or infection) and one or more of anemia, fatigue, Kaposi's sarcoma, fever or involuntary weight loss (at least about 5% of body weight), administration of about 0.1 to about 10 mg\/kg\/day (usually about 0.4 to about 5 mg\/kg\/day) of a formula 1 compound(s) to the subject typically results in noticeable improvement of one or more of the symptoms within about 1-4 weeks. In other embodiments, the formula 1 compound(s) is administered to a subject who has a condition that appears to be associated with a viral infection, e.g., pneumonia or retinitis associated with CMV, nasopharyngeal carcinoma or oral hairy leukoplakia associated with Epstein-Barr virus, progressive pancephalitis or diabetes associated with Rubella virus or aplastic crisis in hemolytic anemia associated with Parvovirus 19.","One or more intermittent dosing protocols disclosed herein or one or more of the liquid non-aqueous formulations described herein can be applied by routine experimentation to any of the uses or applications described herein. For a formula 1 compound(s) that is a new compound per se, the compound(s) can be administered to a subject according to an invention intermittent dosing protocol(s) or by other protocols, e.g., continuous daily dosing of a single dose or two or more subdoses per day. In addition any of the formula 1 compounds, e.g., one or more formula 1 compounds that are new per se, can be present in any solid or liquid formulation described herein. These formulations and dosing protocols can be applied by routine methods to any of the uses or applications described herein.","Antibodies, vaccines and vaccine adjuvants. The formula 1 compounds disclosed herein may also be used as vaccine adjuvants with immunogens or components of immunogenic compositions to prepare antibodies capable of binding specifically to the formula 1 compounds, their metabolic products which retain immunologically recognized epitopes (sites of antibody binding) or prepare antibodies that bind to antigens that can be used for vaccination against, e.g., infectious agents or malignant cells. The immunogenic compositions therefore are useful as intermediates in the preparation of antibodies that bind to formula 1 compounds for use, e.g., in diagnostic, quality control, or the like, methods or in assays for the compounds or their novel metabolic products. In addition, the compounds are useful for raising antibodies against otherwise non-immunogenic polypeptides, in that the compounds may serve as haptenic sites stimulating an immune response against the polypeptide.","The hydrolysis products or metabolites of formula 1 compounds include products of the hydrolysis of the protected acidic, basic or other reactive groups that variable groups, e.g., R-R, optionally comprise. In some embodiments, acidic or basic amides comprising immunogenic polypeptides such as albumin (e.g., human or mammalian), keyhole limpet hemocyamin and any other peptide described herein are used as immunogens. The metabolites of formula 1 compounds may retain a substantial degree of immunological cross reactivity with the unmetabolized parent compounds. Thus, in some embodiments, the antibodies will be capable of binding to the metabolites of the parent formula 1 compound without binding to the parent compound itself. In other embodiments, the antibodies, will be capable of binding to the parent compounds only, while in other cases the antibodies will be capable of binding to either of these. Some of the antibodies will not substantially cross-react with naturally occurring materials or epitopes that are present in the subject. Substantial cross-reactivity is reactivity under specific assay conditions for specific analytes sufficient to interfere with the assay results.","The immunogens of this invention may comprise a formula 1 compound that has 1 or more epitopes in association with another immunogenic substance. Within the context of the invention such association means covalent bonding to form an immunogenic conjugate (when applicable) or a mixture of non-covalently bonded materials, or a combination of the above. Immunogenic substances include adjuvants such as Freund's adjuvant, immunogenic proteins such as viral, bacterial, yeast, plant and animal polypeptides, including keyhole limpet hemocyanin, serum albumin, bovine thyroglobulin or soybean trypsin inhibitor, and immunogenic polysaccharides. Typically, the formula 1 compound having one, two or more epitopes is covalently conjugated to an immunogenic polypeptide or polysaccharide by the use of a polyfunctional (ordinarily bifunctional) cross-linking agent. Methods for the manufacture of immunogens that comprise one or more haptens are conventional per se. Any suitable known method for conjugating haptens to immunogenic polypeptides or the like are used here, taking into account the functional groups on the precursors or hydrolytic products which are available for cross-linking and the likelihood of producing antibodies specific to the epitope in question as opposed to the immunogenic substance.","Typically a polypeptide, polysaccharide or other suitable immunogenic moiety is conjugated to a site on a formula 1 compound in a location that is distant from the epitope on the formula 1 compound to be recognized.","The conjugates are prepared in conventional fashion. For example, the cross-linking agents N-hydroxysuccinimide, succinic anhydride or Calkyl-N\u2550C\u2550N\u2014Calkyl are useful in preparing the conjugates. The conjugates comprise a formula 1 compound that is attached by a bond or a linking group of 1-100, typically, 1-25, more typically about 1-10 carbon atoms to the immunogenic substance. The conjugates are separated from starting materials and by-products using chromatography or the like, and then are optionally sterile filtered, or otherwise sterilized, or are optionally vialed for storage. Synthetic methods to prepare hapten-carrier immunogens have been described, see e.g., G. T. Hermanson, Academic Press, 1996, pages 419-493.","The formula 1 compounds are cross-linked for example through any one or more of the following groups: a hydroxyl group, a thiol group, a carboxyl group, a carbon atom, or an amine group. Included within such compounds are amides of polypeptides where the polypeptide serves as an above-described protecting group.","Animals or mammals are typically immunized once, twice or more times against the immunogenic conjugates that comprise a formula 1 compound or their derivatives and polyclonal antisera or monoclonal antibodies prepared in conventional fashion. In some embodiments, about 0.0001 mg\/kg to about 1 mg\/kg, e.g., about 0.001 or about 0.01 or about 0.1 mg\/kg, of immunogenic conjugate or derivative is used on one, two, three or more occasions to immunize the subject as described herein. The immunogenic conjugates are administered, orally, topically or parenterally as described herein, e.g., by i.m. or s.c. injection. Methods to prepare antibodies, including methods to obtain antibodies that bind to steroids have been described, see, e.g., R. O, Neri et al., 74:593-598 1964, M. Ferin et al., 85:1070-1078 1969, J. Vaitukaitis et al., 33:988-991 1971 and M. Ferin et al., 94:765-775 1974. Such methods can be used essentially as described to prepare antibodies or monoclonal antibodies that bind to a formula 1 compound. Invention embodiments include serum or other preparations that comprise any polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies that bind to a formula 1 compound(s), methods to make them and compounds or compositions that are used in conducting these methods.","In other embodiments the formula 1 compounds are used as adjuvants to enhance a subject's immune response to antigens such as proteins, peptides, polysaccharides, glycoproteins or killed or attenuated viruses or cell preparations. In these methods, an effective amount of the formula 1 compound is administered at about the same time that the antigen is delivered to the subject, e.g., within about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 days of when the antigen is administered to the subject. In some embodiments, the formula 1 compound is administered 1, 2, 3, 4 or more times (usually once or twice per day) at 1, 2, 3 or 4 days before or after the antigen is administered to the subject. In other embodiments, the formula 1 compound is administered on the same day that the antigen is administered to the subject, e.g., within about 1-4 hours. Such immunization methods may be repeated once, twice or more as needed. The formula 1 compound can be administered to the subject using any of the formulations or delivery methods described herein or in the references cited herein. Subjects suitable for these vaccinations include young and elderly mammals, including humans, e.g., humans about 3-36 months of age or older and humans about 60, 65, 70, 75 years of age or older. The amount of antigen used can be about 0.01 \u03bcg\/kg to about 20 mg\/kg, typically about 1-100 \u03bcg\/kg. Dosages of the formula 1 compound used in these vaccinations is essentially as described herein, e.g., about 10 mg to about 1000 mg of a formula 1 compound is used per day on days when it is administered as part of the vaccination method.","Related embodiments include compositions or formulations that comprise a formula 1 compound, an antigen(s) or antigen(s) preparation and optionally one or more excipients. The antigen is essentially as disclosed herein or in a cited reference. Antigen preparations may comprise one or more of (1) lethally or sublethally radiated cells or pathogens, (2) disrupted cells or viruses or such as attenuated viruses, (3) a nucleic acid or DNA vaccine, (4) an antigenic protein, glycoprotein, polysaccharide or a fragment or derivative of any of these molecules and (5) chemically treated cells or pathogens, e.g., formalin or detergent treated cells, viruses or cell or virus extracts. Where cells or disrupted are present in an antigen preparation, they may by genetically modified, e.g., to express one or more antigens or epitopes against which an immune response is desired. Such cells may also be genetically modified to optionally express one or more factors, e.g., an interleukin or a cytokine, such as one described herein, to enhance the desired immune response. As used here, an antigen means a moiety that can be used to elicit an immune response when it is administered to a subject. In some embodiments, the antigen is foreign to the subject. For foreign antigens, the subject to be vaccinated may not encode or express the antigen, while the antigen is usually part of or expressed by a pathogen or by a subject or mammal of a different species. In other embodiments, antigens are endogenous or non-foreign to the subject, e.g., they are usually encoded or expressed by the subject or another subject of the same species. Endogenous antigens are suitable for use in, e.g., tumor vaccination methods. Exemplary tumors from which a suitable antigen(s) may be obtained are as described herein or in the cited references. A DNA vaccine as used here typically comprises a nucleic acid, usually DNA, that encodes one or more antigens or epitopes that a pathogen, e.g., a parasite, fungus, virus or bacterium, or a tumor encodes or can express.","Tumor antigens that are suitable for use in vaccination methods that employ a formula 1 compound include tumor-associated antigens and tumor-specific antigens. These molecules typically comprise one or more protein, glycoprotein, carbohydrate or glycolipid. Vaccinations that employ a tumor antigen(s) may comprise autologous tumor cells or allogenic tumor cells, which are optionally disrupted and optionally used with a non-formula 1 adjuvant, such as Calmette-Guerin (BCG), purified protein derivative, Freund's complete adjuvant, , oligonucleotides that consist of or comprise an unmethylated CpG dimer (e.g., 5\u2032 GACGTT, 5\u2032 GTCGTT) or an alum precipitate. In some embodiments, tumor cells treated with neuraminidase comprise all or part of the tumor antigen source. The non-formula 1 adjuvants are also optionally used in any of the vaccination methods disclosed herein. As used here, tumor associated antigens, e.g., the carcinoembryonic antigen, \u03b1-fetoprotein or the prostate specific antigen, are molecules that are often associated with or detectably expressed by premalignant or malignant cells or cell populations and also with some normal tissues during at least part of the subject's life cycle. Tumor-specific antigens, e.g., the R24C mutation of the cyclin dependent kinase-4 protein or certain sialylated glycoconjugates such as protein containing N-glycolyl neuraminic acid that is found in some human tumors (e.g., colon cancers, liver cancer, lymphoma), are molecules whose expression is restricted to pretumors or tumors and they are not expressed in normal adult or fetal tissue of a subject or a species to a significant extent. Vaccination with one or more tumor antigens and a formula 1 compound may be administered to a subject who has a cancer or a precancer, or to a subject who is considered potentially susceptible to developing such a condition. The tumor antigens are optionally combined with protein or other non-formula 1 adjuvants, e.g., keyhole-limpet hemocyanin or an immunoglobulin from a different species, which may be covalently bonded to the tumor antigen(s).","Suitable natural and synthetic nucleic acid sequences, cells, attenuated pathogens or infectious agents such as attenuated viruses, and protein, glycoprotein, polysaccharide, oligosaccharide or peptide antigens derived various infectious agents and tumors have been described, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,053,585, 4,081,334, 4,115,543, 4,503,036, 4,466,917, 4,508,708, 4,601,903, 4,632,830, 4,683,200, 4,727,136, 4,735,799, 4,784,850, 4,784,941, 4,803,164, 4,831,121, 4,831,126, 4,853,333, 4,863,200, 4,857,452, 4,916,055, 4,939,240, 4,960,716, 4,963,484, 5,013,661, 5,032,397, 5,075,218, 5,077,220, 5,093,118, 5,011,920, 5,110,588, 5,112,749, 5,126,264, 5,134,075, 5,162,226, 5,185,432, 5,198,535, 5,231,168, 5,225,193, 5,283,321, 5,302,386, 5,328,835, 5,378,814, 5,393,532, 5,395,614, 5,456,911, 5,474,900, 5,478,556, 5,348,887, 5,455,332, 5,489,525, 5,527,891, 5,541,292, 5,582,831, 5,591,596, 5,609,872, 5,614,194, 5,639,621, 5,639,863, 5,641,492, 5,643,567, 5,654,136, 5,679,342, 5,688,657, 5,688,658, 5,705,341, 5,712,118, 5,723,130, 5,747,028, 5,756,101, 5,780,591, 5,798,445, 5,814,617, 5,824,316, 5,824,777, 5,837,830, 5,843,451, 5,844,075, 5,849,306, 5,849,476, 5,858,685, 5,866,679, 5,871,936, 5,874,060, 5,895,285, 5,895,651, 5,916,571, 5,916,754, 5,916,879, 5,932,412, 5,935,818, 5,942,235, 5,948,410, 5,948,412, 5,961,985, 5,968,514, 5,985,571, 5,993,813, 5,993,828, 5,994,523, 6,013,765, 6,013,779, 6,017,527, 6,020,478, 6,024,961, 6,025,191, 6,025,474, 6,030,624, 6,030,797, 6,045,802, 6,056,963, 6,060,280, 6,083,703, 6,083,683, 6,087,441, 6,093,540, 6,096,320, 6,100,049, 6,100,088, 6,100,241, 6,100,444, 6,110,468, 6,110,724, 6,110,898, 6,120,770, 6,113,917, 6,120,770, 6,127,116, 6,127,333, 6,130,082, 6,207,170, PCT publication Nos.

Hamilton, Ontario. Antigens suitable for use with the formula 1 compounds include the molecules disclosed in any of these references or antigenic fragments thereof. Such antigenic fragments will typically retain at least about 20% of the antigenicity of the unmodified antigen. Thus, these fragments will retain at least about 20% of the native antigen's capacity to generate an antibody response or to generate a T cell response against the unmodified antigen or the like.","Other suitable antigens include STn, sialyl Tn-KLH, carbohydrate conjugates, carcinogenic embryonic antigen, MAGE-1, MUC-1, HER-2\/neu, prostate specific antigen, p53, T\/Tn, bacterial flagella antigens or capsular polysaccharide antigens (e.g., capsular polysaccharide antigens) and antigenic fragments or antigenic synthetic derivatives of any of these molecules. See, e.g., L. A. Holmberg et al., 2000 25:1233-1241, J. W. Hadden, 1999 21:79-101, G. Ragupathi et al., 1998 15:217-221, A. I. Fattom et al., 1998 66:4588-4592, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,770,208, 5,866,140 and 6,194,161 and citations elsewhere herein, including the preceding paragraph.","An antigenic protein, peptide or glycoprotein can be identified by standard methods, e.g., protein or nucleic acid sequencing, for any of the infectious agents or tumors that are described herein or in the cited references. Thus, in some embodiments, an effective amount of a formula 1 compound and an antigen are administered to a subject, or delivered to the subject's tissues, to stimulate an immune response against the antigen. The antigen may comprise one, two or more antigenic epitopes, which may come from one, two or more genes. In some embodiments, the subject is optionally monitored to follow or determine the immune, dendritic cell, B cell, T cell, antibody or cytokine response, such as one disclosed herein, e.g., modulation or increase in \u03b3IFN, IL-2 or IL-12 levels or measurement of the production of one or more immunoglobulin types or subtypes. The subject may also be monitored by in vitro cell assays, e.g., for activation of T cells or subsets of T cells or other relevant white blood cell types. Such assays include measuring T cell activation using chromium release assays, or mixed lymphocyte assays. The subject is optionally treated with one or more additional booster vaccinations, when this is called for under the circumstances.","Nucleic acid or DNA vaccines as used here will typically comprise a nucleic acid comprising an expressible region that encodes one, two or more suitable antigens or epitopes, e.g., all or an antigenic portion of a viral, bacterial, fungal or parasite protein or glycoprotein. The expressible region will usually comprise a transcription promoter and optionally other control sequences that are operatively linked to the antigen coding region where the promoter and control sequences are transcriptionally active in the intended subject or tissue. Suitable control sequences include enhancers, recognition sequences for transcription factors and termination sequences. Such expression vectors may optionally comprise one, two or more expressible genes or gene fragments, which may each comprise their attendant operatively linked expression sequences. Suitable methods and expression vectors to deliver nucleic acids for vaccine purposes have been described, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,223,263, 5,580,859, 5,703,055, 5,846,946 and 5,910,488.","Thus, in some embodiments, an effective amount of a formula 1 compound and an antigen are administered to a subject to stimulate an immune response against the antigen, wherein the antigen is encoded by a suitable expression construct. Exemplary antigens that are suitable in these methods are, e.g., essentially as described in any reference cited herein or as is apparent to the skilled artisan. In some embodiments, the antigen is encoded by a parasite such as a or a species such as one described herein. The formula 1 compound can be administered before, essentially simultaneously with or after administration of the antigen, as noted above. The dosages of the formula 1 compound are essentially as described for the other conditions described herein.","Vaccinations that utilize a formula 1 compound and an antigen(s) are generally suitable for eliciting or enhancing desired immune responses in conjunction with exposure of a subject to an antigen(s), compared to vaccination without the compound. Antigen specific humoral antibody responses or antigen specific T cell responses may be enhanced or elicited. Typically vaccination using a formula 1 compound and a suitable antigen is conducted to prevent a potential infection or to reduce the severity of a future infection. However, in some cases the vaccination is conducted in a subject that has an infection such as a chronic or a latent infection such as a parasite or a retrovirus or herpesvirus infection, which may be latent or in relapse. In other cases the subject may have a cancer or precancer. Thus, the subject may be exposed to, or contain, one or more of the antigens that are used in one of these vaccination procedures. Such vaccinations are included within the scope of the invention.","In related embodiments, the formula 1 compounds are useful to facilitate preparation of hybridoma clones that express monoclonal antibodies. In these methods, a suitable amount of a formula 1 compound, e.g., about 100 \u03bcg to about 2 mg for a small mammal, is administered to a subject, e.g., a mouse, to enhance the immune response to the desired antigen, which is also administered to the subject. After antigen challenge, suitable cells are recovered from the subject, e.g., anti-antigen immunoglobulin expressing HPRT spleen cells from a mouse. These cells are then fused with suitable immortal cells (e.g., mouse melanoma cells) using, e.g., PEG or Sendai virus, and selected in suitable selection growth medium, e.g., tissue culture medium that contains hypoxanthine, aminopterin and thymidine, to obtain a group or panel of hybridomas that express anti-antigen monoclonal antibodies. The hybridoma panel is used to generate individual clones, which are optionally screened to determine the antibody specificity and antigen binding properties. About one, 100, 1000, 10,000, 100,000 or more individual clones are screened by standard methods. The monoclonal antibodies may be from any suitable source, e.g., murine, human, human-murine hybrid or the like. Methods to obtain human, human-murine hybrid or related monoclonal antibodies have been described, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,562,903, 5,461,760, 5,705,154, 5,854,400, 5,858,728, 5,874,082, 5,874,540, 5,877,293, 5,882,644, 5,886,152, 5,889,157, 5,891,996, 5,916,771, 5,939,598, 5,985,615, 5,998,209, 6,013,256, 6,075,181, 6,901,001, 6,114,143, 6,114,598, 6,117,980. The formula 1 compounds can be used in any of the methods disclosed in these references to facilitate generation or recovery of hybridoma panels and clones that express monoclonal antibodies.","An aspect of these methods comprise a product, i.e., a hybridoma panel or a hybridoma clone, that is obtained by the process of contacting a subject (such as a mouse) with (1) a suitable amount of a formula 1 compound and (2) a suitable amount of an antigen, allowing sufficient time to generate an immune response in the subject against the antigen and then fusing suitable anti-antigen immunoglobulin producing cells from the subject, e.g., the subject's spleen cells, with a suitable immortal cell line (e.g., a HPRT mouse myeloma). The antigen or immunogen is as described above, e.g., a suitable protein, protein fragment or glycoprotein such as an interleukin, cytokine or antigen from an infectious agent. In these methods, a mouse is typically the subject, but other mammals, e.g., humans or other rodents, are also suitable according to known methods.","The amount of antigen for immunization used in preparing monoclonal antibodies in a small mammal will typically be about 1 \u03bcg to about 100 \u03bcg, e.g., about 2 \u03bcg, 5 \u03bcg, 10 \u03bcg or 50 \u03bcg of antigen. The antigens are essentially as described in the vaccination methods described above, e.g., disrupted cell, a protein or glycoprotein, which is optionally combined with a suitable amount of an adjuvant such as Freund's complete adjuvant, alum precipitate, a bacterial lipopolysaccharide or BCG. The formula 1 compound is typically parenterally administered, e.g., subcutaneous or intraperitoneal, within about 2-4 days (e.g., about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 days before or after antigen challenge) of the time that the subject is challenged with antigen. In some cases, the antigen and the formula 1 compound is administered at the same time or at about the same time, e.g., within about 5 minutes to about 1 hour. The formula 1 compound may be administered on one, two, three or more occasions in the process, e.g., a formula 1 compound is administered once per day on one or more of the four days before antigen challenge and then it is optionally administered again on the same day as antigen challenge and then optionally administered daily at one, two, three or more days after antigen challenge.","Related embodiments include a method comprising administering to a subject (e.g., a mammal such as a human or a primate), or delivering to the subject's tissues, an effective amount of a formula 1 compound and a specific antigen. Immune responses that are enhanced include a mucosal immune response to an antigen such as a protein, peptide, polysaccharide, microorganism, tumor cell extract or lethally radiated tumor or pathogen cells (e.g., antigens or cells from melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, breast cancer, prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia, virus or bacteria, or other tumor or pathogen as disclosed herein). Aspects of these embodiments include enhancement of the subject's immune response when an antigen or immunogen is administered intranasally or orally. In these aspects, the formula 1 compound is administered about simultaneously with the antigen or within about 3 hours to about 6 days of antigen administration. The use of immune modulating agents to enhance immune responses to a vaccine has been described, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,518,725.","Other uses for the formula 1 compound(s) include administering the compound(s) to a subject who suffers from a pathological condition(s). The treatment may treat or ameliorate the source of the condition(s) and\/or symptoms associated with the pathological condition(s) such as infection with a pathogen(s) (viruses, bacteria, fungi), a malignancy, unwanted immune response, i.e., an immune response that causes pathology and\/or symptoms, e.g., autoimmune conditions or allergy or conditions such as hypoproliferation conditions, e.g., normal or impaired tissue growth, or wound healing or burn healing, or in immunosuppression conditions, e.g., conditions characterized by an absence of a desired response and\/or an inadequate degree of a desired response.","As noted in the foregoing applications where a formula 1 compound and an antigen are administered to a subject to enhance the subject's immune response, the antigen may be obtained from any suitable source. The antigen will generally be capable of eliciting an immune response against the original pathogen or cell. Desirable immune responses obtained from vaccination of a subject with an antigen and a formula 1 compound include one or more of an enhanced antibody response, an enhanced antigen specific CD4 T cell response or an enhanced cytotoxic T cell response to pathogen infected cells, extracellular pathogen or to tumor cells.","Enhanced antibody responses include detectable enhancement of antibody titer or a shift in the antibody response from a Th2 biased response to an increased Th1 biased component of the response. In such antibody shifts, the Th1 and Th2 character of the response is determined by known methods. For example, a relatively low ratio of IgG1 (or the analogous antibody subclass in humans and other subjects) to IgG2a (or the analogous antibody subclass in humans and other subjects), e.g., about 6:1 to about 12:1, that is generated after exposure of a subject (a mouse for the IgG1 and IgG2a subclasses) to an antigen indicates a Th1 biased antibody response. Conversely a higher ratio, e.g., about 20:1 to about 30:1 indicates a Th1 biased antibody response. Generation of antigen-specific IgG1 generation involves T-helper type 2 (Th2) cells, and for IgG2a, T-helper type 1 (Th1) cells. The formula 1 compounds can detectably increase the Th1 character of an antibody response to an antigen or they can increase the magnitude of both the Th1 and Th2 response.","Exemplary antigen sources include pathogens, cells or their individual proteins, peptides, glycoproteins or polysaccharides or antigenic fragments of any of these molecules. The antigenic material is recovered from suitably treated pathogens or cells and administered to a subject, or it can be recovered using recombinant means to obtain a purified or partially purified antigen source.","Exemplary pathogens or cells that are suitable sources for antigens or a gene(s) that encode suitable antigens include influenza viruses (e.g., influenza A, influenza B), respiratory syncytial viruses, Rotaviruses, Hantaviruses, human Papilloma viruses (e.g., HPV-16, HPV-18), Poxviruses, Poliovirus, rabies viruses, Retroviruses (e.g., HIV-1, HIV-2), hepatitis viruses (e.g., human HAV, HBV or HCV), Togaviruses and Flaviviruses (e.g., West Nile Virus, Yellow Fever Virus, Dengue viruses), Herpesviruses (e.g., CMV, EBV, Varicella Zoster Virus, HSV-1, HSV-2, HHV-6, HHV-8), measles viruses, mumps viruses, rubella virus, pneumococci such as cells or capsule material, enteric bacterial cells (e.g., , or or species), gram positive bacterial pathogens (e.g., ), gram negative bacterial pathogens, diphtheria pathogens, or human or animal cells obtained from a melanoma or skin cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, liver cancer, bone cancer, nervous tissue cancer (e.g., neuroblastoma, glioma), lymphoma, leukemia cells, kidney or renal cell cancer, ovarian cancer or lung cancer (e.g., small cell carcinoma, non-small cell carcinoma). Exemplary parasites or antigen sources include and . The antigen(s) that is used may comprise a pathogen coat protein(s), pathogen cell wall or other structural proteins. Antigen(s) from tumor cells or parasites may comprise cell membrane associated structures or intracellular molecules that are characteristic of, or unique to, the tumor or parasite. Other suitable antigen or pathogen sources are as described herein or in the cited references.","Cancer and hyperproliferation conditions. Many cancers, precancers, malignancies or hyperproliferation conditions are associated with an unwanted Th2 immune response or a deficient Th1 response. An insufficient Th1 immune response may play a role in the capacity of malignant cells to escape immune surveillance. The formula 1 compounds, including those in the compound groups and embodiments disclosed herein, may thus be used to treat, prevent or slow the progression of one or more cancers, precancers or cell hyperproliferation conditions or they may be used to ameliorate one or more symptoms thereof. In these conditions, the formula 1 compounds are useful to enhance the subject's Th1 responses or to reestablish a more normal Th1-Th2 balance in the subject's immune responses.","These conditions include carcinomas, sarcomas, disseminated tumors and solid tumors such as prostate, lung, breast, ovary, skin, stomach, intestine, pancreas, larynx, esophagus, throat, testes, liver, parotid, biliary tract, colon, rectum, cervix, uterus, vagina, endometrium, kidney, bladder, central nervous system, muscle or thyroid cancers or precancers. The formula 1 compounds are thus useful to treat, prevent, slow the progression of, or ameliorate one or more symptoms of a precancer or hyperproliferation condition such as myelodysplastic syndrome, actinic keratoses or benign prostatic hyperplasia. The compounds can also be used to treat, prevent, slow the progression of, slow the replication or growth of, or to ameliorate one or more symptoms of a primary tumor, a metastasis, an advanced malignancy, or a blood born malignancy, a leukemia or a lymphoma. Such conditions include one or more of melanoma, glioblastoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, bronchogenic carcinoma, renal cell cancer or carcinoma, glioma, pancreatic or gastric adenocarcinoma, human pappilomavirus associated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, cervical carcinoma, hepatoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides, Sezary syndrome), colorectal cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, ALL or follicular lymphoma, multiple myeloma, carcinomas with p53 mutations, colon cancer, cardiac tumors, adrenal tumors, pancreatic cancer, retinoblastoma, lung cancer, intestinal cancer, testicular cancer, stomach cancer, neuroblastoma, myxoma, myoma, endothelioma, osteoblastoma, osteoclastoma, osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, adenoma, breast cancer, prostate cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma and ovarian cancer. Treating a subject with a formula 1 compound can ameliorate one or more side effects of chemotherapy or cancer symptoms such as alopecia, pain, fever, malaise, chronic fatigue and cachexia or weight loss. Other cancers, precancers or their symptoms that can be treated, prevented or ameliorated are described in, e.g., 5, 5edition, R. C. Bast et al., editors, 2000, ISBN 1-55009-113-1, pages 168-2453, B. C. Becker Inc. Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.","In some of these embodiments, the formula 1 compounds may be used to treat, prevent or slow the progression of or ameliorate one or more conditions in a subject having or subject to developing a hyperproliferation condition where angiogenesis contributes to the pathology. Abnormal or unwanted angiogenesis or neovascularization contributes to the development or progression of solid tumor growth and metastases, as well as to arthritis, some types of eye diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, macular degeneration, corneal graft rejection, neovascular glaucoma, rubeosis, retinoblastoma, uvietis and pterygia or abnormal blood vessel growth of the eye, and psoriasis. See, e.g., Moses et al., 9:630-634 1991, Folkman et al., 333:1757-1763 1995, and Auerbach et al., 29:401-411 1985.","Dosages of the formula 1 compound, routes of administration and the use of combination therapies with other standard therapeutic agents or treatments could be applied essentially as described above for cancer or hyperproliferation conditions or other conditions as disclosed herein. This, in some embodiments, the use of the formula 1 compound is optionally combined with one or more additional therapies for a cancer or precancer(s), e.g., one or more of surgery and treatment with an antiandrogen or an antiestrogen as described herein or in the cited references, an antineoplastic agent such as an alkylating agent, a nitrogen mustard, a nitrosourea, an antimetabolite or cytotoxic agent, or an analgesic such as propoxyphene napsylate, acetaminophen or codeine. Exemplary anticancer and adjunct agents include methotrexate, thioguanine, mercaptopurine, adriamycin, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, procarbazine, hydroxyurea, allopurinol, erythropoietin, G-CSF, bicalutamide, anastrozole, fludarabine phosphate and doxorubicin. Such therapies would be used essentially according to standard protocols and such they would precede, be concurrent with or follow treatment with a formula 1 compound. In some embodiments, such additional therapies will be administered at the same time that a formula 1 compound is being used or within about 1 day to about 16 weeks before or after at least one round of treatment with the formula 1 compound is completed. Other exemplary therapeutic agents and their use have been described in detail, see, e.g., 54edition, 2000, pages 303-3250, ISBN 1-56363-330-2, Medical Economics Co., Inc., Montvale, N.J. One or more of these exemplary agents can be used in combination with a formula 1 compound to ameliorate, prevent or treat any of the appropriate cancers, precancers or related conditions described herein, or any of their symptoms.","In some of these conditions, the subject's hyperproliferation or malignant condition may be associated with or caused by one or more pathogens. Such conditions include hepatocellular carcinoma associated with HCV or HBV, Kaposi's sarcoma associated with HIV-1 or HIV-2, T cell leukemia associated with HTLV I, Burkitt's lymphoma associated with Epstein-Barr virus or papillomas or carcinoma associated with papilloma viruses (HPV 6, HPV 11, HPV 16, HPV 18, HPV 31, HPV 45) or gastric adenocarcinoma or gastric MALT lymphoma associated with infection.","In some cancers or precancers such as breast cancer, the formula 1 compounds can modulate the synthesis or a biological activity of one or more gene products such as transcription factors or steroid receptors. The compounds can inhibit AIB-1 coactivator or HER2\/neu synthesis or activity in breast cancer cells or conditions. They can enhance the synthesis or an activity of an estrogen receptor such as ER\u03b1, ER\u03b21 or ER\u03b22 or progesterone receptor in breast cancer or colon cancer cells or conditions. These effects can include modulation of the expression or one or more biological activities of proteins or enzymes that contribute to disease establishment or progression. Thus, the compounds can decrease IL-4, IL-6 or IL-13 expression by stromal cells or immune cells that are in proximity to or adjacent to solid or diffuse tumor cells in a subject such as a human or another mammal. The compounds can thus directly or indirectly modulate (e.g., decrease) the activity or expression of enzymes such as STAT-6, neutral nedopeptidase, 17\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase or 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in cancers or precancers such as cervical cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer or benign prostatic hyperplasia.","In an exemplary embodiment, human patients suffering from melanoma or melanoma precursor lesions are treated with a topical cream formulation containing 2-20% BrEA (w\/w). The cream is applied to primary nevi (dysplastic nevi or common acquired nevi), primary cutaneous melanomas, secondary cutaneous melanomas and the skin surrounding the nevi or melanomas. The areas to be treated are washed with soap or swabbed with an alcohol (e.g., ethanol or isopropanol) prior to administering the cream, when this is practical. About 0.1-0.4 g of cream, depending on the size of the treated area, is applied once or twice per day per treated region or lesion for about 10-20 days. The cream is left undisturbed at the administration site for about 15-30 minutes before the patient resumes normal activity. Progression of the nevi and melanomas is retarded in the majority of patients and significant regression is observed for some lesions. Following initial treatment, the formulation is administered every other day for at least 1 to 4 months using the same dosing described for the initial round of treatment. For these patients, standard therapy to treat precursor lesion or melanoma, e.g., dimethyl triazeno imidazole carboxamide or nitrosoureas (e.g., BCNU, CCNU), is optionally started or continued according to the recommendations of the patient's doctor and with the patient's informed approval. In cases where a tumor or precursor lesion is surgically removed and the site has sufficiently healed, the patient optionally continues using the topical formulation at the site and the adjacent surrounding area every other day for at least 1 to 4 months. In some of these embodiments, a formula 1 compound(s) is administered daily continuously as an oral composition or formulation, e.g., for a formula 1 compound(s) that is a new compound per se. BrEA is optionally also administered systemically using, e.g., a formulation described in the examples below to deliver 1-5 mg\/kg\/day every other day for about 1 week to about to 4 months, e.g., in the case of malignant melanoma.","Cardiovascular applications. The formula 1 compounds, including those in the compound groups and embodiments disclosed herein, may be used to treat, prevent or slow the progression of one or more of congenital heart defects, cardiovascular diseases, disorders, abnormalities and\/or conditions, or to ameliorate one or more symptoms thereof in a subject.

veno-occlusive disease, hypertension, hypotension, peripheral vascular diseases, phlebitis, pulmonary veno-occlusive disease, Raynaud's disease, CREST syndrome, retinal vein occlusion, Scimitar syndrome, superior vena cava syndrome, telangiectasia, atacia telangiectasia, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, varicocele, varicose veins, varicose ulcer, vasculitis, venous insufficiency and arterial occlusive diseases such as arteriosclerosis, intermittent claudication, carotid stenosis, fibromuscular dysplasias, mesenteric vascular occlusion, Moyamoya disease, renal artery obstruction, retinal artery occlusion, and thromboangiitis obliterans.","The formula 1 compounds can also be used to treat, prevent or ameliorate one or more symptoms of cerebrovascular diseases, thrombosis, and\/or conditions such as carotid artery diseases, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, cerebral aneurysm, cerebral anoxia, cerebral arteriosclerosis, cerebral arteriovenous malformation, cerebral artery diseases, cerebral embolism and thrombosis, carotid artery thrombosis, sinus thrombosis, Wallenberg's syndrome, cerebral hemorrhage, epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage,

occlusion, carotid artery thrombosis, sinus thrombosis, Wallenberg's syndrome, and thrombophlebitis.","The formula 1 compounds can also be used to treat, prevent or ameliorate one or more symptoms of vascular ischemia or myocardial ischemias, vasculitis and coronary diseases, including angina pectoris, coronary aneurysm, coronary arteriosclerosis, coronary thrombosis, coronary vasospasm, myocardial infarction and myocardial stunning, cerebral ischemia, ischemic colitis, compartment syndromes, anterior compartment syndrome, myocardial ischemia, reperfusion injuries, peripheral limb ischemia, aortitis, arteritis, Behcet's Syndrome, mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome, thromboangiitis obliterans, hypersensitivity vasculitis, Schoenlein-Henoch purpura, allergic cutaneous vasculitis, and Wegener's granulomatosis.","Exemplary symptoms that the use of the formula 1 compounds can ameliorate include one or more of pain such as arm, jaw or chest pain, edema or swelling, high blood pressure, shortness of breath or dyspnea, e.g., on exertion or while prone, fatigue or malaise and low cardiac injection fraction. In treating a cardiovascular condition in a subject or in improving one or more symptoms thereof, the formula 1 compounds may accomplish one or more of increasing cardiac injection volume, decreasing levels of IL-6, decreasing levels of C reactive protein, fibrinogen, cardiac creatinine kinase, carnityl palmitoyl fatty acid transferase or other cardiac enzymes, activating potassium dependent calcium channels, vasodilating or enhancing oxygen delivery to ischemic tissues or decreasing levels of scarring or plaque formation that occurs, e.g., after vascular damage. Symptoms associated with a cardiovascular condition such as ischemia that can be ameliorated also include acidosis, expression of one or more immediate early genes in, e.g., glial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells or endothelial cells, neuronal membrane depolarization and increased neuronal extracellular calcium and glutamate concentration. Other biological effects associated with treatment using a formula 1 compound may also be monitored, e.g., and increase or decrease of a cell surface antigen, a cytokine or an interleukin as disclosed herein.","Useful biological effects of the formula 1 compounds in cardiovascular indications such as myocardial ischemias also include preventing or reducing heart or vascular cell death and subsequent fibrosis. These effects are associated with a decreased oxidative capacity of heart cells or myocytes, which is associated with a decreased capacity of the cells to metabolize fatty acids efficiently. The compounds enhance fatty acid metabolism and ameliorate the deleterious effects of a limited oxidative capacity.","The formula 1 compounds also can limit inflammation or cell injury that is associated with ischemia or oxygen reperfusion after ischemia. Ischemia, which is a detrimental decrease in oxygenated blood delivery to affected cells or tissues, may arise from a cardiovascular condition or event such as an infarction, or from thermal injury or burns. Ischemia may also arise from accidental or surgical trauma. Reperfusion after cells have become hypoxic for a sufficient period of time can lead to tissue or cell injury that varies from slight to lethal. The compounds can reduce cell or tissue injury or death associated with ischemia and reperfusion, by, e.g., reducing inflammation or the level of a molecule associated with inflammation. Thus, levels of a proinflammatory cytokine or molecule such as leukotriene B4, platelet activating factor or levels of extracellular P-selectin may result from administration of a formula 1 compound to a subject who may experience reperfusion injury. Thus, the compounds can reduce injury or death of, e.g., neuron, cardiac, vascular endothelium, myocardial, pulmonary, hepatic or renal cells or tissues. The compounds act in part by reducing one or more of neutrophil activation, endothelial cell activation and neutrophil adherence or adhesion to endothelial cells.","The use of any formula 1 compound or species in any genus of formula 1 compounds disclosed herein to treat, prevent or ameliorate any of these cardiovascular conditions or symptoms will generally use one or more of the routes of administration, dosages and dosing protocols as disclosed herein. Thus, in exemplary embodiments, about 0.5 to about 100 mg\/kg or about 1 to about 25 mg\/kg, of the formula 1 compound will be administered per day by an oral, buccal, sublingual or parenteral route. Such administration can be, e.g., daily for about 5 to about 60 days in acute conditions or it can be intermittent for about 3 months to about 2 years or more for chronic conditions. Alternatively, intermittent dosing can be used essentially as described herein for acute cardiovascular conditions. In conditions such as ischemia, administration of the formula 1 compound should generally occur before or as soon after the ischemic event as possible, e.g., within about 6 hours of an ischemic event or about 12-24 hours before an anticipated ischemic event.","In related embodiments, the use of the formula 1 compound is optionally combined with one or more additional therapies for cardiovascular disorders, e.g., vascular surgery, cardiac surgery, angioplasty, or treatment with andrenergic blockers, coronary vasodilators, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, anti-hypertensives, anti-inflammatory agents, diuretics, anti-arrhythmia agents, thrombolytic agents or xanthine oxidase inhibitors. These other therapies include treatment with one or more of digoxin, nitroglycerin, doxazosin mesylate, nifedipine, enalapril maleate, indomethicin, tissue plasminogin activator, urokinase, acetylsalicylic acid, allopurinol or the like. Such therapies would be used essentially according to standard protocols and such therapies would precede, be concurrent with or follow treatment with a formula 1 compound. In some embodiments, such additional therapies will be administered at the same time that a formula 1 compound is being used or within about 1 day to about 16 weeks before or after at least one round of treatment with the formula 1 compound is completed. Other exemplary therapeutic agents and their use have been described in detail, see, e.g., 54edition, 2000, pages 303-3251, ISBN 1-56363-330-2, Medical Economics Co., Inc., Montvale, N.J.

Administration may be daily for about 1 to about 28 days, or it may be intermittent and used as needed. The amount of a topical formulation that can be administered may be higher, e.g., about 15 g or about 20 g, if the size of the area to be treated is relatively large, e.g., at least about 30 cmto about 100 cmor more. Alternatively, systemic administration of the formula 1 compound such as oral, parenteral, sublingual or buccal delivery may be used, particularly when the area of the skin to be treated is relatively large. In some cases, both topical and systemic administration of a formula 1 compound can be used.","Enhancement of hemopoiesis. The invention includes methods to treat or prevent various blood cell deficiencies such as TP or NP. Without being bound to any theory, the treatment methods may result in enhanced hemopoiesis or the treatment methods may reduce the loss of cells such as platelets or neutrophils. Increased platelet or neutrophil production or reduced loss is typically observed as increased circulating blood cell counts. Thus, invention aspects comprise methods to treat or prevent neutropenia in a subject in need thereof, comprising administering to a subject in need, or delivering to the subject's tissues, an effective amount of a formula 1 compound.","Normal ranges of various white blood cells or blood components in adult (about 18-49 years of age) human blood are as follows. Total adult white blood cell counts average about 7500\/mm, with an approximate normal range of about 4.5-11.0\u00d710\/mm. The normal basophil level is about 35 mm, with a normal range of about 10-100\/mm. The normal adult neutrophil level is about 4400\/mm, with a normal range of about 2000-7700\/mm. The normal eosinophil level is about 275 mm, with a normal range of about 150-300\/mm. The normal monocyte level is about 540 mm, with a normal range of about 300-600\/mm. The normal adult platelet level is about 2.5\u00d710\/mm, with a normal range of about 2.1\u00d710-2.9\u00d710\/mm. The normal adult red cell mass corresponds to about 4.6\u00d710red cells\/L in females and about 5.2\u00d710red cells\/L in males.","Thus, a human patient in need of treatment will typically have, or be subject to, a cell count below these values. As used herein, neutropenia means generally a circulating neutrophil count of less than about 1800\/mm, generally a count of about 1500\/mmor less. Thrmobocytopenia generally means a circulating platelet count of less than about 1.9\u00d710\/mm, generally a count of less than about 1.2\u00d710\/mm. Anemia generally means a red cell mass corresponding to less than about 4.0\u00d710red cells\/L in adult females and less than about 4.5\u00d710red cells\/L in adult males (a hemoglobin level of less than about 12.0 g\/dL in adult females and less than about 13.5 g\/dL in adult males).","In some cases, the diagnosis of a deficiency may cover a cell count that falls outside these ranges, due, e.g., to individual variations in a subject's age, sex, race, animal strain or normal blood cell status for the individual. Such variations are identified by known means such as by identification of a change from the subject's normal status or by multiple cell measurements over time that reveal a deficiency. See, e.g., 2edition, R. Hoffman, E. J. Benz Jr. et al., editors, Churchill Livingstone, N.Y., 1995. Subjects with an identified or identifiable deficiency outside these standard ranges are included in the definition of a blood cell deficiency or a subject in need of treatment, as used herein.","Specific conditions that are amenable to prophylaxis or treatment by the invention methods include the acquired blood cell deficiencies. Exemplary deficiencies or groups of deficiencies are neonatal alloimmune TP, immune TP, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, post-transfusion purpura, radiation associated TP, chemotherapy associated TP (e.g., NSAID treatments such as with indomethicin, ibuprofen, naproxen, phenylbutazone, piroxicam or zompirac, or \u03b2-lactam antibiotic treatments such as with ampicillin, carbenicillin, penicillin G, ticarcillin, or cephalosporin treatments such as with cefazolin, cefoxitin or cephalothin, anticoagulant treatments such as heparin, hirudin, lepirudin or aspirin, treatment with plasma expanders or psychotropic drugs), amegakaryocitic TP, chemotherapy associated TP, radiation associated TP, TP associated with solid organ allograft or xenograft rejection or immune suppression therapy in solid organ or other tissue transplants (e.g., liver, lung, kidney, heart, bone marrow, hematopoietic stem cell or endothelial cell transplant, implant or transfusion), cardiopulmonary bypass surgery or chemotherapy associated TP (e.g., an anticancer, antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal or antiparasite therapy), cardiovascular disease or therapy associated TP (e.g., congenital cyanotic heart disease, valvular heart disease, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary hypertension disorders or diltiazem, nifedipine, nitroglycerin or nitroprusside therapy), TP associated with chronic or acute renal failure or treatment for these conditions (e.g., dialysis), TP associated with infection such as a virus or bacterial infection, postinfectious NP, drug-induced NP, autoimmune NP, chronic idiopathic NP, basophilic leukopenia, eosinophilic leukopenia, monocytic leukopenia, neutrophilic leukopenia, cyclic NP, periodic NP, chemotherapy associated NP, radiation associated NP, chemotherapy associated NP, radiation associated NP, NP associated with solid organ allograft or xenograft rejection or immune suppression therapy in solid organ or other tissue transplants (e.g., liver, lung, kidney, heart, bone marrow, hematopoietic stem cell or endothelial cell transplant, implant or transfusion), chemotherapy associated leukopenia, radiation associated leukopenia, leukopenia associated with solid organ allograft or xenograft rejection or immune suppression therapy in solid organ or other tissue transplants (e.g., liver, lung, kidney, heart, bone marrow, hematopoietic stem cell or endothelial cell transplant, implant or transfusion), immune hemolytic anemias, anemia associated with chronic or acute renal failure or treatment for these conditions (e.g., dialysis), anemia associated with chemotherapy (e.g., isoniazid, prednisone) or anemia associated with radiation therapy.","Some of the blood cell deficiencies are associated with, or caused by, other therapeutic treatments, e.g., cancer chemotherapy, anti-pathogen chemotherapy, radiation therapy and chemotherapy for suppression of autoimmunity or immune suppression therapy for organ or tissue transplantation or implantation. The formula 1 compounds are thus useful to facilitate or speed up immune system recovery in autologous bone marrow transplant or stem cell transplant situations. In many cases it would be medically sound to continue the treatment associated with causing or exacerbating the blood cell deficiency. Thus, one would generally conduct the invention methods with subjects who are undergoing another therapy at the same time or near the same time, e.g., within a few days to within about 1-6 months. Such subjects typically will have an identified blood cell deficiency such as a NP or a TP, e.g., as disclosed herein. However, the formula 1 compounds are generally suitable for preventing the onset of such deficiencies, and they can thus be used prophylactically in these indications. The invention includes all of these embodiments.","In some embodiments, the invention method is accomplished using an effective amount of one or more growth factors or cytokines as a means to further enhance the effect of the formula 1 compounds for their intended uses or to modulate their effects. Suitable growth factors and cytokines are as described herein or in the cited references. For example, when one administers the formula 1 compound to enhance generation of platelets in humans or other subjects, or their precursor cells such as CFU-GEMM, BFU-Mk, CFU-Mk, immature megakaryocytes or mature postmitotic megakaryocytes, one can also administer one or more of G-CSF, GM-CSF, SCF, Steel factor (\u201cSF\u201d), leukemia inhibitory factor (\u201cLIF\u201d), interkeukin-1\u03b1, (\u201cIL-1\u03b1\u201d), IL-3, IL-6, IL-11, TPO, EPO, their isoforms, their derivatives (e.g., linked to a PEG or fusions such as PIXY321) or their homologs for other species. Similarly, administration of the formula 1 compound to enhance the generation or function of myelomonocytic cells such as neutrophils, basophils or monocytes in humans or other subjects, one can also administer one or more of G-CSF, GM-CSF, M-CSF, LIF, TPO, SF, interleukin-1 (\u201cIL-1\u201d), IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, interleukin-5 (\u201cIL-5\u201d), IL-6, IL-11, interleukin-12 (\u201cIL-12\u201d), interleukin-13 (\u201cIL-13\u201d), FLT3 ligand, their isoforms, homologs or derivatives (e.g., linked to a PEG or fusions such as PIXY321) or their homologs for other species. To enhance generation of red cells or their precursor cells such as CFU-GEMM, BFU-E or CFU-E in humans being treated with a formula 1 compound, one can co-administer one or more of G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-1, IL-3, IL-6, TPO, EPO, transforming growth factor-[3], their isoforms, their derivatives (e.g., linked to a PEG or fusions such as PIXY321) or their homologs for other species. See, e.g., 3edition, R. Hoffman, E. J. Benz Jr. et al., editors, Churchill Livingstone, N.Y., 2000 (see, e.g., Chapters 14-17 at pages 154-260). The co-administration of such factors in these methods is intended to enhance the efficacy of the formula 1 compound treatment, which is optionally measured by taking suitable blood or tissue, e.g., bone marrow, samples at one or more times before and after the compounds have been administered. Such co-administration will generally be compatible with a subject's condition and other therapeutic treatments. Co-administration of such factors can precede, be simultaneous with, or follow the times of administration of the formula 1 compound(s) to the subject. Dosages of such growth factors would generally be similar to those previously described, e.g., typically an initial course of treatment comprises administering about 1.0 to about 20 \u03bcg\/kg\/d for about 1-10 days, or as described in, e.g., 3edition, R. Hoffman, E. J. Benz Jr. et al., editors, Churchill Livingstone, N.Y., 2000 (see, e.g., Chapter 51 at pages 939-979 and the references cited therein).","In cases where a subject's blood cell deficiency is caused by, or associated with another therapy, the invention contemplates that the other therapy will continue, if this is reasonable under the circumstances. The timing of other therapies can precede, be simultaneous with, or follow the times of administration of the formula 1 compound(s) to the subject. For example, chemotherapy for some malignancies is accompanied by myelosuppression or a deficiency in one or more blood cell types, e.g., TP or NP. Continued treatment would be called for in some cases, and then the invention methods would be employed to deliver to the subject an effective amount of a formula 1 compound. Thus, alkylating agents, antimicrotubule agents, antimetabolites, topoisomerase I or II inhibitors, or platinum compounds such as one or more of mechlorethamine, vincristine, vinblastine, bleomycin, doxorubicin, epirubicin, tamoxifen, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, methotrexate, ifosfamide, melphalan, chlorambucil, busulfan, carmustine, lomustine, streptozocin, dacarbazine, vinorelbine, paclitaxel (taxol), docetaxel, cytosine arabinoside, hydroxyurea, fludarabine, 2\u2032-chlorodeoxyadenosine, 2\u2032-deoxycoformycin, 6-thioguanine, 6-mercaptopurine, 5-azacytidine, gemcitabine, arabinofuranosylguanine, daunorubicin, mitoxantrone, amsacrine, topotecan, irinotecan, cisplatin, carboplatin, pilcamycin, procarbazine, aspariginase, aminoglutethimide, actinomycin D, azathioprine and gallium nitrate may be administered in conjunction with administration of any formula 1 compound(s) that is disclosed herein. Treatments with other therapeutic agents such as heparin or nucleoside analogs such as 3-thiacytosine, azidothymidine or dideoxycytosine, or other antimicrobials such as cephalosporin, quinine, quinidine, gold salts (e.g., aurothioglucose), ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, fluconazole, fusidic acid, gentamycin, nalidixic acid, penicillins, pentamidine, rifampicin, sulfa antibiotics, suramin or vancomycin may result in a blood cell deficiency(s) and they can thus be combined with administration of a formula 1 compound to treat the deficiency, or to ameliorate a symptom thereof. Similarly, anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., salicylates), cardiac drugs (e.g., digitoxin), \u03b2-blockers or antihypertensive drugs (e.g., oxprenolol or captopril), diuretics (e.g., spironolactone), benzodiazepines, (e.g., diazepam) or antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline, doxepin). Any of these methods also optionally include co-administration of one or more of the growth factors described above, e.g., IL-3, G-CSF, GM-CSF or TPO.","In related embodiments, the activity or numbers of neutrophils or monocytes is enhanced by co-administering the formula 1 compound with an neutrophil or monocyte stimulator, which is an non-protein agent or molecule that can stimulate the activity or number of neutrophils or monocytes in a subject. This aspect of the present invention encompasses any technique to enhance neutrophil or monocyte counts or activity. Means to accomplish this include administering an effective amount of a formula 1 compound and an effective amount of one or more of lithium, e.g., in the form of a salt such as lithium carbonate or chloride, deuterium oxide, levamisole (an antihelminthic agent), lactoferrin, thyroxine, tri-iodothyroxine, anthrax toxin, ascorbic acid, 1-palmitoyl-lysophosphatidic acid, a calcium ionophore, e.g., A23187, cytochalasin B, sodium butyrate, piracetamine, micronized L-arginine, hydroxyurea and a bacterial lipopolysaccharide.","The neutrophil or monocyte stimulator can be administered at various time relative to administration of the formula 1 compound, including about 2-4 hours to about 1 or 2 weeks before administering the formula 1 compound and including administration that is essentially simultaneous with administering the formula 1 compound. Typically a neutrophil or monocyte stimulator will be dosed according to known methods, including daily dosing of about 0.01 mg\/kg\/day to about 25 mg\/kg\/day. For example, about 1 g\/day of ascorbic acid (e.g., about 0.5 to about 1.5 g\/day) can be administered to humans. When deuterium oxide is used as a neutrophil or monocyte stimulator, liquid aqueous formulations may comprise a formula 1 compound and deuterium oxide in place of some or all of the water. Naturally occurring water contains approximately 1 part of deuterium oxide per 6500 parts water. Thus, the water present in a formulation may comprise, e.g., at least 1 part DO in 6000 parts HO, or at least 1 part in 100 parts, or about 50 parts or more per 100 parts of water. These aqueous formulations may comprise one or more additional excipients such as a cyclodextrin such as hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin. Formulations comprising cyclodextrin and deuterium oxide, or comprising cyclodextrin, deuterium oxide and water, may thus comprise deuterium oxide in an amount greater than 1 part per 6500 parts water, such as 1 part deuterium oxide per 1-100 parts water, e.g., 50 parts deuterium oxide per 100 parts water. The amount of cyclodextrin can be in the range of from about 2 to about 85 grams per liter of water and\/or deuterium oxide, such as in the range of from about 5 to about 70 grams per liter of water and\/or deuterium oxide, one example of a suitable amount being in the range of about 45 grams per liter of water and\/or deuterium oxide.","In conducting any of these methods, one can monitor the subject's clinical condition at any relevant time before, during or after administration of the formula 1 compounds, which treatments are optionally combined with any of the other agents or treatments disclosed herein, such as cytokines, interleukins or an agent or molecule that can stimulate the activity or number of neutrophils or monocytes. The subject's blood can be drawn on one, two or more occasions in advance of treatment to, e.g., obtain a baseline or initial level of white or red blood cells, to verify a presumptive diagnosis of a blood cell deficiency or to determine a blood parameter such as circulating myelomonocyte counts, circulating neutrophil counts, circulating platelet counts or the myeloperoxidase index. Then, during the course of treatment or thereafter the subject's blood can be drawn on one, two or more occasions to follow the subject's response.","Invention embodiments include methods that comprise administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a formula 1 compound and an effective amount of at least one form of interferon, such as \u03b3-interferon or a growth factor or interleukin such as G-CSF or IL-6. Interferons can enhance the biological activity of the white cells that arise from increased hemopoiesis. This can be particularly useful when the subject's circulating blood cell deficiency is associated with, e.g., an infection or a chemotherapy that suppresses hemopoiesis. Administration of an growth factor or an interleukin such as IL-6 can facilitate hemopoiesis by stimulating quiescent stem cells or other progenitors that give rise to deficient cell types. Related embodiments replace growth factor or interferon administration partially or completely by increasing endogenous production in the subject using conventional methods, e.g., administering double stranded RNA to stimulate \u03b3-IFN.","For cases where \u03b3-IFN is administered, the administration is usually relatively constant, e.g., daily. This is because in patients in whom \u03b3-IFN is not generated endogenously in significant amounts, there is a tendency for levels of \u03b3-IFN to drop relatively quickly, i.e., within one day. In other words, in a patient in whom initially, \u03b3-IFN levels are close to zero, it should be administered in an amount which is effective to bring \u03b3-IFN levels to within normal levels, e.g., up to 10 nanograms per milliliter, and a similar amount of \u03b3-IFN should be administered each day thereafter.","Suitable forms of \u03b3-IFN and their biological properties and methods to obtain them have been described, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,289,690, 4,314,935, 4,382,027, 4,376,821; 4,376,822, 4,460,685, 4,604,284 and 5,145,677, European patent publication nos. EP 063,482 EP 088 540, and EP 087 686, N. Fujii et al., 1983 130:1683-86. A. Zlotnick et al., 1983 131:794-80, M. deLey et al., 1980 10:877-83, F. Dianzani et al., 1980 29:561-63, G. H. Reem et al., 1982 37:216-21 (1982), R. Devos et al., 1982 10(8):2487-501, G. Simons et al., 1984 28:55-64, P. W. Gray et al., 1982 295:503-508, D. Novick et al., 1983 2:1527-30.","In embodiments where the subject has, or is susceptible to, an infection, administration of the formula 1 compound is optionally accompanied by administration of an agent that can inhibit \u03b3-glutamylcysteine synthetase in the subject. Such inhibition can enhance the capacity of the formula 1 compounds to inhibit replication of pathogens or to sensitize pathogens to metabolites derived from the formula 1 compounds. Suitable \u03b3-glutamylcysteine synthetase inhibitors include buthionine-sulfoximine (BSO), which may be in the form of, e.g., L-buthionine-S-sulfoximine or L-buthionine-R-sulfoximine. Other compounds which can be used to perform this function include sesquiterpene lactones and butylated hydroxy anisole. All of these are commercially available. Such compounds, e.g., BSO, make infected cells more susceptible to the action of the formula 1 compounds, in particular, halogenated formula 1 compounds, e.g., 16-bromoepiandrosterone. The effects of hypohalogenous acid can be enhanced by the administration of an inhibitor of \u03b3-glutamylcysteine synthetase, such as BSO, which, as discussed herein, can render infected cells more susceptible to hypohalogenous acid.","Some compounds that inhibit \u03b3-glutamylcysteine synthetase have significant toxicity toward at least some subjects. Such compounds are suitable for this purpose if such toxicity can be counteracted or kept to levels which are acceptable. Such compounds include pentathionine-sulfoximine, hexathionine-sulfoximine, heptathionine-sulfoximine, prothionine-sulfoximine and methionine sulfoximine. When these compounds are used, they are used in amounts that limits their toxicity.","In any of the methods disclosed herein, a treatment may be interrupted briefly or for extended periods of time. The reason for such interruption can be any of a wide variety, e.g., patient non-compliance, apparent improvement in a subject's condition or by design. Any such interruption would not take a regimen outside the scope of the present invention. For example, a patient might miss a day or several days of administration. Similarly, the regimen might call for administration of one or more compounds for one or more day, and then non-administration of the one or more compounds for one or more day, and then resumption of the administration of the one or more compounds. Furthermore, a regimen according to the present invention can be altered in view of a patient's current condition, and can continue for any length of time, including the entire subject's lifetime.","For administration of \u03b3-IFN, a volume of about 1 mL of a solid or liquid sublingual formulation that comprises about 100 micrograms of \u03b3-IFN may be used. An exemplary liquid formulation comprises a saline solution containing 45 weight % \u03b2-hydroxypropylcyclodextrin. It would be expected that such a dosage would provide in the range of 30 to 40 micrograms of \u03b3-IFN to the patient's blood. Such sublingual formulations would be held under the patient's tongue for a period of time sufficient to allow some or all of the \u03b3-IFN to be delivered to the patient while held under the patient's tongue. Such administration has not been previously known in the art, in which conventionally, it has been thought that administration of \u03b3-IFN must be by injection, e.g., subcutaneous injection. Subcutaneous injection of \u03b3-IFN is associated with unwanted side effects, including fatigue, headache, night sweats, fever, local pain at the injection site, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and others. The above-described sublingual \u03b3-IFN formulations of the present invention is an aspect of the present invention, which can be of use in accordance with other aspects of the present invention as described herein. In general, however, a wide variety of routes of administration could be employed for \u03b3-IFN in accordance with the present invention, including those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,145,677.","Modulation of transcription factors, receptors and gene expression. The formula 1 compounds can modulate, i.e., detectably enhance or inhibit, the expression or biological activity of one or more transcription factors or receptors. This activity can lead to detectable modulation of target gene activity or expression. Such modulation can arise from changes in the capacity of a transcription factor or receptor to bind to or form a complex with other natural ligands such as a target DNA sequence(s), another transcription factor(s), a transcription cofactor, a receptor such as a steroid receptor, receptor cofactor or an enzyme such as a polymerase, kinase, phosphatase or transferase. In many of the clinical conditions described herein, e.g., in inflammation conditions, the formula 1 compounds can inhibit the activity or protein levels of one or more of AP-1, nuclear factor kappa B (NFkB) and GATA-3 in, e.g., a subject's cell(s) or tissue(s) or in enzyme or cell-based assays. In this aspect the compounds are used to treat, prevent or to ameliorate conditions or symptoms that are associated with unwanted or overexpression or activity of one or more of AP-1, NFkB, c-maf or GATA-3 in conditions such as, e.g., inflammation or its symptoms, allergy or its symptoms, e.g., allergic rhinitis or acute or chronic asthma, psoriatic arthritis, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, neurological dysfunction or their symptoms, e.g., dementias such as Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, or memory loss conditions, in osteoporosis or in cancer such as breast cancer. The compounds can prevent NFkB from translocating from the cytoplasm into the nucleus and thus can increase the ratio of cytoplasmic NFkB to nuclear NFkB. The formula 1 compounds may inhibit activation of NFkB-mediated transcription while NFkB is bound to target DNA sequences in the nucleus. Alternatively, the formula 1 compounds can activate or enhance the expression of or one or more activity of a transcription factor such as T-Bet in, e.g., a subject's cell(s) or tissue(s) or in enzyme or cell-based assays.

The steroid hormone receptor may be an orphan nuclear hormone receptor or a characterized receptor such as the glucocorticoid receptor, estrogen receptor or the androgen receptor that displays a moderate or high binding affinity for the formula 1 compound(s). In some embodiments, the steroid receptor is a known steroid receptor. Biological effects from interaction of a formula 1 compound and a receptor can lead to interference with the replication or development of a pathogen or the cell(s) itself. For example, expression of HIV transcripts in HIV-infected cells may be altered. The receptor-formula 1 compound complex may directly interfere with LTR-dependent transcription of HIV genes, leading to reduced viral replication. Alternatively, such effects can include the decreased synthesis or biological activity of a protein or gene product that is associated with the establishment, maintenance or progression of a disease condition described herein or in the cited references.","Invention embodiments include compositions comprising a partially purified or a purified complex comprising a formula 1 compound and a steroid receptor. Such a steroid receptor(s) may be an orphan steroid receptor or a characterized steroid receptor, where either type binds the formula 1 compound with a moderate or high binding affinity, e.g., less than about 0.5\u221210\u00d710M, usually less than about 1\u00d710M, or, for higher affinity interactions, less than about 0.01\u221210\u00d710M. The formula 1 compound(s) may also enhance immune responses such that both immune responses and altered intracellular conditions simultaneously exist to ameliorate one or more of the pathological conditions described herein.","The formula 1 compounds may be used to identify receptors that modulate biological responses, e.g., receptors that participate in effecting enhanced Th1 cytokine synthesis. Invention embodiments include a method, \u201cMethod 1\u201d, which permits the determination of one or more effects of a test compound on a steroid receptor in various biological systems. Generally, the test compound is a formula 1 compound. Such systems include cells containing a DNA construct that constitutively or inducibly expresses a steroid receptor(s) of interest, e.g., SXR, CAR\u03b2, RXR, PXR, PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b2, PPAR\u03b3 or mixtures or dimers thereof, e.g., SXR\/RXR. In other biological systems, the steroid receptor can be under the transcriptional control of a regulatable promoter. Alternatively, the expression another gene such as a steroid-inducible gene, e.g., a steroid-inducible cytochrome P-450. For this method, a source of steroid receptors is generally combined with a means of monitoring them, e.g., by measuring the transcription of a gene regulated by the receptor. Cells that comprise the steroid receptor and optional monitoring means are sometimes referred to herein as the \u201cbiological system.\u201d Sources of steroid receptors include cell lines and cell populations that normally express the steroid receptor of interest and extracts obtained from such cells. Another source for a useful biological system for purposes of this method is tissues from experimental animals that express the receptor.","In one aspect, method 1 allows one to determine one or more effects of a formula 1 compound on a steroid receptor using a method that comprises (a) providing a biological system, e.g., a cell extract, cells or tissue, comprising cells having a plurality of steroid receptors that comprise monomers, homodimers or heterodimers that comprise a steroid receptor, e.g., SXR, CAR-\u03b2, RXR, PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b2, PPAR\u03b3, PXR or dimers that comprise one or more of these; (b) activating or inhibiting the plurality of monomers, homodimers or heterodimers that comprise the steroid receptor by contacting the cells with a steroid receptor (e.g., SXR, CAR-\u03b2, RXR, PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b2, PPAR\u03b3 or PXR) agonist or antagonist; (c) removing substantially all of the steroid receptor agonist or antagonist from the cells; (d) determining an activity of the plurality of monomers, homodimers or heterodimers that comprise the steroid receptor while in an activated state in the absence of agonist or antagonist; (e) exposing the cells to the test compound; (f) determining at least one effect of the test compound on the activity of the plurality of monomers, homodimers or heterodimers that comprise one or more of the steroid receptors while they remain substantially free of agonist or antagonist; and (g) optionally classifying the test compound as an agonist or an antagonist of the steroid receptor, or a neutral compound having little or no detectable effect.","The effects that method 1 can measure includes determining or measuring an effect on a gene whose expression is affected by the steroid receptor. The gene could be a gene associated with a pathological condition such as an infectious agent, an immune disorder such as an inflammation condition or a hyperproliferation condition disclosed herein or in the cited references.","Thus, another aspect of method 1, \u201cmethod 1A\u201d, is determining if a compound not previously known to be a modulator of protein biosynthesis can transcriptionally modulate the expression of a gene that encodes a protein associated with the maintenance or treatment of one or more symptoms of a pathological condition (the \u201ctarget gene\u201d or \u201ctarget protein\u201d). This method comprises: (a) contacting an assay system that comprises eucaryotic cells or a suitable lysate with a formula 1 compound, wherein the eucaryotic cells or suitable lysate comprises one, two or a plurality of steroid receptor proteins and optionally comprises one or more coactivator proteins and a DNA construct comprising operatively linked sequences that comprise (i) a modulatable transcriptional regulatory sequence(s) of the target gene, (ii) a promoter of the gene, and (iii) either the target gene's nucleic acid coding protein region or a coding region for a suitable reporter gene, either of which is capable of expressing the DNA construct's coding region, which is coupled to, and under the control of, the modulatable transcriptional regulatory sequence(s) and the promoter, under conditions such that the formula 1 compound, if capable of acting as a transcriptional modulator of the gene encoding the protein of interest, causes a measurable or detectable signal (e.g., an increased or decreased nucleic or protein expression level compared to a suitable control); (b) quantitatively or qualitatively determining the amount of the signal so produced; and (c) optionally comparing the amount of the signal so determined with the amount of signal detected in the presence of the formula 1 compound with a suitable control, e.g. in the absence of any compound being tested or upon contacting the sample with a known activator or inhibitor of expression of the target gene so as to identify the chemical as one that causes a change in the detectable signal produced by the polypeptide. The method thus permits one to determine if the formula 1 compound specifically transcriptionally modulates expression of the target gene or protein. Suitable steroid receptors and their coactivators are as described herein, e.g., androgen receptor, estrogen receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, mineralcorticoid receptor, aldosterone receptor, PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b4, PPAR\u03b3, PPAR\u03b4, RXR or CAR\u03b2. Information regarding these receptors has been described, see, e.g., relevant U.S. patents cited herein and PCT publication WO 0025800 and WO 0031286.","In method 1A the assay system may comprise a transformed cell line, primary cells or untransformed cells or a suitable lysate or extract of any of these. Exemplary cell lines include ones derived from human or other mammalian tumors or precancers. The source of such cells may be human or animal, e.g., a mammal such as a primate or a rodent. In some embodiments, the assay system comprises a rodent such as a mouse, transgenic mouse or other transgenic animal (see e.g., PCT publication WO 000602). Measurement of the formula 1 compound's effect on the assay system includes detecting increased or decreased expression of nucleic acid or polypeptide by the target gene in response to the formula 1 compound's presence. Exemplary conditions include conducting the method under conditions suitable for maintaining the cells in tissue culture or under conditions suitable for enzyme assays using cell extracts or lysates, e.g., tissue culture medium or a buffered aqueous solution that is, e.g., a nearly isotonic solution at about 32-38\u00b0 C., a pH of about 6 to about 8, a formula 1 compound concentration of about 1\u00d710M to about 1\u00d710M (including any concentration in any single unit increment of, e.g., 1\u00d710M, e.g., 1\u00d710M, 1\u00d710M, 1\u00d710M, 1\u00d710M, 1\u00d710M, 1\u00d710M or 1\u00d710M) and contacting the formula 1 compound and the assay system for about 20 minutes to about 72 hours. Detection of a change in expression of the target gene or the reporter gene includes, e.g., detecting (1) changes in gene nucleic acid levels by qualitative or quantitative PCR methods and (2) changes in gene protein levels by enzyme or antibody-based assays such as measuring enzyme activity using a suitable substrate or measuring protein levels, e.g., by ELISA or western blotting.","In conducting method 1A, one typically contacts a sample that contains a predefined number of identical or essentially identical eucaryotic cells, e.g. about 5\u00d710to about 5\u00d710cells, with a predetermined concentration of a compound of formula 1. The eucaryotic cells comprise a DNA construct that is made using conventional molecular biology methods and protocols. The assay system is maintained under conditions such that the formula 1 compound, if capable of acting as a transcriptional modulator of the gene encoding the protein of interest, causes a measurable or detectable signal to be produced by the polypeptide expressed by the reporter gene. Once sufficient time for generation of a detectable response or signal has passed, one can determine the amount of the signal produced. Typically the response or signal is measured quantitatively, but a qualitative measurement can be useful for rapid screening purposes.","For method 1A, one can also optionally compare the detectable signal with the amount of produced signal that (i) one detects in the absence of any formula 1 compound or (ii) when contacting the sample with other chemicals, which identifies the formula 1 compound as a chemical that causes a change in the detectable signal the polypeptide produces. One then typically determines whether the formula 1 compound specifically transcriptionally modulates expression of the gene associated with the maintenance or treatment of one or more symptoms of the pathological condition.","Other aspects of the method 1 and 1A include a screening method comprising separately contacting each of a plurality of identical, essentially identical or different samples, each sample containing a predefined number of such cells with a with a predetermined concentration of each different formula 1 compound to be tested, e.g., wherein the plurality of samples comprises more than about 1\u00d710or more than about 1\u00d710samples or about 0.5\u22125\u00d710samples. In other aspects one determines the amount of RNA by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In any of methods 1 or 1A, a formula 1 compound such as any one of those described or named herein may be utilized.","Aspects of the invention include another method, \u201cmethod 2\u201d, which centers on identifying a gene whose expression is modulated by a candidate binding partner for infectious disease therapeutic agents. Typically the binding partner is a steroid receptor, e.g., a monomer, homodimer or heterodimer that comprises SXR, CAR-13, PXR, PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b2, PPAR\u03b3, PPAR\u03b3 or RXR or a homolog or isoform thereof. The steroid receptor is typically present as a complex that comprises, e.g., the formula 1 compound and the regulated gene's DNARS, which the steroid receptor, or a complex that comprises the steroid receptor, recognizes and specifically binds to. Such complexes can also comprise a transcription factor that binds to the steroid receptor or to nucleic acid sequences adjacent to or near the DNARS. Exemplary transcription factors that may be present include one or more of ARA54, ARA55, ARA70, SRC-1, NF-\u03baB, NFAT, AP1, Ets, p300, CBP, p300\/CBP, p300\/CPB-associated factor, SWI\/SNF and human homologs of SWI\/SNF, CBP, SF-1, RIP140, GRIP1 and Vpr. In general, one provides a first and a second group of cells in vitro or in vivo and contacts the first group of cells with the infectious disease therapeutic agent, but does not contact the second group of cells in vitro or in vivo with the infectious disease therapeutic agent. Recovering RNA from the cells, or generating cDNA derived from the RNA, is accomplished by conventional protocols. Analysis of the RNA, or cDNA derived from the RNA, from the first and the second group of cells identifies differences between them, which one can use to identify a gene whose regulation is modulated by the candidate binding partner for the infectious disease therapeutic agent or any DNARS associated with that gene.","An aspect of method 2 is determining the capacity of a formula 1 compound to modulate, or participate in the modulation of, the transcription of a gene associated with the maintenance or treatment of one or more symptoms of a pathological condition. It is expected that in general, the formula 1 compounds will cause an increase in the transcription of such genes. The pathological condition is typically one associated with an infectious agent, e.g., virus, parasite or bacterium, but can also include an immune condition, e.g., an autoimmune condition or an immune deficiency. The pathological condition may also be an insufficient immune response to an infection or an insufficient response to a hyperproliferation condition or malignancy. Other pathological conditions that one can apply the method to are inflammation conditions.","In some aspects, the formula 1 compounds used in method 2 will be labeled. Such compounds are prepared by conventional methods using standard labels, such as radiolabels, fluorescent labels or other labels as described herein and in the cited references.","An embodiment of method 2 involves analyzing the RNA, or cDNA derived from it, by subtraction hybridization. In this embodiment, the RNA or cDNA obtained from the first and second groups of cells is hybridized and the resulting duplexes are removed. This allows recovery of nucleic acids that encode genes whose transcription is modulated by the candidate binding partner, which is usually a steroid receptor. One can use conventional methods to amplify and obtain nucleic acid and protein sequence information from the nucleic acids recovered by this method. The nucleic acid sequences that are transcriptionally induced or repressed by the formula 1 compound are candidate binding partners.","A transcriptionally induced gene(s) will be enriched in the group 1 cells treated with the formula 1 compound, while any repressed gene(s) will be depleted or absent. In these embodiments, the RNA recovered after removal of duplexes is typically amplified by standard RT-PCR or PCR protocols. These protocols typically use specific sets of random primer pairs, followed by analysis of the amplified nucleic acids by gel electrophoresis. Nucleic acids that are induced by the formula 1 compound will appear as a band(s), usually duplex DNA, that is not present in the control or second set of cells. Nucleic acids that are transcriptionally repressed by the formula 1 compound's binding partner will be depleted or absent in the first group of cells. Once such gene candidates are identified, they can be cloned and expressed and the capacity of the DNARS associated with the gene to form a complex that comprises a candidate binding partner and an optionally labeled formula 1 compound is analyzed by conventional methods, e.g., equilibrium dialysis, affinity chromatography using, e.g., the DNARS immobilized on a column, or coprecipitation of complexes that comprise an optionally labeled DNARS and candidate binding partner using anti-binding partner antibodies. Nucleic acid sequence analysis is usually used to identify regions adjacent to the coding regions of the regulated gene to identify any DNARS associated with the gene. The identity of a DNARS can be established by the binding to the DNARS of complexes that comprise a candidate binding partner, e.g., a steroid receptor, and optionally also comprise a formula 1 compound. The location and identity of the DNARS can be accomplished by DNA footprinting or other methods for detecting binding interactions. The DNARS, the receptor or the formula 1 compound can be labeled in these variations of method 2.","In general, the second group of cells will be identical or essentially identical to the first group of cells. In embodiments (for both methods 1 and 2) where the cells are \u201cessentially identical\u201d, the first or the second group of cells may differ from each other by the presence or absence of a DNA construct(s) that expresses (i) a steroid receptor and\/or (ii) an easily detected protein, e.g., a \u03b2-galactosidase, a peroxidase, a phosphatase, a luciferase or a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, whose transcriptional regulation is usually modulated by a steroid receptor. In these embodiments, the difference between the first and the second group of cells is used to facilitate the analysis of the biological effects of the formula 1 compound and the steroid receptor binding partner. Groups of cells are considered \u201cidentical\u201d if they do not display known or obvious morphological or genetic differences.","Usually, the second group of cells will serve as a control, and they will thus not be exposed to any formula 1 compound before obtaining the RNA or cDNA. But, for some embodiments, one can expose the second group of cells to a known agonist or antagonist of the steroid receptor binding partner. This allows one to compare the potency of the formula 1 compound with the potency of the agonist or antagonist.","In other embodiments, one can modify method 2 by providing a third group of cells, which is optionally used as an untreated control when the second group of cells is treated with a steroid receptor agonist or antagonist. In these embodiments, one will typically compare the effect of the formula 1 compound and the agonist or the antagonist of the expression of a gene or DNA construct. The DNA construct would comprise a promoter or other regulatory sequences that are subject to transcriptional modulation, usually increase transcription, by the formula 1 compound in concert with its binding partner.","The formula 1 compounds can directly or indirectly modulate the activity or synthesis of one or more biological ligands to effect a detectable biological response or activity change. To facilitate the identification of candidate binding partners for the formula 1 compounds, one can use a radiolabeled formula 1 compound that is linked to a support, usually a solid support, as a means to recover the candidate binding partners. The formula 1 compound can be linked to the support through a variable group that is bonded to the formula 1 compound, e.g., at the 2-, 3-, 7-, 11-, 15-, 16- or 17-position of the steroid nucleus. Linking agents are known for such uses and include homobifunctional and heterobifunctional agents, many of which are commercially available. The linker one uses will typically comprise about 2-20 linked atoms. The linked atoms usually comprise mostly carbon, with one, two or three oxygen, sulfur or nitrogen atoms that optionally replace one or more carbon or hydrogen atoms. One can use a cDNA expression library that one has made from suitable cells or tissues as a source of candidate binding partners. The cells or tissues can be obtained from a mammalian or a vertebrate host, e.g., human, mouse, bird, primate, or from other sources, e.g., insects (e.g., ), other invertebrates (e.g., yeast, bacteria, sp., sp., sp., ) or other organism groups or species listed herein or in the cited references. Suitable tissues include skin, liver tissue or cells, including hepatocytes and K\u00fcpfer cells, fibrocytes, monocytes, dendritic cells, kidney cells and tissues, brain or other central nervous system cells or tissues, including neurons, astrocytes and glial cells, peripheral nervous system tissues, lung, intestine, placenta, breast, ovary, testes, muscle, including heart or myocyte tissue or cells, white blood cells, including T cells, B cells, bone marrow cells and tissues, lymph tissues or fluids and chondrocytes.","Typically a candidate binding partner that one isolates from a non-human source will have a human homolog that has similar binding properties for the formula 1 compound. Non-human candidate binding partners can thus be used to facilitate recovery of the human homologs, e.g., by preparing antiserum for precipitating the human homolog from a solution that comprises the human homolog or by comparing the sequence of the non-human candidate binding partner with known human gene sequences. Once a source of the candidate binding partner is obtained, it can be contacted with labeled formula 1 compound, usually radiolabeled with, e.g., C or H, and complexes that comprise the labeled formula 1 compound and the candidate binding partner is recovered using, e.g., affinity chromatography or antibody precipitation methods. The recovery of the complex provides a source of at least partially purified candidate binding partner, i.e., the candidate binding partner is enriched, e.g., at least 10-fold enriched, or at least 100-fold enriched, or at least 500-fold enriched, compared to its abundance in the original candidate binding partner source material.","Embodiments of the invention include a composition comprising a partially purified (purified at least about 2-fold to about 10-fold relative to natural sources, e.g., cells or a cell lysate) comples or a purified (purified at least about 20-fold to about 5000-fold relative to natural sources, e.g., cells or a cell lysate) complex (where the partially purified or purified complex is optionally isolated) comprising a formula 1 compound and a steroid receptor, a serum steroid-binding protein (e.g., human serum albumin, \u03b11-acid glycoprotein, sex hormone-binding globulin, testosterone-binding globulin, corticosteroid-binding globulin, androgen binding protein (rat)) or another binding partner, e.g., transcription factor or DNARS. An aspect of these compositions includes a product produced by the process of contacting the partially purified or the purified composition with one or more cells, one or more tissues, plasma or blood.","Other embodiments include a method to modulate a cellular response or to determine a biological activity of a formula 1 compound comprising: (a) contacting the formula 1 compound(s) with a cell or cell population; (b) measuring one or more of (i) a complex between a binding partner and the formula 1 compound, (ii) proliferation of the cell or cell population, (iii) differentiation of the cell or cell population (iv) an activity of a protein kinase C, (v) a level of phosphorylation of a protein kinase C substrate, (vi) transcription of one or more target genes, (vii) inhibition of unwanted cellular responses to certain steroids, e.g., inhibition of glucocorticoid-induced immune suppression or inhibition of glucocorticoid-induced bone loss, (viii) inhibition or modulation of steroid-induced transcription, e.g., increased or decreased expression induced by glucocorticoids or sex steroids or (ix) inhibition of HIV LTR-driven transcription; and (c) optionally comparing the result obtained in step (b) with an appropriate control. Aspects of this embodiment include (i) the method wherein the binding partner is a steroid receptor, a transcription factor or a DNARS, (ii) the method wherein the biological activity determined is a modulating activity of the formula 1 compound for replication or cytopathic effects associated with a retrovirus, a hepatitis virus or a protozoan parasite, (iii) the method wherein the biological activity determined is a modulating activity of the formula 1 compound for replication, cytopathic effects associated with the retrovirus, the hepatitis virus or the protozoan parasite or the biological activity determined is metabolism (assay by H-thymidine uptake or other assay as referenced or described herein) of a cell or cell population comprising NK cells, phagocytes, monocytes, macrophages, basophils, eosinophils, dendritic cells, synoviocytes, microglial cells, fibrocytes, transformed (neoplastic) cells, virus-infected cells, bacteria-infected cells or parasite-infected cells, and (iv) the method wherein the target gene is a virus gene, a bacterial gene, a parasite gene, a gene associated with cancer, e.g., wherein the virus gene is a DNA or an RNA polymerase gene, a reverse transcriptase gene, an envelope gene, a protease gene or a gene associated with viral nucleic acid replication or a viral structural gene.","Another embodiment is a method comprising contacting a complex that comprises a steroid receptor and a formula 1 compound with a transactivator protein, whereby a complex comprising the steroid receptor protein, the formula 1 compound and the transactivator protein forms, wherein the transactivator protein is in (1) a cell or tissue extract (e.g., nuclei, lysate containing nuclei or lysate without nuclei from a cell(s) or tissue(s)), (2) a partially purified or purified cell or tissue extract, (3) a cell(s) in tissue culture or (4) a cell(s) in a subject, where any of (1)-(4) optionally comprises a target gene (native gene or introduced by standard gene manipulation techniques) whose level of expression is optionally assayed after the complex forms. In some of these embodiments, the transactivator protein is partially purified or purified and is in the cell or tissue extract or the partially purified or purified cell or tissue extract. The transactivator protein may be TIF-1, CBP\/P300, TRIP1\/SUG-1, RIP-140, SRC1\u03b1\/P160, or TIF-2\/GRIP-1. In any of these embodiments the complex comprising the steroid receptor protein, the formula 1 compound and the transactivator protein may increase or decrease transcription of the target gene compared to a suitable control (e.g., control under same conditions, but lacking any added compound that corresponds to the formula 1 compound, or where another compound (e.g., a steroid that is known to bind to the steroid receptor) is used as a benchmark or reference standard against which altered target gene expression is measured). In these methods, the target gene may be a pathogen gene (e.g., virus, bacterium, parasite, fungus, yeast) or a gene associated with a pathological condition (autoimmunity, inflammation, hyperproliferation).","The formula 1 compounds are suitable for use in certain described methods that use steroids to modulate biological activities in cells or tissues. For example, a formula 1 compound(s) can be used to selectively interact with specific steroid receptors or steroid orphan receptor, or their subtypes, that are associated with a pathological condition(s) in a subject, essentially as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,668,175. In these applications, the formula 1 compound may act as a ligand for the receptor to modulate abnormal expression of a gene product(s) that correlates with the pathological condition (a steroid hormone responsive disease state). Such genes are normally regulated by steroid hormones. In other applications, one can use the formula 1 compounds to screen for ligands that bind to or detectably affect a biological activity of a steroid receptor or steroid orphan receptor and one or more transcription factors (or cofactors) such as AP-1 and\/or with a DNA sequence(s), essentially as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,643,720. Similarly, the formula 1 compounds can be used essentially as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,597,693, 5,639,598, 5,780,220, 5,863,733 and 5,869,337 to detectably modulate a biological activity of one of these molecules. In some of these embodiments, the formula 1 compound(s) is labeled to facilitate its use. Suitable labels are known in the art and include radiolabels (e.g., H, C, P, S, I, Tc and other halogen isotopes), fluorescent moieties (e.g., fluorescein, resorufin, Texas Red, rhodamine, BODIPY, arylsulfonate cyanines), chemiluminescent moieties (e.g., acridinium esters), metal chelators, biotin, avadin, peptide tags (e.g., histidine hexamer, a peptide recognized by monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies), covalent crosslinking moieties. One prepares the labeled compounds according to known methods.","Methods suitable to measure the cellular response or biological effects caused by various compounds, e.g., activation, on immune system cells (e.g., NK cells, phagocytes, monocytes, macrophage, neutrophils, eosinophils, dendritic cells, synoviocytes, microglial cells, fibrocytes) have been described, e.g., Jakob et al., 1998 161:3042-3049, Pierson et al., 1996 87:180-189, Cash et al., 1994 98:313-318, Monick et al., 1999 162:3005-3012, Rosen et al., 1999 67:1180-1186, Grunfeld et al., 1999 40:245-252, Singh et al., 1998 76:513-519, Chesney et al., 1997 94:6307-6312, Verhasselt et al., 1999 162:2569-2574, Avice et al., 1999 162:2748-2753, Cella et al., 1999 189:821-829, Rutalt et al., 1999 26:232-238, Akbari et al., 1999 189:169-178, Hryhorenko et al., 1998 40:231-240, Fernvik et al., 1999 48:28-35, Cooper et al., 1999 179:738-742, Betsuyaku et al., 1999 103:825-832, Brown et al., 1998 46:308-316, Sibelius et al., 1999 67:1125-1130. The use of formula 1 compounds in such methods are aspects of the invention and they permit, e.g., measurement of the biological effects of formula 1 compounds on, e.g., one or more of (1) the cell's biological activities, (2) genes whose expression is regulated by the formula 1 compound or (3) a steroid receptor. Exemplary biological effects that the formula 1 compounds may exert include one or more of (1) stimulation of ion flux or ion channel activity in one or more immune cell subsets such as one or more of those described herein, (2) binding to one or more ligands such as a steroid receptor and modulation of a biological activity of the receptor, (3) detectably enhanced transcription of one or more genes whose expression is affected by a steroid receptor(s) or other biomolecule whose activity is directly or indirectly affected by the formula 1 compound's presence and (4) detectably decreased transcription of one or more genes whose expression is affected by a steroid receptor(s) or other biomolecule whose activity is directly or indirectly affected by the formula 1 compound's presence.","Embodiments include any of the methods described above, e.g., method 1, wherein the cells or biological system comprises NK cells, phagocytes, monocytes, macrophage, neutrophils, eosinophils, dendritic cells, synoviocytes, microglial cells, glial cells, fibrocytes or hepatocytes, that optionally comprise a DNA construct that expresses one or two cloned steroid receptors. The method optionally analyzes the effect of a formula 1 compound on the cells compared to controls. Controls include the use of a known agonist or antagonist for the steroid receptor or the comparison of cells exposed to a formula 1 compound with control cells (usually the same cell type as the treated cells) that are not exposed to the formula 1 compound. A response, e.g., activation of the steroid receptor can be measured by known assays compared to controls.","The formula 1 compound will, in some cases modulate (increase or decrease) transcription of one or more genes in the cells. In other cases, the formula 1 compound will enhance lysosome movement in one or more of the subject's NK cells, phagocytes, monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, dendritic cells synoviocytes, microglial cells or fibrocytes. Such effects will typically be mediated directly or indirectly through one or more transcription factors or steroid receptors that act to modulate gene transcription, e.g., cause enhanced protein kinase C (a PKC such as PKC\u03b1, PKC\u03b2, PKCy or PKC\u03b6) activity in the cells used in the assay, or another effect as disclosed herein.","Other related embodiments are a composition comprising a partially purified or a purified complex comprising a formula 1 compound and a steroid receptor, a serum steroid-binding protein (e.g., human serum albumin, a1-acid glycoprotein, sex hormone-binding globulin, testosterone-binding globulin, corticosteroid-binding globulin, androgen binding protein (rat) or a homolog or isoform of any of these) or another binding partner, e.g., transcription factor or DNARS. An aspect of these compositions includes a product produced by the process of contacting the partially purified or the purified composition with one or more cells, one or more tissues, plasma or blood.","In a related embodiment, a formula 1 compound is used to exert a cytostatic effect on a subject's cells, e.g., mammalian cells, in vitro or in vivo. Typically such cells are lymphoid cells, e.g., T cell populations from, e.g., blood or organs that are rich in lymphoid cells (e.g., spleen, lymph tissue or nodes), or transformed T cell lines. Such activity provides an estimate of the potency of formula 1 compounds to mediate immunological effects, such as enhancing Th1 immune responses or suppressing expression of one or more Th2-associated cytokines. Thus, an invention method comprises (a) contacting a formula 1 compound and lymphoid cells in vitro, (b) determining the degree of cytostasis that the compound exerts to identify a cytostatic compound and (c) optionally administering the cytostatic compound to an immune suppressed subject to determine the effect of the compound on one or more of the subject's immune responses as described herein, e.g., enhanced Th1 cytokine or cell response or decreased Th2-associated cytokine expression. Typically, such methods are conducted using a range of formula 1 compound concentrations and suitable controls, such as a known cytostatic agent or a blank that contains solvent that lacks the formula 1 compound. Inhibition of cell proliferation is measured by standard methods. Methods to measure the cytoststic effects of the compounds includes measuring viable cell numbers in treated and untreated cultures or by measuring DNA synthesis using e.g., H-thymidine incorporation into DNA in treated and untreated cultures. Typical ranges of formula 1 concentrations in the cell growth medium are about 0.1 \u03bcM to about 100 \u03bcM, using about 4-6 different concentrations of compounds with a fixed number of cells (e.g., about 0.4\u00d710to about 5\u00d710). The formula 1 compound is left in contact with the cells in tissue culture for a sufficient time to observe cytostasis, e.g., about 16 hours to about 6 days, typically about 24-72 hours. In these embodiments, one may optionally screen for modulation of a biological activity of a steroid receptor, e.g., activation of PPAR\u03b1, which may be associated with the cytostasis the compound induced.","Other therapeutic and biological applications and activities. The formula 1 compounds are useful in enhancing \u03b2-cell function in the islets of Langerhans or in reducing the rate of islet cell damage and thus they are useful to treat, prevent, ameliorate or slow the progression of diabetes and hyperglycemia in a subject. One or more diabetes symptoms that can improve include improved tolerance to glucose or improved glucose utilization, or a decrease in vascular lesions, atherosclerosis, diabetic osteoarthropathy, skin lesions, neuropathy, ketosis or autoantibodies against islet cells or decreased expression or levels of one or more of IL-1, TNF and IFN-\u03b3. The compounds can also be used in, e.g., diabetes or obesity, to (1) reduce body fat mass and increase muscle mass or (2) lower one or more of serum or blood low density lipoprotein, triglyceride, cholesterol or serum apoB levels, typically with little or no effect on tissue sensitivity to insulin or with little or no effect on serum or blood high density lipoprotein levels. The compounds can be used to treat symptoms associated with obesity or diabetes. Dosages, routes of administration and dosing protocols for the formula 1 compounds are essentially as described herein.","The formula 1 compounds are also useful for preventing, slowing the progression of or treating chronic renal failure in a subject. In some embodiments, the formula 1 compounds may be used where chronic renal failure results from polycystic kidney disease, from, e.g., an autoimmune condition such as acute or chronic glomerulonephritis, or from diabetes, interstitial nephritis or hypertension. Dosages, routes of administration and dosing protocols for the formula 1 compounds are essentially as described herein.","The formula 1 compounds modulate the biological activity of cytokines or interleukins that are associated with various immune deficiency or dysregulation conditions, which may be transient or chronic. They can thus be used to ameliorate, treat or prevent naturally occurring age-related decline in immune function in a subject or immune deficiency or dysregulation resulting from trauma, stress, burns, surgery, autoimmunity or infections as described herein. Such immune deficiency dysregulation may be associated with, e.g., an age-related increase in production of one or more of IL-4, IL-5 and IL-6 or an age-related decrease in production of one or more of IL-2, IL-3, \u03b3-IFN, GM-CSF or antibodies. In these embodiments, the formula 1 compound is administered to the subject to detectably decrease production or levels of one or more of IL-4, IL-5 and IL-6 or to detectably increase production or levels of one or more of IL-2, IL-3, IL-5, GM-CSF and \u03b3-IFN. These cytokine changes facilitate normalization of the subject's immune responses. Such normalization can be observed by various means. These means include monitoring appropriate cytokine RNA or protein level(s) in the subject or by measuring biological responses such as restoration or detectable improvement of contact hypersensitivity in a subject with depressed or suboptimal contact hypersensitivity response. The formula 1 compounds can thus be used to enhance or restore a deficient or suboptimal immune response such as contact hypersensitivity response in a subject with a chronic or transient state of immune deficiency or dysregulation. In these embodiments, the formula 1 compound is administered using the dosages, routes of administration and dosing protocols for the formula 1 compounds essentially as described herein. Treatment with the formula 1 compounds is optionally combined with other appropriate treatments or therapies essentially as described herein, e.g., a antibacterial or antiviral agent(s) is coadministered with a formula 1 compound to treat, prevent or ameliorate an infection in an infected subject or a subject suffering from, e.g., a burn. Methods to measure changes in cytokine levels or contact hypersensitivity are known and can optionally be used in these embodiments, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,919,465, 5,837,269, 5,827,841, 5,478,566.","The capacity of the formula 1 compounds to modulate immune functions permits their use for treating, preventing, slowing the progression of or alleviating the a symptom(s) of subjects with psychological disorders, metabolic disorders, chronic stress, sleep disorders, conditions associated with sexual senescence, aging, or premature aging. Chronic stress and related disorders include fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome and hypothalamic-pituitary axis dysregulation. In these embodiments, treatment of subjects with a formula 1 compound is optionally combined with other suitable agents such as triiodothyronine, tetraiodothyronine, an insulin-like growth factor or insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3.","An aspect of the invention provides embodiments where a formula 1 compound and a glutathione reductase inhibitor such as buthathione sulfoximine [CH\u2014(CH)\u2014S(\u2550O)(\u2550NH)\u2014(CH)\u2014CHNH\u2014C(O)\u2014OH] are administered to a subject to treat infections, e.g., a parasite infection such as malaria, , or to treat a cancer or malignancy. Without being bound to any theory, it is believed that the decreased supply of reduced glutathione may enhance phagocytosis by macrophage, possibly due to enhanced oxidative damage in infected cells or in replicating malignant cells. Alternatively, the use of a glutathione reductase inhibitor may result in improved recognition of infected or malignant cells by the immune system. A formula 1 compound, such as BrEA, and buthathione sulfoximine are used, e.g., to enhance clearance of ring stage malaria from infected cells or to enhance immune system recognition of malignant cells compared to the use of the formula 1 compound alone. The infections and malignancies where these embodiments apply are as described herein.","Another aspect of the invention provides for the use of a formula 1 compound and a flavonoid, e.g., a naragin flavonoid, to enhance the bioavailability of the formula 1 compound. In these embodiments, the an effective amount of a flavonoid is administered to a subject who is receiving a formula 1 compound. Typically about 1-10 mg of flavonoid per kg of body weight is administered to the subject a flavonoid such as bavachinin A, didymin (isosakuranetin-7-rutinoside or neoponcirin), flavanomarein (isookanine-7-glucoside), flavanone azine, flavanone diacetylhydrazone, flavanone hydrazone, silybin, silychristin, isosilybin or silandrin. The flavonoid compound is typically administered with the formula 1 compound or a few hours, e.g., about 1, 2 or 3 hours, before the formula 1 compound is administered to the subject.","As noted above, in some embodiments a treatment with a formula 1 compound is combined with a corticosteroid or glucocorticoid. Corticosteroids are used in a number of clinical situations to, e.g., decrease the intensity or frequency of flares or episodes of inflammation or autoimmune reactions in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, ulcerative colitis, bronchial asthma, psoriasis or systemic lupus erythematosus. However, many corticosteroids have significant side effects or toxicities that can limit their use or efficacy. The formula 1 compounds are useful to counteract such side effects or toxicities without negating all of the desired therapeutic capacity of the corticosteroid. This allows the continued use, or a modified dosage of the corticosteroid, e.g., an increased dosage, without an intensification of the side effects or toxicities or a decreased corticosteroid dosage. The side-effects or toxicities that can be treated, prevented, ameliorated or reduced include one or more of bone loss, reduced bone growth, enhanced bone resorption, osteoporosis, immunosuppression, increased susceptibility to infection, mood or personality changes, depression, headache, vertigo, high blood pressure or hypertension, muscle weakness, fatigue, nausea, malaise, peptic ulcers, pancreatitis, thin or fragile skin, growth suppression in children or preadult subjects, thromboembolism, cataracts, and edema. Dosages, routes of administration and dosing protocols for the formula 1 compound would be essentially as described herein. An exemplary dose of formula 1 compound of about 0.5 to about 20 mg\/kg\/day is administered during the period during which a corticosteroid is administered and optionally over a period of about 1 week to about 6 months or more after dosing with the corticosteroid has ended. The corticosteroids are administered essentially using known dosages, routes of administration and dosing protocols, see, e.g., 54edition, 2000, pages 323-2781, ISBN 1-56363-330-2, Medical Economics Co., Inc., Montvale, N.J. However, the dosage of the corticosteroid may optionally be adjusted, e.g., increased about 10% to about 300% above the normal dosage, without a corresponding increase in all of the side effects or toxicities associated with the corticosteroid. Such increases would be made incrementally over a sufficient time period and as appropriate for the subject's clinical condition, e.g., daily corticosteroid dose increases of about 10% to about 20% to a maximum of about 300% over about 2 weeks to about 1 year.","Such corticosteroids include hydrocortisone (cortisol), corticosterone, aldosterone, ACTH, triamcinolone and derivatives such as triamcinolone diacetate, triamcinolone hexacetonide, and triamcinolone acetonide, betamethasone and derivatives such as betamethasone dipropionate, betamethasone benzoate, betamethasone sodium phosphate, betamethasone acetate, and betamethasone valerate, flunisolide, prednisone, fluocinolone and derivatives such as fluocinolone acetonide, diflorasone and derivatives such as diflorasone diacetate, halcinonide, dexamethasone and derivatives such as dexamethasone dipropionate and dexamethasone valerate, desoximetasone (desoxymethasone), diflucortolone and derivatives such as diflucortolone valerate), fluclorolone acetonide, fluocinonide, fluocortolone, fluprednidene, flurandrenolide, clobetasol, clobetasone and derivatives such as clobetasone butyrate, alclometasone, flumethasone, and fluocortolone.","In some applications, the formula 1 compound(s) may directly and\/or indirectly interfere with replication, development or cell to cell transmission of a pathogen such as a virus or a parasite (malaria). Improvement in a subject's clinical condition may arise from a direct effect on an infectious agent or on a malignant cell. Interference with cellular replication can arise from inhibition of one or more enzymes that a parasite or an infected cell uses for normal replication or metabolism, e.g., glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which affects cellular generation of NADPH (see, e.g., Raineri et al., 1970 9: 2233-2243). This effect may contribute to cytostatic effects that some formula 1 compounds can have. Modulation of cellular enzymes expression or activity may also interfere with replication or development of a pathogen, e.g., HIV or malaria parasites or with replication or development of neoplastic cells, e.g., inhibition of angiogenesis. Clinical improvement will also generally result from an enhanced immune response such as an improved Th1 response.","Administration of a formula 1 compound can lead to a decrease in adenosine levels in a subject's tissue(s), e.g., lung or central nervous system tissue. This effect can be used to treat, prevent, ameliorate one or more symptoms of or slow the progression of a disease(s) or clinical condition(s) where a relatively high level of adenosine is a factor in or can contribute to the disease or condition, e.g., in asthma.","Adenosine is associated with the symptoms of bronchial asthma, where it can induce bronchoconstriction or contraction of airway smooth muscle in asthmatic subjects, see, e.g., J. Thorne and K. Broadley, & 149(2 pt. 1):392-399 1994, S. Ali et al., Agents & Actions 37:165-167 1992, Bjorck et al., 145:1087-1091 1992. This effect is not observed in non-asthmatic subjects. In the central nervous system, adenosine can inhibit the release of neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin, glutamate, and GABA. It can also depress neurotransmission, reduce neuronal firing to induce spinal analgesia and it possesses anxiolytic properties, see, e.g., A. Pelleg and R. Porter, 10:157 1990. In the heart, adenosine suppresses pacemaker activity, slows AV conduction, possesses antiarrhythmic and arrhythmogenic effects, modulates autonomic control and triggers the synthesis and release of prostaglandins. In addition, adenosine has vasodilatory effects and can modulate vascular tone.","The unwanted effects of excess adenosine can be ameliorated or reduced by administering sufficient amounts of a formula 1 compound to a subject who is subject to developing or who has an unwanted level of adenosine in one or more tissues or organs. In typical embodiments, one will administer about 10 mg\/kg\/day to about 100 mg\/kg\/day of a formula 1 compound to a subject over a period of about 1 week to about 4 months to effect detectable changes in adenosine levels or amelioration in one or more symptoms associated with high adenosine in one or more of the subject's tissues. Such changes may be determined by comparing the subject's adenosine levels before treatment with the formula 1 compound is started. Alternatively, for subjects with symptoms that are consistent with high adenosine levels, the decrease can be inferred by comparing the normal level of adenosine in the target tissue(s) for subjects of the same species and similar age or sex with the level that is observed after treatment. Methods to measure adenosine levels in mammalian tissue are known and can optionally be used in these embodiments, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,087,351.","In some clinical conditions, the formula 1 compounds can inhibit activated T lymphocytes in vivo, and they can inhibit the expression or biological activity of one or more of TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, IL-8 or insulin like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) or IL-6 receptor. The compounds are thus useful to treat, prevent or ameliorate conditions where this is a component of pathology. Such conditions include inflammation conditions such as psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis. The compound can thus ameliorate the inflammation, e.g., by inhibiting expression of one or more of TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, IL-8 or IGF-1R. Also, the compounds can inhibit unwanted T cell activity. They can thus ameliorate one or more psoriasis symptoms such as skin scaling, skin thickening, keratinocyte hyperproliferation, deficient filaggrin expression (B. Baker et al., 1984, 111:702), deficient strateum corneum lipid deposition or they can improve a clinical assessment such as the Psoriasis Activity and Severity Index. The formula 1 compounds can be delivered to a subject with psoriasis using topical or systemic formulations as described herein. Topical formulations include gels and creams, e.g., as described herein. Daily or intermittent administration of the compound can be used essentially as described herein. The use of the formula 1 compounds is optionally combined with one more current psoriasis treatments, e.g., topical emollients or moisturizers, tars, anthralins, systemic or topical corticosteroids, vitamin D analogs such as calcitriol, methotrexate, etretinate, acitretin, cyclosporin, FK 506, sulfasalazine, ultraviolet B radiation optionally combined with one or more of a topical corticosteroid, tar, anthralin, emollient or moisturizer or ultraviolet A plus psoralen. Such additional treatments essentially would use known dosages and routes of administration, which are applied, e.g., within a month before, during or within a month after a treatment course with a formula 1 compound.","Other desirable modulation effects of the formula 1 compounds on cells or tissues include (1) inhibition of one or more of bone resorption or calcium release or gp80, gp130, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), osteoclast differentiation factor (RANKL\/ODF), RANKL\/ODF receptor, IL-6 or IL-6 receptor expression or biological activity in, e.g., bone loss or osteoporosis conditions or in osteoclasts, or in cancers such as metastatic breast cancer or metastatic lung cancer (e.g., with bone metastases), (2) inhibition of osteoclastogenesis or osteoclast development from progenitor cells, (3) enhancement of NFkB inhibition that is mediated by steroid receptors, e.g., enhanced inhibition of estrogen receptor-\u03b1 or estrogen receptor-\u03b2 mediated inhibition of NFkB in inflammation, rheumatoid arthritis or osteoporosis, (4) enhancement of osteoblastogenesis or osteoblast development from progenitor cells in, e.g., osteoporosis or other bone loss conditions, by, e.g., modulation or enhancement of the synthesis or biological activity of a transcription factor such as Cbfa1, RUNX2 or AML-3 (5) normalization of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function in conditions where there is dysregulation such as in chronic inflammatory diseases, chronic asthma or rheumatoid arthritis (increased cortisol to ACTH ratio), (6) modulation of ligand-gated ion channels in neurons in, e.g., depression, sleep or memory disorders, (8) modulation of G-protein coupled receptors in neurons in, e.g., depression, sleep or memory disorders, (9) modulation, e.g., induction, of the synthesis or biological activity of metabolic enzymes such as a cytochrome (e.g., CYP1A1, CYP2B1, CYP4A, CYP7A1, CYP7B1, P450 3A4, P450c17, P450scc, P450c21 or an isozyme or homolog of any of these) in cells or tissues such as liver cells, neurons, neuron precursor cells, brain, breast, testes or colon, (10) enhancement of collagen synthesis or levels in, e.g., skin in aging or skin damage from, e.g., trauma, thermal injury or solar radiation, (11) inhibition of nitric oxide production in cells or tissue, e.g., in nervous system tissue or in microglial cells in dementias such as Alzheimer's disease, (12) enhancing glucose-stimulated insulin synthesis in hyperglycemia or diabetes conditions, (13) modulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), dopamine or N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activity or levels in, e.g., brain tissue or neurons, (e.g., decreased GABA-mediated chloride currents or potentiation of neuronal response to NMDA in the hippocampus) in, e.g., conditions such as a dementia (Alzheimer's Disease), depression, anxiety, schizophrenia or memory loss due to, e.g., aging or another condition described herein, (14) modulating (e.g., enhancing) the expression or activity of a transcription factor(s), or a homolog(s) or isoform(s), such as SET, nerve growth factor inducible protein B, StF-IT, SF-1 in cells or tissues such as nerve cells, neuronal precursor cells or liver cells, (15) inhibition of eosinophil infiltration or reduction IgE levels in allergic responses or in lung or other tissue, (16) modulation, e.g., a decrease, in serum or blood of leptin levels in, e.g., obese subjects such as humans with a body mass index of about 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33 or greater, (17) increased corticotropin releasing hormone synthesis or activity in, e.g., elderly subjects such as humans at least about 60 years of age or at least about 70 years of age, (18) enhancement of memory or reduction of memory loss or disorientation in aging or dementias such as Alzheimer's Disease, (19) modulation, e.g., enhancement, of CAR\u03b2, RXR, PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b4 or PPAR\u03b3 levels or activity in conditions such as diabetes, obesity (e.g., a human with a body mass index of about 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33 or greater), glucose or lipid disorders (e.g., a hemostasis disorder or in elevated cholesterol, low density lipoprotein or triglyceride conditions), cancer (e.g., breast cancer), (20) enhancement of the synthesis or activity of one or more enzymes responsible for thermogenesis, e.g., liver glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase or malic enzyme, in subjects such as obese or diabetic humans, (21) modulation, e.g., reduction, of the synthesis or biological activity of the CXCR4 receptor or the CXCL12 chemokine in hyperproliferation conditions such as breast cancers or precancers, (22) modulation of the synthesis or biological activity of one or more of holocytochrome c, cytochrome c, second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase, Apaf-1, Bax, procaspase-9, caspase-9, procaspase-3, caspase-3, caspase-6 and caspase-7, e.g., enhanced translocation of these molecules from mitochondria to cytosol or activation of these molecules in the cytosol in cancer precancer cells, cancer cells or cells that mediate autoimmunity, (23) modulation of the synthesis or biological activity of one or more of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-1\u03b2 converting enzyme, IL-6, IL-8, caspase-4 and caspase-5, e.g., decreased activation of these molecules in injured cells or cells subject to injury from, e.g., ischemia or infarction (e.g., vascular, cardiac or cerebral), reperfusion of hypoxic cells or tissue or an inflammation condition such as rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, viral hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, or another inflammation condition disclosed herein, (24) decrease of the synthesis, biological activity or activation of one or more of phospholipase A2, caspase-1, caspase-3 and procaspase-3 in neurodegeneration disorders or dementias such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, or another neurological condition disclosed herein. The formula 1 compounds can thus be used where one or more of these conditions or their symptoms is present. Methods to measure the synthesis or biological activity of these molecules has been described, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,200,969, 6,187,767, 6,174,901, 6,110,691, 6,083,735, 6,024,940, 5,919,465 and 5,891,924.","The formula 1 compounds are believed to be effective in facilitating release of myeloperoxidase from granulated neutrophils. The enzyme generates free hydrogen peroxide. Some of the formula 1 compounds, e.g., compounds with a halogen such as bromine or iodine at, e.g., the 16 position, can be metabolized to provide a source of halogen. In cases where the halogen is released, the released halogen can react with hydrogen peroxide (HO) to generate hypohalogenous acid such as hypobromous acid (HOBr). Exemplary compounds include a halogenated formula 1 compound such as 16-bromoepiandrosterone. Alternatively, a halogen salt, e.g., KBr, NaBr, KI or NaI, can be administered to the subject to provide a source of halogen. The halogen source can be administered to a subject as a component in a formulation that comprises a formula 1 compound or it can be administered separately. Hypohalogenous acid is a potent antimicrobial agent, which may be effective in reducing pathogens in the circulatory system of subjects with a blood cell deficiency who also have a pathogen infection. Hypohalogenous acid that is generated in vivo would provide benefits to such subject as shown by, e.g., a reduced quantitative circulating viral or bacterial culture measurement, without the toxicity that is normally associated with its direct administration to a subject. Biological activities of white blood peroxidase enzymes have been described, see, e.g., M. Saran et al., 1999 26:482-490, W. Wu et al., 2000 105:1455-1463 and Z. Shen et al., 2000 39:5474-5482.","Numbered embodiments.

using BrEA and the formulations from example 1. Samples are taken at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 month time points and compared with the specifications listed in example 1. Real time stability (25\u00b0 C., 60% relative humidity) is conducted using BrEA formulation Lots 1 and 2, with sampling time points at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months. After 3 months of storage at 40\u00b0 C. and 75% relative humidity, the assay potency of BrEA is at least 95% of the label value. The results from the stability testing indicate that BrEA is stable for at least 3 months at elevated temperature and humidity in the Lot 1 and 2 formulations.","Pig-Tail Macaque monkeys infected with the SHIVretrovirus were treated with a BrEA formulation as described in example 1. SHIVis a recombinant retrovirus containing HIV and SIV sequences. J. Thompson et al., abstract #75, 16, Oct. 7-10, 1998, Atlanta, Ga., M. Agy et al., abstract #67, 16, Oct. 7-10, 1998, Atlanta, Ga. In monkeys, it establishes an aggressive infection that leads to severe symptoms of end-stage disease in infected untreated animals at about 180-210 days after infection. Four pig-tail macaques (2\/group) received subcutaneous injections of the formulation at 1 or 2 mg\/kg body weight for 10 consecutive days (Protocol 1). On week 8, 3 of the 4 monkeys were retreated and 2 treatment na\u00efve monkeys were treated with 5 mg\/kg of the formulation on an every other day basis for a period of 20 days (Protocol 2). On week 19, all primates receiving treatment began a 3 course treatment regimen with 3 mg\/kg the BrEA formulation once daily for 10 consecutive days, repeated every four weeks for a total of 3 treatment courses (Protocol 3).","The animals were infected with 1-100 TCIDunits administered intravenously or intrarectally. Viral titers in the first group of animals ranged from 10to 10before dosing began. All animals demonstrated an initial rise in plasma viral SHIV RNA. After a period of 2 to 3 weeks, titers began to decline and 3 of the 4 animals showed a response to therapy with average viral titers of 0.76 log below baseline at weeks 4 to 5 after initiation of treatment. By week 8, titers in all animals had returned to baseline values. Blood glucose levels dropped significantly, alkaline phosphatase levels were elevated and SGOT\/GGT values trended towards the high end of normal. No other significant changes were observed in any of the parameters monitored. The CD4 levels in all monkeys remained less than 100 cells\/mmat the end of the first protocol.","Three of the five monkeys on the second regimen (Protocol 2) responded to the BrEA therapy with a greater depth and duration of response than observed at the lower dose levels. In the responding animals, the average decline below baseline was 1.47 log. The non-responding animal from Protocol 1 responded when administered the BrEA formulation in Protocol 2. Two animals did not respond, one each from the treatment experienced and treatment na\u00efve groups. The third regimen (Protocol 3) is ongoing and animals are being monitored.","The monkeys on this study were salvaged from an infectivity study and the first cohort of four monkeys on study (Protocol 1) were expected to live only a few weeks past the initiation of these experiments as they were beginning to deteriorate due to disease related causes. One animal died at day 356 from a toxic reaction to the anesthetic used during acquisition of a blood sample for analysis. At the time of this application, the remaining monkeys are receiving multiple rounds of therapy appear to be in good clinical health. Their survival was greater than 380 days from the time of infection. Treatment by intermittent dosing of the BrEA formulation was used. Three control monkeys were infected with 1-10,000 SHIVTCIDunits and did not receive treatment. These animals are considered the no treatment arm of a survival study. The mean time to death for pig-tailed macaques infected with SHIVwas 193 days. Monkeys receiving therapy remained in good clinical health for over 350 days with CD4 levels less than 20 cells\/mmand without opportunistic infections or disease-related symptoms, other than a mild anemia in one animal.","These results show completely unexpected therapeutic responses by the primates infected with the SH IV retrovirus, which is quite virulent. The results show that the majority of subjects in these treatment protocols not only had significantly prolonged survival compared to untreated controls, but also the clinical symptoms associated with retroviral infection improved dramatically, despite the fact that CD4 counts remained low, i.e., less than about 100 CD4 cells\/mminitially and less than about 20 CD4 cells\/mmlater in the treatment protocols. To date, results such as this, i.e., (1) good clinical health in a majority of subjects having low CD4 levels (less than about 150 cells\/mm, especially less than about 75 cells\/mm) and (2) no clinical sign of viral resistance to treatment despite intermittent dosing over a prolonged time period, are unprecedented in primates, humans or any other animal. The SHIVmodel is extremely pathogenic in pig-tailed macaques. Events that occur in this model over several weeks would typically take several years in humans infected with HIV. Treatment of monkeys infected with this virus and treated with commonly used antiretrovirals, e.g., AZT, 3TC or a protease inhibitor, are not expected to significantly affect the course of disease progression. The clinical condition of the animals continues to improve, e.g., weight gain is about 8-15% per animal. These results show that the treatment using the intermittent dosing protocol is highly effective despite the apparent impairment of the subject's specific immunity, as shown by the low CD4 counts. Increased CD4 counts may be attained using immune stimulators such as IL2 or they may increase spontaneously in some subjects such as humans, depending on the treatment protocol, the duration of dosing or the subject's initial medical condition. The antiviral effects shown here appear to function at least in part by enhancing the subject's immune responses, e.g., enhanced immune response by phagocytic cells (NK cells, monocytes and\/or macrophages), and\/or enhancing any residual specific immune responses, if any, that the subject may be able to muster.","A dose escalation clinical trial is performed using a nonaqueous formulation containing BrEA or another formula 1 compound(s) that is prepared essentially as described in example 1. The patients are treatment na\u00efve or treatment experienced and about 3-10 patients are examined at each dose level. The initial dose is 25 mg of BrEA or another formula 1 compound(s) that is administered parenterally, e.g., s.c. or i.m. The dose is administered once or once or twice per day for 1-12 days, followed by no dosing for at least 7 days (e.g., 7 to 90 days). Subsequent doses are administered once or once per day for 1-12 days, followed by no dosing for at least 7 days (e.g., 7 to 90 days). Other dose levels tested are 20 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg, 250 mg and 300 mg with each dose administered once per day as a single dose or as two, three or more subdivided doses. An efficacy dosing trial is performed using the same dosing protocol as the dose escalation trial or it may alternatively comprise dosing once or twice every other day for 3-17 days, followed by no dosing for 7-90 days and then repeating the dosing once or twice every other day for 3-17 days. This protocol is repeated indefinitely (e.g., at least about 3-18 months) using the optimal dose(s) obtained from the dose escalation trial, e.g., about 10-200 mg\/day of a formula 1 compound.","Nonclinical studies were conducted using an oral and a subcutaneous formulation of BrEA. Rats were orally administered C BrEA solubilized in different excipients to determine the levels of drug in blood and various tissues. The results of these preliminary pharmacokinetics studies indicated that the absorption of BrEA by oral administration is about 0.1 to 15%, with at least about 80% excreted in the feces.","The nonaqueous BrEA formulation of example 1 was administered as a single subcutaneous dose to rabbits. More than 90% of the drug left the injection site within 24 hours of administration, and reached a maximum concentration in the plasma of about 1.2% of the injected dose at eight to twelve hours post administration. The circulating half-life of the drug in the plasma was about twelve hours. The drug did not accumulate to a significant extent in any major organ and was primarily excreted in the urine.","BrEA was administered subcutaneously to rats using the formulation of example 1. Approximately 90% of the drug left the injection site within 24 hours of administration, and reached a maximum concentration in the plasma of about 0.2% of the injected dose at one hour post administration. Elimination from the plasma was biphasic, with half-lives of about 12 and 72 hours respectively. BrEA did not accumulate to a significant extent in any major organ, and was excreted primarily in the feces. A study is also performed in Rhesus Monkeys with the example 1 formulation to determine plasma pharmacokinetics.","A pharmacokinetic analysis of C BrEA in plasma was conducted in two female Rhesus Monkeys. Trace labeled compound (16\u03b1-bromo-3-beta-hydroxy-5\u03b1-[4-C]-androstan-17-one [50 mCi\/mmole]) was used at a dose of 1 mg\/kg as a subcutaneous injection in the scapular region using an injection volume of 1 mL\/kg. The BrEA was formulated in 25% polyethylene glycol 300, 12.5% absolute ethanol, 5% benzyl benzoate, and qs with propylene glycol. 40 \u03bcCi were injected per animal. Blood samples were taken at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours for determination of C activity. The radioactivity in the plasma rose to near peak concentration in 8 hours and remained at approximately the same level through the end of the study at 24 hours.","A pharmacokinetic analysis of C BrEA was conducted in New Zealand White rabbits. Twenty \u03bcCi of C 16\u03b1-bromo-3-beta-hydroxy-5\u03b1-[4-C]-androstan-17-one (50 mCi\/mmole) plus 1 mg\/kg unlabeled BrEA was administered to each of three New Zealand White rabbits as a subcutaneous injection in the scapular region using an injection volume of 1 mL\/kg. The drug was formulated in 25% polyethylene glycol 300, 12.5% absolute ethanol, 5% benzyl benzoate, and qs with propylene glycol. Blood samples were taken at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 hours for all three animals, and at 48 hours for two of the animals. Twenty-four and 48 hours after administration, one and two animals respectively, were sacrificed, and the following organs\/tissues were collected: brain, heart, kidneys, liver, lungs, skeletal muscle, spleen, and injection site muscle and skin. In addition to the organs and tissues, urine and feces were collected as well as the cage wash. BrEA did not accumulate to a significant degree in any of the organs listed above. Of the organs, the greatest mass of drug was observed in the liver, containing approximately 0.8% and 0.12% of the injected dose at 24 and 48 hours, respectively (average 0.13%).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1013","num":"1162"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00010","num":"00010"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Percentage of Drug in Organs (Rabbits)"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Animal 201","Animal 301","Animal 302"]},{"entry":["Organ or Tissue","24 hours","48 hours","48 hours"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Brain","0.005","0.002","0"]},{"entry":["Heart","0.008","0.003","0.002"]},{"entry":["Kidneys","0.155","0.055","0.050"]},{"entry":["Liver","0.76","0.145","0.125"]},{"entry":["Lungs","0.029","0.019","0.011"]},{"entry":["Spleen","0.002","0","0"]},{"entry":["Skeletal muscle","0.002","0","0"]},{"entry":["(sample wt. in grams)","(3.8 g)","(6 g)","(5 g)"]},{"entry":["Skin","0.008","0.002","0.004"]},{"entry":["(sample wt. in grams)","\u2002\u2009(8 g)","(6 g)","(9 g)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The average percentages of the administered dose in whole blood was calculated by multiplying the concentration of drug in whole blood by the assumed volume of blood in the animals, 200 mL. The amount of drug in the blood reaches a maximum at around 8 hours, and a small amount was still evident at 48 hours. The amount of BrEA in whole blood was consistently lower than in plasma, suggesting the drug is not taken up to an appreciable extent by red blood cells.","In vivo experiments were conducted to determine the bioavailability of BrEA via oral administration using different formulations. BrEA was (1) solubilized in soya oil, vitamin E oil, a mixture of vitamin E and cremophore or (2) BrEA was micronized and combined with or without a surfactant. These formulations are described below. The formulations were administered orally to rats and BrEA levels were determined in the blood, liver, spleen, kidney, and the lymph nodes. In the studies using micronized BrEA, the brain was evaluated for drug uptake. Twenty-four hour urine and feces were collected when BrEA was solubilized in vitamin E and soya oils and vitamin E mixed with Cremophore. The data from these studies indicate that BrEA enters into the lymphatics but is eliminated rapidly from the other tissues. The amount of C radioactivity recovered in the feces 24 hours after administration was 78 to 83%. A brief summary of each experiment is provided below and the results are provided in Table 6.","BrEA (5 mg in 1.0 mL of soya oil or vitamin E oil) supplemented with 140-labelled BrEA was administered intragastrically to rats. Solubilization of BrEA in the vitamin E or soya oil was facilitated with 50 \u03bcL ethanol. Animals (3\/time point) were assayed at 1.5, 3, 5.5, and 24 hours after administration and the C-radioactivity was measured in the blood, liver, spleen, kidney, lymph nodes and 24 hour feces and urine. The results indicate that, on the basis of C-radioactivity, some of the BrEA is taken into the lymphatic system. The uptake is greater with soya oil than vitamin E oil in the blood, liver, and lymph nodes.","BrEA (5 mg in 1.0 mL of a vitamin E and cremophore) supplemented with C-labelled BrEA was administered intragastrically to rats. Solubilization of BrEA in the vitamin E-cremophore mixture was facilitated by the adding 60 \u03bcL ethanol. Animals (4\/time point) were sacrificed at 2, 3, 5.5, and 24 hours and C-radioactivity was measured in the blood, liver, spleen, kidney, lymph nodes and 24 hour feces and urine. The results indicate that a small portion of the drug is taken up by the lymphatic system. Judging from the values in plasma, liver and lymph nodes, it appears that drug uptake is slower compared with soy oil or vitamin E and its presence in the tissues is more persistent.","Rats, in groups of three males, were orally administered 1.0 mL of 0.9% NaCl containing 10 or 32 mg BrEA micronized with a surfactant, Synperonic PE\/F 127 (2.5% wt\/wt). Rats were examined at 1.5, 5 and 24 hours after administration. Blood, liver, spleen, kidney, lymph nodes, and brain were assayed for C radioactivity. The levels of BrEA in the blood, in comparison to the experiments with BrEA in Vitamin E oil and soya, were higher, 0.3% at 1.5 hours, and increased after 5 hours to 0.8% and 0.9% of the 10 and 32 mg dose, respectively. Additionally, the values in the lymph nodes were similar to those measured at 1.5 hours and the levels were sustained at 5 hours (5.3 and 5.0%) and 24 hours (3.7 and 3.1%) for the 10 and 32 mg dose, respectively (refer to Table 6).","In a repeated dose experiment, rats were intragastrically administered 1.0 mL 0.9% NaCl containing 2 mg BrEA micronized with Synperonic PE\/F 127 (2.5% wt\/wt) every 6 to 16 hours. Rats (3\/time point) were sacrificed at 40, 72, 84, 90 and 96 hours after the first administration. Blood, liver, spleen, kidney and lymph nodes were assayed for C radioactivity. Higher levels in the blood, liver, kidneys and lymph nodes were noted in this experiment over previous studies.","Rats, in groups of three males, were orally administered 1.0 mL of 0.9% NaCl containing 2, 4 or 10 mg BrEA micronized without a surfactant. Rats were sacrificed at 1.5, 5 and 24 hours after administration and blood, liver, spleen, kidney, lymph nodes and brain were assayed for C radioactivity. The concentration of BrEA micronized without a surfactant in the observed tissues was lower than BrEA plus a surfactant.","For in vitro antimalarial testing, micro-titer plates were used. The concentration of drugs were prepared as pMol\/well according to WHO standard procedures (WHO, 1990). The test compound was dissolved in 15% DMSO in sterile RPMI-1640. Both chloroquine sensitive (e.g., WS\/97) and resistant (e.g., MN\/97) isolates of species are used.","A schizont inhibition assay was performed as follows.

The test consists of the inoculation of parasitised erythrocytes on the first day of the experiment (D), followed by an injection of the test compound, which is also administered on the 2, 3and 4days of the protocol. On the 5day, blood films are taken and antimalarial activity is assessed either by calculating parasitemia, or by scoring parasite numbers on a predetermined scale (i.e., 1-5).

HP15 ANKA parasites were collected by cardiac puncture using a heparinised syringe from a donor mouse having a 30+% parasitaemia. The blood was diluted with diluting agent (50% HIFCS+50% sterile PBS) to a final concentration of 1% parasitaemia or 1\u00d710infected erythrocytes per 0.2 mL of the infecting suspension. Each mouse was inoculated intravenously, which produced a more uniform infection rate than intraperitoneal administration of 0.2 mL of the infecting suspension.

Blood was collected aseptically and transferred to 10 mL syringes containing 2 mL of acid citrate dextrose (ACD) for in vitro culture. Prior to incubation, the plasma was separated from the red blood cells and the red blood cells were washed twice. Parasites were cultured by modification of standard in vitro culture techniques (W. Trager and J. B. Jensen, 193:673-675, 1976; A. M. Oduola et al., 39: 605-608, 1992). Samples were dispensed into sterile centrifuge cubes within 10 min of collection and spun down. The supernatant plasma was stored while the packed cells were washed twice with culture medium (washing medium, RPMI-1640 medium, containing 25 mM HEPES buffer and 25 mmol\/L NaOH). The buffy coat was removed by vacuum aspiration. A 1:10 fold dilution was done for each blood sample with complete washing medium [CMP (washing medium supplemented with 10% human plasma)]. One milliliter each of the sample was transferred into 2 wells of a 24 well micro culture plate. Cultures were incubated at 37 degrees C. in an atmosphere of 5% CO, 5% Oand 90% Npremixed gas. The culture medium was changed daily and thin blood smears were prepared for microscopy at 24 and 48 h after the culture has been set up.

During the in vivo study, thin and thick blood films were fixed with dehydrated methanol (100%) and heat, respectively, were stained with 10% Giemsa for 20 min. Parasitemia was quantified in thin films by counting 2000 red blood cells in clear contiguous fields and finding the proportion that was parasitized. In thick films, parasitemia was quantified by counting parasites against leukocytes. A film was declared negative if no parasites were found after examination of 200 microscope fields of a thick smear. During in vitro and ex vivo study, pretreatment thin and thick smears were, graded for ring stages by the method of Jiang as modified by Li et al. (J. B. Jiang et al, 2(8293): 285-288, 1982; K. Silamut and N.J. White 87: 436-443, 1993; X. L. Li et al, Chi. 12: 296, 1994). Approximately 5000 erythrocytes were counted in clear contiguous fields 24 and 48 h after incubation of blood obtained at each time point and graded for maturity into tiny rings, small rings, large rings, pigmented trophozoites and schizonts. Functional viability was estimated as the percentage of asexual ring forms capable of maturing to pigmented trophozoites or schizonts after 24-48 h of in vitro culture (W. M. Watkins et al., 87: 75-78, 1993).","Calculation of parameters. The patients presented with acute symptomatic severe non-cerebral pure malaria.

Since glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (\u201cG6PD\u201d) is the limiting enzyme of the PPS, PPS flux measurement is considered to better reflect G6PD activity in the whole cell compared to G6PD activity measurement in a cell lysate. G6PD activity measured in a cell lysate is typically about 1100-fold higher than the PPS flux in whole resting unstimulated RBC (G6PD activity in cell lysate: 165; PPS flux 0.142 micromoles\/hour\/ml RBC). PPS flux and G6PD activity in the whole RBC depends on a number of factors (the concentration of NADPH, NAD, and ATP, and intracellular pH), which are kept constant if the measurement is performed in the lysate and may vary in the whole RBC. Levels of G6PD activity in cells is considerably above normal basal needs and inhibition of overall G6PD activity might have no or minor consequence on PPS flux in the whole cell. For example, RBC with the Mediterranean G6PD mutant with about 1-3 percent residual activity compared with normal individuals have no impairment in basal PPS flux, but show impaired flux when flux through PPS is stimulated by methylene blue addition. A series of experiments were performed using varying amounts of BrEA and PPS flux was measured in unstimulated basal RBC and in methylene-blue (MB)-stimulated RBC.","The data below shows PPS flux (micromoles\/hour\/ml RBC) in basal unstimulated, and MB-stimulated normal RBC.

On average, at least 90% of the monocytes phagocytose PE, as assessed by microscopic inspection. Control cells are kept under similar conditions without phagocytosis. Quantitative assessment of phagocytosis is performed by a previously described bioluminescence method (E. Schwarzer, et al., 1994 88: 740-745).","Erythrocyte treatments and parasite cultures are as follows. Fresh blood (Rh+) is used to isolate erythrocytes (RBC). Washed RBC are infected with schizont\/trophozoite parasite stages (Palo Alto strain, mycoplasma-free). Stage specific parasites are isolated by the Percoll-mannitol method. Briefly, normal schizont-stage parasitized RBC(SPE) separated on Percoll-mannitol gradient (parasitemia >95% SPE) are mixed with RBC suspended in growth medium (RPMI 1640 medium containing 25 mmol\/L Hepes, 20 mmol\/L glucose, 2 mmol\/L glutamine, 24 mmol\/L NaHCO, 32 mg\/L gentamicin and 10% AB or A human serum, pH 7.30) to start synchronous cultures at selected hematocrit values. The inoculum parasitemia is adjusted to 20% normal SPE for isolation of ring parasitized RBC (RPE) and to 5% normal SPE for isolation of trophozoite-stage parasitized RBC (TPE). At 14-18 hours after inoculum parasites are at ring-stage in the first cycle; at 34-33 hours, parasites are at trophozoite-stage in the first cycle; and at 40-44 hours after inoculum parasites are at schizont-stage in the first cycle. RPE, TPE and SPE are separated on Percoll-mannitol gradients. The parasitemia is usually 8-10% RPE, and >95% TPE. Nonparasitized and parasitized RBC are counted electronically. To assess total parasitemia and relative contribution of RPE, TPE and SPE, slides are prepared from cultures at indicated times, stained with Diff-Quik\u2122 parasite stain and about 400-1000 cells are examined microscopically.","The effect of a formula 1 compound such as BrEA in parasitized RBC is examined using various concentrations of the compound, e.g., BrEA, e.g., 0.5 \u03bcM, 1 \u03bcM, 10 \u03bcM, 25 \u03bcM and 50 \u03bcM. Trophozoite-parasitized RBC, schizont-parasitized RBC or ring-parasitized RBC are examined as described.","The clinical trial protocol that incorporates about 15-20 patients is established. For a phase I, I\/II or II trial, the patients are mildly infected with one or more parasites and they are mildly symptomatic (less than about 8-10% parasitemia of RBC). Before treatment, the patients are optionally tested for infection with HIV, HCV, TB, and . Patients with one or more co-infections are given standard care for the coinfection. The patients are hospitalized for treatment for one week. Two or more dose groups, e.g., 25, 50 or 100 mg\/day of BrEA administered parenterally, e.g., by intramuscular, subcutaneous or intravenous injection, on 3, 4 or 5 days of the week when patients are dosed. Dosing is on consecutive days or on an intermittent schedule, e.g., 2, 3 or 4 doses with one dose administered every other day.","The formulation containing BrEA is as described herein, e.g., the formulation of example 1 or a formulation that comprises 100 mg\/mL BrEA, PEG300-30% v\/v, propylene glycol 30% v\/v, benzyl benzoate 30% v\/v and benzyl alcohol 2% v\/v. At day 5-7, if less than about 50% reduction in parasitemia is observed, the patients are given standard care for malaria (mefloquine). During the week of treatment and for 1, 2 3, or more weeks there after, blood samples are taken periodically for evaluation of parasitemia, pharmacokinetics, plasma cytokines (e.g., IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IGF1, \u03b3IFN, GM-CSF), and intracellular cytokines (e.g., IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IGF1, \u03b3IFN, GM-CSF). The patients are optionally treated again at about 2 to 12 weeks after the initial dosing, using the same or a similar protocol as that used in the initial dosing protocol.","An exemplary open-label study of a BrEA formulation administered intramuscularly to semi-immune patients with uncomplicated malaria is conducted. The formulation comprises 100 mg\/mL BrEA, PEG300-30% v\/v, propylene glycol 30% v\/v, benzyl benzoate 30% v\/v and benzyl alcohol 2%. Patients will remain at the hospital as in-patients for the first 7 days of the study. Patients will receive one daily intramuscular administration of 50 mg or 100 mg of BrEA for 5 consecutive days. Daily evaluation for the first 7 days, and up to study day 14, may include parasitemia evaluation (twice daily), chemistry, hematology and drug levels (pharmacokinetic evaluation). If, after study day 7, the parasitemia levels decrease from the screening value and the patient is clinically stable, the patient may be followed on a daily basis for parasitemia (twice daily) for up to an additional 7 days as hospital in-patients. If a patient becomes clinically unstable at any time during the study, the patient will be discontinued and may be offered the standard treatment for malaria. Patients deficient in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase enzyme may be excluded, since BrEA inhibits the enzyme. Other considerations that may lead to exclusion of patients from the trial include patients diagnosed with any of the following: severe anemia (hematocrit <21% or hemoglobin <7 g\/dL); renal or liver failure by history and\/or laboratory results respiratory distress as evidenced by dyspnea or respiratory rate 30 per minute; hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg); tachycardia (heart rate >130 beats\/minute); pregnant or breast-feeding women; significant active co-morbid illness (acute medical diagnosis requiring specific therapy; patients with parasitemia >10% on peripheral smear.","Blood samples may be collected from each patient for future clinical evaluation such as the determination of activation markers or immunological analyses (e.g., assay for intracellular or extracellular interleukins IL-1p, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-12, \u03b3IFN and TNF\u03b1).","Liposomes suitable for parenteral administration are prepared as follows. 400 mg of phosphatidyl choline and 80 mg of BrEA are dissolved in chloroform and methanol (2:1 v\/v) and the solution is dried by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure. The resulting film is rehydrated by adding 8.0 mL of a 0.9% w\/v NaCl solution and agitating the solution. The sizes of the liposomes are optionally measured, e.g., by photon correlation spectroscopy (Malvern Zetasizer 3000 or equivalent). The liposomes are optionally sized by, e.g., sonication to reduce the average size below 400 nm, or by filtration using suitable filters. Similar procedures are used to prepare liposome preparations that contain a formula 1 compound at about 15-100 mg\/mL. The formulation is used to deliver the compound orally or parenterally (I.M., S.C., I.V.).","A cyclodextrin formulation containing BrEA is prepared as follows. 450 g of hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin is added to about 1 L of ethanol and the mixture is stirred for about 4-24 hours, until a clear solution is obtained. Non-micronized or micronized BrEA is added to give a concentration of 20 mg\/mL and the mixture is stirred until a clear solution is obtained. The solution is dried, e.g., by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure. The dried material is added to 1 L of physiological saline and stirred until a clear solution is obtained. The solution is sterilized by filtration using a 0.2 \u03bcm pore size filter and dispensed into sterile containers. Similar procedures are used to prepare cyclodextrin formulations that contain a formula 1 compound at about 10-100 mg\/mL. The formulation is used to deliver the compound orally, parenterally (I.M., S.C., I.V.) or by a buccal or sublingual route.","A suppository formulation containing a formula 1 compound such as BrEA is prepared as follows. Sufficient non-micronized BrEA is measured to obtain a desired number of units that comprise 500 mg each of BrEA. The BrEA is blended with a suppository base, e.g., triglyceride from edible vegetable oil, to provide desired characteristics, e.g., a free fatty acid content of about 0.1% w\/w, a saponification value of about 242, an iodine value of about 3, moisture at about 0.1% w\/w and a closed capillary melting point of about 35\u00b0 C.","A female patient infected with HIV and HCV was dosed I.V. with BrEA for 3 consecutive days using a formulation that contained 20 mg\/mL BrEA in 45% w\/v hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin and saline. Four mL of the formulation (80 mg BrEA) was administered to the patient every 4 hours during the 3 day treatment period. The patient's predosing HCV level was 6.5 Logas measured by PCR and the HCV level was 6.2 Logon the first day of dosing, 5.5 Logon the 3day of dosing and 4.9 Logthree days after the last dose was administered. HIV RNA levels as measured by PCR was 5.2 Log(predosing), 5.8 Log(first day), 5.9 Log(third day) and 5.4 Log(day 6). The NK cell counts (cells\/mm) were 28, 41 and 38 at predosing, day 0 and day 3.","A formulation comprising 100 mg\/mL BrEA, \u02dc30% v\/v PEG300, 30% v\/v propylene glycol, 30% v\/v benzyl benzoate and 2% v\/v benzyl alcohol was prepared by suspending BrEA in polyethylene glycol 300, and sequentially adding propylene glycol and benzyl benzoate, to form a solution, which was diluted to the final desired volume with additional propylene glycol. The procedure is described below.","The calculated amount of polyethylene glycol 300 was added to a compounding vessel. Then, while mixing, the calculated amount of BrEA was added to the vessel, and mixed for at least 5 minutes to form a smooth, creamy liquid propylene glycol was added to the vessel, and mixed for a minimum of 5 minutes to form a uniform suspension. The calculated amount of benzyl benzoate is added to the vessel, and mixed for approximately 5 minutes to form a translucent liquid suspension. Propylene glycol was then added to achieve the desired final formulation, and mixed for approximately 5 minutes. The drug solution was transferred to a volume dispensing device set to deliver 1.2 mL per vial. Under nitrogen pressure, the solution was filtered through two 0.2 \u03bcm polyvinylidene fluoride filters in series into 2 cc amber glass vials. The vials were capped with Teflon-coated, butyl-rubber stoppers and crimp sealed.","A double blind, randomized, placebo controlled study of 100 mg of BrEA administered intramuscularly to late stage HIV-infected patients at risk for opportunistic infections (OIs). HIV-1 seropositive patients with a CD4 cell count 100 cells\/mm, HIV RNA at 1\u00d710copies\/mL and a Karnofsky score of at least 60 are identified for potential inclusion into the protocol. Patients in all clinical protocols must understand and sign a written informed consent form prior to screening evaluations.","BrEA in the formulation of example 16 is used. Administration of drug or vehicle will be for 3 to 5 consecutive days followed by about 35-90 days of observation, e.g., 37 days of observation. An exemplary treatment regimen comprises 5 days of treatment followed by 37 days of observation, which is repeated for a total of 7 courses over 42 weeks. The incidence rate of OIs as well as the time to resolution or control of the OIs will be monitored and compared to a placebo control group. The patients may be monitored monthly for 2 or 3 months after completion of the study for follow-up. The incidence of OIs or conditions associated with AIDS are monitored, e.g., as tuberculosis (TB), candadiasis, pneumonia (PCP), diarrhea, or Kaposi's sarcoma, may be evaluated as protocol endpoints. If a patient is diagnosed with one or more of the protocol specified opportunistic infections, the protocol regimen a treatment for the OI will be initiated, e.g., Fluconazole for Candidiasis or for PCP, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole or Dapsone. A similar protocol is used with other formula 1 compounds.","Patients infected with HIV are dosed with an i.m. injection of 25-200 mg of BrEA using a formulation containing 100 mg\/mL BrEA, PEG300-30% v\/v, propylene glycol 30% v\/v, benzyl benzoate 30% v\/v and benzyl alcohol 2% v\/v. The patients are dosed once per day for 5 consecutive days followed by a period of about 28 days or longer with no BrEA treatment. The patients were them provided with one more course of 5 consecutive days of dosing with BrEA, followed by a non-dosing period of at least about 28 days. Up to 8 rounds of 5-day treatments, followed by at least 28 days of no dosing were provided. Immunological responses were then assayed using blood or plasma samples from the patients by flow cytometry and other known analytical methods. Immune cell subsets or other measured markers were assayed within 24 hours of obtaining the sample from each patient. Labeled antibodies, e.g., anti-CD antigen antibodies conjugated with fluorescent dyes (FITC, phycoerythrin, allophycocyanin or PerCP), were prepared and used essentially according to standard protocols using commercially available reagents, see, e.g., PharMingen, 1998 Research Products Catalog, technical protocols at pages 732-774, human cell surface molecules at pages 182-295 and mouse, rat and hamster cell surface molecules at pages 2-173 and cytokine and chemokine reagents at pages 344-489.","Otherwise untreated patients with CD4 counts of \u2267200\/\u03bcL and HIV-1 viral RNA between 5,000 and 1,000,000 copies\/mL (branched-DNA, version 3.0, Bayer, Tarrytown, N.Y.) provided informed consent and were enrolled into a Phase I\/II dose-escalation study of the safety and efficacy of intramuscular injections of BrEA. The protocol was conducted in South Africa. In the first cohort, four patients received an initial injection of 1 mL (50 mg), followed by a safety and pharmocokinetic study for seven days, and then received five daily injections of 1 mL (50 mg). The second cohort of 8 patients was randomized in a 1:2 ratio to receive either 50 mg (1 mL) or 100 mg (2 mL) on the same schedule. Patients were allowed at the discretion of the investigators to receive up to three additional courses each, repeated after 28 days of observation. The protocol was amended to introduce an improved formulation, and to extend the initial pharmacokinetic and safety period to 14 days, the observation period following the five daily doses to 35 days, and to allow up to 7 treatment courses. A third cohort of 24 patients was randomized in a 1:2:4 ratio to receive either 50 mg (0.5 mL), 100 mg (1 mL), or 200 mg (2 mL) of BrEA. The patients were all male, since initial safety studies are not permitted in females in South Africa. Within the group of 39 patients randomized, the ethnic demographic included was 18 Caucasian, 17 African, and 4 other. The average age was 34 (range 20-63), the average initial CD4\/4 was 434 (range 176-1210), and the average viral load was 13,772 copies\/mL (range 3,020-158,489). Patients underwent physical examinations and provided samples for chemistry, hematology, virology and immunology testing approximately every two weeks.","The clinical protocol is a phase I\/II, open-label, randomized study of 3 dose levels of BrEA administered intramuscularly to HIV-infected patients who are treatment na\u00efve. There will be 3 treatment groups and each group will consist of 2 parts (Parts A and B). Patients will receive the same dosage of BrEA throughout Parts A and B of the study. If a patient experiences an antiviral response (an HIV RNA titer at least 0.5 log below the average of the screening and baseline values) or benefits (any decrease in HIV RNA titers below the average of the screening and baseline values) from the treatment received during Parts A and B of the study, the patient may continue receiving 5-day treatment courses of the BrEA formulation of example 2 at the dose initially received. This treatment course may be repeated up to six times.","All patients may be monitored for levels of HIV RNA (Chiron Quantiplex\u2122 branched chain DNA assay), T-cell subsets [CD4\/CD8], proviral HIV DNA (PBMC), interleukins [IL-2,4,6,8, 10, and 12] (serum), \u03b3IFN (serum), insulin-like growth factor [IGF-1] (serum) and tumor necrosis factor [TNF] (serum) throughout the study. PBMC quantitative co-culture (cells) may be conducted on a subset of patient samples. Assays for additional activation markers may be conducted. Analysis of chemistry and hematology panels and urinalysis is planned. Additionally, patients co-infected with hepatitis B and\/or C viruses, malaria or tuberculosis may be monitored regularly for viral titers or microbiological cultures. Serial blood and urine samples will be collected from a subset of patients for pharmacokinetic determination after the first dose on Part A and the last dose on Part B.","Treatment may consist of more than one intramuscular injection. Intramuscular injections may be administered in different locations (i.e., left or right upper arms or thighs or buttocks) and a single 100 mg or 200 mg dose of BrEA may be delivered to patients in two or more subdoses of less than 100 mg (e.g., 50 mg).","There are two segments of this study, Segment 1 and 2. Both segments consist of two parts, Part A and Part B. The first 12 patients enrolled on the study will be assigned to the design described in Segment 1. The remaining 24 patients will be assigned to Segment 2 of the study. The design of each segment is provided below.","Part A will consist of a single intramuscular injection of a BrEA formulation. The day the patient receives the injection will be study day 1. Patients participating in the pharmacokinetic subgroup will have serial blood and urine samples collected, beginning on study day 1. Part B of the study begins on study day 8 (Segment 1) or study day 15 (Segment 2).","Segment 1 Part B consists of 5 consecutive daily intramuscular injections of the formulation of example 1 at the same dose as received in Part A of the study. The day the patient receives the first dose will be on about study day 8-12. The 5-day treatment course is followed by an approximate 28-day observation period (or approximately 32 days from a first dose on day 8 to the initiation of a second treatment course on day 40). During the observation period, patients will be asked to return to the clinic on a weekly basis for various tests. Patients participating in the pharmacokinetic subgroup will have serial blood and urine samples collected, beginning approximately on study day 12-17.","Segment 2 Part B consists of 5 consecutive daily intramuscular injections of the formulation of example 2 at the same dose the patient received during Part A of the study. The day the patient receives the first dose will be about at study day 15. The 5-day treatment course is followed by an approximate 45 day observation period (or approximately 49 days from the first dose on study day 15 to the initiation of the next treatment course on study day 64). During the observation period, patients will be asked to return to the clinic on a weekly basis for various tests. Patients participating in the pharmacokinetic subgroup will have serial blood and urine samples collected, beginning approximately on study day 19.","Randomization in this dose escalation study is as follows. When 4 of the 12 patients per treatment group have completed 5 days of daily dosing on Part B and have not experienced a serious drug-related adverse event, enrollment into the next higher dose level will occur, after consultation between the sponsor and investigators.","The first four patients enrolled will be assigned to the 50 mg dose group. If no serious drug-related adverse events are experienced, the next 8 subjects will be randomized to either the 50 mg or 100 mg dose level in a 1:1 fashion. If no serious drug-related adverse events occur in patients receiving 100 mg, then the next 24 patients will be randomized to either the 50, 100, or 200 mg dose group in a 1:2:3 fashion.","If 4 of the 12 patients in a dose group experiences a serious drug-related event (Grade III or IV), 2 additional patients will be enrolled at the same dose level. Additionally, patient enrollment on to the next dose level, if enrolling, will be temporarily on hold until safety is assessed. If one of the 2 additional patients experiences a serious drug-related event, dosing in this dose level will discontinue. Upon consultation with the sponsor and investigators, additional patients may be enrolled at a dose between the dose-limiting group and the next lower dose group to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Enrollment of additional patients at a specific dose level will be determined in a protocol amendment.","The results indicated that a single 50 mg or 100 mg dose of BrEA increased the numbers of activated CD8 and CD4 T cells (e.g., CD8, CD69, CD25 cells) that were circulating in the patient's blood. Also, the circulating numbers of dendritic precursor cells, NK cells, LAK cells and cells that mediate ADCC (antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity mediated by the CD8, CD16 immune cell subset) functions were increased. Further increases were usually observed on dosing for 5 consecutive days.","Some of the results are summarized below. Course 1, 2 and 3 refer to each 5 consecutive day treatment regimen of one daily injection with BrEA (50 or 100 mg BrEA per injection). The formulation contained 100 mg\/mL BrEA, PEG300 \u02dc30% v\/v, propylene glycol 30% v\/v, benzyl benzoate 30% v\/v and benzyl alcohol 2% v\/v. The data shown below was obtained from patient blood samples at baseline (on the day dosing was initiated) and at various times after the patients received at least one dose of BrEA. The results showed significant increases in immune cell populations and cytokine expression profiles associated with Th1 responses. The patients in this protocol initially had CD4 counts of at least 200 per mmand a serum HIV RNA load of 5,000 to 1\u00d710RNA copies\/mL. After dosing with one course of BrEA (5 consecutive daily i.m. injections), all patients showed increases in levels of immune cells including activated CD8 T cells (e.g., CD8, CD69, CD25), LAK cells (e.g., CD8, CD16, CD38), NK cells (e.g., CD8, CD16), ADCC cells (e.g., CD8, CD16) and dendritic cells (Lin, HLA-DR, CD11c or Lin, HLA-DR, CD123). Average CD4 IL-10 production dropped from a median of 66% to 4% of the cells, while CD4 IFN\u03b3 went from a median of 8% to 63%, leading to a Th2 to a Th1 shift in cytokine production.","In the tables below, baseline data is indicated by \u201cBL\u201d or by \u201cpre\u201d.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1087","num":"1236"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00022","num":"00022"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Increased immunophenotypes after BrEA therapy"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Phenotype","Baseline","Course 1","Course 2","Course 3"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["CD8+CD69+CD25\u2212","18","54","56","75"]},{"entry":["n =","(13)","(13)","(9)","(4)"]},{"entry":[{"sup":"b"},{},"<0.001","<0.001","0.04"]},{"entry":["CD8+CD16+CD38+","8","27","28","25"]},{"entry":["n =","(10)","(10)","(4)","(4)"]},{"entry":["p =",{},"<0.001","0.047","0.02"]},{"entry":["CD8\u2212CD16+","53","253","288","249"]},{"entry":["n =","(12)","(12)","(4)","(2)"]},{"entry":["p =",{},"<0.001","0.02","0.04"]},{"entry":"Lin\u2212 HLA-DR+"},{"entry":["CD11c+\/CD123+","3.2","17.7","11.4","14.7"]},{"entry":["n =","(10)","(10)","(5)","(4)"]},{"entry":["p =",{},"<0.001","0.02","0.04"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"left","id":"FOO-00005"},"sup":"a"}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"left","id":"FOO-00006"},"sup":"b"}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"left","id":"FOO-00007"},"sup":["c","nd "]}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"left","id":"FOO-00008"},"sup":"d"}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"left","id":"FOO-00009"},"sup":"e"}}]}}]}}},"Median activated T cells (CD8 CD69 CD25 cells), LAK cells (CD8 CD16CD38), NK (ADCC responders) cells (CD8 CD16), dendritic cells (Lin HLA-DRCD123\/CD11), and cells that mediate Th1 immune responses (IFN\u03b3 white blood cells) compared to baseline cell counts for 3 16\u03b1-bromoepiandrosterone treatments or treatment courses in the HIV-infected patients gave the following results.

mediate cytotoxic immune responses and Th1 immune responses.","Treatment of HIV infected patients normalized their IL-10 producing CD4 T cells. In the same patients, 16\u03b1-bromoepiandrosterone was shown to enhance the proportion of CD4 T cells that express detectable IFN\u03b3. CD4 IL-10 IFN\u03b3 T cells mediate Th1 responses. These results show that the compound reduced the Th2 component of the immune system and enhanced the Th1 component.","The results given above are a preliminary analysis based on data obtained from 13 patients. Additional data was obtained for the patients as follows.","CD4 counts were assessed using a FACScount (BDIS), and viral loads were measured using the bDNA assay (Bayer). Quality assurance procedures were adhered to and internal and external controls were used to validate each batch of samples. On some occasions plasma viral loads were performed on batched samples between cycles of dosing.","Whole blood was labeled with a cocktail of four monoclonal antibodies (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, BDIS, San Jose, Calif.) per cell subset using allophycocyanin, phycoerytherin, PerCP and FITC conjugates to measure surface phenotypes using a FACSCalibur (BDIS). In addition, four-color immunofluorescent analysis of blood cells was performed on the same schedule. The four color panels consisted of APC, PerCP, FITC, and PE reagents respectively in the following combinations: memory\/na\u00efve T cells (CD3\/CD8\/CD45RA\/CD62L, CD3\/CD4\/CD45RA\/CD62L), T cell activation (CD3\/CD8\/CD69\/CD25, CD3\/CD4\/CD69\/CD25, CD3\/CD8\/HLA-DR\/CD38, CD3\/CD4\/HLA-DR, CD38), B cell, LAK and NK (CD19\/CD8\/CD16\/CD38) and dendritic cells (CD11c\/HLA-DR\/lineage markers CD3, CD16, CD14, CD19, CD56\/CD123). Listmode data (25,000 to 50,000 events) were analyzed using FCS Express (De Novo Software, Thornhill, Ontario, Canada). CD3 cell subsets were identified by serial gating of (1) nucleated cells, (2) lymphocyte\/lymphoblastoid cells, and (3) CD3 cells, followed by the gating of the subset of interest. For example, the absolute frequency per \u03bcL of any CD4 cell subset (S) was estimated by the equation: S=(proportion of CD4 cells) X (CD4 cell frequency per \u03bcL).","The CD4 cell frequency was determined using the FACSCount test. The absolute frequency of a CD8 cell subset was calculated in a similar fashion. The absolute white blood cell (WBC) count was determined using an automated cell counter (Advia 120, Bayer, Tarrytown, N.Y.). The nucleated cell region was defined using a forward versus orthogonal scatter plot. The absolute frequency per \u03bcL of CD3 Natural Killer or Dendritic Cell subsets (F) was estimated by the equation: F=(proportion of nucleated cells) X (absolute WBC count per \u03bcL).","Statistical analysis of changes in surface phenotypes, hematological, and viral parameters were performed by calculating the area under the curve (AUC) of the percentage difference from baselines (phenotype), percentage difference from the mean of screen and baseline values (hematology), or logchange from the mean of screen and baseline values (plasma viral RNA) for individual patients. AUC were calculated using the actual number of days between analysis visits for each patient. Because patients were on study for varying periods of time, this value was normalized to the time-averaged AUC by dividing by the number of days of observation. The Student's t-test was then used to analyze the difference from zero for the AUCs from all patients with data available for each parameter. A significant increase in the AUC for the entire 5-month period was interpreted as a nonrandom change in the given parameter.","Changes occurred soon after the intermittent dosing for a number of the measurements, and patients showed variability in the kinetics of immunologic, hematologic and virologic responses. For these reasons, the time-averaged AUC values for the 5-month period underestimate the magnitude of the individual responses. Maximal individual patient responses were calculated as the mean of the maximal percentage changes from baselines for individual patients at any analysis visit after dosing.","To investigate the kinetics of the responses for the entire population related to the time after dosing, the maximum analysis visit responses were calculated as the average of the maxima of the mean percentage changes from baselines for each analysis visit. Due to the altered BrEA administration interval for cohort 3, the analysis visits were aligned relative to the last dosing visit.","BrEA treatment of the HIV infected patients caused changes in T cell and dendritic cell phenotypes that persisted for weeks after intermittent dosing was discontinued. Increases were observed after dosing in both the total activated and early activated stage CD8 T cells as well as in circulating total dendritic cells consisting of both the CD11c and the CD123 phenotypes. The significant increases observed in the AUC analyses over the entire 5-month intermittent dosing period indicate that these changes are not random fluctuations. Although activation of CD8 cells is linked with disease progression, intact dendritic cell function and activation of CD8 T cells is also requisite for stimulation of CTL, both for specific anti-HIV-1 responses, as well as for anti-opportunistic infection responses. In HIV infection there is a progressive decrease in circulating CD4 T cells, an increase in circulating CD8 T cells, and a decrease in the CD4\/CD8 ratio. In this study, the decreases in both circulating CD4 and CD8 T cells with no change in the CD4:CD8 ratio may indicate that activated T cells are trafficking to sites of infection in the lymph nodes and mucosal tissue.","In this study, there was no overall decrease in viral load after three 5-day courses of intermittent dosing over a period of 153 days. It is possible that a CTL-driven elimination of HIV-1 infected cells with long-term effects on viral levels may result from continued dosing or from adjustments in the route of administration or the dose-schedule.","Treatment with BrEA resulted in significant changes in hematology parameters in the patients including increased circulating platelets (an average 20% increase over baseline on study day 126), monocytes (an average 49% increase over baseline on study day 50) and neutrophils (an average 51% increase over baseline on study day 81). These changes may due to stimulation of hematopoiesis or redistribution of the hematopoietic elements from the tissues to the circulation. The duration of the increases in neutrophils and platelets that have in vivo half-lifes of approximately 10 and 107 hours respectively suggest that at least part of the observed responses is due to enhanced hemopoiesis in these patients.","Some of the data that was obtained is summarized below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1106","num":"1255"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00027","num":"00027"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Timing of BrEA Dosing and Analyses"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"98pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"7pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Dosing Visit","Analysis Visit","Median Days After Last Dose",{}]},{"entry":["Days","Days","to Analysis Visit (Range)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1","7","7","(7-11)"]},{"entry":["15-19","22","3","(2-10)"]},{"entry":[{},"36","17","(13-24)"]},{"entry":[{},"50","31","(26-36)"]},{"entry":["60-64","67","3","(0-5)"]},{"entry":[{},"81","17","(13-19)"]},{"entry":[{},"95","31","(25-33)"]},{"entry":["118-122","126","3","(0-5)"]},{"entry":[{},"139","17","(12-23)"]},{"entry":[{},"153","31","(26-33)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"left","id":"FOO-00010"},"sup":"A"}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"left","id":"FOO-00011"},"sup":"B"}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"left","id":"FOO-00012"},"sup":"C"}}]}}]}}},"For the following table, the symbols in the table have the meanings given here.

a separate clinical trial using 100 mg of BrEA delivered to patients once per day for 5 consecutive days by intramuscular injection, several patients were evaluated for changes in the ratio of CD4 memory T cell 1 cells (intracellular IFN\u03b3 CD45RA CD62L CD11a) or MT1 cells to memory T cell 2 cells (intracellular IL-4 CD45RA CD62LCD11a) or MT2 cells. MT1 cells mediate or facilitate Th1 immune responses and MT2 cells mediate or facilitate Th2 immune responses. An increase in the MT1:MT2 ratio indicates an enhanced Th1 immune response or immune status. See, e.g., D. K. Mitra et al., 1999 11:1801-1810. The tested patients (7\/7) showed a transient increase in the MT1:MT2 ratio after a 5 day course of dosing with BrEA. The maximum observed increase was about 700% in one patient at 10 days after the last dose of BrEA was administered. The increase usually persisted for more than 10 days after the last dose of BrEA was administered. These results showed that BrEA was capable of enhancing the numbers of circulating immune cell subsets that mediate Th1 type responses.","Two HIV infected patients with chronic diarrhea were dosed with BrEA as follows. A BrEA formulation (40 mg\/mL BrEA in 25% v\/v PEG 300, 12.5% v\/v ethanol, 5% v\/v benzyl benzoate, \u02dc57.5% v\/v propylene glycol) was delivered subcutaneously. The patients received 60 mg of BrEA in 1.5 mL daily for 10 days. During the period of dosing, the diarrhea ceased. After the 10-day dosing period ended, diarrhea resumed. In other patients receiving oral BrEA, diarrhea also went into remission.","A BrEA formulation was prepared essentially as described herein. The formulation contained 50 mg\/mL BrEA, 40% v\/v PEG 200, 2% v\/v benzyl alcohol, 2% v\/v benzyl benzoate and \u02dc66% v\/v propylene glycol (qs). The formulation is particularly suitable for subcutaneous administration of the compound.","Crude BrEA was prepared by bromination of epiandrosterone, followed by crystallization from methanol. The hemihydrate was prepared by dissolving 25 g of crude BrEA in 75 mL of refluxing ethanol with moderate agitation. To the BrEA solution 12.5 mL of water was slowly added while maintaining the solution at reflux with agitation. Agitation of the solution was maintained and the solution was then allowed to cool to about 20-25\u00b0 C. and kept at about 20-25\u00b0 C. for about 15 minutes to obtain a suspension of BrEA hemihydrate crystals. The crystals were recovered by filtration, washed with a solution of 25 mL of water:ethanol (5:1 v\/v) at about 20-25\u00b0 C. and then vacuum dried for about 13 hours at 50-60\u00b0 C. until the product weight was constant. The crystals were primarily rod and needle shaped, with smaller amounts of other shapes such as tablets.","The procedure gave 22.5 g of BrEA hemihydrate (yield 90%) with a water content of 2.6% w\/w by KF analysis, a purity of 100% by HPLC area analysis, an FTIR spectrum with carbonyl peaks at 1741 cmand 1752 cm. The FTIR scan of anhydrous BrEA shows a single carbonyl peak at 1749 cm. The DSC scan showed three endotherms. One had a broad shallow peak with an onset at about 109-110\u00b0 C. and ending at about 150\u00b0 C. This broad DSC peak is consistent with the loss of water from the hemihydrate crystals as the temperature of the sample increased. The second endotherm at about 83-100\u00b0 C. is consistent with the loss of the small amount of residual ethanol from the sample. A DSC scan of anhydrous BrEA does not have the broad endotherm that is observed with the hemihydrate. Also consistent with the loss of water from the hemihydrate over the 100-150\u00b0 C. range is a sharp third endotherm peak in the hemihydrate DSC scan at about 16\u03b2-164\u00b0 C., which is the melting point of anhydrous BrEA. The FTIR was obtained using USP method <197>, where the BrEA hemihydrate sample was prepared in KBr. The DSC thermogram was obtained by scanning from 25\u00b0 C. to 250\u00b0 C. with a heating rate of 10\u00b0 C.\/minute.","The hemihydrate was prepared by dissolving 10 g of crude BrEA in 40 mL of refluxing acetone with moderate agitation. To the BrEA solution 4.0 mL of water was slowly added while maintaining the solution at reflux with agitation. Agitation of the solution was maintained and the solution was then allowed to cool to about 20-25\u00b0 C. and kept at about 20-25\u00b0 C. for about 15 minutes to obtain a suspension of BrEA hemihydrate crystals. The crystals were recovered by filtration, washed with a solution of 6.0 mL of water:acetone (10:1 v\/v) at about 20-25\u00b0 C. and then vacuum dried overnight (about 13-15 hours) at 50-60\u00b0 C. until the product weight was constant. The procedure gave 7.0 g of BrEA hemihydrate (yield 70%) with a water content of 2.6% w\/w by KF analysis and an FTIR spectrum with carbonyl peaks at 1741 cmand 1752 cm.","BrEA hemihydrate crystals were prepared essentially as described herein and sized using a particle sizing apparatus (Malvern Instruments). The analysis model used was for a polydisperse sample and a volume distribution type. The analysis showed a range of crystal diameter sizes from about 0.5 \u03bcm to about 880 \u03bcm. About 90% of the crystals had a diameter of about 20 \u03bcm to about 220 \u03bcm and the majority of the crystals had a diameter of about 30-200 \u03bcm. The mean crystal diameter was about 93 \u03bcm. The specific surface area of the crystals was about 0.25 m\/g.","Formulations containing BrEA hemihydrate were prepared. Similar formulations using other formula 1 compounds are prepared using the same or similar excipients, e.g., a different preservative can be used in the suspension formulation instead of methylparaben.","A formulation containing BrEA hemihydrate in aqueous suspension was prepared. The BrEA hemihydrate had an average particle size of less than 20 \u03bcm and it was mixed with polysorbate 80 before addition to the liquid components. The final aqueous composition contained 100 mg\/mL BrEA, 2% w\/v polysorbate 80, 0.1% w\/v carboxymethylcellulose sodium, 0.82% w\/v sodium chloride, 0.023% w\/v dibasic sodium phosphate, 0.101% w\/v monobasic sodium phosphate, 0.5% v\/v ethanol and 0.1% w\/v methylparaben, pH 6.5+\/\u22120.4. The formulation was prepared using sterile technique. This formulation is suitable for subcutaneous, intramuscular or intraperitoneal delivery of BrEA, which can be delivered in a bolus or depot in the skin, muscle, peritoneal cavity or other suitable site in a subject. The formulation is not generally used for intravenous delivery, particularly in humans, due to the presence of the drug particles.","A caplet (capsule shaped tablet) containing BrEA hemihydrate was prepared using compressible sucrose. The caplets each contained 25 mg BrEA hemihydrate, 6.25 mg povidone (1-ethenyl-2-pyrrolidinone polymer), 0.62 mg magnesium stearate, 45 mg mannitol and 48.12 mg of compressible sucrose. Sterile BrEA and excipients were used to prepare the caplets. The formulation is suitable for buccal or sublingual, delivery of BrEA (or another formula 1 compound) to a subject.","The capacity of formula 1 compounds to limit or inhibit inflammation or symptoms of inflammation was shown using animal models for inflammatory bowel disease.","Groups of 3 male Wistar rats (180\u00b120 grams) fasted for 24 hours before 2,4-dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS) or saline challenge were used. Distal colitis was induced by intra-colonic instillation of 0.5 mL of an ethanolic solution of DNBS (30 mg in 0.5 mL of a 30% ethanol in saline solution) after which 2 mL of air was injected through the cannula to ensure that the solution remained in the colon. The volume used was 0.1 mL per injection of 2 and 20 mg\/mL of 7-oxodehydroepiandrosterone in a liquid formulation, was administered by subcutaneous injection once a day for 6 days. The formulation contained 100 mg\/mL of 7-oxodehydroepiandrosterone in a non-aqueous suspension that contained 2% benzyl alcohol w\/v, 0.1% Brij 96 w\/v and equal volumes of PEG 300 and propylene glycol. Concentrations of 2 mg\/mL and 20 mg\/mL were obtained by diluting the 20 mg\/mL formulation with vehicle that lacked the active substance.","The first dose was given 30 minutes after DNBS challenge. Sulfasalazine (30 mg\/mL in 2% Tween 80 in distilled water) was administered orally (PO) once a day (10 mL\/kg\/day) for 7 days, the first two doses beginning 24 hours and 2 hours before DNBS challenge. The presence of diarrhea was recorded daily by examining the anal area. Animals were fasted for 24 hours prior to being sacrificed. Animals were sacrificed on day 7 or day 8 and their colons were removed and weighed. Before removal of the colon, signs of adhesion between the colon and other organs were recorded. Also, the presence of ulcerations was noted after weighing of each colon. The \u201cnet\u201d change of colon-to-body weight (BW) ratio was normalized relative to saline-challenged baseline group. A 30% decrease in \u201cnet\u201d colon-to-body weight ratio was considered significant.","A total of five studies were conducted. Data from the first study are reported in this report. The 7-oxodehydroepiandrosterone at 2 and 20 mg\/mL, decreased the net colon-to-body weight ratio by 19 and by 14% relative to vehicle-treated group, respectively. Adhesions were absent in all three tested animals. Colonic ulceration was noted in \u2153 animals. All animals had diarrhea. Similarly, all animals treated with Sulfazalazine had diarrhea. Sulfasalazine exhibited significant protection from inflammation (\u221233% change in net colon-to-body weight (BW) ratio relative to EE-1 treated group) and no animals exhibited adhesions or colonic ulceration. The formula 1 compound 3\u03b2,7\u03b2,17\u03b2-trihydroxyandrost-5-ene (AET) was administered by subcutaneous injections of 2 and 20 mg\/day for 5 or 6 days, with the first dose injected 30 minutes post-DNBS challenge. The AET formulation was the same as the 7-oxodehydroepiandrosterone formulation, except that AET replaced 7-oxodehydroepiandrosterone. AET decreased the net colon-to-body weight ratio by 15% and 21% relative to controls (see the table below). Animals treated with AET (20 mg\/kg) had no diarrhea. Adhesion was absent and fewer animals had colonic ulcerations (33% relative to untreated animals, N=9, pooled data from two studies). The same formulations containing BrEA hemihydrate (100 mg\/mL) or dehydroepiandrosterone (20 mg\/mL) decreased the net colon-to-body weight ratio by 21 and 3%, respectively relative to controls. In four subsequent studies, AET variably reduced the net colon-to-body weight ratio, ulcers and diarrhea.","Severe acute inflammation, measured 7 days after DNBS challenge, was observed in 3 of 10 immunosteroid vehicle control animals, while AET, dehydroepiandrosterone, sulfasalazine, and sulfasalazine vehicle (polysorbate 80) resulted in severe inflammation in 4, 10, 3, and 8 animals respectively. Moderate acute inflammation, measured 7 days after DNBS challenge, was observed in 5 of 10 immunosteroid vehicle control animals, while AET, dehydroepiandrosterone, sulfasalazine, and sulfasalazine vehicle (polysorbate 80) resulted in severe inflammation in 6, 0, 6, and 2 animals respectively. Severe chronic inflammation, measured 14 days after DNBS challenge, was observed in 8 of 10 immunosteroid vehicle control animals, while AET, dehydroepiandrosterone, sulfasalazine, and sulfasalazine vehicle (polysorbate 80) resulted in severe inflammation in 3, 3, 2, and 6 animals respectively.","At day 7 (acute inflammation) after DNBS challenge, 8 of 10 animals treated with vehicle control had severe ulceration, while 2 of 10 animals treated with AET had severe ulceration. Such ulceration was observed in 3 of 10 sulfasalazine control and in 10 of 10 animals treated with dehydroepiandrosterone. Delaying the initiation of AET treatment until 2 days after DNBS challenge resulted in increased chronic ulceration, with 5 of 10 animals showing ulcers 14 days after challenge, compared to only 1 animal with ulcers when treatment began the same day as challenge. This indicated that for acute inflammation in this model, AET is most effective early in the initiation of a flare of inflammatory cellular responses. At day 14 after DNBS challenge (chronic inflammation) 5 of 10 vehicle controls showed severe ulceration, 1 of 10 AET treated animals had severe ulceration, 0 of 10 animals treated with dehydroepiandrosterone had severe ulceration and 4 of 10 sulfasalazine treated animals (positive control) has severe ulceration. The results showed that the formula 1 compounds reduced inflammation or its symptoms compared to untreated control animals.","In another protocol formula 1 compounds were used in a similar animal model. Groups of 10 male Sprague Dawley rats (250-300 grams) were fasted for 24 hours before 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) or saline challenge. This model presents a severe challenge to the animal's immune system. On Day 0, the rats were lightly anesthetized and a catheter inserted rectally into the colon such that the tip was 8 cm proximal to the anus. Distal colitis was induced by intra-colonic instillation of 0.5 mL of an ethanolic solution of TNBS (60 mg\/mL ethanol 50% in water). The test substance, 7-oxodehydroepiandrosterone 20 mg\/mL in vehicle or vehicle control was administered by subcutaneous injection (0.1 mL\/injection) once a day for 6 days, the first dose being given 30 minutes after TNBS challenge. Sulfasalazine (30 mg\/mL in 2% Tween 80 in distilled water) or vehicle control was administered orally (PO) once a day (10 mL\/kg\/day) for 7 days, the first two doses beginning 24 hours and 2 hours before DNBS challenge. Signs of diarrhea were recorded daily by examining the anal area. Animals were fasted for 24 hours prior to sacrifice on day 14 and the colon was removed and weighed. After gross observations of colonic tissues, 3 samples were taken from regions approximately 1, 3, and 8 cm proximal to the anus. If gross ulcers or inflammation were present, at least one sample was taken from the affected region. Before removal of the colon, signs of adhesion between the colon and other organs were recorded. Also, the presence of colonic ulcerations and intestinal adhesions was noted after weighing of each colon. Body weight, colon-to-body-weight ratio, and damage scores were assessed. Visible damage was scored on a 1-5 scale as follows: 0=No damage; 1=Localized hyperemia but no ulcers; 2=linear ulcers with no significant inflammation; 3=Linear ulcers with inflammation at one site; 4=Two or more sites of ulceration and\/or inflammation; 5=Two or more major sites of ulceration and inflammation or one major site of ulceration and inflammation extending more than 1 cm along the length of the colon. Inflammation is defined as regions of hyperemia and bowel wall thickening.","Ulcerations were present more frequently at multiple colonic levels following 7-oxodehydroepiandrosterone treatment compared to controls. Moderate to severe ulcerative lesions associated with moderate to severe fibrosis of the mucosa and\/or submucosa occurred in 8\/9 (89%) of 7-oxodehydroepiandrosterone treated animals compared to 5\/9 (56%) of controls. The severity and frequency of muscular, peritoneal and\/or mesenteric inflammation appeared slightly more than in controls. These histopathological data suggests that 7-oxodehydroepiandrosterone exacerbated the inflammation. Moderate to severe ulcerative lesions occurred in 6\/10 (60%) and 5\/10 (50%) of sulfazalazine and vehicle treated animals, respectively. The severity and frequency of muscular, peritoneal and\/or mesenteric inflammation appeared to be similar to that occurring in vehicle groups. The frequency of moderate to severe lesions and their severity based on their occurrence at multiple colonic levels appeared to be similar between the negative control (vehicle), reference control (sulfazalazine), BrEA and dehydroepiandrosterone, indicating that for these compounds the degree of inflammation was similar for the control compound and the tested compounds.","3\u03b2,7\u03b2,17\u03b2-trihydroxyandrost-5-ene (AET) was examined for its capacity to modulate delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH). Groups of five female BALB\/cByJ mice (20-25 grams) were anesthetized and 1004 of a 3% solution of oxazolone was applied on day 0 to the shaved abdomen and dried. Seven days later, on day 7, the mice were challenged by applying 5 \u03bcL of oxazolone topically to each side of the right ear. The compound AET (40 mg\/mL) in vehicle was administered by subcutaneous injection (2 mg\/day, 50 4\/injection) one time on day 6, 24 hours before the oxazolone challenge. The vehicle as a non-aqueous suspension of AET in 2% benzyl alcohol w\/v, 0.1% Brij 96 w\/v and equal volumes of PEG 300 and propylene glycol.","Dexamethasone in saline (0.2 mg\/mL) was administered daily for 9 days (day-1 to 7), first dose 24 hours before sensitization, last dose at challenge by subcutaneous injection (0.01 mg\/dose, 50 4\/injection). On Day 8, 24 hours following the oxazolone challenge, both the right and left ear thicknesses were measured using a micrometer caliper and the differences determined. The differential ear thickness is measured as an indicator of the DTH response to topical oxazolone challenge. The DTH response was expressed as the difference in the thickness (mm) between the right and the left ears for each animal.","The differential ear thickness in animals receiving vehicle alone was 0.225 mm and treatment with dexamethasone (high dose) or cyclophosphamide reduced the DTH response (0.144 mm and 0.092 mm, respectively). AET administered subcutaneously had only a slight effect on the DTH response to oxazolone. When administered 24 hours before challenge or at challenge (2 mg\/day), the effect was a 22-24% reduction in the response. When administered daily for 8 days (2 mg\/day), first dose 24 hours before sensitization and last dose 24 hours prior to challenge, the effect was an enhancement of the response (23%). This result shows that if the compound was delivered to the animals during sensitization, the DTH response increased. This is consistent with an enhanced Th1 immune response. If the compound was delivered to the animals after sensitization, the DTH response was decreased. This is consistent with a decreased inflammatory response.","Healthy aged (20-month) or immunologically-mature (3-month) BALB\/c mice were vaccinated with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (2 \u03bcg; Recombivax-HB; Merck) and Alum (2.75 \u03bcg). The aged mice were vaccinated with the antigen and also received a single subcutaneous injection of either 0.3 mg or 3.0 mg of 3\u03b2,7\u03b2,17\u03b2-trihydroxyandrost-5-ene (AET), BrEA or 7-oxodehydroepiandrosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone or the vehicle (placebo control). The AET, BrEA hemihydrate or dehydroepiandrosterone was present in a formulation that contained 60 mg\/mL of the compound suspended in 0.1% w\/v carboxymethyl cellulose sodium in 0.9% saline. 7-Oxodehydroepiandrosterone was in a formulation that contained 60 mg\/mL of the compound suspended in 0.1% w\/v gum arabic in 0.9% saline. A concentration of 6 mg\/mL was obtained by diluting the 60 mg\/mL formulation with vehicle that lacked the active substance.","Blood samples were collected 14, 21 and 34 days after treatment and the sera were analyzed by ELISA to determine the concentration of HBsAg-specific IgG (total IgG). In addition, samples obtained on day 21 were analyzed to determine the concentration of HBsAg-specific IgG1 and IgG2a subclasses. The results summarized below were average values obtained with blood samples collected 21 days after vaccination of groups of 8 mice. Subcutaneous injection was performed after shaving the hair from the thighs of each mouse. The injected volume was 50 \u03bcL for compound (3.0 mg or 0.3 mg) or placebo, and for vaccine preparation. The vehicle control consisted of carboxymethylcellulose (0.5%) in saline (0.9%). Antibody titers were determined by ELISA.","Treatment of aged, vaccinated animals with the formula 1 compounds, resulted in higher anti-HBsAg IgG titers than aged animals receiving the vaccination only. Higher antibody titers were achieved in aged mice that received the compounds at the same time as vaccination, in the majority of cases. For all tested compounds, except for BrEA at the low dose (0.3 mg), the IgG titer increase was significant compared to aged controls. This result shows that the formula 1 compounds result in an enhanced immune response to antigen challenge in the immune senescent animals.","The serum samples were also analyzed for the titers of HBsAg-specific, IgG1 or IgG2a immunoglobulin subclasses. A bias to IgG1 is seen in aged mice and this is considered symptomatic of immune senescence or a suboptimal immune response associated with immune senescence. The IgG1\/IgG2a ratio is an indicator of immune status. Th2 cells predominantly assist in the generation of humoral immunity, while Th1 cells enhance, e.g., cellular immunity. Humoral immunity (Th2) becomes predominant with age, while the decreasing cellular (Th1) immunity leads to increased susceptibility to, e.g., infectious diseases.","The ratio of IgG1 to IgG2a of about 8:1 was measured in the young mice and 27:1 in aged mice. Generation of antigen-specific IgG1 generation involves T-helper type 2 (Th2) cells, and for IgG2a, T-helper type 1 (Th1) cells. Treatment of aged animals with the formula 1 compounds shifted the IgG1\/IgG2a ratios toward the ratio seen in young, vaccinated animals. The ratios observed from the animals treated with AET, BrEA, 7-oxodehydroepiandrosterone or dehydroepiandrosterone ranged from about 4 to about 13. The shift was statistically significant. The tested compounds all enhanced the proportion of IgG2a, and thus the associated Th1 response to the antigen.","Secondary antibody response. Later, 42 days after the initial exposure to HBsAg, serum samples were taken from the mice described in the previous section and these were tested for anti-HBsAg IgG. At this time-point, vaccine-specific IgG titers were either low or undetectable. Three days later (45 days after first vaccination), the mice were injected again with HBsAg in Alum, but this time, none of the mice received immunosteroid (secondary vaccination). Serum samples collected 7 days and 14 days after the second exposure to HBsAg vaccine were assayed for anti-HBsAg antibody. In the young mice, a marked increase in specific antibody was seen in response to the second vaccination. In contrast, in aged mice that had received no immunosteroid with the first HBsAg injection, low levels of anti-HBsAg were detectable, and only in 4 of the 8 mice in this group was antibody detectable. Increases in anti-HBsAg titers were seen following secondary vaccination in aged animals that had been treated with immunosteroid in conjunction with the first HBsAg exposure. The anti-HBsAg antibody titer in serum increased following secondary vaccination in all 8 mice in the groups of aged mice that were treated at primary vaccination with the higher dose (3 mg\/mouse) of AET, BrEA or 7-oxodehydroepiandrosterone, or with dehydroepiandrosterone (0.3 mg\/mouse). In those aged mice that had received the lower dose (0.3 mg\/mouse) of AET, BrEA or 7-oxodehydroepiandrosterone at vaccination, an intermediate response was seen, with 6 of the 8 mice producing detectable anti-HBsAg in response to secondary vaccination. These results show that the tested compounds resulted in an enhanced secondary antibody response in the aged animals.","Formula 1 compounds such as 3\u03b2,7\u03b2,17\u03b2-Trihydroxyandrost-5-ene (AET) and BrEA are used to modulate the immune response to an antigen(s) such as malaria antigens encoded by DNA expression vectors. Antigens such as a , e.g., or , circumsporozoite or merozoite protein are used to immunize a subject. AET or BrEA is administered on the same day or a day or two before antigen challenge. Suitable antigens, expression vectors and their delivery to a subject have been described. See, e.g., S. L. Hoffman et al., Vaccine 1994 12:1529-1533, R. Weiss et al., 2000 68:5914-5919, J. C. Rayner et al., 2000 97:9648-9653, S. Scheiblhofer et al., 2001 31:692-298. The capacity of the compounds to enhance immune responses to the antigens by, e.g., measuring cytotoxic T lymphocytes or antibody titer after delivery of the formula 1 compound and immunization with an antigen(s). Typically the immune response is measured at about 10 days to about 21 days after a primary immunization. Methods to measure immune responses are essentially as described herein or in appropriate cited references. DNAs that encode an antigen(s) that is associated with, e.g., an infectious agent or a tumor described herein may be used in these assays. The capacity of the formula 1 compound to modulate the immune response(s) to antigen challenge is optionally compared to the response generated by AET or BrEA.","The capacity of the formula 1 compounds to activate monocytes and\/or increase monocyte or macrophage activity or survival is determined using methods known in the art. The formula 1 compounds are assayed using, e.g., the assays described below. For these assays, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are purified from a subject, e.g., a human leukopack (American Red Cross, Baltimore, Md.) by centrifugation through a histopaque gradient (Sigma). Monocytes are isolated from PBMC by counterflow centrifugal elutriation. In each of the assays, the activity of a given formula 1 compound is optionally compared to the response associated with AET or BrEA.","Modulation of monocyte survival is determined essentially as follows. Human peripheral blood monocytes progressively lose viability when cultured in absence of serum or other stimuli. Their death results from internally regulated process such as apoptosis. Addition to the culture of activating factors, such as TNF-\u03b1 improves cell survival. Propidium iodide (PI) staining is used to measure apoptosis as follows. Monocytes are cultured for 48 hours in polypropylene tubes in serum-free medium (positive control), in the presence of about 100 ng\/mL of TNF-\u03b1 (negative control), and in the presence of varying concentrations of the formula 1 compound. Cells are suspended at a concentration of 2\u00d710\/mL in PBS containing PI at a final 5 concentration of about 5 \u03bcg\/mL, and then incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes before FACScan analysis. PI uptake has been demonstrated to correlate with DNA fragmentation in this experimental paradigm. The activity of formula 1 compounds such as AET or BrEA can be used as a comparison standard for other formula 1 compounds.","The effect of formula 1 compounds on monocyte or macrophage cytokine release is determined essentially as follows. An important function of monocytes and macrophages is their regulatory activity on other cellular populations of the immune system through the cytokines release after stimulation. An ELISA to measure cytokine release is performed using, e.g., human, monocytes, which are incubated at a density of about 5\u00d710cells\/mL. A range of formula 1 compound concentrations is used, e.g., 1 nm, 10 nm, 100 nm, 1 \u03bcm, 10 \u03bcm and 50 \u03bcm. To determine IL-12 production, the cells are primed overnight with IFN (100 U\/mL) in presence of a formula 1 compound. LPS (10 ng\/mL) is then added. Conditioned media are collected after 24 h and kept frozen until use. Measurement of TNF-alpha, IL-10, MCP-I and IL-8 is then performed using a commercially available ELISA kit (e.g, R & D Systems (Minneapolis, Minn.)) and applying the standard protocols provided with the kit.","Activation of monocytes or macrophages by formula 1 compound is measured by assaying the oxidative burst after stimulation of the cells. Purified monocytes are plated in 96-well plate at about 2\u00d710cells\/well. A range of formula 1 compound concentrations, e.g., 1 nm, 10 nm, 100 nm, 1 \u03bcm, 10 \u03bcm and 50 \u03bcm, are added to the wells in a total volume of 0.2 mL culture medium (RPMI 1640+10% FCS, glutamine and antibiotics). After 3 days incubation, the plates are centrifuged and the medium is removed from the wells. To the macrophage monolayers, 0.2 mL per well of phenol red solution (140 mM NaCl, 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.0, 5.5 mM dextrose, 0.56 mM phenol red and 19 U\/ml of HRPO) is added, together with the stimulant (200 nM PMA). The plates are incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 2 hours and the reaction is stopped by adding 20 pL 1N NaOH per well. The absorbance is read at 610 nm. To calculate the amount of H0produced by the macrophages, a standard curve of a HOsolution of known molarity is performed for each experiment.","The formula 1 compounds are used to modulate astrocyte or neuron survival, neurite outgrowth, phenotypic differentiation of cortical neuronal cells or for inducing the proliferation of glial fibrillary acidic protein immunopositive cells (astrocytes). A thymidine incorporation assay, for example, can be used to measure cell proliferation or survival. The biological effects of FGF-2 (basic FGF) on cortical or hippocampal neurons in vitro included increases in both neuron survival and neurite outgrowth (Walicke et al., 1986 83:3012-3016. Using primary cortical neuronal culture, the effect of a formula 1 compound to induce neurite outgrowth can be compared to the response achieved with FGF-2 using, for example, a thymidine incorporation assay.","The formula 1 compounds are used in a model for Parkinson disease essentially as follows. The loss of motor function in Parkinson's disease is attributed to a deficiency of striatal dopamine resulting from the degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic projection neurons. An animal model for Parkinson's that has been extensively characterized involves the systemic administration of 1-methyl-4 phenyl 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). In the CNS, MPTP is taken-up by astrocytes and catabolized by monoamine oxidase B to 1-methyl-4-phenyl pyridine (MPP) and released. Subsequently, MPP is actively accumulated in dopaminergic neurons by the high-affinity reuptake transporter for dopamine. MPP is then concentrated in mitochondria by the electrochemical gradient, which selectively inhibits nicotidamide adenine disphosphate; ubiquinone oxidoreductionase (complex 1), thereby interfering with electron transport and eventually generating oxygen radicals. It has been demonstrated in tissue culture and in vivo that FGF-2 (basic FGF) has trophic activity for nigral dopaminergic neurons. FGF-2 in gel foam implants in the striatum results in the near complete protection of nigral dopaminergic neurons from the toxicity associated with MPTP exposure. The formula 1 compounds are administered with or without FGF-2 to measure their capacity to enhance survival of dopaminergic neurons in vitro, or they are delivered in vivo to enhance protection of dopaminergic neurons in the striatum from the damage associated with MPTP treatment.","In vitro dopaminergic neuronal cell cultures are prepared by dissecting the midbrain floor plate from gestation day 14 Wistar rat embryos. The tissue is dissociated with trypsin and seeded at a density of about 2\u00d710cells\/cmon polyorthinine-laminin coated glass coverslips. The cells are maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium and F12 medium containing hormonal supplements (N1). The cultures are fixed with paraformaldehyde after 8 days and are processed for tyrosine hydroxylase, a specific marker for dopminergic neurons, immunohistochemical staining. Dissociated cell cultures are prepared from embryonic rats. The culture medium is changed every third day and the factors are also added at that time. Since the dopaminergic neurons are isolated from animals at gestation day 14, a developmental time which is past the stage when the dopaminergic precursor cells are proliferating, an increase in the number of tyrosine hydroxylase immunopositive neurons represents an increase in the number of dopaminergic neurons surviving in vitro.","The recruitment of lymphocytes to areas of inflammation and angiogenesis involves specific receptor-ligand interactions between cell surface adhesion molecules (CAMs) on lymphocytes and the vascular endothelium. The adhesion process, in both normal and pathological settings, follows a multi-step cascade that involves intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (E-selectin) expression on endothelial cells (EC). The expression of these molecules and others on the vascular endothelium determines the efficiency with which leukocytes may adhere to the local vasculature and extravasate into the local tissue during the development of an inflammatory response. The local concentration of cytokines and growth factor participate in the modulation of the expression of these CAMs.","Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), is a proinflammatory cytokine and stimulates all three CAMs on endothelial cells. It may be involved in a wide variety of inflammatory responses, often resulting in a pathological outcome. The capacity of a formula 1 compound to mediate a suppression of TNF-\u03b1 induced CAM expression can be examined. A modified ELISA assay which uses ECs as a solid phase absorbent is employed to measure the amount of CAM expression on TNF-\u03b1 treated ECs when co-stimulated with a member of the FGF family of proteins. To perform the experiment, human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) cultures are obtained from pooled cord harvests and maintained in growth medium (EGM-2, Clonetics, San Diego, Calif.) supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% penicillin\/streptomycin in a 37\u00b0 C. humidified incubator containing 5% CO. HUVECs are seeded in 96-well plates at concentrations of about 1\u00d710cells\/well in EGM medium at 37\u00b0 C. for 18-24 hrs or until confluent. The monolayers are subsequently washed 3 times with a serum-free solution of RPMI-1640 optionally supplemented with 100 U\/mL penicillin and 100 mg\/mL streptomycin, and treated with a given cytokine and\/or growth 5 factor(s) for 24 h at 37\u00b0 C. Following incubation, the cells are then evaluated for CAM expression.","HUVECs are grown in a standard 96 well plate to confluence. Growth medium is removed from the cells and replaced with 90 \u03bcL of 199 Medium (10% FBS). Samples for testing and positive or negative controls are added to the plate in triplicate (in 10 volumes). Plates are incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for either 5 h (selectin and integrin expression) or 24 h (integrin expression). Plates are aspirated to remove medium and 100 \u03bcL of 0.1% paraformaldehyde-PBS (with Ca and Mg) is added to each well. Plates are held at 4\u00b0 C. for 30 min. Fixative is then removed from the wells and wells are washed 1\u00d7 with PBS(+Ca,Mg)+0.5% BSA and drained. Do not allow the wells to dry. 10 \u03bcL of diluted primary antibody is added to the test and control wells. Anti-ICAM-1-Biotin, Anti-VCAM1-Biotin and Anti-E-selectin-Biotin are used at a concentration of 10 pg\/ml (1:10 dilution of 0.1 mg\/ml stock antibody). Cells are incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 30 min. in a humidified environment. Wells are washed \u00d73 with PBS (with Ca, Mg) and 0.5% BSA. Then add 20 \u03bcL of diluted ExtrAvidin-Alkaline Phosphotase (1:5,000 dilution) to each well and incubate at 37\u00b0 C. for 30 min. Wells are washed \u00d73 with PBS (with Ca, Mg) and 0.5% BSA. 1 tablet of p-Nitrophenol Phosphate pNPP is dissolved in 5 mL of glycine buffer (pH 10.4). 100 \u03bcl of pNPP substrate in glycine buffer is added to each test well. Standard wells in triplicate are prepared from the working dilution of the ExtrAvidin-Alkaline Phosphotase in glycine buffer: 5 \u03bcL of each dilution is added to triplicate wells and the resulting AP content in each well is 5.50 ng, 1.74 ng, 0.55 ng, 0.18 ng. 100 \u03bcl of pNNP reagent is then be added to each of the standard wells. The plate is incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 4 h. A volume of 50 \u03bcL of 3M NaOH is added to all wells. The results are quantified on a plate reader at 405 nm. The background subtraction option is used on blank wells filled with glycine buffer only. The template is set up to indicate the concentration of AP-conjugate in each standard well. Results are indicated as amount of bound APconjugate in each sample.","This assay can be used to evaluate inhibition of a Mixed Lymphocyte Reaction (MLR) by formula 1 compounds. Inhibition of a MLR may be due to a direct effect on cell proliferation and viability, modulation of costimulatory molecules on interacting cells, modulation of adhesiveness between lymphocytes and accessory cells, or modulation of cytokine production by accessory cells. Multiple cells may be targeted by the compounds since the peripheral blood mononuclear fraction used in this assay includes T, B and natural killer lymphocytes, as well as monocytes and dendritic cells. Compounds that inhibit the MLR are useful in treating, preventing or ameliorating diseases associated with lymphocyte and monocyte activation or proliferation. These include, e.g., inflammatory or autoimmune conditions such as asthma, arthritis, diabetes, inflammatory skin conditions, psoriasis, eczema, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, glomerulonephritis, inflammatory bowel disease, crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, arteriosclerosis, cirrhosis, graft vs. host disease, host vs. graft disease and hepatitis.","To perform the assay, PBMCs from, e.g., human, donors are purified by density gradient centrifugation using Lymphocyte Separation Medium (LSM\u2122, density 1.0770 g\/mL, Organon Teknika Corporation, West Chester, Pa.). PBMCs from two donors are adjusted to 2\u00d710cells\/mL in RPMI-1640 (Life Technologies, Grand Island, N.Y.) supplemented with 10% FCS and 2 mM glutamine. PBMCs from a third donor is adjusted to 2\u00d710cells\/ml. Fifty \u03bcL of PBMCs from each donor is added to wells of a 96-well round bottom microtiter plate. Several concentrations of the formula 1 compound in the wells is used in triplicate, e.g., 1 nm, 10 nm, 100 nm, 1 \u03bcm and 10 \u03bcm. Recombinant human IL-2 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn., catalog number 202-IL) is added to a final concentration of about 0.1 to 1 \u03bcg\/mL and anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody (e.g., R&D Systems, clone 34930.11, catalog number MAB379) is added to a final concentration of about 1 to 10 \u03bcg\/mL. Cells are cultured for 7-8 days at 37\u00b0 C. in 5% CO, and 1 \u03bcCi of [H] thymidine is added to wells for the last 16 hrs of culture. Cells are harvested and thynudine incorporation determined using a suitable scintillation counter, e.g., a Packard TopCount. Data is expressed as the mean and standard deviation of triplicate determinations. Samples of the protein of interest are screened in separate experiments and compared to the negative control treatment, anti-CD4 mAb, which inhibits proliferation of lymphocytes and the positive control treatment, IL-2 (either as recombinant material or supernatant), which enhances proliferation of lymphocytes.","Previously described MLR protocols, sources of cells for use in the MLR and assay parameters can be used to evaluate the effects of the formula 1 compounds. See, e.g., K. V. Bromelow et al., 2001 247:1-8, Z. Amirghofran et al., 2000 721:167-172, T. Itoh et al., () 1993 46:1575-1581, P. Van Vlasselaer et al., 1991 138:326-340, and A. Shaked et al., 1991 52:1068-1072.","The effects of the formula 1 compounds on memory are assayed essentially as follows.","Aged, two year old mice are tested in the Morris water maze procedure by training the mice to locate a pedestal in less than 15 seconds in three consecutive trials. Immediately upon completion of training one group of mice is treated with a formula 1 compound (5-30 mg\/kg) and a second group is treated with a placebo. The treatment comprises one, two or three intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous injections of the formula 1 compound and the vehicle placebo. The injections are given once per day. Two weeks after treatment, the time to rescue is timed in the Morris water maze procedure and the control result is compared to the placebo control.","Scopolamine induced amnesia is examined essentially as follows. Groups of 13 to 16 C57BL76 mice (about 35 gm) are trained in the Morris water maze procedure to locate a pedestal in less than 15 seconds in three consecutive trials. Immediately upon completion of training the mice in each of three groups are treated with scopolamine (1 mg\/kg), scopolamine plus a formula 1 compound at one or more dosages (e.g., about 5-50 mg\/kg), and scopolamine plus a placebo. The treatment comprises one, two or three intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous injections of the formula 1 compound and the vehicle placebo. The injections are given once per day. Six days after treatment the average time (sec) to rescue is timed using the Morris water maze procedure and the results from each group are compared. Results for a formula 1 compound are optionally compared to the results that are obtained in these protocols using BrEA or AET to determine the relative potency of the formula 1 compounds.","The capacity of formula 1 compounds to limit injury associated with ischemia and reperfusion is determined in an animal model essentially as follows. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 130-170 g are randomly assigned to no pre-treatment, vehicle pre-treatment or formula 1 compound pre-treatment using one or more dosages, e.g., about 1-10 mg\/kg. Animals are treated with vehicle or DHEA the day before and the day of surgery. Anesthesia is induced with intraperitoneal pentobarbital (60-70 mg\/kg). The rats are placed on a heating pad, and body temperature is maintained at about 36\u00b0 C. Detection of the cremaster muscle on its neurovascular pedicle is performed essentially according to conventional techniques, e.g., Anderson, G. L. et al., 1988 36:56-63, Siemionow, M. et al., 1991 7:183-197, Siemionow, M. et al., 1993 18A:963-971.","Briefly, a skin incision is made from the anterior iliac spine to the tip of the scrotum. The testis with cremaster muscle intact is then dissected away from the scrotum. An opening of 1 cm is made on the ventral surface of the cremaster, and the testis and spermatic cord are removed. Under a microscope, the neurovascular pedicle, consisting of the pubic-epigastric arteries, vein, and genitofemoral nerve, is then completely isolated by dissecting to the origin of the vessels from the external iliac artery and vein. The front wall of the cremaster muscle sac is opened and the island cremaster muscle flap is prepared for intravital videomicroscopy. The rat is secured on a tissue bath, and the cremaster muscle flap is spread over the coverglass in the opening at the bottom of the bath and fixed with 5-0 silk sutures. It is then transilluminated from below, using a fiber optic tungsten lamp. The muscle is kept moist and covered with impermeable plastic film. The tissue bath, designed specifically for temperature control, is filled with 0.9% saline and the temperature maintained at between 35-36\u00b0 C. The microscope is equipped with a color video camera. The video image of the microcirculation is displayed on a 19\u2033 monitor, where the final magnification is 1800\u00d7. Measurement of microvascular activity is recorded after isolation of the muscle to establish the pre-ischemia baseline. After proper positioning of clamps to completely shut down blood flow to the muscle flap, the duration of the ischemic period is six hours. Following removal of clamps to induce reperfusion injury, activity in the microvasculature is measured at e.g., 30, 60 and 90 minutes post-reperfusion. In all experimental subjects, ischemia is followed by reflow and then by an initial period of flow of blood through the microcirculation. This burst of circulatory activity is followed by marked reperfusion injury that induces loss of flow.","One or more of the following parameters are used to evaluate the state of the cremaster muscle microvasculatory system prior to ischemia and after reperfusion. The density of perfused capillaries in each of three flap regions is measured by counting the number of flowing capillaries in proximity to the preselected post-capillary venule. Nine visual fields of capillaries are counted at each postcapillary venule site, for a total of 27 fields per cremaster muscle flap.","A leukocyte count in postcapillary venules is taken using video scans of three pre-selected post-capillary venules in proximal, middle and distal flap regions. For each venule, the number of leukocytes rolling through the lumen, the number adhering to the endothelium and the number migrating across the endothelium over a two-minute period are recorded. Results are optionally obtained for rollers, strikers and diapedesis. Red blood cell velocities in first order and second order arterioles are measured. Red blood cell velocities are recorded in the main arterioles of the cremaster flap using an optical Doppler velocimeter. Results are obtained for velocity of venous and arterial blood.","In an exemplary protocol, six rats are untreated and six rats are pre-treated with vehicle. Under conditions of six hours of ischemia and 90 minutes of reperfusion, the absolute number of rolling, sticking and transmigrated leukocytes is determined within 60 minutes of reperfusion and at 90 minutes. Rats are pre-treated with a formula 1 compound by subcutaneous injection the day before and the day of surgery to measure any protective effect of the therapy. One or more of the three parameters are determined and are compared to normal values. The endothelial-adherent properties compared to baseline values are optionally determined, using numbers of rolling, sticking and transmigrating leukocytes. Red cell velocities in second order arterioles are compared to normal rates of flow at, e.g., 90 minutes post-reperfusion.","The capacity of formula 1 compounds to limit hypoxia induced pulmonary vasoconstriction is demonstrated using an animal model essentially as follows. Isolated perfused ferret lungs are an established animal model to study secondary pulmonary hypertension. In brief, male ferrets are anesthetized with intraperitoneal pentobarbital sodium and the chest is opened. Stainless steel cannulae are secured in the left atrium and pulmonary artery, and the pulmonary artery and the aorta are ligated. The lungs are perfused with a mixture of autologous blood and Krebs-Henseleit buffer in a circulating manner at a constant rate of about 85 mL\/min. The perfusion circuit includes a perfusate reservoir, a roller perfusion pump, filter, and a heat exchanger. The perfusion system is made of, e.g., tygon tubing, which is used for connections and for passage through the perfusion pump. The temperature of the perfusate is kept about 37-38\u00b0 C. and the pH is maintained at 7.35 to 7.40 by adding sodium bicarbonate to the reservoir as needed. The venous reservoir is placed below the lowermost portion of the lung.","The lungs are ventilated with a hypoxic gas mixture of 5% CO, 4% O, and 91% Nby a tracheotomy with a Harvard animal respirator for 30 minutes. The animals are ventilated with a tidal volume of 30 mL, at a rate of 18 breaths\/min. and with 2 cm of HO positive end-expiatory pressure. For measurements, pulmonary arterial, left atrial and tracheal pressures are monitored using Gould Statha P231 D pressure transducers or an equivalent connected to the inflow circulation and recorded on, e.g., a Grass polygraph. After 30 minutes of ventilation with hypoxic gas mixture, a formula 1 compound in a dose between about 5-25 mg\/kg body weight is added to the reservoir, and perfusate is allowed to perfuse the ferret lungs for 1.5 hours. Pulmonary artery pressure is measured until the end of the experiment, i.e., a total of two hours. Pressure that remains at or near basal level indicates the vasodilatory effect of the formula 1 compound in pulmonary circulation that is otherwise constricted in response to hypoxia. The effects of the formula 1 compounds can be compared to the effects and duration of nitric oxide, a therapeutic agent that is optionally used in this model as a control.","Enhanced hemopoiesis is observed in mammals with immune injury from, e.g., radiation exposure or from an immunosuppressive chemotherapy. In an example, animals are used to demonstrate the effect of formula 1 compounds on hemopoiesis after immune system injury due to radiation. Hemopoiesis in the murine immune system after radiation is optionally used because of the similar responses of murine and human hemopoiesis to drugs and toxic insults (see, e.g., J. H. Hendry and B. I. Lord, editors, 1995 Taylor & Francis Inc., London).","In an exemplary protocol, B6D2F1\/J female mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Me.), 18-24 weeks of age, 22-30 g body weight, are obtained and held in quarantine for two weeks. Up to 10 mice are housed in sanitized 46\u00d724\u00d715 cm polycarbonate boxes with filter covers (MicroIsolator; Lab Products, Inc, Maywood, N.J.) on autoclaved hardwood chip bedding. Mice are given feed and acidified (pH 2.5) water freely. The animal holding room is maintained with conditioned fresh air at approximately 21\u00b0 C. and 50\u00b0 (\u00b110%) relative humidity and with a 12-h light\/dark full spectrum lighting cycle.","Mice are placed in ventilated Plexiglas containers and exposed bilaterally to gamma-radiation from a Co source. Exposure time is adjusted so that each animal received a midline tissue-absorbed dose of 1-12 Gy at a nominal dose rate of 0.4 Gy\/min at ambient temperature. Using a standardized technique, the midline dose rate is measured by placing a 0.5 cc tissue-equivalent ionization chamber at the center of a 2.5-cm diameter cylindrical acrylic mouse phantom. The tissue-air ratio, defined as the ratio of the dose rate measured in the phantom to the dose rate in free air, for this array is about 0.96. Variation within the exposure field is less than about 4%. Dosimetric measurements are made in accordance with the American Association of Physicists in Medicine protocol for the determination of absorbed dose from high-energy photon and electron beams (1983 10:741-771). Sham-irradiated mice are treated in the same way as the irradiated animals, except that the animals are not irradiated.","Various formula 1 compounds e.g., compounds such as those in the compound groups described herein are formulated with a suitable vehicle (e.g., PEG-400) or sterile 0.9% NaCl (saline) optionally containing other excipients such as a cyclodextrin. The compounds are injected subcutaneously in a volume of about 0.1 mL or they are delivered orally or they are administered by another route. Doses typically range from about 1 mg\/kg to about 350 mg\/kg, e.g., about 1, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160 or 320 mg\/kg.","Blood (0.6-1.0 mL) is obtained from halothane-anesthetized mice by cardiac puncture using a heparinized syringe attached to a 21-gauge needle. Blood is collected in EDTA-containing sample tubes. Mice are euthanized by cervical dislocation after blood collection. White blood cell (WBC), red blood cell (RBC) and platelet (PLT) counts are performed using, e.g., a Hematology System 9000 (Biochem Immunosystems). Wright-stained blood smears from the same samples are made for differential counts of neutrophils and lymphocytes by light microscopy.","Hemopoietic progenitor cells committed to granulocyte-macrophage differentiation (GM-CFC) are assayed by a single-layer modification of a double-layer semisolid agar technique essentially as described (Patchen et al. 1992 12:223-248). For example, femoral marrow is extracted and cell suspensions are prepared by flushing with 3 mL of McCoy's 5A medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HIFBS; Hyclone, Logan, Utah). Each cell suspension represented a pool of marrow from four femurs, i.e., both femurs from each of two mice. The total number of nucleated cells in each suspension is determined with, e.g., a Coulter counter. The agar-medium mixture consisted of equal volumes of 0.66% agar and double-strength supplemented CMRL 1066 medium (Gibco, Grand Island, N.Y.). The medium is supplemented with final concentrations of 10% HIFBS, 5% tryptic soy broth, 5% heat-inactivated horse serum, antibiotics, and L-serine. One milliliter of the agar-medium mixture is added to each 35-mm plastic Petri dish (two dishes per suspension) and mixed with 50 \u03bcL of 0.1 ng\/\u03bcL recombinant mouse GM-CSF (Genzyme, Cambridge, Mass.). Cell suspensions are then mixed into the agar-medium mixture to a final concentration of 0.5\u00d710cells\/mL for unirradiated animals, and 1.0\u00d710or 1.5\u00d710cells\/mL for irradiated animals to ensure sufficient colonies per plate for quantitation. Control experiments are done to confirm linearity of colonies at cell concentrations of 0.5-1.5\u00d710cells\/mL. Colonies (>50 cells) are counted after seven days incubation in a 37\u00b0 C. humidified environment containing 5% CO. The average of the counts for the two dishes is taken as the value for each pool. About six animals are used per group in each of two experiments.","For histological examination of myeloid hyperplasia in bone marrow after administration of the formula 1 compound, mice are euthanized with halothane, tissues are immersed in formalin, bones are decalcified and routine H&E-stained 6-\u03bcm paraffin sections are prepared.","For induced-infection studies, a clinical isolate of , capsule type 5 (strain AFRRI 7), that is kept frozen at 70\u00b0 C. in skim milk, is grown overnight at 35\u00b0 C. on Trypticase Soy Agar (Becton-Dickinson, Sparks, Md.). Five typical colonies are inoculated into 8 mL of brain heart infusion broth (Becton-Dickinson) and incubated overnight at 35\u00b0 C. Two milliliters of this overnight suspension is inoculated into 95 mL of prewarmed brain heart infusion broth. The culture is incubated at 35\u00b0 C. with shaking for approximately 2.5 h. The optical density of bacterial growth is monitored with a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 550 nm. Late log-phase cells are ished and suspended in cold saline to yield 10viable bacteria per mL. Appropriate dilutions for inoculations are made in cold saline.","To induce a bacterial infection, all mice are injected sc with four days after sham-irradiation or irradiation when circulating leukocytes are depressed. Mice are inoculated sc rather than iv or ip, to establish infection leading to sepsis, but not rapid septic shock. After sc inoculations of in the mice, the infection remains largely localized to the injection site. are not detectable in blood of inoculated mice until a few hours before death.","Different doses of the bacteria are inoculated for each of three radiation dose levels (0, 1 or 3 Gy) to approximate the LD, because the effects of radiation on hemopoiesis and susceptibility to infection are dependent on the dose of radiation. The LDfor bacteria at each radiation dose is calculated from probit analysis. The actual doses are estimated by dilution plating of inocula onto Trypticase Soy Agar and incubating overnight at 35\u00b0 C. Since different bacterial doses are expected to be needed for different radiation doses, the LDis estimated for each group and different mortality rates are observed in the vehicle-injected control groups. Bacterial doses for induced-infection experiments are prepared and calculated in the same manner.","Animals are checked frequently, e.g., once or twice daily, six or seven days per week, to monitor survival and to euthanize mice that are in a moribund state. To verify that mortality in the induced-infection experiments is associated with injection, heart blood from recently deceased animals (or moribund animals euthanized by cervical dislocation) is cultured overnight at 35\u00b0 C. on Columbia sheep blood agar plates (Becton-Dickinson, Sparks, Md.). Colonies are identified as by a suitable means, e.g., Biolog analysis.","For histological analysis of bone marrow, coded slides are scored blind using a five-level semiquantitative scale and the results analyzed with a randomization t-test to obtain exact P-values. Thirty-day survival values are compared using the generalized Savage (Mantel-Cox) procedure (BMDP Statistical Software, Inc, Los Angeles, Calif.). To calculate dose reduction factors (DRFs), probit analysis is performed on mortality data.","To test the ability of formula 1 compounds to ameliorate radiation-induced defects in hemopoiesis, mice are exposed to bilateral whole-body gamma-radiation and receive a dose of 3 Gy (or are sham-irradiated). One hour after irradiation or sham-irradiation, mice are injected with 320 mg\/kg AED or PEG-400 vehicle. Between-group differences in blood cell elements, e.g., neutrophils, GM-CFC and platelets are generally determined. Irradiation results in a decrease in neutrophils at about four days after radiation compared to sham-irradiated animals.","A human patient infected with the HIV virus was treated with 16\u03b1-bromoepiandrosterone (\u201cBrEA\u201d), using a physiological saline formulation containing 10 mg\/mL of BrEA in solution, 36% w\/v hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin and 20 mg\/mL of micronized BrEA in suspension. The patient received two courses of treatment. The first course consisted of subcutaneous injection once per day of 80 mg of BrEA for 10 days. The second course of treatment commenced 74 days later and used the same formulation, except that deuterium oxide replaced water in the formulation. The second treatment course consisted of subcutaneous injection once per day of 80 mg of BrEA for 15 days. The patient's blood parameters were obtained at the start and at the end of each course of treatment. The results shown below indicated that the BrEA compound enhanced blood cell counts as shown by increased blood platelets and neutrophils after the second course of treatment or by increased NK cells after either treatment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1175","num":"1324"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00030","num":"00030"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"1Course","2Course"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Blood parameter","start","end","start","end"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["WBC (\u00d710\/L)","2.38","2.47","3.57","5.66"]},{"entry":["platelets (\u03bcL)","142","146","119","225"]},{"entry":["neutrophils (\u00d710\/L)","0.92","0.8","2.02","3.60"]},{"entry":["monocytes (\u00d710\/L)","0.35","0.3","0.34","0.54"]},{"entry":["basophils (\u00d710\/L)","0.02","0.01","0.01","0.06"]},{"entry":["CD16\/56NK cells (mm)","186","348","144","425"]},{"entry":["CD4T cells (mm)","93","116","113","125"]},{"entry":["T suppressor cells (mm)","344","452","351","513"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"To 1 L of physiological saline was added 450 g of hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin to obtain a clear solution, which was brought to a volume of 1250 mL with saline. 12.5 g of 16\u03b1-bromoepiandrosterone was then added and the solution was stirred for 2 hours with a magnetic mixer.
