{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["Governmental Interest\u2014The invention described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government.","The present disclosure relates to reaction characteristic detectors for energetic materials, including nanoenergetic materials.","Energetic materials (EMs) provide the potential for significant advances in such microscale energy-demanding systems and applications as actuators, explosives, igniters, propulsion units, and power sources. Nanoscale EMs (nEMs), also known as nanoenergetic materials, offer the promise of much higher energy densities, faster rates of energy release, greater stabilities and probabilities against reaction, and more security (sensitivity to unwanted reaction initiation). The terms \u201cnano\u201d and \u201cmicro\u201d are used by those skilled in the art rather arbitrarily to mean extremely small, such as at least one dimension within a range of tens to thousands of nanometers (a nanometer being a billionth of a meter). The concepts described herein are applicable to a variety of energetic materials as well as nanoenergetic materials.","Nano-energetic materials are mixtures of fuel and oxidizers closely packed together for a self-sustaining, high temperature reaction. Tiny particles have increased surface area over larger particles. Close proximity of the fuel and the oxidizer create waves of energy as the flame propagates through the solid material. Energy from adjacent layers ignites the fuel\/oxidizer mixture. Material can be used as prepared or modified with polymers or explosives and used as a primers for explosives or propellants. Materials of this type have potential application in mining, demolitions, precision cutting, explosive welding, surface treatment and hardening of materials, pulse owner, crystallization and solar cells, sintering, micro-aerospace, satellite platforms, military applications and biomedical fields that destroy localized pathological tissues. Other prominent applications include thermite torches for underwater and atmospheric cutting or perforation, electronic hardware devices, additives to propellants and explosives having increased performance, pyrotechnic switches, airbag gas generator materials, high-temperature stable igniters, freestanding insertable heat sources, devices to breach ordnance cases to relieve pressure during fuel fires, thermal battery heat sources,incendiary projectiles,delay fuses, additives to propellants to increase burn rate without decrease of specific impulse and full sized shape-charged liners.","Some current technologies can be used to measure reaction characteristics such as propagation velocity. For instance, high speed cameras can measure reaction propagation velocity, but such high-speed cameras are relatively expensive and might be damaged in particularly hot, hostile, or caustic environments. Fiber optic based measurements require one data acquisition channel per measurement site, and thus tends to form a complex solution. It is desirable to limit the number of acquisition channels necessary to measure reaction propagation velocity.","Therefore, there is a need in the art for a detector for determining a characteristic of a reaction of an energetic material (including a nanoenergetic material).","One embodiment of the invention comprises a reaction characteristic detector The detector includes a ladder assembly having a plurality of rungs, each rung in the plurality of rungs comprises a reaction passage determiner spaced a distance from a point of an energetic material reaction initiation. Each of the reaction passage determiner has at least one characteristic that changes in response to the reaction occurring proximate to the reaction passage determiner.","Another embodiment of the invention comprises a method of measuring characteristics of a reaction comprising: igniting a reaction of a energetic material; as the reaction becomes proximate a reaction passage determiner, determining a change in a characteristic of the determiner and determining at least one of a propagation time elapsed or distance traversed from ignition to occurrence of the change; and computing a reaction characteristic related to the change and the at least one of propagation time or distance.","To facilitate understanding, identical reference numerals have been used, where possible, to designate identical or similarly functioning elements that are common to the figures. The figures are not drawn to scale and may be simplified for clarity. It is contemplated that elements and features of one embodiment may be beneficially incorporated in other embodiments without further recitation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100","100"],"sub":"4 "},"Certain embodiments of the detector  comprise a substrate  supporting a detection assembly  comprising an igniter , a ladder assembly , and a sensor . A variety of substances may be used as the substrate. The substrate  should be inert to the energetic material and be able to withstand the heat generated by a flame front. One such substrate material is glass Other substrates materials include silicon, silicon-on-insulator, RF4, carbide, fiberglass, perforated glass, LEXAN, polymers and\/or other materials able to support formation of electronic circuits thereon and resist destruction during a reaction of the energetic material. The term \u201csubstrate\u201d is not intended to be limited to a single supporting object, even though the singular form of the term is used. One or more supporting materials can form the substrate .","Prior to installation of any of the components, the substrate  should be cleaned to remove impurities that may affect the preparation of the apparatus or the properties of the energetic material. When glass is used as the substrate  material, it is generally cleaned with a corrosive acid solution such as Aqua Regis (a combination of concentrated sulfuric acid and concentrated nitric acid) or Piranha solution (a combination of concentrated sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide) to remove metals and organic contaminants. Residual acids or sulfates are removed by rinsing the substrate  under running distilled water. Cleaned substrates  are dried at suitable temperatures and pressures. Glass is suitably dried above 100\u00b0 C., preferably at about 106\u00b0 C. for about 15 minutes.","The detection assembly  is formed on the substrate  and is coupled to a controller  for activating a reaction within the detection assembly , collecting data as the reaction progresses, and analyzing the data to determine at least one characteristic of the reaction. Certain embodiments of the detection assembly  may be formed such as to be on at least one integrated circuit chip using thin film deposition techniques such as physical vapor deposition, chemical vapor deposition, masking, etching, and other well known microelectronic device fabrication techniques. Or, alternately, the detection assembly could be formed in a larger scale.","Certain embodiments of the detector  includes an energetic material deposition region  that receives an energetic material  over at least a portion of the ladder assembly  spreading at least from a point of reaction initiation  adjacent the igniter  to the ladder assembly  and, as shown, covering some or all of the ladder assembly . The amount of coverage of the ladder assembly  depends upon the type of testing being performed.","A molecular linker is coated onto the substrate  to bind the energetic material  to the substrate surface . The linker is able to bond with both fuel and oxidizer particles. In one embodiment, the binding sites are not random, but are spaced to non-randomly intermix the fuel and oxidizer for good interfacial surface area.","Suitable molecular-linker materials include polyvinyl pyrrolidone, poly(4-vinyl pyridine), poly(2-vinyl pyridine), poly(ethylene imine), carboxylated poly(ethylene imine) cationic poly(ethylene glycol) grafted copolymers, polyaminde, polyether block amide, poly(acrylic acid), cross-linked polystyrene, poly(vinyl alcohol), poly(n-isopropylacrylamide), copolymer of n-acryloxysuccinimide, poly(acrylontrile), fluorinated polyacarylate, poly(acrylamide), polystyrene-poly(4-vinyl)pyridine and polyisoprene-poly(4-vinyl)pyridine. Metal oxide oxidizer (e.g. CuO etc) and metal fuel particles, such as aluminum particles, are sonicated in alcohol for a time sufficient to achieve homogenous dispersion. In one embodiment, the alcohol is 2-propanol, however, the use of other solvents that allow dispersion of the fuel and oxidizer. A polymer having a \u201cpyridyl\u201d group forms one embodiment of a molecular linker, and poly(4-vinyl pyridine), available from Aldrich Chemical, (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, Mo.). In one embodiment, a solution is prepared having a concentration of about 0.0001-0.1% g\/100 ml of the molecular linker in 2-propanol and is coated onto the substrate . Any suitable coating method is usable to coat the molecular linker solution, but spin-coating and dip-coating are typical.","The presence of material other than fuel and oxidizer tends to slow the burn rate of the energetic material . Cross-linking or bonding of the molecular linker with itself makes is difficult or impossible to remove excess polymer and reduces the burn rate. Thus, another feature of the molecular linker is that it does not bond with itself, allowing excess molecular linker polymer to be removed until essentially a monolayer of molecular linker remains.","After the molecular linker is coated onto the substrate , it is washed in ethanol, then annealed. If used, annealing takes place at temperatures of about 110\u00b0 C. to about 160\u00b0 C. for several hours. When the preferred poly(4-vinyl pyridine) molecular linker  is used, annealing takes place at about 120\u00b0 C. for about 4 hours.","A wide variety of fuels are useful as part of the energetic material. Where the energetic particle is a thermite, the fuel is generally a metal. Such metals include aluminum, boron, beryllium, hafnium, lanthanum, lithium, magnesium, neodymium, tantalum, thorium, titanium, yttrium and zirconium. Metals having a relatively low melting temperature are useful so as to increase the speed at which they burn. The use of two or more metals, either physically mixed or alloyed, is contemplated.","The fuel is optionally formed into a shape, such as a sphere, that allows the fuel to bind compactly with the molecular linker. Sonication is one method for shaping the fuel particles. Fuel is placed in isopropanol and positioned within the sonic field. When activated, the sound waves disperse the fuel, creating extremely small particles that are often substantially monoparticles comprising a few atoms or molecules of fuel. The high degree of dispersion creates an extremely high fuel surface area. Other shapes, or larger particles, are useful in to applications where the extremely fast burn rate is not required.","The oxidizer should be selected to burn rapidly with the chosen fuel. The fuel and the oxidizer are chosen to assure that a self-propagating reaction takes place. As long as the fuel has a higher free energy for oxide formation than the oxidizer, an exothermic replacement reaction will spontaneously occur. Oxidizers include copper oxide (CuO or CuO), silver oxide (AgO or AgO), boron oxide (BO), bismuth oxide (BiO), cobalt oxide (CoO), chromium oxide (CrO), iron oxide (FeO), mercuric oxide (HgO), iodine oxide (IO), manganese oxide (MnO), molybdenum oxide (MoO), niobium oxide (NbO), nickel oxide (NiO or NiO), lead oxide (PbO or PbO), palladium oxide (PdO), silicone oxide (SiO), tin oxide (SnO or SnO), tantalum oxide (TaO), titanium dioxide (TiO), uranium oxide (UO), vanadium oxide (VO) and tungsten oxide (WO).","Optimally, the amounts of fuel and oxidizer present in the thermite are in a stoichiometric ratio for combustion of the fuel with the oxidizer. In one embodiment, the ratios of fuel to oxidizer range from about 1.4 to about 1.8.","Certain embodiments of the ladder assembly  consist of a shaped electrode, or set of electrodes, that form rungs  extending and conductively coupled between two electrode rails . The reference character for the rungs , , , and includes the appended letter to describe such relative aspects as direction of reaction, distance between adjacent electrode rungs and the like. The number of rungs to is a design choice that generally depends on the type of testing to be performed. Each rung to comprises a respective reaction passage determiner  being fabricated at respective prescribed distances from the point of reaction initiation . In one embodiment, the determiner  is a conductive strip of metal that becomes an open circuit when contacted with the heat of a reaction. Various embodiments of determiners  are described in detail with respect to  below.","The igniter  can be, but does not have to be, deposited on the same substrate , and using the same semiconductor processing steps as used to fabricate, the ladder assembly . Certain embodiments of the detector  can thus be formed with the igniter  on a separate chip from the ladder assembly , such, that the igniter  could be re-used or applied to ladder assemblies  with different configurations such as to test different energetic material. The characteristics and operations of electronic igniters such as  are generally well known for modern fuses, propellants, explosives, and the like. In one embodiment, igniter  comprises a pair of spaced apart electrodes  between which an electric arc can be created that is sufficient to initiate the reaction, such as the energetic material  catching fire. One illustrative experimental embodiment of igniter  includes an electrode pair  made of a tri-layer of approximately  angstroms chromium,  angstroms platinum, and 3800 angstroms gold. A variety of configurations, materials, and dimensions of igniter is within the intended scope of the present disclosure. Another form of igniter is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,608,478 issued Oct. 27, 2009.","The reaction propagation velocity detector  quantifies reaction propagation of the energetic materials based on precise timing that successive reaction passage determiners  of the rungs , , , , and undergo some quantifiable change that can be detected by the sensor . From the overall configuration of detector , the distance that each rung , , , , and is from each other (as well as some point of a reaction initiation ) is shown in  as d, d, d, d, and d, and is known or can be determined, and in certain embodiments may be stored in a database for use by the reaction characteristic determining computations. The determiners  have a design and\/or composition to measure a particular reaction characteristic, e.g., velocity, acceleration, temperature, optical, pressure and the like.","In one embodiment, the detector  measures reaction velocity. The velocity is derived by dividing the distances shown as d, d, d, d, and d, (between pairs of points of the reaction passage determiner  or the reaction initiation ) by the time to travel one or more distances. The timing can be derived between the point of reaction initiation  and any of the reaction passage determiners  associated with respective rungs , , , , and ; or alternately between any two rungs , , , , and . Different numbers and configurations of the rungs , , , and and their respective reaction passage determiners  (as well as the remainder of the ladder assembly ), are intended to be within the intended scope of the present disclosure.","Different energetic materials are likely to undergo reactions at different temperatures, and react to yield different measurable characteristics e.g., reaction velocity, temperature, pressure and the like. As such, the materials, configurations, and positions of the rungs , , , , and (and their respective reaction passage determiners ) can be designed or selected not only based on the type of reaction and energetic materials being tested, but also the temperature ranges t which the energetic materials undergo reactions.","In one embodiment, the electrical characteristics of the respective reaction passage determiners  associated with the rungs , , , , and change considerably during reaction passage during testing. The electrical characteristics of the rails  are not intended to change during the reaction, so any change during sensing by the sensor  can be considered a result of changes of the rungs , , , , and (embodied by changes in the respective integrated reaction passage determiners ). Different embodiments of the reaction passage determiners  are configured to rely on a variety of different mechanisms to provide such electrical changes, such as integrating thermocouples, consumable or breakable resistors, or electrical arcs as described below with respect to .","Certain embodiments of the detector  further includes the controller  to control operation, characteristics, timing and analysis performed by the detector .","In one embodiment, the controller  comprises a processor , memory , and support circuits . The processor  may be any commercially available microprocessor, microcontroller, application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) and\/or the like that forms a general purpose computer and, when executing various software, becomes a specific purpose computer for controlling the detector . The processor  is coupled to support circuits  and memory . The support circuits  are well know circuits that facilitate operation of the processor , such as, for example, clock circuits, power supplies, busses, I\/O circuits, network interfaces, cache, and the like.","Certain embodiments of the memory  include a random access memory (RAM) and\/or read only memory (ROM) that together can store computer programs, operands, and other parameters that control the operation of certain embodiments of the controller . The memory  may also store data, information, test results, and the like that can be obtained, retained, or captured by the controller .","Certain embodiments of the controller  store in memory  a reaction characteristic analysis module  comprising an ignition controller module , a reaction passage sensor module  and a timing\/ velocity controller module . In addition, in one embodiment, the memory  may store a distance database . The various modules , , ,  and database  may, in actuality, be a number of different intertwined threads or processes using the resources of a stand-alone or networked processor, computer, processor, etc. Certain embodiments of the ignition controller module  are configured to control the timing of the energetic material ignition via the igniter . The reaction characteristic analysis module , using its constituent modules , ,  and database , to monitor electrical characteristics (e.g., current, voltage, impedance, resistance, and the like) of the ladder assembly . The controller  is coupled to the sensor  that monitors the electrical characteristics of the ladder assembly . The operation of the reaction characteristic analysis module  and its constituent modules is described below with respect to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","136","200","200","202","204"]},"At step , the ignition controller module  applies a voltage to the igniter  to ignite the energetic material. At step , (e.g., an implementation of the reaction passage sensor module ), the method  monitors the progression of the reaction, as the reaction progresses along the ladder assembly  and becomes sequentially proximate each determiner , an electrical characteristic of the ladder assembly  changes (e.g., the resistance of the ladder assembly changes as a determiner is open circuited by the reaction). For instance, the particular change in resistance, or other related electrical characteristic, of the different embodiments of any of the reaction passage determiners  can be detected at the sensor . At step , the method  determines a relative timing of the reaction progression. For instance, based on the sensed change in electric characteristic monitored in step , the method determines the relative timing of reaction propagation, e,g., the amount of time for the reaction to progress from the ignition time to each change in electrical characteristic.","At step , the method  determines the reaction propagation velocity by determining the time for the reaction to travel the known distances from the igniter  to the various determiners . For instance, the method  may calculate a variety of reaction velocities based on the relative time of reaction between any two or more of the point of reaction initiator  and the determiners  Step  represents an exemplary implementation of the timing\/velocity controller module .","In other embodiments, the method  may be used to determine reaction acceleration, reaction temperature profiles, reaction pressure profiles, reaction flash profiles and the like.

In one embodiment the rungs , , , , and are straight and continuous at 50 \u03bcm wide coupled between 50 \u03bcm wide or wider rails . This configuration is designed such that a flame associated with the reaction propagation would break or consume a resistor  associated the electrode rungs , , , , and and not alter the rails . For ease of computation, each thin film resistor  has a substantially identical cross sectional and length configuration, as well as incorporates identical materials, and therefore has substantially identical electrical resistance characteristics. This equal resistance configuration results in a predictably increasing larger change in resistance of the ladder assembly  as successive thin film resistors  are altered (e.g., open circuited). For example, assume that the ladder assembly  includes  electrode rungs. As the first of ten thin film resistors  is open circuited by the reaction, the number of current carrying rungs  are reduced to 90 percent of its original number and as such the resistance through the ladder assembly  increases by 11 percent. As the next thin film resistor  in its respective rung  opens leaving eight rungs  electrically operational, the resistance of the ladder assembly  increases by 12.5 percent of the value when there were nine rungs  intact. The resistance continues to increase as each successive resistor is opened by propagation of the reaction. In absolute terms, assume that each rung  has a resistance of 10 ohms, then the total ladder assembly  with ten electrode rungs  would have a resistance of 1 ohm. Opening the first of ten thin film resistors  would increase the total resistance of the electrode ladder assembly  from 1 to 1.11 ohm. Each successively opened resistor increases the ladder assembly resistance by a measurable amount. In one embodiment, the sensor may drive the ladder assembly with a fixed voltage and measure the current change as the resistance of the ladder assembly incrementally increases with time. In other embodiments, the resistance values may be different in each rung such that the current changes are equal with the opening of each resistor. Other current profiles may be found useful and can be formed through varying the resistor values.","In one embodiment, the detection assembly  or  may be disposable after use. In other embodiments, the detection assembly may be cleaned and the thin film resistors replaced to form a reusable detection assembly.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["111","500","500","104","500","232","112","111"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["111","600","600","600","600"]},"If a voltage of 20-30v (but could also be more or less) is applied to the ladder assembly , then when the reaction crosses each arc gap  electrical breakdown occurs. The breakdown facilitates current flow through the gap. Such electrical breakdown and current flow would be detectable by certain embodiments of the sensor and controller  to determine the velocity of the reaction propagation. As such, as the reaction alters an electrical characteristic of each arc gap  e.g., decreases electrical resistance for each respective rung , , , , and . Such measurements of resistance when different arc gaps  change states, and associated calculations, can be performed by a variety of embodiments of the controller  as described above. In some embodiments, the increase in current may be transient as the reaction passes an arc gap. As such, steady state current into the ladder assembly may not increase with time. As such, the controller measures the number of current spikes and time of each occurrence of each current spike. In this manner, reaction propagation characteristics can be determined.","The foregoing embodiments measured reaction characteristics such as temperature and velocity.
