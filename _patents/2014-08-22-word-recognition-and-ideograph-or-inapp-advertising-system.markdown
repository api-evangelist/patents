{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE\/CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present patent application is a continuation of U.S. Ser. No. 14\/071,372, which was filed on Nov. 4, 2013, the entire content of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.","Communication applications, such as email, text messaging applications, social networking applications, and the like are widely available on mobile devices and other computer systems. These communication applications are largely text based, allowing a user to type a text, message, or letter for transmission to another user in order to communicate. An ideograph is a graphic character used for the meaning of a thing, rather than a word. Communication applications have been augmented to convey emotion in a number of ways. Emoticons are a type of ideograph in which a text based pictorial was used as a representation of a facial expression to convey tone or emotion within a text based message. Emojis are another type of ideograph used in electronic communication to convey tone or emotions which appear inline in a communication. Digital \u201cstickers\u201d are yet another type of ideograph, but often appears out of the normal line of text in an electronic communication. Emoticons, emojis, and stickers may be animated or non-animated. In some applications, \u201cpacks\u201d of multiple ideographs are offered to users and presented as long strings of characters which, once selected by a user, are inserted as the desired ideograph. However, the character strings may be difficult to remember and prone to confusion as there are no standards among chat platforms and communication applications for character strings used to insert certain ideographs. Ideographs may also be placed in menus of these communication applications or may be ported into a communication application from another application on the computing system. In order to include ideographs in text communications, the user may be forced to search a large library of emojis\/emoticons\/stickers, choose the ideograph that best represents the emotion or feeling the user wishes to convey, and then enter the ideograph into the text communication.","It is difficult in any communication application whether it be mobile, tablet, desktop, or web, for users to quickly locate ideographs, such as emoji, emoticons, or stickers, to include in a text or chat while remaining within the application in order to quickly and accurately represent and convey a specified emotion or concept. Therefore, it would be beneficial to have a software technology system which can recognize words and automatically suggest ideographs suitable to replace the word or suitable for insertion into a message containing the word.","This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts that are further described below in the detailed description. This summary is not intended to identify key or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in limiting the scope of the claimed subject matter.","In one embodiment a non-transitory processor readable medium is described having processor executable instructions that when executed by a processor cause the processor to monitor application data from a user device via a communications network, analyze the application data for one or more indicator(s), retrieve one or more ideograph indicative of a graphical representation of one or more meaning of the one or more indicator(s), and transmit the one or more ideograph to the user device via a communications network. The application data is indicative of text entered into an application by a user via the user device. The one or more indicator(s) is at least one word or a portion of the text entered into the application and has one or more meaning(s). The application data may include the word \u201chappy.\u201d This word is an indicator that the user of the user device is conveying that they or someone is in a good mood. One or more ideograph, such as a smiley face, may be automatically retrieved and entered into the application data. The one or more ideograph is retrieved without immediate user action beyond entering the descriptive text into the application.","In another embodiment a mobile device is described with a processor, an input device, and a non-transitory processor readable medium storing processor executable instructions that when executed cause the processor to receive data indicative of text entered into an application by the input device, analyze the data for one or more indicator(s), retrieve one or more ideograph graphically, representing one or more meaning(s) of the one or more indicator(s), and display at least a portion of the text and the one or more ideograph to the user in the application. The application is stored on the non-transitory processor readable medium. The one or more indicator is at least a portion of the text entered into the application and has one or more meanings. The one or more ideograph is retrieved without requiring immediate user action beyond entering the text into the application.","In another version, a mobile device is described as having a processor configured to access a database, an input device coupled to the processor, an output device coupled to the processor, a communications device coupled to the processor, and a non-transitory processor readable medium coupled to the processor.

The communications device is configured to transmit information from a communications network to the processor and transmit information from the processor to the communications network. The non-transitory processor readable medium stores processor executable instructions that when executed cause the processor to receive data indicative of text entered into an application by the input device, analyze the data for one or more indicator(s), retrieve one or more ideograph graphically representing one or more meaning of the one or more indicator(s), and display at least a portion of the text and the one or more ideograph to the user via the output device. The application is stored on the non-transitory processor readable medium. The one or more indicator is at least a portion of the text entered into the application and has one or more meanings. The one or more ideograph is retrieved without immediate user action beyond entering the text into the application.","In another embodiment, a non-transitory processor readable medium is described having processor executable instructions that when executed by a processor cause the processor to receive one or more branded visual content from one or more advertiser, monitor application data received from a user device via a communications network, analyze the application data for one or more indicator, retrieve one or more of the one or more branded visual content representative of the one or more meanings of the one or more indicator(s), and transmit the branded visual content to the user device via the communications network. The application data is indicative of text entered into an application by a user via the user device. The one or more indicator is at least a portion of the text entered into the application, and the one or more indicator has one or more meaning.","However, many modifications are possible without materially departing from the teachings of this disclosure. Accordingly, such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of this disclosure as defined in the claims.","In the following description, numerous details are set forth to provide an understanding of some embodiments of the present disclosure. However, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the system and\/or methodology may be practiced without these details and that numerous variations or modifications from the described embodiments may be possible.","Unless expressly stated to the contrary, \u201cor\u201d refers to an inclusive or and not to an exclusive or. For example, a condition A or B is satisfied by anyone of the following: A is true (or present) and B is false (or not present), A is false (or not present) and B is true (or present), and both A and B are true (or present).","In addition, use of the \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d are employed to describe elements and components of the embodiments herein. This is done merely for convenience and to give a general sense of the inventive concept. This description should be read to include one or at least one and the singular also includes the plural unless otherwise stated.","The terminology and phraseology used herein is for descriptive purposes and should not be construed as limiting in scope. Language such as \u201cincluding,\u201d \u201ccomprising,\u201d \u201chaving,\u201d \u201ccontaining,\u201d or \u201cinvolving,\u201d and variations thereof, is intended to be broad and encompass the subject matter listed thereafter, equivalents, and additional subject matter not recited.","Finally, as used herein any references to \u201cone embodiment\u201d or \u201can embodiment\u201d means that a particular element, feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment.

The word recognition and advertising insertion program - may also be implemented, similarly to the word recognition and advertising insertion program -, as a single application with the word recognition and ideograph insertion programs - and\/or - such that the word recognition and advertising insertion program - may perform the functions of another embodiment of a word recognition and ideograph or in-app advertising system -, as will be described in more detail below.","In one embodiment, the computer system  and the user device  may further include or have access to a database  having a plurality of indicators and a plurality of ideographs linked to form relationships between certain of the plurality of indicators and certain of the plurality of ideographs, as will be explained in more detail below. The database  may be implemented as any desired non-transitory processor readable medium configured to store processor executable instructions and\/or data, for example. The database  may be operably coupled with the processor  and\/or the processor  (e.g., directly or via the network ) so that the database  and the processor  or  may exchange data and\/or signals bi-directionally with one another. It is to be understood that in some exemplary embodiments, the database  may be implemented as a part of the non-transitory processor readable medium  where implemented within the computer system  or as part of the non-transitory processor readable medium  where implemented within the user device . In some other embodiments, the database  may be implemented and located at a separate physical location from the word recognition and ideograph or in-app advertising system  and may be operably coupled to the processor  or  via the network .","Referring now to , therein shown is block diagram of one embodiment of the word recognition and ideograph insertion program -. As previously discussed, at least a portion of the word recognition and ideograph insertion program - may be stored on the one or more non-transitory processor readable medium  of the computer system . In one embodiment, when executed, the word recognition and ideograph insertion program - may cause the one or more processor  to monitor application data  from the user device  via the communications network , as indicated by block . The word recognition and ideograph insertion program - may further cause the processor  to analyze the application data for one or more indicator  within the application data , as indicated by block . The processor  may then retrieve one or more ideograph  indicative of a graphical representation of the one or more meanings of the one or more indicator , as indicated by block . The processor  may then transmit the one or more ideograph  to the user device  via the communications network , as indicated by block .","The application data  may be indicative of text entered into an application by a user via the user device . For example, the application data  may be a text string entered into a smartphone on a text messaging application or email application, stored on the non-transitory processor readable medium  of the user device . The one or more indicator , identified within the application data  by the processor , may be at least a portion of the text entered into the application and may have one or more meaning. In some embodiments, the one or more meaning may be an emotional denotation or connotation. In some embodiments, the processor  may determine the one or more meaning of the one or more indicator  from the database  from the relations between the plurality of indicators and the plurality of ideographs stored on the database . The processor  may also determine meaning from internal or external dictionaries, or other suitable methods.","The one or more ideograph  may be a pictorial representation of the one or more indicator  or the one or more meaning of the one or more indicator  for which the one or more ideograph  is indicative. In some embodiments, the one or more ideograph  is a non-textual graphic, such as an emoticon, emoji, sticker, image, video, series of images, .gif, animations, sounds, sound recordings, video with sound, other media, or combination thereof, for example. In some embodiments, the one or more ideograph  may include one or more branded visual content such as product icons, licensed images, advertising icons, slogans, trademarks, and\/or other images, emoticons, emoji, stickers, video, .gif, animations, sounds, sound recordings, video with sound, jingles, other media, and\/or combinations thereof, for example. However, it should be understood that the one or more ideograph  may be any ideograph conveying at least one of the one or more meaning of the one or more indicator  and\/or providing context or tone clues to the application data . For example, when the one or more indicator  in the application data  is the textual word \u201ccoffee,\u201d the one or more ideograph  may be presented as a coffee cup, a mug with coffee, a coffee bean, or other similar images indicative of the word and\/or contextual meaning for coffee within the application data . It should also be understood that, in addition to general meanings, the one or more indicator  may be replaced by branded visual content where the one or more indicator  specifically references, refers to, or implicates the content. For example, where the one or more indicator  is the name of a company, a company's product, or other similar word, the one or more ideograph  acting as a pictorial representation of that one or more indicator  may be a graphic of a trademark for the company or company product. The one or more ideograph  may be retrieved from the database , from the communications network , from the one or more non-transitory processor readable medium  of the user device , from the one or more non-transitory processor readable medium  of the computer system , from combinations thereof, or from any other suitable source of ideographs accessible to the computer system . The one or more ideograph  may be retrieved without immediate user action beyond entering the text into the application. For example, upon entering the application data  into the application, the processor  may analyze the application data  for the one or more indicator  and retrieve one or more ideograph  indicative of the meaning of the one or more indicator  automatically in response to entering the one or more indicator  into the application. By way of another example, the processor  may be prompted to retrieve one or more ideograph  for the one or more indicator  entered into the application where the application determines that the one or more indicator  has one or more meaning representable by a graphic. The term \u201cimmediate\u201d as used herein refers to a time period in which the user is entering the application data  into the application. Non-immediate user action may be used to set up or enable the word recognition and ideograph insertion program -, configure custom associations between the one or more ideograph  and the one or more indicator , or initiate the application into which the application data  is entered, for example.","Referring now to  and generally to FIGS. ---, therein shown is another representation of an embodiment of the word recognition and ideograph insertion program -. When executed, the word recognition and ideograph insertion program - may cause the processor  to receive data  indicative of text  entered into an application  by the input device , as indicated by block . The text  may be a text stream entered into the application . The application  may be stored on the one or more non-transitory processor readable medium . The processor  may then analyze the data  for one or more indicator , as indicated by block . The processor  may then retrieve one or more ideograph  indicative of a graphical representation of the one or more meanings of the one or more indicator , as indicated by block . The processor  may then display at least a portion of the text  and the one or more ideograph  to the user in the application , as indicated by block .","The one or more indicator  may be at least a portion of the text  entered into the application . The one or more indicator  may have one or more meanings, which in some embodiments may be one or more emotional denotations or connotations such as happy, sad, angry, or the like, for example. In some embodiments, the processor  may determine the one or more meaning of the one or more indicator  from the database , from the relations between the plurality of indicators and the plurality of ideograph stored on the database . The processor  may also determine the one or more meaning from internal or external dictionaries, or other suitable methods such as a data table forming links from particular words or phrases to particular ideographs, for example.","As previously discussed, the one or more ideograph  may be a pictorial representation of the one or more indicator  or the one or more meaning of the one or more indicator  and may be associated with the one or more indicator  and one or more meaning by the relational tags. In some embodiments, the one or more ideograph  is a non-textual graphic, such as an emoticon, emoji, sticker, image, video, series of images, .gif, other media, or combination thereof, for example. In some embodiments, the one or more ideograph  may include one or more branded visual content such as product icons, licensed images, advertising icons, slogans, trademarks, and\/or other images, emoticons, emoji, stickers, video, .gif, other media, and\/or combinations thereof, for example. However, it should be understood that the one or more ideograph  may be any media conveying at least one of the one or more meaning of the one or more indicator  and\/or providing context or tone clues to the data .","In analyzing the data , the processor  may pass the data  to an application programming interface (API), a software development kit (SDK), or other interface. The interface may be included in the database , stored on the non-transitory processor readable medium , stored on the non-transitory processor readable medium , or accessible via the communications network . The interface may search for the one or more indicator , for example by searching the data  for keywords such as the one or more indicator . Once one or more indicator  has been found within the data , the interface may further search for any corresponding words or emotions related to the one or more indicator  located within the data  which may be suitable for graphical representation by the one or more ideograph. For example, if a user inputs a first indicator - \u201csmile\u201d, the first indicator - would be passed to the interface and associated indicators -, which may have a relationship to the first indicator -, such as \u201chappy,\u201d \u201cpleased,\u201d \u201cgrin,\u201d and \u201cdelighted\u201d would also be collected. The processor  may then search for the one or more corresponding ideograph  based on one or more relational tags associated with the one or more ideograph  and indicative of a relationship between certain of the one or more indicator  and the one or more ideograph .","The one or more relational tags may be words associated with the one or more ideograph  within the database , the non-transitory processor readable medium , or the non-transitory processor readable medium  where the one or more ideograph  are stored. For example, where the one or more ideograph  is a heart, the relational tags may include love, like, heart, affection, amity, ardor, cherish, crush, lust, passion, and other words related to or depicted by the heart.
