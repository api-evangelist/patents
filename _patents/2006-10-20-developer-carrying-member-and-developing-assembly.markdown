{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a continuation of International Application No. PCT\/JP2006\/314930, filed Jul. 21, 2006, which claims the benefit of Japanese Patent Application Nos. 2005-211658, filed Jul. 21, 2005 and 2005-211681, filed Jul. 21, 2005.","1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates to a developer carrying member used to develop electrostatic latent images formed on an electrostatic latent image bearing member such as an electrophotographic photosensitive member or an electrostatic recording dielectric in electrophotography, and a developing assembly in which such a developer carrying member is set.","2. Description of the Related Art","A number of methods are conventionally known as methods for electrophotography. In general, copies are obtained by forming an electrostatic latent image on an electrostatic latent image bearing member such as a photosensitive member by utilizing a photoconductive material and by various means, subsequently developing the electrostatic latent image by the use of a toner to form a toner image, transferring the toner image to a transfer material such as paper as occasion calls, and thereafter fixing the toner image onto the transfer material by the action of heat and\/or pressure.","In recent years, electrophotographic apparatus such as printers and copying machines have been made high-resolution as a trend of techniques. For example, those which hitherto have a resolution of 300 dpi or 600 dpi are being replaced by those having a resolution of 1,200 dpi or 2,400 dpi. Accordingly, developing systems are correspondingly required to achieve a higher minuteness.","In addition, in the field of electrophotography, color image formation is on rapid progress. Color images are formed by development performed by superimposing yellow, magenta, cyan and black four-color toners appropriately, and hence the respective-color toners are sought to have a higher developing performance than those in monochrome image formation. Accordingly, it has become important to control the chargeability of color toners uniformly.","It, however, is difficult to regulate the charging of toners, and various measures are being taken on toners. Nevertheless, especially in the case of one-component developing systems, it is demanded to further improve toners in their charge uniformity and running stability of charging.","In particular, as the developer carrying member such as a developing sleeve is repeatedly rotated, what is called charge-up tends to occur, which is a phenomenon in which the charge quantity of the toner coated on the developing sleeve becomes too high because of contact with the developing sleeve. Once it occurs, the toner is very strongly attracted to the developing sleeve surface to come to stand immobile on the developing sleeve surface to become not movable to the latent images on the photosensitive drum from the developing sleeve. If such a phenomenon of charge-up occurs, the toner can not easily be charged at its upper-layer portion in a toner layer on the developing sleeve surface. For this reason, the toner that participates in development decreases, and hence this tends to cause thin line images and a decrease in image density of solid images. A phenomenon may further come about in which such toner not properly charged because of the phenomenon of charge-up flows out onto the developing sleeve to cause line-shaped, blotchy or wavy non-uniformity.","Toners are recently made to have small particle diameter in order to make electrophotographic apparatus digital and make them achieve much higher image quality, and made to have closely spherical particle shape in order to reduce waste toners.","However, where a toner having been made to have a small particle diameter and made spherical is used, the toner is improved in fluidity, but on the other hand shows a tendency that it is difficult for the toner to be coated on the developing sleeve in a uniform thin layer. Accordingly, in order for such a toner to be uniformly coated on the developing sleeve, it is necessary to enhance toner control power by using a developer layer thickness control member such as a developing blade. Especially in a low-temperature and low-humidity environment, the charge quantity of toner per unit mass tends to increase. Hence, the toner may non-uniformly be charged to tend to cause image density decrease and image density non-uniformity, and also the toner having strongly adhered onto the developing sleeve may grow to melt-adhere thereto to cause faulty images such as fog and vertical streaks.","In a high-temperature and high-humidity environment, because of the use of materials which make the toner readily flowable by physical force and heat in order to improve low-temperature fixing performance, melt adhesion of the toner to the developing sleeve surface and developing blade surface is accelerated as a result of the fact that the toner is repeatedly rubbed between the developing sleeve and the developing blade with repetition of copying and then undergoes a stress. This tends to seriously cause faulty images such as fog, image density non-uniformity and vertical streaks.","Meanwhile, as a method for resolving such a phenomenon, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. H08-240981 discloses use of a developing sleeve comprising a metallic substrate and provided thereon with a resin coat layer in which a conductive material or solid lubricant such as carbon black or graphite particles is dispersed.","The use of such a developer carrying member is seen to make the above phenomenon of charge-up vastly less occur, and further to make the toner less melt-adhere to the developing sleeve surface in a high-temperature and high-humidity environment.","However, in the above developer carrying member, the profile of surface unevenness of the resin coat layer is not uniform and also the lubricity of the resin coat layer surface is not sufficiently uniform, and hence it is necessary to more improve charge characteristics by which the toner can uniformly and quickly be charged. Also, in long-term and long-running service, especially where the toner having been made spherical is used, part of the resin coat layer surface stands easily causative of toner melt adhesion because of an influence of non-uniform hills in unevenness of the resin coat layer surface and because of such non-uniform lubricity of the resin coat layer surface. Accordingly, since the toner may come to be non-uniformly triboelectrically charged to cause fog seriously and cause image density non-uniformity, sleeve ghosts and line-shaped image defects, there is room for improvement.","In particular, in the case when the developer carrying member having the resin coat layer in which the solid lubricant such as graphite particles has been dispersed is used, the resin coat layer surface has lubricity due to the scaly structure of graphite, and hence brings out a sufficient effect against sleeve ghosts which may be caused by the charge-up. However, the graphite particles are not easily uniformly be dispersed in the coating resin because of their shape which is scaly and amorphous and the particles have particle diameters as large as 2 to 30 \u03bcm and also have a broad particle size distribution. As the result, a resin coat layer which contains only the graphite particles in a large quantity may have a non-uniform surface profile to tend to cause wear and liberation of the graphite particles themselves and any local poor lubricity, at the resin coat layer surface. Hence, where the developer carrying member is used in long running, its resin coat layer may come to wear to change in surface roughness and surface composition and also cause toner contamination, to tend to cause faulty transport of toner and make the toner charged non-uniformly.","A method is also disclosed in which, as a conductive material, specific carbon black having a high electrical conductivity, such as KETJEN BLACK or acetylene black, is used in the resin coat layer of the developer carrying member. For example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2001-331032 discloses a developing roller having a resin coat layer which contains KETJEN BLACK. Japanese Patent No. 2795168 also discloses a developing roller having an elastic layer which contains acetylene black.","Carbon black commonly has a small particle diameter and a large specific surface area and its structures stand developed. Hence, it has a high DBP oil absorption. According to the internet website of Lion Corporation, \u201cIntroduction of carbon black KETJEN BLACK\u201d, searched on Sep. 21, 2002, on Internet <URL:http:\/\/www.\/lion.co.jp\/chem\/jn\/sectop\/carbon\/k intro.htm>, KETJEN BLACK EC300J has a DBP oil absorption of as high as 360 ml\/100 g; and KETJEN BLACK EC600JD, 495 ml\/100 g. However, the carbon black having a high DBP oil absorption like KETJEN BLACK can not easily uniformly be dispersed in the resin coat layer. Hence, the effect of keeping the toner from charging up is not sufficiently brought out to tend to make the toner charged non-uniformly, and also tend to cause a leak of development bias, starting from the agglomeration of KETJEN BLACK. The carbon black like KETJEN BLACK may also insufficiently provide the resin coat layer with lubricity to tend to make the toner melt-adhere to the resin coat layer surface during long-term service. In this aspect as well, the toner tends to come charged insufficiently. Further, KETJEN BLACK tends to vary in resistivity depending on humidity, and hence may come to have a low charge-providing performance to toner especially in a high-temperature and high-humidity environment.","Meanwhile, the acetylene black is carbon black obtained by partial combustion of acetylene, and is usually produced by thermal decomposition or by a combustion process. As described in \u201cProperties and Optimum Formulation of Carbon Black and Its Application Techniques\u201d, page 284, published by K.K. Gijutu Joho Kyokai on May 26, 1997, this acetylene black as well has a DBP oil absorption as high as 250 ml\/100 g, and also its structures stand developed. Such structures come into contact with one another to form conducting paths to thereby manifest the electrical conductivity. However, because of the one having a high DBP oil absorption, like the above KETJEN BLACK, it can not easily be dispersed in the resin coat layer to tend to make it insufficient to keep the phenomenon of charge-up of toner from occurring, and tend to make the toner charged non-uniformly. In addition, the resin coat layer is insufficiently provided with the lubricity, and hence the toner tends to melt-adhere to the resin coat layer surface during long-term service, also tending to make the toner charged non-uniformly.","Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. H07-013415 discloses a developing roller comprising a substrate and provided thereon a resin coat layer in which an ionic conductor has been dispersed in addition to a conductive fine powder such as carbon black and crystalline graphite particles. In this method, the addition of the ionic conductor is seen to be effective in keeping the phenomenon of charge-up of toner from occurring. However, the ionic conductor has a high humidity dependence. Hence, it follows that the resin coat layer varies greatly in its resistivity to cause a decrease in charge quantity of toner especially in a high-temperature and high-humidity environment. Thus, this method is still insufficient in regard to image density stability and fog during long-term service.","Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a developer carrying member and a developing assembly which, even in continuous copying over a long term, do not cause any charge-up of toner, and prevent the toner from melt-adherent to the developer carrying member surface and developer layer thickness control member surface to maintain the state of uniform coating of a developer having a toner and to make the toner uniformly and quickly triboelectrically charged, so as to obtain high-grade images free of any image density decrease, image density non-uniformity, sleeve ghosts, fog and vertical streaks under service conditions in which running performance is required.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a developer carrying member and a developing assembly which are able to stably obtain high-grade images having a high image density, without causing the problems such as image density decrease, image density non-uniformity, vertical streaks and fog even in high-temperature and high-humidity and low-temperature and low-humidity environments.","Still another object of the present invention is to provide a developer carrying member and a developing assembly which prevent the phenomenon of charge-up of toner that tends to occur when images are formed using a toner having small particle diameter or a toner made spherical to a high degree, to make the toner less melt-adhere to the developer carrying member surface and developer layer thickness control member surface to maintain the state of uniform coating of a developer having a toner and to make the toner uniformly and quickly triboelectrically charged, so as to obtain high-grade images free of any image density decrease, image density non-uniformity, sleeve ghosts, fog and vertical streaks.","The above objects of the present invention are achieved by the following means.","A developer carrying member which holds thereon a developer having a toner for developing an electrostatic latent image held on an electrostatic latent image bearing member, wherein the developer carrying member has at least a substrate and a resin coat layer on the surface of the substrate, and the resin coat layer contains at least a binder resin and a carbon black, where the graphite (002) plane measured by X-ray diffraction of the carbon black has a lattice spacing of from 0.3370 nm or more to 0.3450 nm or less.","According to the present invention, the resin coat layer of the developer carrying member has superior lubricity and wear resistance, and this enables a developer carrying member and a developing assembly to be provided which, even in continuous copying for a long time, do not cause any charge-up of toner, and prevent the toner from melt-adhering to the developer carrying member surface and developer layer thickness control member surface to maintain the state of uniform coating of a developer having a toner and to make the toner uniformly and quickly triboelectrically charged, to thereby obtain high-grade images free of any image density decrease, image density non-uniformity, sleeve ghosts, fog and vertical streaks under conditions in which running performance is required.","Further features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of exemplary embodiments with reference to the attached drawings.","The present invention is described below in detail by giving preferred embodiments.","The developer carrying member of the present invention is described first.","The developer carrying member of the present invention is a developer carrying member which holds thereon a developer having a toner for developing an electrostatic latent image held on an electrostatic latent image bearing member. It is essential that the developer carrying member has at least a substrate and a resin coat layer on the surface of the substrate, and the resin coat layer contains at least a binder resin and a carbon black, where the graphite (002) plane measured by X-ray diffraction of the carbon black has a lattice spacing [d(002)] of from 0.3370 nm or more to 0.3450 nm or less.","Inasmuch as the graphite (002) plane measured by X-ray diffraction of the carbon black has a lattice spacing (hereinafter also \u201cd(002)\u201d) of from 0.3370 nm or more to 0.3450 nm or less, the resin coat layer surface can readily be formed in uniform lubricity and electrical conductivity, and further the resin coat layer surface can not easily change during its running. Hence, the developer carrying member brings out the effect of keeping the toner from charging up, over a long period of time, so that the toner can not easily come to melt-adhere to the developer carrying member surface and also the developer is stably uniformly be charged. The X-ray diffraction pattern 2\u03b8 measured by this X-ray diffraction of the carbon black has a main peak at from 25.84\u00b0 or more to 26.46\u00b0 or less.","It is difficult to produce carbon black having d(002) of less than 0.3370 nm, because it is difficult to effect crystallization. If on the other hand carbon black having d(002) of more than 0.3450 nm is used, the resin coat layer may have insufficient lubricity and electrical conductivity to damage the effect of keeping the toner from charging up and the effect of making the toner less melt-adhere to the developer carrying member surface.","In order to control the d(002)\u2033 of the carbon black so as to be from 0.3370 nm or more to 0.3450 nm or less, it is preferable to graphitize the carbon black.","Conventionally, the resistivity of the resin coat layer has been regulated by the type and amount of a substance having electrical conductivity which is to be incorporated in the resin coat layer. In particular, the carbon black has been in wide use because it can achieve certain arbitrary electrical conductivity only by controlling the amount for its addition. Where, however, the carbon black is used, it has often come about that the toner is inhibited from being charged because, if the carbon black is added in a small quantity, it is difficult to make the resin coat layer have resistivity at a desired low level, or because the toner comes to melt-adhere to the resin coat layer of the developer carrying member surface. If on the other hand the carbon black is added in a large quantity, it has come about that the carbon black present at the surface of the resin coat layer is in so high a proportion that the resin coat layer, although it can have a sufficient electrical conductivity, may conversely has a low film strength. Hence, it has been unable to maintain wear resistance in long-term service. Further, if the carbon black is added to a coating material in a large quantity when the resin coat layer is formed, a coating material fluid has a high viscosity when the carbon black is dispersed in a coating material resin fluid, to make it difficult to uniformly disperse the carbon black and other components in the coating material. As the result, the carbon black comes distributed non-uniformly in the resin coat layer formed, to cause problems on leak resistance and uniform charge-providing performance to toner.","On the other hand, the carbon black having the d(002) of from 0.3370 nm or more to 0.3450 nm or less is one in which the crystallinity of conventional carbon black has been made close to that of graphite. Accordingly, where this carbon black is incorporated in the resin coat layer, a resin coat layer having more uniform charge characteristics can be materialized. In particular, the higher crystallinity the carbon black has, the higher the above characteristics can be made.","The carbon black having been graphitized (hereinafter also \u201cgraphitized carbon black\u201d) as used in the present invention is obtained by graphitizing conventional carbon black by its heat treatment. The graphitized carbon black thus obtained has no functional groups present on particle surfaces and has a good electrical conductivity. It also contains impurities (e.g., sulfur and chlorine) only in a very small level, and has a small water adsorptivity. Hence, it has a characteristic feature that its conducting properties may less change depending on environment. In addition thereto, the graphitized carbon black has particle surfaces which have been changed over to a graphite crystal structure having good lubricating properties, and hence the surface of the developer carrying member having the resin coat layer containing this can no longer easily come contaminated by the toner. Thus, the incorporation of such graphitized carbon black in the resin coat layer at the developer carrying member surface enables the developer to be prevented from charging up, by its addition in a small quantity and also brings an improvement in film strength of the resin coat layer, making it possible for the developer to be stably and uniformly charged.","The carbon black serving as a raw material of the graphitized carbon black used in the present invention may include carbon black, lamp black, thermal black and channel black produced by a conventionally known furnace process, channel process or thermal process, and various by-product carbon blacks, any of which may be used. In the present invention, for the reasons as stated previously, carbon black is used which has been made to have the d(002) of from 0.3370 nm or more to 0.3450 nm or less by, e.g., graphitizing any of these carbon blacks. The use of the one obtained by graphitizing carbon black of various types is desirable for stabilizing the resin coat layer.","The carbon black may be graphitized by putting carbon black kept filled in a graphite crucible, into a usual Acheson furnace or high-frequency furnace, and heating the same in a non-oxidizing atmosphere. Temperature in graphitizing it may preferably be set within the range of from 1,700\u00b0 C. to 3,200\u00b0 C. If the temperature falls below this range, the graphitization does not proceed sufficiently, and any heating at a temperature beyond this range is unnecessary.","The crystallinity of such graphitized carbon black may be regulated by changing the temperature at the time of graphitization within the range of from 1,700\u00b0 C. to 3,200\u00b0 C.","The carbon black used in the present invention may preferably have an average primary particle diameter of from 10 nm or more to 100 nm or less, and more preferably from 12 nm or more to 80 nm or less. If it has an average primary particle diameter of less than 10 nm, the crystallization may proceed with difficulty when the carbon black is graphitized. Also, particles may mutually be highly agglomerative when the carbon black is dispersed, so that the coating material fluid obtained by dispersing the carbon black together with a coating material resin may have so high viscosity as to make the carbon black dispersed non-uniformly in the coating material fluid. If on the other hand the carbon black has an average primary particle diameter of more than 100 nm, it is difficult for the carbon black to be uniformly dispersed in the coating material fluid. As the result, the carbon black may come distributed unevenly at the resin coat layer surface to make electrical conductivity and lubricity poor at the resin coat layer surface at its part where the carbon black is present in a small quantity, to make uneven the developing performance of the developer carrying member. Also, the resin coat layer may wear or the development bias may come to leak, starting from large particles of carbon black as nuclei.","The carbon black used in the present invention may preferably have a DBP oil absorption of from 50 ml\/100 g or more to 200 ml\/100 g or less, and more preferably from 50 ml\/100 g or more to 150 ml\/100 g or less. The DBP oil absorption is indicated as a parameter of structures that is a standard of how the carbon black stand agglomerated. As long as it is within the above range, the carbon black has good electrical conductivity and dispersibility. This makes the carbon black less uneven or agglomerated in the resin coat layer formed at the developer carrying member surface, makes the resin coat layer provided with uniform electrical conductivity, makes the toner well chargeable, and enables improvement in leak resistance and wear resistance. In the present invention, the DBP oil absorption of the carbon black is measured according to JIS K 6217-1997.","If carbon black is used in which its structures stand so developed as to have a DBP oil absorption of more than 200 ml\/100 g, the coating material may have so large viscosity as not to make dispersion uniform in the step of dispersing the coating material when the resin coat layer is formed, so that the carbon black may agglomerate in the resin coat layer to tend to cause a leak of development bias and make the resin coat layer have a low film strength, making it difficult to achieve good developing performance.","If on the other hand the carbon black has a DBP oil absorption of less than 50 ml\/100 g, the carbon black may have a poor dispersion stability in the coating material when the resin coat layer is formed, so that the resin coat layer surface may have a low uniformity in electrical conductivity and a low lubricity to tend to cause the charge-up of the developer and also tend to cause a decrease in image density which is due to non-uniformity charging of the developer and make fog, density non-uniformity and so forth occur greatly.","The carbon black used in the present invention may further preferably have a BET specific surface area of 500 m\/g or less, and more preferably 300 m\/g or less. If it has a BET specific surface area of more than 500 m\/g, the coating material may have so large viscosity as not to make dispersion uniform when the resin coat layer is formed, so that the carbon black may agglomerate in the resin coat layer to tend to cause a leak of development bias and make the resin coat layer have a low film strength, resulting in poor developing performance.","Further, in the present invention, graphitized carbon black may be used to the particle surfaces of which organic groups have been covalent-bonded to effect modification treatment of its particle surfaces. Such treatment effected brings an improvement in affinity for the coat resin of the carbon black because the organic groups are present at the particle surfaces of the graphitized carbon black in the state of being covalent-bonded, and enables the graphitized carbon black to be well dispersible. As the result, the resin coat layer to be obtained can be much improved in charge-providing performance and wear resistance to enable remarkable improvement in image quality of electrophotographs.","As a method for the modification treatment of the particle surfaces of the graphitized carbon black, available are, e.g., a method in which the particle surfaces are treated with an organometallic compound having an element such as titanium, aluminum, zirconium or silicon, and a method in which the particles are heated in the presence of a radical polymerization initiator. The organometallic compound used here may specifically include the following: Titanium chelate compounds, titanium coupling agents, aluminum chelate compounds, aluminum coupling agents, zirconium coupling agents and silane coupling agents. The radical polymerization initiator may include, e.g., organic peroxides, azo compounds and persulfate compounds. Any of these compounds may be used alone, or may be used in combination. Stated specifically, a method is available in which the graphitized carbon black is put into a mixed solvent of water and an organic solvent such as alcohol and is dispersed therein, and then the above compound for surface treatment is added to the resultant dispersion in an appropriate quantity, followed by heating.","In the present invention, it is desirable that the resin coat layer formed at the surface of the developer carrying member is electrically conductive in order to prevent the developer from sticking to the developer carrying member surface because of the charge-up, and the developer from being defectively charged.","The resin coat layer may preferably have a volume resistivity of 10\u03a9cm or less, and more preferably 10\u03a9cm or less. If the resin coat layer has a volume resistivity of more than 10\u03a9cm, the toner may stick to the developer carrying member surface because of the charge-up and the toner may tend to come charged defectively.","In order to attain the above volume resistivity as the resin coat layer, the carbon black used in the present invention may preferably be added in an amount of from 8 parts by mass to 100 parts by mass based on 100 parts by mass of the binder resin to be contained in the resin coat layer. If it is added in an amount of less than 8 parts by mass, the resin coat layer may have a high volume resistivity and also a poor lubricity to tend to cause deterioration of developing performance because of the charge-up of toner and also cause sticking or melt adhesion of toner to the developer carrying member surface. If on the other hand it is added in an amount of more than 100 parts by mass, the resin coat layer may have a low charge-providing performance to toner and a low film strength to make the toner come charged non-uniformly, resulting in a poor developing performance.","In the developer carrying member of the present invention, having the substrate and the resin coat layer on the substrate surface, other conductive fine particles may further be used in combination together with the carbon black, as long as they do not damage the properties of the carbon black. Such conductive fine particles may include, e.g., fine powders of metals such as aluminum, copper, nickel and silver; and metal oxides such as antimony oxide, indium oxide, tin oxide, titanium oxide, zinc oxide, molybdenum oxide and potassium titanate.","As the binder resin used in the resin coat layer constituting the developer carrying member of the present invention, any known resins conventionally commonly used in resin coat layers of developer carrying members may be used. It may include, e.g., the following: Thermoplastic resins such as styrene resins, vinyl resins, polyether sulfone resins, polycarbonate resins, polyphenylene oxide resins, polyamide resins, fluorine resins and acrylic resins; and thermo- or photosetting resins such as epoxy resins, polyester resins, alkyd resins, phenolic resins, melamine resins, polyurethane resins, urea resins, silicone resins and polyimide resins. In particular, preferred are resins having releasability, such as silicone resins and fluorine resins; or resins having good mechanical properties, such as polyether sulfone resins, polycarbonate resins, polyphenylene oxide resins, polyamide resins, phenolic resins, polyester resins, polyurethane resins, styrene resins and acrylic resins.","In the present invention, in order to regulate the charge-providing performance of the developer carrying member, a charge control agent may further be incorporated in the resin coat layer. In such a case, the charge control agent may be in a content of from 1 part by mass to 100 parts by mass based on 100 parts by mass of the binder resin to be contained in the resin coat layer. If it is in a content of less than 1 part by mass, the effect to be brought by the addition of the charge control agent is not seen. If it is in a content of more than 100 part by mass, it may poorly dispersed in the resin coat layer to tend to cause a lowering of film strength.","The charge control agent may include, e.g., the following: Nigrosine and modified products thereof, modified with a fatty acid metal salt; quaternary ammonium salts such as tributylbenzylammonium 1-hydroxy-4-naphthosulfonate and tetrabutylammonium teterafluoroborate, and analogues of these, including onium salts such as phosphonium salts, and lake pigments of these (lake-forming agents may include tungstophosphoric acid, molybdophosphoric acid, tungstomolybdophosphoric acid, tannic acid, lauric acid, gallic acid, ferricyanides and ferrocyanides); metal salts of higher fatty acids; diorganotin oxides such as dibutyltin oxide, dioctyltin oxide and dicyclohexyltin oxide; diorganotin borates such as dibutyltin borate, dioctyltin borate and dicyclohexyltin borate; guanidine compounds, and imidazole compounds.","The resin coat layer constituting the developer carrying member of the present invention may further be incorporated with graphitized particles. In the present invention, the graphitized particles may preferably have, in their X-ray diffraction chart obtained by measurement by X-ray diffraction, a main peak at from 25.46\u00b0 or more to 26.67\u00b0or less, and more preferably at from 25.46\u00b0 or more to 25.84\u00b0 or less, in the X-ray diffraction pattern 2\u03b8. If the position of the main peak in 2\u03b8 exceeds 26.67\u00b0, the use of the graphitized particles is effective for the initial-stage developing performance and in making melt adhesion less occur, but the graphitization has proceeded in excess to make the resin coat layer have a low hardness, so that the developer carrying member may not sufficiently be provided with durability. In graphitized particles the position of the main peak in 2\u03b8 of which is less than 25.46\u00b0, the graphitization has not sufficiently proceeded, and hence image improvements such as improvement in developing performance and improvement in resistance to melt adhesion are less effective to bring about a poor image stability. In the present invention, the graphitized particles may also preferably be particles having a number average particle diameter of from 0.5 \u03bcm or more to 25.0 \u03bcm or less.","The graphitized particles in the present invention may be obtained by the methods shown below, which, however, are not necessarily limited to these methods.","As a method for obtaining especially preferable graphitized particles used in the present invention, graphitization is effected using, as a raw material, particles which are optically anisotropic and formed of a single phase, such as mesocarbon microbeads or bulk mesophase pitch particles. This is preferable in order to make the graphitized particles have a high degree of graphitization and also retain their spherical shape. Optical anisotropy of the above raw material comes from stacks of aromatic molecules, and its orderliness develops further by graphitization treatment, so that the graphitized particles having been graphitized to a high degree can be obtained.","In the case when the bulk mesophase pitch is used as the raw material from which the graphitized particles are to be obtained, a bulk mesophase pitch capable of softening and melting with heating may preferably be used in order to obtain graphitized particles which are spherical and have a high degree of graphitization. What is typical as a method for obtaining the bulk mesophase pitch, it is, e,g, a method in which \u03b2-resin is extracted from coal-tar pitch or the like by solvent fractionation, and this is hydrogenated to carry out heavy-duty treatment to obtain the mesophase pitch. The mesophase pitch may further be finely pulverized after the heavy-duty treatment and then treated with benzene or toluene to remove the solvent-soluble matter. This bulk mesophase pitch may preferably have 95% by mass or more of quinoline-soluble matter. If one having less than 95% by mass of the same is used, the interiors of particles can not easily be liquid-phase carbonized and may come solid-phase carbonized, and hence the particles formed may be kept in a crushed state not to obtain any spherical particles.","As a method for obtaining the graphitized particles by using mesophase pitch, first, the above bulk mesophase pitch is finely pulverized into a size of from 2 \u03bcm to 25 \u03bcm, and the particles obtained are subjected to heat treatment in air at about 200\u00b0 C. to 350\u00b0 C. to carry out oxidation treatment lightly. This oxidation treatment makes the bulk mesophase pitch particles infusible only at their surfaces, and the particles are prevented from melting or fusing at the time of heat treatment for graphitization in the next step. The bulk mesophase pitch particles having been subjected to oxidation treatment may preferably have an oxygen content of from 5% by mass to 15% by mass. If they have an oxygen content of less than 5% by mass, particles tend to greatly fuse one another at the time of heat treatment. If they have an oxygen content of more than 15% by mass, particles may be oxidized up to their interiors, and may be graphitized as their shape is in a crushed state to make it difficult to obtain spherical particles. Such difficulties may come. Next, the bulk mesophase pitch particles having thus been subjected to oxidation treatment are subjected to primary firing at about 800\u00b0 C. to 1,200\u00b0 C. to make them carbonized and subsequently to secondary firing at about 2,000\u00b0 C. to 3,500\u00b0 C. both in an inert atmosphere of nitrogen, argon or the like to obtain the desired graphitized particles.","As a method for obtaining the mesocarbon microbeads, another preferable raw material for obtaining the graphitized particles used in the present invention, a typical method is as follows: Coal type heavy oil or petroleum type heavy oil is subjected to heat treatment at a temperature of from 300\u00b0 C. to 500\u00b0 C. to effect polycondensation to form crude mesocarbon microbeads. Then the reaction product obtained is subjected to treatment such as filtration, sedimentation by leaving at rest, or centrifugation, to separate mesocarbon microbeads, followed by washing with a solvent such as benzene, toluene or xylene, and further followed by drying to obtain the mesocarbon microbeads.","As a method for graphitization using the mesocarbon microbeads thus obtained, the mesocarbon microbeads having been dried are first kept mechanically primarily dispersed by a force mild enough not to break them. This is preferable in order to prevent particles from coalescing after graphitization and attain uniform particle size. The mesocarbon microbeads having been thus kept primarily dispersed are subjected to primary heat treatment at a temperature of from 200\u00b0 C. to 1,500\u00b0 C. in an inert atmosphere to undergo carbonization. The carbonized product having been subjected to the primary heat treatment is also mechanically dispersed by a force mild enough not to break the carbonized product. This is preferable in order to prevent particles from coalescing after graphitization or attain uniform particle size. The carbonized product having been subjected to such secondary dispersion treatment are subjected to secondary heat treatment at a temperature of from about 2,000\u00b0 C. to 3,500\u00b0 C. in an inert atmosphere to obtain the desired graphitized particles.","In producing the graphitized particles by using any raw materials, the particles may preferably be fired at the temperature of from 2,000\u00b0 C. to 3,500\u00b0 C. If the particles are fired at a temperature of less than 2,000\u00b0 C., the graphitized particles have a high hardness and hence show a tendency of being improved in durability, but the graphitized particles may stand graphitized insufficiently and may have low electrical conductivity and lubricity to cause the charge-up of toner, tending to make image quality poor because of image density decrease, fog, spots around letters, and so forth. Such particles may further cause rub scratches on the developer layer thickness control member when an elastic member is used in the control member, tending to cause lines and non-uniformity in solid images. If the particles are fired at a temperature of more than 3,500\u00b0 C., the graphitized particles may stand graphitized in excess, and hence the graphitized particles may have a low hardness to tend to make the resin coat layer have a low wear resistance, a low mechanical strength and a low charge-providing performance to toner because of a poor wear resistance of the graphitized particles.","The graphitized particles in the resin coat layer may preferably be in a content of from 2 parts by mass to 150 parts by mass, and more preferably from 4 parts by mass to 100 parts by mass, based on 100 parts by mass of the binder resin in the resin coat layer. If the graphitized particles are in a content of less than 2 parts by mass, the addition of the graphitized particles may be less effective. If they are in a content of more than 150 parts by mass, the resin coat layer may have too low adherence, resulting in a poor wear resistance.","In the present invention, the carbon black having the d(002) of from 0.3370 nm or more to 0.3450 nm or less and the graphitized particles may preferably be in a mixing proportion [(mass of carbon black)\/(mass of graphitized particles)] of from 0.01 to 20.00, more preferably from 0.04 to 5.00, and still more preferably from 0.04 to 2.00, in the interior of the resin coat layer.","Unevenness-providing particles may further be incorporated in the resin coat layer constituting the developer carrying member of the present invention. The unevenness-providing particles has the effects of making the resin coat layer surface of the developer carrying member retain an appropriate surface roughness to improve the transport performance of the developer having a toner, providing more opportunities of contact between the developer and the resin coat layer and also improving the wear resistance of the resin coat layer, and further moderating the pressure applied from an elastic blade to developer particles when an elastic blade is used as the developer layer thickness control member, to make the toner not easily melt-adhere to the developer carrying member.","The unevenness-providing particles may preferably have a volume average particle diameter of from 1 \u03bcm to 20 \u03bcm, and more preferably from 2 to 15 \u03bcm. If the unevenness-providing particles have a volume average particle diameter of less than 1 \u03bcm, the effects to be brought by their addition may be obtained with difficulty. If on the other hand the unevenness-providing particles have a volume average particle diameter of more than 20 \u03bcm, the resin coat layer surface may have so non-uniform surface roughness and also may have so large surface roughness as to make the toner insufficiently chargeable and further tend to make the toner melt-adhere in the vicinity of such unevenness-providing particles to cause poor image quality such as fog and image density decrease. In addition, when the elastic blade is used, the blade tends to cause scratches because of hill-shaped portions of unevenness which stand protruded to the resin coat layer surface, and the development bias may tend to come to leak starting from such hill-shaped portions of unevenness which stand protruded.","The unevenness-providing particles may preferably have a true density of 3 g\/cmor less, more preferably 2.7 g\/cmor less, and still more preferably from 0.9 to 2.3 g\/cm. If the unevenness-providing particles have a true density of more than 3 g\/cm, the unevenness-providing particles may insufficiently be dispersible in the resin coat layer, and hence the resin coat layer surface may not easily be provided with uniform roughness to tend to make the toner charged non-uniformly and make the resin coat layer have an insufficient film strength. If on the other hand the unevenness-providing particles have a true density of less than 0.9 g\/cm, too, it may come about that the unevenness-providing particles are insufficiently dispersed in the resin coat layer.","The shape of the unevenness-providing particles may preferably be spherical.","The \u201cspherical\u201d in such spherical particles as termed in the present invention means that the unevenness-providing particles have a length\/breadth ratio of from 1.0 to 1.5 in their particle projected images. In the present invention, it is preferable to use particles having a length\/breadth ratio of from 1.0 to 1.2, and is particularly preferable to use truly spherical particles.","If the unevenness-providing particles have a length\/breadth ratio of more than 1.5, the unevenness-providing particles may insufficiently be dispersed in the resin coat layer to make the resin coat layer have a non-uniform surface roughness.","Any known particles may be used as such unevenness-providing particles, which may include, e.g., spherical resin particles and spherical metal oxide particles.","The resin coat layer may be formed by coating on a substrate a coating material prepared by dispersing and mixing the respective components for the resin coat layer in a solvent, followed by drying to harden or by curing. To disperse and mix the respective components in the solvent, a known dispersion machine that utilizes beads may preferably be used, as exemplified by a sand mill, a paint shaker, Daino mill or Pearl mill. As coating methods, known coating methods may be used, such as dipping, spraying and roll coating.","In the present invention, the resin coat layer may preferably have, as its surface roughness, an arithmetic-mean roughness Ra (JIS B 0601-2001) of from 0.2 \u03bcm to 2.5 \u03bcm, and more preferably from 0.2 \u03bcm to 1.5 pm. If the resin coat layer surface has an Ra of less than 0.2 \u03bcm, the resin coat layer surface has almost no unevenness, and hence the level of the developer having a toner may become unstable on the developer carrying member and also the resin coat layer may have insufficient wear resistance and resistance to contamination by developer. If on the other hand it has an Ra of more than 2.5 \u03bcm, the developer on the developer carrying member may be in so large a transport level as to make the toner not easily uniformly charged and also make the resin coat layer have a low mechanical strength.","The resin coat layer constituted as described above may preferably have a thickness of 25 \u03bcm or less, more preferably 20 \u03bcm or less, and still more preferably from 4 \u03bcm to 20 \u03bcm. This is preferable in order to achieve a uniform layer thickness. The thickness is not particularly limited to this thickness. This thickness is achievable as long as the resin coat layer is 4,000 mg\/mto 20,000 mg\/min coverage mass, which depends on materials used in the resin coat layer.","In the present invention, the resin coat layer may preferably have, in its X-ray diffraction chart obtained by measurement by X-ray diffraction, a main peak in the range of from 25.46\u00b0 or more to 26.67\u00b0 or less in the X-ray diffraction pattern 2\u03b8.","It is also preferable that the whole region of a half width of the main peak is in the range of from 25.09\u00b0 or more to 27.04\u00b0 or less. Where peaks are separable as in , the half width is measured in the state of peak separation. Where some peaks overlap but the peaks are unseparable, the half width is determined as the peaks are kept to overlap and base lines stand corrected. For simplification, as long as a half width determined only by base-line correction falls within the above range, it is unnecessary to determine the half width by peak separation made afresh.","More specifically, in the case when the main peak is in the range of from 25.46\u00b0 or more to 26.67\u00b0 or less and further the half width of the main peak is in the range of from 25.09\u00b0 or more to 27.04\u00b0 or less, the graphitized particles and carbon black incorporated in the resin coat layer stand graphitized to a degree with less scattering, and hence the properties of these graphitized particles and carbon black are brought out. For example, the resin coat layer can have an enhanced durability and printed images can have an improved image quality.","In the present invention, it is preferable to incorporate the resin coat layer with i) the graphitized particles having a main peak in the range of from 25.46\u00b0 or more to 25.84\u00b0 or less in the X-ray diffraction pattern 2\u03b8 and ii) the carbon black having a main peak in the range of from 25.84 or more to 26.46 or less in the X-ray diffraction pattern 20. In the case when the graphitized particles and carbon black which differ in main-peak position in 2\u03b8 in this way are used, in the X-ray diffraction chart obtained by measurement by X-ray diffraction of the resin coat layer, a sub-peak is sometime observed in addition to the main peak as is seen in , thus the peaks are separable. When the peak are separated in such an occasion where such an X-ray diffraction chart is obtained by measurement, it is preferable that the X-ray diffraction pattern 2\u03b8 has at least one peak in each of the range of from 25.46\u00b0 or more to 25.84\u00b0 or less and the range of from 25.84\u00b0 or more to 26.46\u00b0 or less. In , an example is shown in which the main peak is sharp in the state it overlaps with the sub-peak, but the peaks may come reverse depending on the mixing ratio of the graphitized particles to the carbon black.","As the substrate of the developer carrying member, used in the present invention, a cylindrical member, a columnar member and a beltlike member are available. In a developing method in which the developer carrying member is not in contact with the electrostatic latent image bearing member such as a photosensitive drum, a cylindrical tube or solid rod of a rigid material such as a metal may preferably be used. What may preferably be used as such a substrate is a non-magnetic metal or alloy such as aluminum, stainless steel or brass molded in a cylindrical shape or in a columnar shape and then subjected to abrasion, grinding or the like. Such a substrate is used after it has been shaped or worked in a high precision in order to improve the uniformity of images to be formed. For example, it may preferably be 30 \u03bcm or less, more preferably 20 \u03bcm or less, and still more preferably 10 \u03bcm or less, in straightness in its lengthwise direction. The substrate may also preferably be 30 \u03bcm or less, more preferably 20 \u03bcm or less, and still more preferably 10 \u03bcm or less, in variation width of the gap between the developer carrying member and the electrostatic latent image bearing member, e.g., in variation width of the gap formed between the developer carrying member and a vertical face when the developer carrying member is rotated in the state it is placed against the vertical face via a uniform spacer. Aluminum may preferably be used as the substrate in view of material cost and readiness to work.","As a substrate used when a developing method is used in which the developer carrying member is brought into direct contact with the electrostatic latent image bearing member such as a photosensitive drum, a cylindrical member may preferably be used which is constituted of a mandrel made of a metal and provided thereon a layer formed of a rubber or elastomer such as EPDM or silicone. In a developing method making use of a developer having a magnetic toner, the substrate may be of a cylindrical shape and a magnet roller may be disposed in the interior of the former in order to magnetically attract the magnetic toner to, and hold it on, the developer carrying member.","The developing assembly of the present invention, having the aforesaid developer carrying member of the present invention, is described next.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0087"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"As shown in , a photosensitive drum  as a latent image bearing member holding thereon an electrostatic latent image formed by a known process is rotated in the direction of an arrow B.","A developing sleeve  as the developer carrying member is so disposed as to face the photosensitive drum , leaving a stated gap between them, to form a developing zone D.
