title: Systems and methods for document management
abstract: A user retains access to a document previously generated or received by an institution system and stored in encrypted form in storage of the institution system or another entity associated with the institution system. However, the institution system does not have access to the document (in readable form) after an expiration of an amount of time. The document is encrypted in such a manner that only the user can decrypt the document, but the institution system cannot decrypt it. In this manner, the institution system may meet business or regulatory requirements or policies directed to discarding (i.e., purging) the document after a predetermined amount of time, but can still provide secure storage of the document in encrypted form to the user independent of the business or regulatory requirements or policies that mandate purging the document.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["A business often generates or receives documents for customers of the business. For example, a financial services institution often generates or receives loan documents, deposit account statements, investment account statements, insurance policies, home inventories, digital image files, video data files, etc. for its customers.","Typically, the business electronically stores a document in storage for an amount of time and then discards the document. After the amount of time expires, the business may discard the document from its storage for a number of reasons, such as to comply with a document retention (or destruction) policy, because of local, state, and\/or federal regulations, or to save or recapture storage space. A customer may request access to the document from the business after the amount of time has expired. Because the amount of time has expired, however, the business has discarded the document and the document is unavailable to the customer.","A user retains access to a document previously generated or received by an institution system and stored in encrypted form in storage of the institution system or another entity associated with the institution system. However, the institution system does not have access to the document (in readable form) after an expiration of an amount of time. The document is encrypted in such a manner that only the user can decrypt the document, but the institution system cannot decrypt it.","In an implementation, the institution system may encrypt the document using a key and may provide the key to the user. The institution system may store the key and may send the encrypted document to an aggregator for storage on behalf of the user. The institution system cannot access the encrypted document that is stored by the aggregator. The aggregator cannot interpret (i.e., read or view) the encrypted document that they are storing on behalf of the user because the aggregator does not have a key used by the institution system to encrypt the document.","In an implementation, the aggregator may use another key to further encrypt the encrypted document received from the institution system. The user may then use two keys to decrypt the document.","This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the detailed description. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["105","185","150","185","105","105","105","150","150","105","150","105","105"]},"The institution system , or an institution affiliated with or associated with the institution system , does not have access to the document (in readable form) after an expiration of an amount of time. The document is encrypted in such a manner that only the user  can decrypt the document, but the institution system  cannot decrypt it. In this manner, the institution system  or an institution affiliated with the institution system , may meet business or regulatory requirements or policies directed to discarding (i.e., purging) the document after a predetermined amount of time (e.g., 7 years, 10 years, 15 years, etc.), but can still provide secure storage of the document in encrypted form to the user  independent of the business or regulatory requirements or policies that mandate purging the document.","The institution system , associated with or otherwise maintained by an institution such as a financial services institution, may generate a document for the user  using a document generator . The document generator  may comprise a computing device, an example of which is described with respect to . Alternatively, the institution system  may receive the document from the user  or a third party. The document may be received from a user computing device  of the user  via a communications network. An example user computing device  is described with respect to .","Any type of document may be generated or received by the institution system  and used with the systems and methods described herein, such as a loan document, a credit card statement, a deposit account statement, an investment account statement, an insurance policy, an email, a home inventory, a digital image file, a video data file, etc. Data generated by the institution system  or received from the user  or another party might include any type of documents associated with any type of application in any type of format (e.g., text, graphics, multimedia, etc.).","The user computing device  and the institution system  may be connected over a communications network. The user  may communicate with the institution system  by way of the communications network such as an intranet, the Internet, a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a wireless fidelity (WiFi) network, a public switched telephone network (PSTN), a cellular network, a voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) network, and the like. The user  may also communicate with the institution system  by phone, email, instant messaging, text messaging, web chat, facsimile, mail, and the like.","The institution system  may encrypt the document using an encryption module . Any known encryption technique(s) may be used. In an implementation, the encryption technique uses an encryption key (referred to herein as a key) and an encryption algorithm to encrypt the document, and the institution system  may store the key in a key store  and provide the key and the encryption algorithm to the user . The institution system  may maintain the key in the key store  even after the document has been purged from the storage  of the institution system . Thus, the institution system  may provide the key and the encryption algorithm to the user  even after the document has been purged from the storage .","In an implementation, the user  may send a request for the key from the user computing device  to the institution system . The request may be made via a website  of the institution system  or any other electronic technique such as email, instant message, text message, web chat, facsimile, phone, etc. A key retrieval module  of the institution system  may retrieve the key from the key store  via a data source access engine  and provide the key to the user computing device  via a communications network.","The institution system  sends the encrypted document to an aggregator computing device  of the aggregator . The aggregator  may store the encrypted document for the institution system  on behalf of the user , e.g., in a database record associated with the user such as an identifier of the user. In an implementation, the aggregator  may store the encrypted document in a document store . The document store  may comprise an online repository that the user  may access e.g., via a communications pathway between the user  (e.g., the user computing device ) and the aggregator  (e.g., the aggregator computing device ) via a communications network. The user  may request the encrypted document from the aggregator . Pursuant to receiving the request, a document retrieval module  of the aggregator  may obtain the encrypted document from the document store  and provide the encrypted document to the user computing device . The user computing device  may comprise a decryption module  that may decrypt the encrypted document using the appropriate key and encryption algorithm, as described further herein.","The institution system  cannot access the encrypted document that is stored by the aggregator . The aggregator  cannot interpret (i.e., read or view) the encrypted document that they are storing on behalf of the user  because the aggregator  does not have a key used by the institution system  to encrypt the document.","In an implementation, the institution system  may store the unencrypted document in storage, such as a storage , for an amount of time in accordance with a retention policy (also referred to as a destruction policy) or other regulation, requirement, or procedure. After the amount of time elapses (e.g., an expiration date passes), the document may be discarded (also referred to as purged) from the storage . The document, in encrypted form, may be maintained by the aggregator  for the user  to access at any time, even after the institution system  has discarded the unencrypted document from the storage .","In such an implementation, the institution system  holds the key and the aggregator  maintains the encrypted document. Neither the institution system  nor the aggregator  can produce a readable or otherwise viewable (i.e., unencrypted) document on their own, and thus they are unable to supply an unencrypted document in response to a request (after the unencrypted document has been purged from the storage  of the institution system ). The user  may read or view the document without maintaining their own archived copy on the user computing device  or any other computing device of the user .","The institution system  may include a user interface module . The user interface module  may generate and format one or more pages of content  as a unified graphical presentation that may be provided to the user computing device  as an output, e.g., from the key retrieval module  or the document generator  in an implementation. The page(s) of content  may be provided to the user computing device  via the website  associated with the institution system .","The user  may interface with the institution system  via the website  that may display one or more pages of content  to the user  on the user computing device . A request for a document or a key may be received at the institution system  from the user computing device  through any suitable means, such as interaction with a web browser that is in communication with the institution system . The actual mechanism of connection is outside the scope of the present discussion.","In an implementation, instead of hosting the website , the institution system  may comprise a conventional application server hosting a proprietary online service accessible only by a private network. In any event, the institution system  may have appropriate security mechanisms in place to prevent unauthorized third parties from intercepting the user's information.","The institution system  has access to data pertaining to the user , including unencrypted documents that are currently stored by the institution system , such as in the storage , and keys and algorithms that have been used to encrypt documents and that are stored in the key store , for example. The institution system may retrieve the data from the storage  and the key store  or other associated storage via the data source access engine .","A user access system may be communicatively coupled to the institution system  and may be configured to send machine-readable instructions to the institution system . Those instructions may cause the institution system  to access the storage  and\/or the key store , for example. A unified graphical presentation may be transmitted to the user access system.","The user access system may be implemented as a web server in an implementation. The user access system, through the use of any suitable interactive web technology, provides an interactive experience to the user  through which access to and maintenance of their documents and keys with associated algorithms can be accomplished. Any technology that provides interactivity through a web browser is considered to be within the scope of the present discussion and may include, without limitation, Hyper-Text Mark-Up Language (HTML), Dynamic HTML (DHTML), JavaScript, and Ajax.","The institution system  may include any combination of systems and subsystems such as electronic devices including, but not limited to, computers, servers, databases, or the like. The electronic devices may include any combination of hardware components such as processors, databases, storage drives, registers, cache, random access memory (RAM) chips, data buses, or the like and\/or software components such as operating systems, database management applications, or the like.","The institution system  may comprise one or more computing devices . The user computing device  may allow a user  to interact with the computing device(s) . The computing device(s)  may have one or more processors , storage  (e.g., storage devices, memory, etc.), and software modules . The computing device(s) , including its processor(s) , storage , and software modules , may be used in the performance of the techniques and operations described herein.","Examples of software modules  may include modules for identifying and authenticating a user, generating a document, encrypting a document with a key, providing the encrypted document to the aggregator , providing the key and encryption algorithm to the user , storing the document and the key, receiving a request for the document, providing the request for the document to the aggregator, generating web page content for display, and receiving instructions from the user , described further herein. While specific functionality is described herein as occurring with respect to specific modules, the functionality may likewise be performed by more, fewer, or other modules.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","210","185","130","105","190"]},"At , the document may be stored in storage of the institution system , such as the storage . The document may be stored in accordance with a retention policy of the institution system  such that the document (unencrypted) may be purged from the storage  at a predetermined time (e.g., at the expiration of an amount of time).","At , the document may be encrypted by the institution system , such as by the encryption module . Any encryption method may be used, such as AES (advanced encryption standard) or a similar symmetric cipher. The encrypted document may be sent to the aggregator , e.g., via a communications network. Such encryption and transmission may be performed pursuant to requesting and receiving authorization from the user  regarding the encryption of the document and transmission of the encrypted document to the aggregator  for storage. The aggregator  may store the encrypted document in storage, such as the document store . At , the key that was used to encrypt the document may be stored by the institution system , e.g., in storage associated with the institution system , such as the key store .","At , at some point such as after the unencrypted document has been purged from the storage  of the institution system , the user  may access the institution system  (e.g., via the website  or any other electronic technique), be authenticated by the institution system , and may request the document. Any authentication technique(s) may be used to authenticate the user  to the institution system .","In an implementation, the user  may access an account of theirs that is maintained by the institution system . The user  may access the account via the user computing device . In an implementation, the user  may log on to a website  maintained by the institution system  using known identification and authentication techniques. After the user logs on to the website , the institution system  may display a listing of the user's documents maintained by the institution system  (e.g., in encrypted form at the aggregator ) affiliated with the user's account and the user  may select one of the documents for retrieval and viewing.","It is contemplated that the user  may access an account of theirs via other techniques, such as by accessing an electronic file that is sent to the user  by email or that is linked to in an email provided to the user . Alternatively, the institution system  may provide a private network and\/or connection to the user  so that the user  may access their account via the institution system's private network and\/or connection. A user  may select an account by highlighting the account identifier (e.g., name, number, etc.), clicking on the account identifier, using pull-down menus, or using any other known selection technique(s).","The user  may view a listing of the documents in the account. The document listing may comprise documents internal and\/or external to the institution system  (e.g., held by the aggregator ). The listing may be displayed to the user on the user computing device . In an implementation, the user  may select one of the documents, e.g., by highlighting the document, clicking on the document, using pull-down menus, or using any other known selection technique(s).","At , pursuant to receiving the request for the document, the key retrieval module  of the institution system  may retrieve the key from the key store  via the data source access engine  and electronically provide the key to the user computing device  (e.g., via the website, an email, a link, an instant message, a text message, a web chat, etc.). In an implementation, the institution system  may provide the key to the user  (e.g., the user computing device ) prior to receiving any request for the document, such as after encrypting the document with the key at  or storing the key in the key store  at .","At , the request for the document may be forwarded from the institution system  to the aggregator computing device  of the aggregator  via a communications network. In an implementation, the request may be provided from the institution system  to the aggregator  in a transaction that is transparent to the user  such that the user  does not know that the request is being provided from the institution system  to the aggregator . At , the aggregator  may retrieve the encrypted document from the document store  using the document retrieval module . The aggregator  may provide the encrypted document to the user computing device .","At , the user computing device  may receive the encrypted document from the aggregator  and may decrypt the document using the decryption module  and the key that had been received from the institution system . In an implementation, the user computing device  uses the key to decrypt the document without user intervention in a transaction that is transparent to the user . The user  may then view or otherwise access the document.","In an implementation, the user  may request the document directly from the aggregator  via an access point (e.g., a website, web page, a hyperlink or other link, etc.) provided by the institution system  or the aggregator .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","310","185","105","320","105","330","105","310","320","330","210","220","230"]},"At , the key and encryption algorithm that was used to encrypt the document may be provided to the user  (e.g., to the user computing device ).
