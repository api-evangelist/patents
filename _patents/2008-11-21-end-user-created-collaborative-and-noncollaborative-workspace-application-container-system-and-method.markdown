Other features, aspects, and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.","Like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings indicate like elements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","105"]},"In various implementations the state of one or more of a workspace's applications, documents, the workspace itself, or combinations of these, is automatically saved at various times or when a user closes a workspace. This allows users to take their workspace and current context with them as they change computing devices. In some implementations, an application's state describes the application's user interface location, size and appearance of the application's user interface in the GUI , the context of application, or combinations of these. Other application state information is possible. For example, application state information includes an identity of the web browser application , a set of coordinates that initially place the application 's user interface in the upper-right corner of the GUI , a uniform resource locator (URL) of web page that the application  is displaying, the scrolled position and magnification of the web page in the application 's user interface, and\/or other information that can be used to describe the state of the application . A history button  can be selected by users to open a history recall interface that provides the user with an ability to recall and display previous application and workspace  states. The history recall interface is discussed in reference to . Application state and other information that comprise a workspace definition are discussed further in reference to  below.","Workspace applications execute within, or their execution is coordinated by, an application container which, in some implementations, manages the GUI . Workspace applications expose their respective user interfaces, if any, in the GUI . By way of illustration, the workspace  includes the web browser application , a charting application , and a search engine application . Each application's respective user interface occupies a portion of the GUI . In some implementations, the GUI  can extend beyond the window borders of the workspace  so that an application's user interface may be partially visible or may not be visible in the GUI  until the workspace 's view is changed to include that portion of the GUI  which includes the application's user interface.","In some implementations, application user interfaces can be arranged in the GUI  by one or more panels. A panel is a visible or invisible organization element in the GUI  used to spatially arrange application user interfaces. For example, a panel could specify a grid layout in the GUI  where the grid's cells serve as locations for applications to display their user interfaces. By way of further example, panels can be composed in logical layers so different application user interfaces are presented in the GUI  depending on what layer is being viewed. Other techniques for organizing application user interfaces in the GUI  are possible.","In some implementations, the applications -, the documents -, and the application container  can share information to perform interrelated tasks. For example, the user can type the name of a job application into the search engine application , and the search engine application  can search a contact database for the named applicant to retrieve the applicant's address, desired job position and company, and salary requirements, and share that information with the other applications -. The web browser application  can use the applicant's address to display a map of the applicant's location and\/or the address of the desired job position. The charting application  can use the address, desired position, and salary requirements information to query an employment demographics database to present a visual representation of comparative salary statistics for similar job positions in nearby geographical regions. In some implementations, the workspace  can use the applicant's identity to dynamically present relevant ones of the electronic documents -, such as to load the applicant's picture as the image document , the applicant's resume as the PDF document , and\/or a job description as the word processing document .","In various implementations, the GUI  provides various interactive controls. The user can maximize, minimize, and resize the application container  with a collection of window controls . The user can also select a full-screen button  to cause the application to occupy substantially the entire screen. The application container  also includes a collection of user identity information  for the current user or \u201cparticipant\u201d of the workspace , such as the participant's name, workspace role, picture, and\/or other identifying information. Workspace roles and associated privileges are discussed further with reference to  below. A button , when selected, shows a participant their workspaces, both private and shared. A private workspace is used by only one participant, usually the person who created the workspace, but a private workspace can be shared with other workspace participants by selecting button  and inviting others to join. Shared workspaces are discussed further below.","A button , when selected, presents a catalog user interface that provides a participant with an ability to obtain additional applications or workspace templates. The catalog is discussed further in reference to and . The application container  also includes a distribution button . In some implementations, the distribution button  can be activated to send copies of the workspace  to others. In some implementations, the distribution button  can be activated to publish the current version of the workspace to a distribution server so that other participants can obtain the updated version of the workspace.","In some implementations, a workspace can include documents in addition to applications. By way of illustration, the workspace  includes the following documents: an image , a portable document format (PDF) document , and a word processing document . Examples of other types of documents that can be included in the workspace  are audio files, video files, spreadsheets, presentations, Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) documents, eXtensible Markup Language (XML) documents, binary files (e.g., executables), text files, compressed files, other file types, and combinations of these.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["110","120","210","205","205","205","205","205","205","100","105","105","105","105","105"],"i":["a","b","c","d","e","f"]},"By way of illustration, the document is dragged to the GUI  as indicated by mouse cursor . When a document is imported into a workspace, the workspace's definition is updated to reflect that the document is now part of the workspace. In addition, the workspace state information is updated to retain the location of the visual representation of the document (e.g., an icon) in the GUI . In some implementations, the document is copied into the workspace definition or to local or remote storage that is accessible to the application container.","In various implementations, when a document is imported into a workspace, the application container associates an external application or a workspace application with the document. The associated application is invoked when a user wishes to view or edit the document. Generally speaking, a table of associations between document types and applications can guide this process. For example, if a spreadsheet document created outside of the workspace is imported into the workspace, the associated application would be the external spreadsheet application. Alternatively, if there is a workspace application that can be used to view and\/or modify the document, the workspace application is associated with the document. In the former case, when a user selects the document for viewing or editing in the workspace (e.g., by performing a mouse double-click on the document's icon) the associated application is invoked with the document. If the application is external to the workspace, the document can first be copied into a file system or other storage location where the external application can access the document.","When a workspace is shared, there exists the possibility that a workspace participant may add a document to the workspace associated with an external application that is not available on each participant's computing device. To enable participants without access to the application to view such documents, such as by using a commonly available workspace application or external application document viewer, a portable version of the document is created and copied into the shared workspace definition or stored on a document repository server in some implementations. In some implementations, the portable version of a document has the same fidelity of the original document. The portable version does not require the application used to create the document in order for the document to be viewed in the shared workspace. For this reason, and in some implementations, the portable version of a document is not capable of being edited or modified to the extent that the original version of the document is. In some implementations, the portable version is a PDF document and is produced by causing the document 's creating application to export the document as a PDF document. Other types of portable documents are possible.","In some implementations, the application for viewing portable documents allows users to annotate such documents with markups, notes and marginalia that can be saved along with the portable version of the document. A given participant's view (e.g., current scroll position and magnification) of a portable document in an application for viewing portable documents, including annotations if any, can be shared with other participants. In some implementations, a viewer application for portable documents allows participants to fetch the original version of the document from a document repository for editing, for example.","In further implementations, a preview or thumbnail image of the document is stored in the workspace definition and the full version of the document is stored on a document repository. When a user accesses a document through the GUI , if the document is not present in the workspace definition or in local storage, such as may be the case when using a shared workspace, the application container downloads the document from a document server. Document downloading is deferred until a participant attempts to view more than a document's preview or thumbnail image document.","When a workspace application is imported into a workspace, workspace's definition is updated to reflect that the workspace application is now part of the workspace. In some implementations, the workspace application is copied into local cache of workspace applications, the workspace definition is updated to indicate the storage location of the application, and the workspace application is then executed by the application container.","In some implementations, the workspace includes a file repository workspace application . The file repository application  allows users to add and remove documents and workspace applications to\/from a global document repository simply by dragging the document and workspace application icons between the application 's user interface and the GUI . This allows users to share information without having to share their workspace.","The document repository workspace application  provides users with interactive access to a document repository for the storage and distribution of shared documents. For example, The documents -can be moved among the host, the workspace , and the shared file repository interface . In some implementations, the shared file repository can be a central file server that multiple users can access through separate instances of the workspace  and shared file repository interface .","When a document or workspace application is exported or otherwise removed from a workspace, information pertaining to the workspace application or document is removed from the workspace definition and, in some implementations, any cached versions of the workspace application or document are removed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"105"},"In some implementations, participants can create their own private (i.e., custom) views of a shared workspace by changing the size and location of application user interfaces, hiding application user interfaces, and customizing workspace applications, for example. Other ways to customize a workspace view are possible. In further implementations, the extent to which a participant's private view can depart from the public view is based on one or more workspace roles associated with the participant. Roles are discussed further below. In some implementations, a shared workspace's private view is stored in a workspace definition's workspace state information.","Workspace participants can switch back and forth between the public view and their private view. By way of illustration, GUI  presents a public view of the shared workspace  which includes a charting application , a web browser application , an image document , word processing document  and a search engine application . GUI  presents a private view of shared workspace  in which the size and location of applications  and  has changed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","418","408","410","416","408","400","410","400","408","400"],"i":["a","c","a","b","c. "]},"A workspace can be used in online mode or offline mode. When a workspace is in online mode, the application container is able to synchronize changes to the local workspace definition at various times with a workspace definition maintained by a server (e.g., ). Moreover, collaboration services and workspace applications which utilize network services will not have their functionality impaired. However, a workspace can be instantiated and used offline to the extent that network communication is not required by the workspace's applications, and assuming there is a copy of the workspace definition on the computing device or accessible to the computing device. When a workspace is in online mode, the workspace is able to synchronize changes made to the workspace definition while the workspace was in offline mode with the workspace definition maintained by a server. By way of illustration, participant Jim is using workspace definition offline, for instance. If Jim adds workspace applications or otherwise changes the workspace definition, these changes will be propagated to the corresponding definition on server  when Jim's workspace is back online.","Workspaces can be shared with others when a user creates or obtains a workspace (e.g., from a workspace template), and then \u201cpublishes\u201d the workspace to server which, in some implementations causes a copy of the published workspace's definition to be placed on the server where it can be accessed by others. Next, the user invites others to join the workspace as participants. Initially, the user who published the workspace is the only participant. If others elect to join the shared workspace, they will receive a local copy of the shared workspace definition which, depending on roles and privileges, they may be allowed to customize to some extent.","Unlike non-shared workspaces, shared workspaces allow one or more participant's changes to their local copy of the shared workspace definition to be propagated to all copies of that workspace definition maintained by other participants. For example, assuming that Susan owns or has control over a shared workspace, she can modify the workspace definition (e.g., add\/remove applications, add\/remove documents, etc.) and the modifications will be propagated to each participant's local copy of the workspace definition if she elects to publish the changes. (In some implementations, if Susan closes her workspace without publishing the changes she will be prompted whether she wants to discard, publish or save the changes.) For example, published changes to the workspace definition will be synchronized with the copy of on the server and then propagated to Bob and Jim's respective local workspace definitions (, ) when they are next synchronized with the server . In further implementations, if an updated public view of a shared workspace is not compatible with a participant's private view (e.g., the public view no longer contains a workspace application that is in a private view), the private view can be removed from the workspace or modified to remove portions that are in conflict with the public view.","An owner or controller of a shared workspace can apply changes to the workspace definition but may not be ready to share the changes with other participants. To accommodate this, the application container has the ability to save the changes without publishing them to the server . If a shared workspace has more than one participant who can make changes (e.g., an owner or contributor) the workspace space is automatically locked  by the participant currently changing the workspace. The lock  excludes others from modifying the shared workspace definition. The lock is removed once the user publishes the workspace definition changes. In some implementations, a user can manually obtain the lock .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 5A","b":["400","400","400"]},"For example, the \u201cBusiness Corp\u201d company can provide a collection of applications that can be obtained from a \u201cBusiness Corp\u201d application distribution server. The user can browse the collection of applications by selecting a collection control  to open an applications collection control . The applications collection  includes a collection of interactive tabs and that the user can select to move among available categories of applications. The applications collection  includes a search control  that provides the user with an ability to search for applications (e.g., by name, keyword, category). For example, the user can enter the word \u201cweather\u201d to browse a collection of applications that can include applications that provide weather forecasts, satellite imagery, and\/or current conditions.","The applications collection control  includes a subcategory control . The subcategory control  can be used to browse among subcategories of available applications. In the illustrated example, the user has selected to view applications within the \u201cBusiness Corp\u201d collection (e.g., by selecting the control  in a template and tiles area ) of \u201csales\u201d related applications (e.g., by selecting the \u201csales\u201d tab ). The \u201csales\u201d collection can be further subdivided into subcategories that are grouped by job function, department, or other subgrouping. In the illustrated example, the user has activated the subcategory control  to group the available applications by job function. The catalog  responds to the selection by displaying a collection of job function controls . The user can also activate an all products control  to browse all the applications that have been made available by the application provider.","The applications collection control  also includes a new releases collection control  and a top downloads collection control . The new releases collection control  displays a collection of applications that the application provider has recently made available for download. The top downloads collection control  displays a collection of applications that have been downloaded most frequently by other users.","The catalog  includes a collection of controls  that provide the user with links to workspaces that the user can create and\/or workspaces that have been shared with the user. The controls  provide the user with links to the user's private workspaces, to workspaces that the user has made available to be shared with other users, to workspaces that have been shared with the user, and\/or to a collection of all the workspaces that the user can access. A new workspace control  is included to provide the user with the option to create a new, substantially empty workspace. An example process for creating a new workspace is discussed in the description of .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 5B","b":["500","400","400","125","135","100","400","505","510","505","505","505"]},"In some implementations, the enterprise server  can distribute applications privately. For example, the enterprise server  can be an intranet server that distributes applications only within an organization's network. Users within the organization's network can browse the organization's privately distributed applications through the catalog , whereas users outside of the organization's network cannot. In some implementations, the enterprise server  can distribute applications publicly. For example, the organization can be in the business of creating commercial applications, such as the applications -, and the enterprise server  can make the organization's commercial applications available through the catalog .","Through the catalog , the user can select one or more of the applications - for inclusion in the workspace . In some implementations, the applications - can be added to the workspace  in one or more drag and drop operations. For example, the applications  can be selected in the catalog  and dragged to a position within the workspace . In some implementations, applications can be added to the workspace  by selecting the applications - within the catalog . For example, the user can add the applications - to a list, and when the list is complete the user can activate a control that closes the catalog  and populates the workspace  with the applications' - data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 1"],"b":["600","600","100","100"]},"In various implementations, the workspace definition  includes a workspace identifier , one or more application identifiers , and one or more workspace participants . The workspace identifier  can be used to uniquely identify a workspace . In various implementations, a workspace identifier is data representing a sequence of one or more letters, numbers, symbols, codes, special characters or combinations of these. In further implementations, the workspace identifier  is a data structure. By way of illustration, the workspace identifier  can be a file name, a URL, a record number in a database, or other identifiers that can be used to identify the workspace . In some implementations, the workspace identifier  is unique within a namespace. For example, the workspace identifier  can be a unique filename within a collection of electronic files included in the folders of a file repository that define a namespace, such as \u201c\\\\server\\folder\\subfolder\\workspacefile\u201d. In another example, the workspace identifier  can be a unique server and file address, such as \u201chttp:\/\/www.company.com\/intranet\/department\/jobfunction\/workspace.xml\u201d. Other workspace identifiers are possible.","The one or more application identifiers  identify one or more applications (e.g., the applications -) in the workspace .

In further implementations, an application identifier  is a data structure. In some implementations, an application identifier is unique within a namespace. In yet further implementations, an application identifier can be used to identify an application and an application provider from which the application can be obtained. For example, the application identifier can be a file path, wherein the application is uniquely identified by an application provider, a department, a class, and a file name, such as \u201c\\\\AcmeIncorporated\\customerservice\\warrany\\spareparts.swf.\u201d In another example, the application can be an URL that references an application provider and an application, such as \u201chttp:\/\/www.realestate.com\/applications\/propertysearch.swf\u201d where \u201chttp:\/\/www.realestate.com\/applications\/\u201d is the application provider and \u201cpropertysearch.swf\u201d is the application.

In some implementations, the local cache  is used to store a so-called local catalog that includes applications that a user has downloaded into workspaces instantiated by the application container . Optionally, the local catalog indicates which tiles are currently used in a workspace. Applications can be imported to, or exported from, the local catalog to the file system .","The application container  receives a workspace definition  from local storage (e.g.,  or ), from a server (see ) by way of the one or more networks , or from a process executing on the client system . Application identifier(s)  are then read from the workspace definition . Each application identifier  refers to an application provider server (see ) from which the application container  obtains a corresponding application (e.g., , and ). For example, the applications can be transferred to the application container  by using a data communication protocol such as HTTP, FTP or TCP\/IP, for example. In some implementations, the applications are loaded into the execution environment  where they execute. Alternatively, the application container  causes the applications to execute as processes or threads in the operating system .","In various implementations, the execution environment  includes one or more virtual machines (e.g., Java Virtual Machine, ActionScript Virtual Machine, Common Language Runtime). Applications can be written in ActionScript, ECMAScript, JavaScript or the Java programming languages, for example, and are executed by a virtual machine. Other virtual machines and programming languages are possible. Moreover, applications can access services using Internet or other data communication protocols. In further implementations, the execution environment  manages the executing of workspace applications executing as processes or threads in the operating system . The workspace applications can execute in a parallel fashion (e.g., assuming the availability of multiple microprocessor execution cores), a preemptive multitasking fashion, a cooperative fashion, or in other multitasking scenarios.","The workspace applications (e.g., -) can take advantage of services which, in some implementations, are available as software libraries whose functions or methods can be invoked by the workspace applications. Authentication services allow workspace applications to perform authentication and authorization operations for workspace participants. Inter-application communication services allow workspace applications to find each other and exchange information with each other during execution. Collaboration services enable workspace applications to become aware of participants using a shared workspace and to communicate with the participants (e.g., through instant messaging, email, etc.). User interface services provide services for workspace applications to create and expose their user interfaces in the application container user interface.","The application container  also includes support processes. A synchronization process  provides workspace definition synchronization services to the application container  by communicating with a workspace server to obtain and synchronize workspace definitions, by communicating with a document repository to obtain and synchronize workspace documents, by communicating with an authentication server to authenticate the workspace participant, and by communicating with one or more application providers to obtain workspace applications called for in workspace definitions. By way of illustration, when a participant logs into a workspace, the synchronization process  will request login information (unless the participant has the login stored locally) and verify the credentials with the authentication server if the workspace is in online mode, or use locally cached credentials if the workspace is offline. Next the synchronization process  obtains a default or selected workspace definition from the workspace server and, once received, obtains any needed applications from the application providers and documents from the document repository . The applications are then executed by the application container.","A catalog process  is responsible for assembling a catalog and presenting it in the GUI . A search engine process  can be used by the application container  or workplace applications to search the workspace definition for desired information.","A collaboration process  provides presence information regarding participants who are online. The collaboration process  can query the collaboration server to determine which participants are logged into which non-shared and shared workspaces. Application containers and, optionally, workspace applications, can register the presence information of participants with the collaboration server and notify the server when participants login and logout of a workspace. Workspace applications and the application container GUI  can surface presence information to allow participants to collaborate with each other using instant messaging, electronic mail, voice-over-IP, or video conferencing, for example. Moreover, presence information allows users to invite each other to be participants in shared workspaces.","A snapshot process  captures the state of one or more of a workspace's applications, documents, the workspace itself, or combinations of these, automatically at various times and sends the information to a snapshot server for archiving. Snapshots can be used to return an application or a workspace to a previous state.

A participant in the \u201cObserver\u201d role  can open and interact with the workspace, but is not allowed to change the public view of the workspace or share the workspace with additional participants. Observers are also not allowed to modify, remove or add documents or applications to the workspace. A participant in the \u201cContributor\u201d role  can add, modify or delete documents in the workspace. A contributor can also change the public view of the workspace. Contributors are not allowed to add or remove applications or to share the workspace with additional participants. A contributor cannot change privileges. An \u201cOwner\u201d has full privileges and can add, modify and delete applications, documents and workspaces, and bestow on workspace participants roles. Owners can share a workspace with additional participants and assign privileges to roles or to participants. In some implementations, each workspace has at least one owner which by default is the user who created the workspace.","In various implementations, a role is defined as a hierarchy tree that has been decorated with privileges. For example, the role \u201cOwner\u201d  is associated with a hierarchy tree representing a specific workspace template or a generic workspace template where each node has been assigned one or more privileges, although not all nodes not have to be assigned privileges. By way of example, the root node representing a workspace template is decorated with read (r), write (w), and execute (x) privileges . The read privilege allows the workspace participant in the role to have read-only access to data associated with the workspace template. The write privilege gives the workspace participant in the role to the ability modify data associated with the template. Finally, the execute privilege allows the workspace participant in the role to perform template operations requiring the execute privilege. Other privileges are possible. Individual documents and applications in a workspace can also be assigned privileges for a given role, as illustrated by -. The Contributor  and Observer  roles are similarly defined.","In some implementations, roles themselves can be composed in hierarchies whereby privileges associated with descendent roles are inherited by ancestor roles. By way of illustration, a role hierarchy  illustrates that the Contributor role inherits privileges of the Observer role .

In some implementations, the workspace participant can be selected  to be the user that is currently logged on to the application container's  host. In some implementations, the application container  can prompt the user for identification information that can be used to select  the workspace participant. In some implementations, the application container  can infer an identity to select  as the workspace participant. For example, the application container  can use the application container's  host's location, network address, identity, or other information to infer that a particular workspace participant should be selected  as the current participant. For example, a public kiosk can present the application container , and any user of that kiosk can be with a common workspace participant identity to select  a public identity as the current participant.","The current participant's permissions are then determined  based on a role associated with the current participant (e.g., a workspace role).

In some implementations, the subset of features can include a restriction on the amount of time the application will execute before shutting down, the size data sets and\/or query results, the accuracy of data, or other aspects of the application that can be adjusted to make its operation less valuable than that of a fully enabled application.","In some implementations, the authorization of the participant can be performed to confirm that the user has purchased, subscribed, or has otherwise been given permission to fully utilize an application. For example, non-authorized users may be given limited access to a program's features to let them try the application in a limited manner before paying for it. In some implementations, applications that can present non-authorized users with a subset of features can be called \u201ctrial-ware\u201d, \u201ccripple-ware\u201d, \u201cdemo-ware\u201d, or other such names to denote an ability for users to try an application before purchasing or otherwise becoming authorized to use the application's full feature set.","The application container and\/or the application can accept input to enable additional application features.
