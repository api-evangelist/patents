No. 09\/921,407 entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Quick Paging in a Wireless Communication System\u201d filed Aug. 1, 2001, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,823,192, which claims priority to Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/261,454, entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Synchronization of QPOCH Soft Handoff,\u201d filed Jan. 12, 2001, all assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein.","1. Field","The present invention relates to communications systems. Specifically, the present invention relates to methods of providing quick pages in a wireless communication system.","2. Background","In a wireless communications system a base station pages a mobile station indicating that a call is pending. The paging signal is transmitted on a separate channel, referred to as a paging channel. While the paging channel may be implemented on a separate carrier frequency, in a spread spectrum system, such as a Code Division Multiple Access, CDMA, type system, a unique code is applied to paging messages, thus providing a paging channel.","The base station generates pages in response to instructions received from a Base Station Controller, BSC. In one embodiment, the BSC also instructs the base station to send a Quick Page, QP, signal. The QP signal is transmitted on a separate Quick Page Channel, QPCH. The quick page message may be one bit or may be a message made up of multiple bits.","A problem exists in generating QP messages when a mobile station is in soft handoff. During soft handoff, the BSC instructs those base stations in a neighborhood around the mobile station to transmit a QP message. After sending the QP message, each base station is instructed to page the mobile station. For each base station, the mobile station has an assigned paging slot. The loading of the base stations in the neighborhood may prevent one or all of the base stations from sending the corresponding page during the assigned paging slot. Therefore, there is a need for a method of providing quick pages while a mobile station is in soft handoff.","According to one aspect, in a wireless communication system having a base station controller and a plurality of base stations, a method includes receiving a paging instruction from the base station controller at a base station of the plurality of base stations, the paging instruction specifying a number of paging repetitions; and transmitting a quick paging message to a target recipient of the paging instruction for the number of paging repetitions.","According to another aspect, in a wireless communication system having a base station controller and a plurality of base stations, a base station includes means for receiving a paging instruction from the base station controller at a base station of the plurality of base stations, the paging instruction specifying a number of paging repetitions, and means for transmitting a quick paging message to a target recipient of the paging instruction for the number of paging repetitions.","In still another aspect, in a wireless communication system having a base station controller and a plurality of base stations, a mobile station includes a means for receiving a plurality of quick paging messages from the plurality of base stations, a means for receiving a first paging message from a first of the plurality of base stations, a means for receiving a second paging message from a second of the plurality of base stations, and a means for responding to at least one of the first and second paging messages.","The word \u201cexemplary\u201d is used exclusively herein to mean \u201cserving as an example, instance, or illustration.\u201d Any embodiment described herein as \u201cexemplary\u201d is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments.","In a spread spectrum system, such as a Code Division Multiple Access, CDMA, communications system, signals are spread over a wide bandwidth via the use of a code, such as a Pseudorandom Noise, PN, spreading sequence. The \u201cTIA\/EIA\/IS-95 Mobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular System,\u201d hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe IS-95 standard,\u201d and the \u201cTIA\/EIA\/IS-2000 Standards for cdma2000 Spread Spectrum Systems,\u201d hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe cdma2000 standard,\u201d detail spread spectrum CDMA systems. Further, operation of a CDMA system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,901,307, entitled \u201cSPREAD SPECTRUM MULTIPLE ACCESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM USING SATELLITE OR TERRESTRIAL REPEATERS,\u201d assigned to the assignee of the present application for patent and hereby expressly incorporated by reference.","In one embodiment, such as a communication system consistent with the cdma2000 standard, a Quick Paging Channel, QPCH, is used to alert mobile stations to receive paging information, such as transmitted on a Forward Common Control Channel, F-CCCH or a Paging Channel, PCH.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","102","104","104","104","104","104"]},"Terminals  in the coverage area may be fixed (i.e., stationary) or mobile. As shown in , various terminals  are dispersed throughout the system. Each terminal  communicates with at least one and possibly more base stations  on the downlink and uplink at any given moment depending on, for example, whether soft handoff is employed or whether the terminal is designed and operated to (concurrently or sequentially) receive multiple transmissions from multiple base stations. Soft handoff in CDMA communications systems is well known in the art and is described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,101,501, entitled \u201cMETHOD AND SYSTEM FOR PROVIDING A SOFT HANDOFF IN A CDMA CELLULAR TELEPHONE SYSTEM,\u201d which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated by reference herein.","The downlink refers to transmission from the base station to the terminal, and the uplink refers to transmission from the terminal to the base station. In the exemplary embodiment, some of terminals  have multiple receive antennas and others have only one receive antenna. Similarly, some of terminals  have multiple transmit antennas, and others have single transmit antennas. There are no restrictions on the combinations of transmit antennas and receive antennas. Therefore, it is possible for a terminal  to have multiple transmit antennas and a single receive antenna or to have multiple receive antennas and a single transmit antenna or to have both single or multiple transmit or receive antennas. In , base station A transmits data to terminals A and J on the downlink, base station B transmits data to terminals B and J, base station C transmits data to terminal C, and so on.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["130","106","102","102","102","102","102","106","1","106","120","120","100"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["100","1","120","1","1","130","102","102","120","120","1","2","102","102","3","4","130","1","130","1","120"]},"The MS receives the QP messages from the base stations in the neighborhood . The MS combines the QP messages, thus increasing the reliability of the information. Each base station that is not able, or chooses not to transmit the QP message to MS reduces the reliability of the message.","One embodiment solves this problem by implementing a mandatory scheme, wherein each base station in neighborhood  that receives the instruction from BSC  is required to send a QP message followed by a page message regardless of the loading of the base stations.","An alternate embodiment provides repeated QP messages, allowing base stations multiple opportunities to send the page. Referring to , again the BSC  has sent an instruction to BTSs A and D. In response, both base stations send QP messages during the interval of time t to t. The instruction includes a number of retries, identified as N, wherein if N=1 a mandatory scheme is implemented. The paging interval of each base station begins at time t and continues to time t. Within the paging interval, a time slot is assigned to the MS, and other time slots are assigned to other mobile stations. The time slot assigned to MS is from time t to time t. As illustrated in , the BTS D has hatching during the MS paging slot to indicate transmission of the paging message during this slot. The loading of BTS D allowed the transmission. In contrast, BTS A was loaded so as to prevent transmission of the paging message during the time slot assigned to MS, i.e. from time t to time t. At a subsequent time from t to t, also assigned to MS, BTS D does not transmit the paging message, however, at this time BTS A allows transmission of the paging message. In this way, BTS D sent the paging message at a first time, while BTS A sent the paging message at a second time. According to one embodiment, two slots are designated between time t and t (the second slot is not shown) for paging messages. Similarly, two slots are designated between time t and t (the second slot is not shown) for paging messages.","In an alternate embodiment, in response to the page message received from the BSC, each BTS calculates the available bandwidth for transmission. If a BTS has bandwidth to transmit the paging message in the next paging slot, the BTS sends a paging confirmation message to the BSC. The paging confirmation message identifies the transmitter as a BTS available to send the paging message to the MS during the next slot. As illustrated in , the BTS D receives the paging message from the BSC  and determines there is sufficient bandwidth available to send the paging message to the target MS. Note that the BSC  also instructs the BTSs to send quick paging messages N times. The BTS D transmits a paging confirmation message to the BSC  at time t. The BTS D then transmits a quick paging message during the time interval t to t and the paging message during the time interval t to t. The BTS A also receives the paging message from the BSC  but determines there is not sufficient bandwidth available to send the paging message to the target MS. The BTS A transmits a quick paging message during the time interval t to t. The transmission bandwidth of BTS A changes subsequent to time t such that BTS A has sufficient bandwidth to transmit the paging message in a next slot. The BTS A sends a paging confirmation message to the BSC  at time t. A quick paging message is sent from BTS A during the time interval from t to t. The BTS A then sends the paging message during the next slot, i.e., time interval t to t. The present embodiment allows each BTS to send a paging message during one of multiple time intervals. The BTS identifies each time interval during which the paging message is sent to the target MS. In this way, for each BTS, the BSC  may track transmission of the paging message.","The BSC may use this information to modify a quick paging soft-handoff list maintained at the BSC, BTS and MS. According to one embodiment, the BSC ignores those BTS having insufficient bandwidth to transmit the paging message, thus saving power consumption at the MS as the MS does not need to update the list as often.","One embodiment for implementing the quick paging described hereinabove is illustrated in . The method  is performed in a base station or other control terminal, wherein at step  the base station receives a quick paging instruction for a given mobile station, MS. The instruction also indicates a number of paging repetitions, identified as N. At step  the base station initializes a slot index i to the value N. At decision diamond  the base station determines if the number of paging repetitions is equal to 1. For the case of N=1, the base station sends the quick paging signal and then sends the page message in the first slot assigned to MS, the target recipient of the page. As indicated in , the base station sends the quick paging message for MS and then sends the paging message in slot i at step . For the case of N=1, the paging is synchronized between all of the base stations, wherein each base station transmits the paging message during a same slot assigned to the target mobile station.","In contrast, if the number of paging repetitions does not equal one, processing continues to step  to send the quick paging message for MS. The case of N>1 is referred to as a pseudo-synchronized paging scenario. At step  the base station determines the loading condition for pending transactions. If the paging slots available from the base station are congested, the base station increments the slot index at step . If the base station loading allows transmission of the page to MS, then the page is sent during slot i at step . Processing then continues to step  to increment the slot index. At decision diamond , the index i is compared to the number of paging repetitions N, wherein if the number of paging repetitions is satisfied, the process ends. Else, processing returns to step  to send the quick page message to MS. Note in one embodiment, once the base station transmits the paging message the process for ends for the target mobile station and no further quick page messages are sent.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5"],"b":["500","502","502","504","504","506","508","504","508","508","512","512","510","508","506","510","508"]},"In one embodiment, a mobile station operating within a wireless communication system receives and processes the quick paging messages from at least two base stations while in soft handoff. The mobile station then receives and processes a first paging message from a first base station, wherein the first paging message is received during a transmission cycle of the first base station. During a subsequent cycle, the mobile station receives a second paging message from a second base station. The mobile station then processes the paging information and determines a response with respect to the first and second base stations. The receiving and processing may be performed by computer-readable instructions stored in memory resident to the mobile station. Also, the receiving and processing may be performed by dedicated hardware, firmware, or a combination thereof.","As disclosed hereinabove, a method for processing paging messages in a wireless system allows for individual loading conditions of the base stations in communication with a mobile station. By designating a number of paging repetitions, a base station is not prevented from sending a paging message due to loading, but rather may send the page when the loading allows it.","Thus a variety of methods have been illustrated hereinabove for paging in a wireless system. Each method finds application according to the design and resource requirements of a given system.
