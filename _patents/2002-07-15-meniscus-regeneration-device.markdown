No. 10\/195,719 entitled \u201cDevices from Naturally Occurring Biologically Derived Materials\u201d; Ser. No. 10\/195,347 entitled \u201cCartilage Repair Apparatus and Method\u201d; Ser.

Cross reference is also made to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/172,347 entitled \u201cHybrid Biologic-Synthetic Bioabsorbable Scaffolds\u201d which was filed on Jun. 14, 2002, which is assigned to the same assignee as the present application, and which is hereby incorporated by reference.","The present disclosure relates to devices for repairing or regenerating a meniscus or a portion of a meniscus in a knee.","It is known to use various collageneous scaffolds to provide a matrix for repair and regeneration of damaged tissue. U.S. Pat. No. 6,042,610 to ReGen Biologics, hereby incorporated by reference, discloses the use of a device comprising a bioabsorbable material made at least in part from purified natural fibers of collagen or glycosaminoglycans. The purified natural fibers are cross-linked to form the device of U.S. Pat. No. 6,042,610. The device can be used to provide augmentation for a damaged meniscus. Related U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,735,903, 5,681,353, 5,306,311, 5,007,934, and 4,880,429 also disclose a meniscal augmentation device for establishing a scaffold adapted for ingrowth of meniscal fibrochondrocyts.","It is also known to use naturally occurring extracellular matrices (ECMs) to provide a scaffold for tissue repair and regeneration. One such ECM is small intestine submucosa (SIS). SIS has been described as a natural biomaterial used to repair, support, and stabilize a wide variety of anatomical defects and traumatic injuries. See, for example, Cook\u00ae Online New Release provided by Cook Biotech of Bloomington, Ind., a copy of which can be found at their online website. The SIS material is reported to be a naturally-occurring collagenous matrix derived from porcine small intestinal submucosa that models the qualities of its host when implanted in human soft tissues. Further, it is taught that the SIS material provides a natural matrix with a three-dimensional structure and biochemical composition that attracts host cells and supports tissue remodeling. SIS products, such as Oasis material and Surgisis material, are commercially available from Cook Biotech, Bloomington, IN.","An SIS product referred to as RESTORE Orthobiologic Implant is available from DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. in Warsaw, Ind. The DePuy product is described for use during rotator cuff surgery, and is provided as a resorbable framework that allows the rotator cuff tendon to regenerate itself. The RESTORE Implant is derived from porcine small intestine submucosa that has been cleaned, disinfected, and sterilized. Small intestine submucosa (SIS) has been described as a naturally-occurring ECM composed primarily of collagenous proteins. Other biological molecules, such as growth factors, glycosaminoglycans, etc., have also been identified in SIS. See Hodde et al., Tissue Eng. 2(3): 209-217 (1996); Voytik-Harbin et al., J. Cell Biochem., 67:478-491 (1997); McPherson and Badylak, Tissue Eng., 4(1): 75-83 (1998); Hodde et al., Endothelium, 8(1):11-24 (2001); Hodde and Hiles, Wounds, 13(5): 195-201 (2001); Hurst and Bonner, J. Biomater. Sci. Polym. Ed., 12(11) 1267-1279 (2001); Hodde et al., Biomaterial, 23(8): 1841-1848 (2002); and Hodde, Tissue Eng., 8(2): 295-308 (2002), all of which are incorporated by reference herein. During seven years of preclinical testing in animals, there were no incidences of infection transmission from the implant to the host, and the SIS material has not decreased the systemic activity of the immune system. See Allman et al., Transplant, 17(11): 1631-1640 (2001); Allman et al., Tissue Eng., 8(1): 53-62 (2002).","Other products made from porcine small intestine are commercially available. For example, Organogenesis, Inc., of Canton, Mass., is understood to market such products under the designations GRAFTPATCH, FORTAFLEX, FORTAGEN and FORTAPERM, and possibly under other designations.","While small intestine submucosa is available, other sources of submucosa are known to be effective for tissue remodeling. These sources include, but are not limited to, stomach, bladder, alimentary, respiratory, or genital submucosa, or liver basement membrane. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,171,344, 6,099,567, and 5,554,389, hereby incorporated by reference. Further, while SIS is most often porcine derived, it is known that these various submucosa materials may be derived from non-porcine sources, including bovine and ovine sources. Additionally, other collageneous matrices are known, for example lamina propria and stratum compactum.","For the purposes of this disclosure, it is within the definition of a naturally occurring ECM to clean, delaminate, and\/or comminute the ECM, or even to cross-link the collagen fibers within the ECM. It is also within the definition of naturally occurring ECM to fully or partially remove one or more sub-components of the naturally occurring ECM. However, it is not within the definition of a naturally occurring ECM to extract and purify the natural collagen or other components or sub-components of the ECM and reform a matrix material from the purified natural collagen or other components or sub-components of the ECM. Thus, while reference is made to SIS, it is understood that other naturally occurring ECMs are within the scope of this invention. Thus, in this application, the terms \u201cnaturally occurring extracellular matrix\u201d or \u201cnaturally occurring ECM\u201d are intended to refer to extracellular matrix material that has been cleaned, disinfected, sterilized, and optionally cross-linked. The terms \u201cnaturally occurring extracellular matrix\u201d and \u201cnaturally occurring ECM\u201d are also intended to include ECM foam material prepared as described in copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/195,354 entitled \u201cPorous Extracellular Matrix Scaffold and Method\u201d, filed concurrently herewith.","The following patents, hereby incorporated by reference, disclose the use of ECMs for the regeneration and repair of various tissues: U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,334,872, 6,187,039, 6,176,880, 6,126,686, 6,099,567, 6,096,347, 5,997,575, 5,993,844, 5,968,096, 5,955,110, 5,922,028, 5,885,619, 5,788,625, 5,762,966, 5,755,791, 5,753,267, 5,733,337, 5,711,969, 5,645,860, 5,641,518, 5,554,389, 5,516,533, 5,460,962, 5,445,833, 5,372,821, 5,352,463, 5,281,422, and 5,275,826. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,275,826 and 5,516,533 disclose providing a mass of SIS, particularly as a fluidized injectable mass, to promote repair of tissue defects. U.S. Pat. No. 5,352,463 discloses an SIS pillow filled with comminuted SIS for regeneration of a meniscus. While U.S. Pat. No. 5,352,463 contemplates the general concept of meniscus regeneration with an SIS filled pouch, it does not address itself to providing such a pouch having the capability of withstanding the compression and shear stresses involved in an implant for regenerating a meniscus.","The present disclosure relates to a device for regenerating a meniscus of a knee or a portion thereof. A natural meniscus in a human knee has a generally wedge-shaped cross-section, i.e., a section through a plane extending along and radially outwardly from the axis of the tibia either through the medial meniscus or the lateral meniscus will define a generally wedged-shaped cross-section. Typically, the device will be placed in a meniscal space from which a defective portion of the meniscus is removed, and that space will be a generally wedge-shaped space. The device will be placed in the space and anchored to the surrounding tissue. In one embodiment, a composite device will be inserted into the space from which the defective meniscus portion has been removed. The device comprises an upper cover made from toughened naturally occurring extracellular matrix (ECM), the cover defining a space therebelow. In some embodiments, the cover comprises a plurality of layers of naturally occurring ECM laminated together and toughened to withstand articulation stresses. A mass comprising comminuted naturally occurring ECM is disposed in the space. In various embodiments, the mass may also comprise bioactive agents, biologically-derived agents, cells, biological lubricants, biocompatible inorganic materials, biocompatible polymers and\/or some combination thereof mixed with the comminuted ECM.","In some embodiments, a biocompatible polymer can be used in conjunction with naturally occurring ECM. See, for example, the teachings of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/195,341 entitled \u201cHybrid Biologic\/Synthetic Porous Extracellular Matrix Scaffolds\u201d filed contemporaneously herewith, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/172,347 entitled \u201cHybrid Biologic-Synthetic Bioabsorbable Scaffolds,\u201d which was filed on Jun. 14, 2002.","An implant for regeneration or repair of the meniscus of the knee may be toughened to withstand better the compression and\/or shear forces of the knee for a sufficient amount of time for remodeling to begin. It will be understood that a surgeon may immobilize or partially immobilize the knee for a period of time subsequent to surgery. The rehabilitation protocol may include limited articulation, compression, and shear forces for a period of time. However, an implant that is toughened should be able to withstand even these reduced forces better than an equivalent implant that has not been toughened. At the same time, the material must be porous enough to permit remodeling. Thus, it is preferred that the condyle-facing surface of the ECM device of this disclosure is toughened to withstand the forces. Toughness may include stiffness (i.e. tensile modulus), resistance to delamination, increased thickness, resistance to shear or abrasion, decreased water content, or increased density, for example.","One method of toughening is dehydrothermal cross-linking. Techniques for dehydrothermal cross-linking are known in the art, but the steps in one method include applying mechanical pressure to the ECM while using vacuum to remove water, and subsequently delivering pressurized warm air to the ECM, thus producing a dehydrated ECM. Other methods of mechanical cross-linking, as are known in the art, may be used to toughen the upper cover of the device of the present disclosure. Such methods of physical cross-linking include, for example, freeze-drying, irradiation (ultraviolet or gamma irradiation) and combinations of methods. In addition, chemical cross-linking can be used to toughen the upper cover of the device of the present disclosure. Chemical cross-linking can be achieved through the use of materials like aldehydes, carbodiimides, glycation agents, enzymes and the like.","In some embodiments, the upper cover is formed by laminating a plurality of sheets of naturally occurring ECM and treating it to provide a toughened surface capable of withstanding the compression and shear stresses involved in knee articulation, i.e., the articulation of the knee condyle on the device inserted into the meniscus. The mass in the space below the upper cover may be comminuted SIS or is alternatively bioactive agents, biologically derived agents, cells or combinations thereof, for example. Other collageneous materials may also be used for the mass in the space below the upper cover, alone or in combination with the above-mentioned materials. The mass of comminuted naturally occurring ECM is believed to provide a framework for meniscus regeneration. The insertion of the device into the space from which the defective portion has been removed and the attachment of the device to the surrounding tissue places the device such that it is in contact with the host tissue of the remaining meniscus such that the meniscus will be regenerated in the space from which the defective portion is removed. However, in some embodiments the space below the upper cover is left empty; if desired, biological material may be implanted as a discrete element or could be injected intraoperatively or post-operatively for example.","To reduce the stress on the upper surface of the device, a lubricant may be affixed or applied to the toughened surface of the implant. For example, a lubricant such as hyaluronic acid may be affixed to the upper surface of the device by cross-linking. Other lubricants can also be used. Reference is made to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/195,606 entitled \u201cCartilage Repair and Regeneration Device and Method\u201d, filed concurrently herewith, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","One embodiment, therefore, is a composite device comprising a cover of naturally occurring ECM and a framework therebelow provided to accommodate the regeneration. With the mass of comminuted ECM, the device serves as a cushion for the condyle load and a bearing surface for the condyle. By placing the device into close contact with the remaining portion of the meniscus, the regeneration will take place.","In another embodiment of the present invention, the device comprises a shell shaped conformingly to fit into the space occupied by the removed meniscus portion, the shell to provide an upper surface to withstand the articulation of the knee and a space below the upper surface. A bioactive agent, biologically derived agent, cells, biocompatible polymer, biocompatible inorganic material, biological lubricant or combinations thereof is disposed within the space. It will be appreciated that shells of different size and shape will be provided to surgeons such that they can remove a portion of the damaged meniscus conforming to the shape of a device to be inserted or size the shell to conform to the removed portion of damaged meniscus. Templates can be provided to guide the surgeon in the removal of the defective portion. Preferably, the device is shaped to conform to the space into which it is inserted such that the surrounding tissue of the remaining meniscus is in contact with the device. It has been found, for example, that a plug made from comminuted ECM such as SIS may be inserted into a hole in a meniscus to regenerate the meniscus and close the hole. Such a plug may be wrapped or covered with layers of SIS.","For handling purposes, the devices will preferably be made in a factory and supplied to the surgeons for selection and use based on size and shape. In some embodiments, the devices will be provided in dried or lyophilized condition to be hydrated by the surgeon. Portions of the exterior of the device, particularly those portions providing communication with the biological mass under the upper cover, may be perforated to expedite the hydration of the device.","In some embodiments, the device for regenerating a meniscus or a portion thereof comprises a wedge-shaped biological scaffold material body having an apex portion and a base portion spaced radially outwardly from the apex portion. The body provides an upper surface to face a condyle of the femur and to provide for articulation of the knee against the upper surface and a lower surface to face the tibial platform of the knee. This body, which may be fabricated from sheets or strips of naturally occurring ECM, is formed to provide a plurality of channels or compartments disposed between the upper and lower surfaces. In some embodiments, the channels or compartments extend radially inwardly from the base portion to the apex portion. In other embodiments, the channels or compartments extend circumferentially about the device, i.e., in the circumferential direction of the original meniscus. In some embodiments, the radially extending channels will be generally conical in shape with their large ends disposed toward the base portion and their smaller ends disposed toward the apex portion. In some embodiments, the circumferential channels will be arranged such that smaller diameter channels will be disposed toward the apex portion and larger diameter channels will be disposed adjacent the base portion.","These channels or compartments may be filled with comminuted naturally occurring ECMs to provide a framework for meniscus regeneration. In some embodiments, the comminuted ECM will be mixed with or replaced by bioactive agents, biologically-derived agents, cells, biological lubricants, biocompatible inorganic materials, biocompatible polymers and\/or combinations thereof. The ECM material providing the upper surface and the lower surface may be laminated sheets or strips of an ECM material such as SIS which may be formed under pressure and heat. It will be appreciated that lyophilization may be used to dry the mass of comminuted material.","It will be appreciated that various structures may be provided within the concept of the present disclosure to produce a composite device having an upper cover made from a toughened sheet of a naturally occurring ECM with a mass of comminuted naturally occurring ECM therebelow to accommodate the regeneration of the meniscus. For example, a device for regenerating a meniscus or a portion thereof may comprise a wedge-shaped body having radially extending or circumferentially extending compartments or channels into which the comminuted ECM is placed. The upper or lower panels may merely serve as covers for the device's internal structure which may be made separately from the panels as will be further described herein. In some embodiments, the devices are made in the shape of a pillow, the upper and lower covers of which provide an interior space which is filled with a biological material to provide a framework for meniscus regeneration. Channels or compartments within the space between the upper and lower covers may be fabricated, for example, with partitions of ECM material to direct the regeneration. In some cases, the channels or compartments will extend radially inwardly and in other cases, the channels or compartments will extend circumferentially.","Various systems may be provided for forming naturally occurring ECMs such as SIS layers or strips to provide the panels or covers and to provide the recesses, channels or compartments in between the panels or covers. It has been found that layers of harvested and cleaned SIS may be drawn into cavities in vacuum forming operations. Such layers of SIS may be formed and then laminated together and dried by the application of heat and pressure. The mass of biological material such as the comminuted SIS may be placed in the vacuum formed cavities as part of the forming process.","The present invention also comprises a method of regenerating a portion of a knee meniscus comprising the steps of removing a segment of a meniscus to provide a partial meniscal space extending circumferentially about a predetermined portion of the tibial platform and leaving remaining segments of the original meniscus. This partial meniscal space will have a radially outer portion and a radially inner portion. The method involves providing an implant device constructed from naturally occurring ECMs and shaped to conform to the partial meniscal space. The device is placed into the space and then attached to the adjacent tissue of the knee. The method encourages regeneration from the radially outer portion of the device to the radially inner portion of the device. In embodiments of the present invention, the encouraging step comprises channeling blood flow from the vascular rich outer portion of the meniscus and the device to the radially inner portion of the device. The regeneration is encouraged by structuring the device such that the vascular rich portion of the original meniscus and the adjacent radially outer portion of the original meniscus will work with the device and particularly the mass of biological material under the upper cover of the device to regenerate the meniscal tissue.","In one embodiment, the method of the present invention, therefore, comprises the steps of replacing a portion of the original meniscus with a naturally occurring extracellular matrix material shaped and formed to provide an upper surface toughened to withstand the compression and shear stress of articulation of the knee and an interior space into which the meniscal regeneration occurs and attaching the material to the surrounding tissue to provide blood flow to the device. In some embodiments, the interior space is filled with a mass of comminuted naturally occurring extracellular matrix material, bioactive agents, biologically-derived agents, cells or various combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the comminuted ECM may be chemically cross-linked by chemical agents such as aldehydes, carbodiamide, glycation agents, enzymes or the like. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,042,610, already incorporated by reference, at columns 11-12. In some embodiments, the comminuted ECM may be physically cross-linked by heat (thermal cross-linking), radiation (ultraviolet or gamma irradiation), or combinations such as drying at elevated temperatures (dehydrothermal crosslinking). And in some embodiments a lubricating agent may be applied or affixed to the device.","For handling and installation purposes, some embodiments comprise a cover over a recess which is filled with biological materials and constructed to provide a framework for meniscus regeneration. At least the upper cover is formed from a material which will withstand the compression and shear stresses involved in articulation of the femur on the tibia, i.e., of the condyles on the tibia platform. It will be appreciated that this is a dynamic stress situation for the upper cover and, for that matter, for the device attached to the surrounding tissue or anchored in the space from which the defected meniscus portion is removed. This upper cover of the device may be provided by treating layers of ECM with heat and pressure to form a toughened upper surface.","In this specification and in the appended claims, unless expressly limited otherwise, it is intended that \u201ctoughened\u201d or \u201ctreatment for toughening\u201d shall involve treating ECM such as SIS with various treatment steps including such steps as laminating several layers of ECM strips together and treating the layers with compression and vacuum or heat or combinations of pressure, vacuum, and heat. It is contemplated that such layers may be laminated together and bonded by both mechanical compression and application of vacuum and\/or heated air which accomplishes the bonding and also dries the product, leading to a dehydrated product. It has been found that several layers of SIS can be laminated together with heat, vacuum, and pressure to provide a portion of the composite structure. Illustratively, in some embodiments, both the upper cover and the lower cover defining the shell of the device are treated with heat and pressure to remove water from the ECM comprising the shell to produce a shell comprising a dehydrated naturally occurring extracellular matrix. It has been found that various drying conditions affect the toughness of the ECM. For example, changing the platen or drying surface in vacuum drying by reducing the size of the openings in the platen can increase the toughness of the resultant ECM. Drying in air or hot air, as compared to in vacuum, can also produce a dehydrated extracellular matrix having increased toughness. Any method to increase density, for example by increasing the number of layers of ECM in a given volume, will also increase toughness. Altering the orientation of layers, selecting older animals, selecting species having tougher ECMs, and processing techniques (for example, increasing concentration of peracetic acid or pressure from rollers) can also affect the toughness of the resultant ECM.","Unless otherwise expressly limited, \u201ctoughened\u201d or \u201ctreatment for toughening\u201d may also include other means of cross-linking ECM. As discussed above, the ECM can be chemically crosslinked to increase the toughness of all or a portion of the ECM through the use of agents such as aldehydes, carbodiimides, glycation agents, enzymes and the like. In addition, as discussed above, other methods of crosslinking the ECM may be used. For example, radiation (including UV, RF, and gamma radiation) could be used to toughen the ECM. When UV or RF radiation is used, preferably the ECM is crosslinked prior to final drying. Additionally, combinations of methods may be used, such as be drying at elevated temperatures (dehydrothermal crosslinking). All of such methods are intended to be included in the expressions \u201ctoughened\u201d and \u201ctreatment for toughening\u201d unless expressly limited.","In this specification and claims, unless expressly limited otherwise, \u201cgenerally wedge-shaped\u201d is intended to define the shape of a device that has a thick base portion and a thin apex portion, wherein the device tapers between the thick base portion and the thin apex portion. Although a generally wedge-shaped device can have flat upper and lower surfaces (see, e.g., ), such a device can also have one or more surfaces that are curved, such as a tapering convex surface (see, e.g. ) or a tapering concave surface, or could have stepped or contoured surfaces that follow the contour of any underlying material.","In this specification and claims, unless otherwise expressly limited, \u201cmass of biological material\u201d is intended to include naturally occurring extracellular matrix, bioactive agents, and\/or biologically-derived agents and cells. \u201cMass of biological material\u201d is also intended to include biological materials formed in whole or in part from such matrices, agents and cells. Thus, \u201cmass of biological material\u201d includes comminuted extracellular matrix and extracellular matrix foams as disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/195,354 entitled \u201cPorous Extracellular Matrix Scaffold and Method\u201d, and hybrid materials, as disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/195,341 entitled \u201cHybrid Biologic\/Synthetic Porous Extracellular Matrix Scaffolds\u201d, all of which are filed concurrently herewith, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/172,347 entitled \u201cHybrid Biologic-Synthetic Bioabsorbable Scaffolds\u201d which was filed on Jun. 14, 2002, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein. Unless otherwise expressly limited, \u201cmass of biological material\u201d includes material from which commercially available products are made, including, for example: the RESTORE\u00ae Orthobiologic Implant, available from DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. of Warsaw, Indiana; OASIS and SURGISIS products available from Cook Biotech, Inc. of Bloomington, Indiana; \u201cTISSUEMEND\u201d available from TEI Biosciences Inc. of Boston, Mass.; and GRAFTPATCH, FORTAFLEX, FORTAGEN and FORTAPERM products available from Organogenesis, Inc. of Canton, Mass. Unless expressly limited otherwise, the expression \u201cmass of biological material\u201d is also intended to encompass purified collagen, such as that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,042,610. The expression \u201cmass of biological material\u201d is intended to encompass all such materials regardless of whether they include another material, regardless of their physical state (e.g. powder or foam), and regardless of whether they are cross-linked or otherwise toughened, unless otherwise expressly stated. The expression \u201cmass of biological material\u201d should be understood to encompass both materials that are integral and that which comprise discrete elements. \u201cMass of biological material\u201d should also be understood to encompass all forms of these materials, including dry forms, solutions, dispersions, gels, and pastes for example. Specific examples of materials for the mass of biological materials include: comminuted ECM; ECM pieces; ECM foam; an ECM roll; woven ECM; a non-woven ECM mat; braided ECM; ECM solution; ECM dispersion; ECM slurry; ECM gel; ECM paste; and ECM that has not been toughened. Such ECMs include but are not limited to: comminuted SIS; SIS pieces; SIS foam; an SIS roll; woven SIS; non-woven SIS mat; braided SIS; SIS solution; SIS dispersion; SIS slurry; SIS gel; SIS paste; and SIS that has not been toughened.","In the specification and claims, \u201ccomminuted\u201d is intended to mean reduced to pieces. \u201cPiece\u201d and \u201cpieces\u201d are intended to mean any fiber, strip, ribbon, sliver, filament, shred, bit, fragment, part, flake, slice, cut, chunk, or other portion of solid or solid-like material. \u201cComminuted\u201d is not intended to imply any particular means of producing the pieces.

platform  below the condyles  of a knee support a meniscus  from which an illustrative defective portion  is removed to leave a wedge-shaped space . In the removal process, the surgeon will generally leave an outer rim  of the meniscus. It is well known that the radially outer portion of a meniscus is richly vascularized while the radially inner portion of a meniscus is not so well vascularized. Menisci have been described by people working in the orthopaedic field to be two semi-lunar, wedge-shaped concave fibrocartilagenous structures anchored to the tibia plateau (such as shown at ) in the knee. The menisci provide a large surface of articulation between the otherwise incongruent surfaces of the tibia platform or plateau and the femur condyles (such indicated at ). The menisci serve to reduce contact stresses and wear in the knee joint. The peripheral rim of the meniscus at the menisco-synovial junction is highly vascular (red zone) whereas the inner two-third portion of the meniscus is completely avascular (white zone), with a small transition (red-white zone) between the two. Degenerative or traumatic tears to the meniscus which result in partial or complete loss of function frequently occur in the white zone. Such tears result in unstable flaps of meniscal tissue in the knee joint causing, in the short term, severe joint pain and locking, and in the long term, a loss of meniscal function leading to osteoarthritis. The current standard-of-care involves partial meniscectomy to remove unstable tissue to relieve joint pain and locking. However, when the resected tissue is from the avascular (white zone), the meniscus has little potential for self regeneration. Thus, the current standard-of-care results in partial but permanent loss of meniscal tissue, making the joint susceptible to osteoarthritis.","The portion  removed from the structure shown in  includes a portion of the original meniscus which is within the avascular zone, particularly the radially inner portion.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0140","num":"0139"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIGS. 3 and 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["20","16","18","20","16","18","22","24","22","24","26","26","16"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0141","num":"0140"},"figref":["FIGS. 1-4","FIG. 2","FIGS. 3 and 4"],"b":["20","16","20","12","10","20","16","20","16","22","20","12","22","20"]},"Turning to ,  and , it will be seen that an illustrative concept of a regeneration device is somewhat diagrammatically illustrated.

The pressurized air is typically provided at room temperature to 120\u00b0 C., and more typically from 30 to 70\u00b0 C. Thus, it is understood that elements  and  in the drawings represent sources of vacuum and pressurized air. The combination of mechanical pressure and hot air results in toughened layers through dehydrothermal cross-linking.","As a result of toughening the ECM layers as described above, with heat and compression, the resultant toughened ECM laminate can be expected to be more dense than standard commercial ECM products. As an example, a toughened SIS laminate formed from twenty (20) layers of SIS material compressed in a vacuum bed at a temperature of 30\u00b0 C. for 1 hour was determined to have a density of about 0.933+\/\u22120.061 g\/cm. It can be expected that the density and other properties of such toughened ECM laminates can be varied with variations in processing conditions such as temperature and pressure. In comparison, the commercially available RESTORE\u00ae SIS laminate product has a density of 0.466+\/\u22120.074 gm\/cm. A hardened SIS device as described in U.S. Provisional patent application Ser. No. 10\/195,719 entitled \u201cDevices from Naturally Occurring Biologically Derived Materials\u201d, filed concurrently herewith, can be made with a density of 0.747+\/\u22120.059 gm\/cm, for example. An SIS foam can be made as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/195,354 entitled \u201cPorous Extracellular Matrix Scaffold and Method\u201d, filed concurrently herewith, with a substantially lower density: 0.091+\/\u22120.019 gm\/cm; 0.035+\/\u22120.012 \u03bcm\/cm; or 0.006+\/\u22120.002 gm\/cm, for example.","While the  illustration shows four layers  and six layers , it will be appreciated that different numbers of layers may be used. For example, a device may have from 2 to 10 layers  and from 5 to 20 layers . It will also be appreciated that different numbers of layers, different orientations of the layers, and different drying conditions may affect toughness. In one example, strips of clean, disinfected porcine SIS material as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,902,508 and 4,956,178, were cut into swatches approximately 3.5\u2033 square. Several 20-layer implants were assembled from the swatches. Each swatch was oriented at 72\u00b0 from the previous to obtain an isotropic laminated implant. The implants were dried under vacuum pressure in a gel drier system (Model FB-GD-45, Fisher scientific, Pittsburgh, Pa.), for approximately 2 hours at 30\u00b0 C., under two different conditions. One set of implants was sandwiched between perforated stainless steel screens (20 gage thick 304 stainless steel, 15\u2212\u00d719\u2033 screen with 1\/16\u2033 holes, 3\/32\u2033 staggered centers arranged in hexagonal-close-packed format). These implants had a \u201cdimpled\u201d surface after drying, corresponding to the perforations on the screen. The other set of implants were dried in the same way as the first except that the porous screens were replaced by flat non-perforated surfaces. These implants had a smooth surface after drying. At least six implants of each type were fabricated. Uniaxial tension mechanical testing of implants, conducted according to ASTM standard D638, showed that the average failure stress of the smooth implants was more than two times that of the dimpled implants (46.02+\/\u22121.14 MPa versus 19.97+\/\u22121.04 MPa.) The smooth implants were hence tougher than the dimpled implants.","The sequence of the system of  is illustrated showing the layers  drawn down into the cavity  in .  shows the mass  located in the cavity and  shows the platen  closing against the platen  to capture the layers  above the mass .","As discussed above, a naturally occurring ECM for use in this invention is SIS. While SIS is commercially available, an illustrative method of obtaining SIS is as follows. Porcine SIS preferably comes from pigs raised on a Specific Pathogen Free farm. Such pigs are free from all pneumonia, diarrhea, lice, mange, and dysentery. The average pig weight is 220-280 lbs. The age of each pig should be between 150-200 days, and each pig is free from antibiotic administration for 21 days before slaughter. It is preferable that no unrefined animal byproducts be included in the pigs' diets. The SIS is obtained from the slaughterhouse by standard methods of obtaining casings. However, unless the SIS is used immediately, it is preferred that the SIS be stored in a frozen state lower than \u221220\u00b0 C., and most preferably at \u221280\u00b0 C. The SIS may be cleaned and disinfected by standard techniques, for example with 20% ethanol and 0.15% peracetic acid.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0149","num":"0148"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["80","82","84","86","88","60","86","88","58","64","60","80","60"]},"The device formed under pressure, compression, and heat in the system shown in  may be further treated in well known lyophilization processes to dry the device for shipment and\/or storage. The lower surface  and the base portion  may be perforated as by penetration with a very fine cannula or other means to facilitate the hydration of the device. It will be appreciated that, when the wet layers of SIS ,  and the mass  are dried, the body of the device, particularly the lower cover  and base portion  may shrink or cave in without the moisture. However, as illustrated, that shrinkage or caving in does not occur. The pinholes indicated at  expedite the hydration of the device for use by the physician.","Laminating the layers  under heat and pressure will provide a toughened surface to serve as a bearing surface against which a condyle will move. Ultimately, after insertion into the knee, and over a period of time, the device  will be remodeled to regenerate the damaged portion of the meniscus. Illustratively, subsequent to insertion, the patient will recuperate for 3-6 weeks without substantial load bearing on the knee. During this time, body fluids such as blood and synovial fluids infuse into the implant. If additional biological lubricants such as hyaluronic acid are injected into the site, such injected fluids also infuse into the implant.

The cells that infuse into the implant are known to proliferate in mass . Subsequently, when the patient resumes load bearing on the knee, it is believed that the cells begin secreting structural proteins (mostly collagens) in response to exposure to the forces of load bearing. These secreted structural proteins reform the meniscal body.
