More particularly, the invention relates to the use of wireless control and wireless power in light emitting diode (LED) based devices primarily for illumination purposes.","Description of the Related Art","Conservation and management of electrical power are a growing concern with regard to both cost and environmental impact. In various lighting applications, the use of light emitting diodes (LEDs) for illumination is beginning to emerge as a lighting source with potential for addressing these concerns. LED light sources have a long life, are energy efficient, are durable and operate over a wide temperature range. While LED lighting is becoming an attractive option for certain applications, it is not optimal for many applications. Therefore, there is a need for improved LED lighting systems.","The present invention is directed generally to devices and applications related to the use of wireless control and wireless power in light emitting diode (LED) based lighting devices. More particularly, the devices and applications according to various embodiments of the present invention make use of wireless control and wireless power in lighting devices to provide advantages in ease of installation, in the ability to install lighting in locations independent of a connection to wired power, in cost savings, in energy efficiency and in the reduction of energy consumption at times of peak demand through controls and power management and in safety, security, and convenience for the end user.","Wireless control, as in relation to lighting facilities of the present invention, may be defined as any control aspect that provides a controlling function to the lighting facility without the use of a wired connection, such as a wired control interface, wired power control, and the like. Control aspects may include, but are not limited to, a wireless remote control interface (e.g. RF remote control), a wireless power controller (e.g. control of the source of power to the LEDs, such as including integrated energy storage device(s) and AC power), a wireless control input (e.g. an environmental sensor input), internal programmed control (e.g. internal program store controlled through a state machine or processor), and the like. In embodiments, cost savings and power management may be implemented through wireless control. In embodiments, wireless control may enable a distributed intelligence architecture where the LED lighting facility may operate in an autonomous manner in response to its wireless control inputs or internal program. In embodiment, wireless control may be used in conjunction with wireless power to allow operation of the lighting facility completely independent of the power grid.","In some embodiments, wireless control allows the installation of the device in any indoor or outdoor location where light may be desired without the need for a wired connection to control it. In some embodiments, wireless control is used in a lighting device with a wired connection but allows an alternate method of control of the light rather than by its wired connection. In some embodiments, a lighting circuit may have multiple lights on the circuit, but wireless control built into the lights on that lighting circuit may allow them to be independently controlled.","Power sources that can be used stand-alone as described herein (i.e. not connected to a traditional AC power source) are defined as wireless power sources. A wireless power source may be an energy storage device such as a non-rechargeable battery, a rechargeable battery, a capacitor, a fuel cell, and the like. A wireless power source may be derived from an energy harvesting method such as using solar cells, capturing radiofrequency energy, converting kinetic energy to electrical energy (including converting motion or tension into electrical energy), converting thermal energy into electrical energy, converting wind energy into electrical energy, and the like. Multiple wireless power sources may be used together in some embodiments. For example, a light bulb with an integrated rechargeable battery may also contain solar cells on its housing and the ability to charge the integrated battery accordingly.","In some embodiments, a wireless power source integrated into the lighting device allows the installation of the lighting device in any indoor or outdoor location where light may be desired without the need for a wired connection to an AC power source. In other embodiments there is a wired connection to an AC power source, but the wireless power source is used when advantageous, for example as a backup power source in an emergency or as an alternative power source to provide energy efficiency or cost savings.","The embodiments described for the present invention may use wireless control and wireless power in conjunction with LEDs as a light source for illumination. In one embodiment, a power uninterruptable LED light with sensor-based control for transferring to internal power in the event of an AC power disruption is described. The power uninterruptable LED light may be designed in a housing type of a bulb, tube, lamp, fixture, retrofit fixture, and the like. The housing may contain internal wireless power in the form of an internal power source such as a rechargeable battery that can be used to power the light source upon a detected AC power disruption. For example, the power uninterruptable LED light may be a standard size light bulb that when plugged into a standard light socket acts normally as a light bulb, but in the event of an AC power disruption may use the internal power source to continue emitting light through the power disruption. Several forms of wireless control can be used with the disclosed invention including AC power sensing, impedance sensing of the lighting circuit to determine the on\/off state of controlling switches, remote control in the form of a radio frequency receiver, sensors built into the housing such as a motion sensor or light sensor, and the like.","Another embodiment of the invention is directed to an externally controllable LED light in a housing type of a bulb, tube, lamp, fixture, retrofit fixture, and the like, that may receive commands from a power company or lighting control software to control the use of the wireless power source. For example, a load control switch or demand response mechanism reducing light intensity may be designed to control lighting to reduce power consumption during periods of peak usage of electricity. In the instance of reducing the intensity of the lights, the present invention instead may move the power switched off or reduced by the power company or lighting control software onto battery power, thus enabling the light to stay at the same intensity level while still reducing the power consumed from the AC power source. The source of the load control signal is external to the externally controllable LED light itself. This is \u201cgrid shifting\u201d or storing energy from the grid to the integrated power source at one time and using that stored energy at another time when it is advantageous. This allows moving on and off of the AC power source using the integrated power source as an alternate power source and the control of that and other functions with external signals. In some embodiments, AC power and the integrated power source may be used simultaneously where the load is shared by the power sources. In such a case, the load on the AC power source may be reduced by some amount by transferring some amount of load to the integrated power source. The externally controllable LED light may also contain any form of wireless control which can also be controlled by the power company or lighting control software to enable, disable or set the functionality of the wireless control mechanism.","Another embodiment of the invention is directed to a wirelessly controlled LED light bulb containing an integrated power source where the wireless control is through built in sensors, program based intelligence, remote control based on a communication interface wirelessly, over the wire, and the like. With wireless control and wireless power integrated, the wirelessly controlled LED light bulb may operate autonomously in response to the input devices, internal timers, internal clock and\/or internal program. It may have the ability to use the integrated power source autonomously for grid shifting, load shedding, independent control of the light sources on a single lighting circuit, backup power, energy harvesting when an energy harvesting power source is integrated in the bulb, or any application-specific function in which an integrated power source may be advantageous.","Another embodiment of the invention is directed to a wirelessly networked LED light with sensor-based control. The wirelessly networked LED light with sensor-based control may be designed in a housing type of a bulb, tube, lamp, fixture, retrofit fixture, battery powered fixture, and the like. Building a networking capability into a removable and replaceable wirelessly networked LED light bulb creates the ability to plug bulbs in such that they become part of the network without running new wiring (i.e. a plug and play lighting network). This is enabled by building the ability to receive control and programming over a network as well as forward or route traffic to other wirelessly networked LED lights that are part of the network into the lights themselves. If the wirelessly networked LED light is a removable device such as a bulb, tube or lamp, it may be installed as a light source and a node in the lighting network by installing it in a standard socket. Networked bulbs, tubes, lamps, fixtures, retrofit fixtures and battery powered fixtures may operate in a coordinated fashion, where one or more light sources are operating with battery only, battery and AC or AC only power sources along with any control source within the group. In some embodiments, the source of the control for one or more lights in the group may be one of the lights in the group in response to a control input that light received. In addition to coordinating operation, the network may be used for communication purposes such that an extensible lighting network can be installed by installing bulbs, tubes, lamps and battery power fixtures in existing locations that do not require an electrician for new wiring or special hardware other than what is contained with the wirelessly networked LED light itself.","Another embodiment of the invention is directed to a centralized power outage system bridged to a networked lighting system. The centralized power outage control may come in the form of a module that detects a disruption in the AC power source and transmits to a system of bulbs, tubes, lamps, fixtures, retrofit fixtures, battery powered fixtures, and the like, to turn on, switch to backup power or change their mode of operation in some manner in response to the detected disruption in power. The power outage module may be connected to an emergency lighting circuit to transmit control to a networked lighting system when the emergency lighting circuit attempts to turn on emergency lighting. Due to its integrated power source, a wirelessly controlled and\/or wirelessly powered LED light may continue to operate in an emergency situation as controlled by a power outage control module.","Another embodiment of the invention is directed to a sensor-based wirelessly controlled LED light. The sensor-based wirelessly controlled LED light may be designed in a housing type of a bulb, tube, lamp, fixture, retrofit fixture, and the like. In the embodiment, the sensor-based wirelessly controlled LED light is AC powered and contains input devices and the ability to autonomously respond to the input devices. For example, a daylight harvesting LED light bulb may adjust the light intensity based on the ambient light level detected by a light sensor built into the bulb. In an alternate version, the light sensor is built into a remote transmitter that may transmit the ambient light reading directly to one or more sensor-based wirelessly controlled LED lights that can then adjust the light intensity of the LED light source based on a configured net light that needs to be detected at the light sensor. The sensor-based wirelessly controlled LED light may have the ability to learn from the input devices. For example, a sensor-based wirelessly controlled LED light with a motion sensor and real time clock built into the device may learn that motion detections will be high at a certain time of the day. An internal program may schedule the light to turn on automatically at that time of day rather than use the motion sensor. The internal program may dynamically change the schedule to move the time the light turns on automatically to earlier or later times based on the motion detection input.","One advantage of the present invention is the ability to build intelligent lighting systems where wireless control and wireless power along with the ability to take advantage of the additional functionality is built into the light itself. One advantage of the present invention is the ability to provide battery back-up power within an LED bulb or tube that can fit into conventional AC powered sockets. In some embodiments, these lights are able to provide light in the event of power outage, and in other embodiments these lights may be used to reduce demand on the power grid by switching to battery power at peak times, then recharging off peak. One advantage of the present invention is the ability to create programmable light bulbs, tubes or lamps with integrated sensors. These intelligent lights may contain integrated controls that turn on, off, or change light intensity based on a programmable schedule, the detection of sensor inputs, or a change in lighting conditions. One advantage of the present invention is the ability to communicate controls to and between these LED lighting facilities. In some embodiments, intelligent lights may contain wireless transmitters and receivers allowing them to coordinate functions within groups of light bulbs or allowing them to receive control and programming over a network as well as forward or route traffic to other light bulbs that are part of the network. Thus, for example, a removable light bulb may also act as a node in a network of light bulbs providing the ability to deploy a lighting installation and a network to control the lighting installation by plugging light bulbs into sockets.","It should be appreciated that combinations of the foregoing concepts and additional concepts discussed in greater detail below are contemplated as being part of the inventive subject matter disclosed herein.

By way of example, an infrared sensor or motion sensor can monitor occupancy in an environment and, upon detecting presence within the monitored environment, the sensor can transmit a wireless input to the input component . It is to be appreciated that any type of sensors can be utilized in connection with the claimed subject matter such as, but not limited to, infrared sensors, light sensors, proximity sensors, acoustic sensors, motion sensors, carbon monoxide and\/or smoke detectors, thermal sensors, electromagnetic sensors, mechanical sensors, chemical sensors, and the like.","According to another example, any type of remote control can wirelessly communicate with the input component . For instance, the remote control can be a stand-alone remote control (e.g., the remote control  of ) and\/or incorporated into a disparate device (e.g., incorporated into a key fob, a programmable wireless transceiver integrated in an automobile). Moreover, the remote control can be a personal computer, a cellular phone, a smart phone, a laptop, a handheld communication device, a handheld computing device, a global positioning system, a personal digital assistant (PDA), and\/or any other suitable device; such devices can communicate directly with the input component  and\/or via a network (e.g., local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), cellular network). By communicating via a network, the wireless light bulb  can be controlled from a remote location (e.g., an individual can control the wireless light bulb  in her home by utilizing a device in her office). Moreover, the aforementioned devices can be utilized to wirelessly program the wireless light bulb . For instance, operation of a plurality of wireless light bulbs can be programmed from a personal computer (e.g., an RF transmitter can be coupled to a USB port of the computer to communicate with the input component , the wireless light bulbs can be programmed to switch on and off at certain times of day).","In accord with another example, radio frequency identification (RFID) can be utilized to provide the input to the input component . As such, an RFID tag associated with a user can be detected when in range of the input component , and lighting preferences of the particular user (e.g., retained in memory) can be effectuated in response to his or her detected presence. By way of illustration, when an individual walks into a room in her house with an RFID tag, presence of the RFID tag can be observed by the input component(s)  and the wireless light bulb(s) in the room can switch on, intensity, color, and\/or direction of the light(s) can be altered, and so forth; however, the claimed subject matter is not so limited. It is also appreciated that the RFID tag can be read by a RFID reader, the identification of the individual can processed by a software program running on a computer or server and subsequently the computer or server can switch on, intensity, color, and\/or direction of the light(s) can be altered, and so forth based on a stored profile for that individual.","Additionally or alternatively, the input component  can be a sensor that can monitor a condition associated with the wireless light bulb  to generate the input as described in connection with .

By way of another example, the input component  can wirelessly communicate with an input component of a disparate wireless light bulb to enable coordinated operation between more than one wireless light bulb. Following this example, an input can be retransmitted within a network of wireless light bulbs, where the network of light bulbs can be dispersed within a geographic area.","The power source  can be any number and\/or type of batteries. For instance, the battery can be a rechargeable battery. According to another example, the battery can be a non-rechargeable battery. The battery supplies power to the wireless light bulb  to enable installing, moving, replacing, etc. the wireless light bulb  in a fixture at substantially any indoor or outdoor location while mitigating the need for expensive and time consuming wiring and\/or utilization of aesthetically unpleasing and potentially inconvenient cords commonly associated with conventional lighting. Pursuant to a further example, the wireless light bulb  can obtain AC power from the fixture, and the AC power can supplement the power provided by the power source  and\/or be employed instead of power from the power source .","According to an example, the light source  can be one or more LEDs. It is contemplated that any number, type, color, arrangement, etc. of LEDs can be utilized with the wireless light bulb . Further, the control component  can provide instructions to manage operation of the LED(s). For instance, the control component  can yield instructions to switch one or more LEDs on and\/or off, change an intensity of illumination (e.g., brightness), switch a wavelength of light emitted from the LEDs (e.g., to change light color), manipulate direction of illumination (e.g., by moving, rotating, etc. one or more of the LEDs) and the like. However, the claimed subject matter is not limited to the light source  including LED(s); rather, it is contemplated that any disparate type of light source  can be employed.","The control component  employs the input obtained by the input component . The control component  can further include a state modification component , a timer component , an intensity regulation component , and\/or a wavelength control component ; however, it is to be appreciated that the control component  can include a subset of these components -. The state modification component  utilizes the input obtained via the input component  to generate an instruction to change a state of the light source . The state modification component  effectuates transitioning the light source  to an on state, an off state, etc. Further, the state modification component  can yield commands to strobe the light source  (e.g., periodically turning the light source  on and off with substantially any periodicity). According to an example, the state modification component  can decipher that a received input pertains to the light source  and\/or a portion thereof (e.g., a subset of LED(s) in an LED array). Moreover, the state modification component  can analyze the input to determine whether to yield instructions to modify operation of the light source  (e.g., compare an input from a sensor to a threshold, evaluate whether a condition has been met, based upon retrieved instructions corresponding to the input retained in memory).","The timer component  can operate in conjunction with the state modification component . For instance, the timer component  can enable delaying state changes. Thus, turning the light source  on or off can be delayed for an amount of time by the timer component . Further, the amount of time for the delay can be predetermined, randomly selected, included with the input obtained by the input component  (e.g., based on a number of times a button of a remote control is depressed), etc. Moreover, the timer component  can enable turning the light source  on and off at certain times (e.g., to create an appearance of someone being in a house when the owner is out of town); for instance, the timer component  can enable the state modification component  to switch the state at preprogrammed times, at times determined according to a random pattern (e.g., randomly switch the light source  on at different times during the day for differing lengths of time), and so forth. Additionally, the timer component  can include a clock that provides an understanding of time of day, day, month, year, etc. for the wireless light bulb ; by way of illustration, the wireless light bulb  can be synchronized with an individual's calendar to enable randomly turning the light source  on and off when the individual is known to be away from home (e.g., a vacation, meeting, and the like can be scheduled on the calendar), switching the light source  on when the individual is due to return home or guests are scheduled to arrive, and so forth. According to another example, the timer component  can conserve battery life by enabling the state modification component  to switch the light source  to an off state at a particular time of day, after an elapsed amount of time subsequent to an input that turned the light source  to the on state, and so forth. Pursuant to another illustration, the timer component  can operate in conjunction with the intensity regulation component  and\/or the wavelength control component  described below.","The intensity regulation component  can alter the intensity (e.g., brightness) of the light source  based upon the received input from the input component . The intensity can be changed by the intensity regulation component  adjusting a proportion of LEDs in an on state to LEDs in an off state when the light source  includes an LED array. Additionally or alternatively, the intensity regulation component  can control the intensity of light emitted by each of the LEDs in such an array. Pulse width modulation can be used to adjust the intensity of light of any or all LEDs to the desired intensity. In addition, the intensity regulation component in conjunction with the timer component, functions such as fade to off or fade to a low level of light until an input component detect a condition to transition to a full on state can also be implemented. According to an example, the input component  can obtain RFID related input that identifies the presence of a particular user, and this user can have lighting preferences stored in memory (not shown) associated with the wireless light bulb . Following this example, the particular user's preferences may indicate that she desires dim lighting, which can be effectuated by the intensity regulation component . Pursuant to another example, upon a smoke detector or carbon monoxide detector sensing smoke or carbon monoxide, respectively, the intensity regulation component  can increase the brightness of the illumination of the light source  to a highest level (e.g., while the state modification component  can strobe the light source , the wavelength control component  can change the color). It is to be appreciated, however, that the claimed subject matter is not limited to the aforementioned examples.","The wavelength control component  can change the wavelength (e.g., color) of light generated by the light source  as a function of the input obtained by the input component . For example, the light source  can include color changing LEDs, and the wavelength control component  can yield commands to adjust the color based upon the input obtained by the input component . By way of another example, subsets of LEDs included in the light source  can yield differing colors, and the wavelength control component  can select which of the LED subsets to turn to the on state to yield the desired color.","By way of further illustration, the control component  can include memory (not shown) that can retain instructions, commands, settings, preferences, calendar data, etc. associated with the wireless light bulb ; additionally or alternatively, the memory can be separate from the control component  (e.g., the wireless light bulb  can include the memory and\/or the memory can be separate from the wireless light bulb ). Pursuant to an example, a user can create a lighting profile that regulates operation of the wireless light bulb ; the lighting profile can be stored in memory and thereafter retrieved (e.g., upon receipt of input via the input component ) for use by the control component  (and\/or the state modification component , the timer component , the intensity regulation component , the wavelength control component ). The memory can be, for example, either volatile memory or nonvolatile memory, or can include both volatile and nonvolatile memory. By way of illustration, and not limitation, nonvolatile memory can include read only memory (ROM), programmable ROM (PROM), electrically programmable ROM (EPROM), electrically erasable programmable ROM (EEPROM), or flash memory.

For instance, the wireless light bulb  can be utilized with a fixture (e.g., the fixture ) that lacks a connection to a power source (e.g., electrically wired to an AC power source); hence power for operation of the wireless light bulb  can be provided by the power source . To replenish the charge of the power source , the wireless light bulb  can be removed from the fixture  and can be coupled to a charger (not shown), for example. When connected to the charger, the recharge component  can increase the charge of the power source . Following another example, the recharge component  can increase the charge of the power source  when the wireless light bulb  is coupled to a fixture (e.g., the fixture ) that is electrically connected to an AC power source. Therefore, upon charge depletion of the power source  of the wireless light bulb  when connected to a fixture that lacks a connection to an AC power source, the wireless light bulb  can be moved to a fixture that is hard-wired to an AC power source to enable recharging. Additionally, where the fixture  is a lamp, the lamp can be unplugged (e.g., when it is desired to utilize the lamp positioned at a distance from an outlet longer than a length of a cord of the lamp) and the wireless light bulb  can operate by leveraging the power source , and thereafter, the lamp can be plugged into an outlet to allow the recharge component  to increase the charge of the power source . According to another illustration, the recharge component  can be a solar cell (or a plurality of solar cells) that can increase the charge of the power source .","Turning to , illustrated is a system  that coordinates operation of a set of wireless light bulbs.

Thus, at least a subset of the wireless light bulbs - can concurrently switch from an on state to an off state, or vice versa, when the respective transceivers ,  obtain such an input signal from the common remote control and\/or sensor(s). It is to be appreciated that the coordinated lighting group  can be programmed in substantially any manner to manage operations of the wireless light bulbs - as a group.","The grouping components ,  can enable the coordinated lighting group  to be assembled. For instance, the grouping components ,  can allow each of the wireless light bulbs - to be assigned to operate upon a particular RF frequency (e.g., channel). Thus, the grouping components ,  can select the channel corresponding to the coordinated lighting group  for each respective wireless light bulb -. For example, the channel can be user selected, preprogrammed, randomly generated, previously stored in memory, etc. According to another illustration, the grouping components ,  can learn the channel related to the coordinated lighting group . Following this illustration, when initializing the wireless light bulb  , the transceiver  can obtain a setup signal from a remote control, sensor, etc. associated with the coordinated lighting group , and the grouping component  can utilize the setup signal to learn the channel associated with the remote control, sensor, etc. However, it is contemplated that the claimed subject matter is not limited to the aforementioned examples.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0236","num":"0235"},"figref":"FIGS. 15-16"},"With reference to , illustrated is a methodology  that facilitates selectively emitting light in accordance with a wireless input.

In alternate embodiments, any type of wireless light bulb mentioned herein can be designed in any size or shape housing to meet the requirements of any standard size bulb (PAR30, PAR38, A19, R30, MR16 etc), non-standard size bulb, fixture, fluorescent bulbs or lamps (T4, T5, T8, circular, and so on) or down light assembly (recessed fixtures, fluorescent fixtures or down light fixtures for residential or industrial lighting), or the like. It is also to be appreciated that the light socket adapter  can be designed to interface electrically and mechanically with any standard size or non-standard size bulb socket including screw thread bases, bayonet bases, pin bases and any other kind of special lamp base that can be used. In the illustrated embodiment, the motion wireless light bulb  illuminates an area of approximately twenty square feet when above the ground ten feet pointing directly down. Alternate embodiments may include but are not limited to any known light source including LEDs, compact fluorescent, fluorescent, induction, halogen, gas discharge, organic LEDs (OLED), plasma, radio generated plasma and incandescent bulbs and can illuminate any size area.","In the illustrated embodiment, the housing  is constructed of plastic. Alternatively, the housing  can be constructed of metal or any other known material. In one embodiment the housing can be waterproof, shatterproof, UV resistant and\/or corrosion resistant for use outdoors or difficult environments. The material of the housing can serve as a heat sink and can be constructed of a material to dissipate or conduct heat away from the LEDs to improve the performance and extend the life of the LEDs.","In the illustrated embodiment the housing  includes a reflector for each LED to reflect the light from the LEDs to provide a distinct area of coverage. In other embodiments, an optical lens or lenses or reflectors can direct the light, reflect the light or change the viewing angle of the LEDs. The housing of the bulb may include any number of optical elements. The optical elements may serve to focus, diffuse, filter, collimate, or otherwise affect light produced by the LEDs . In embodiments, the optical elements may include one or more lenses, reflectors, optical filters, aperture, and so on. The lenses may be fixed, a multiple lens array, adjustable, and so on. The lenses or reflectors may be manually adjustable, motorized with direct control with switches on the unit for adjusting the direction or characteristics of the light source, motorized with a remote control for adjusting the direction or characteristics of the light source through RF or IR control or it may detect motion and automatically adjust the lenses or reflectors to aim the light in the direction of the motion. An example use of the embodiment where the lenses or reflectors are automatically adjusted based on the direction in which motion is detected is several light bulbs can adjust to direct light in the direction of the motion adding illumination to the object in motion thereby allowing the individual light bulbs to be smaller and require less power but still resulting in a necessary amount of light on the object in motion. In some embodiments, there may be an array of optical elements that are pointed in fixed directions such that the light may be redirected by turning on LEDs pointing in a desired direction with a desired light output and turning off LEDs that may not point in the desired direction or provide the desired light output. Thus, the directionality of the light is achieved based on which LEDs are on and which LEDs are off in the embodiment.","With continued reference to illustrated embodiment shown in  one input component is a motion sensor. When the motion sensor  detects motion, logic  determines if the motion is above a predetermined threshold. If the motion is above the predetermined threshold, the logic  instructs an LED controller to turn on at least one LED. The motion sensor will only be operational if a second input component, a light sensor, detects that detected light is at a low enough level to allow the motion sensor  to control the LEDs to turn on (i.e. the bulb will only work in the dark or whatever low light level is set by the light sensor and its detection circuitry). In an alternate embodiment the light sensor is not present and the bulb works only based on the state of the motion sensor .","In the illustrated embodiment, after the LEDs are turned on, the logic  starts a timer. The logic will then instruct the LED controller to turn off the LEDs if no motion is detected before the timer reaches a predetermined timer threshold. If motion is detected before the timer reaches the timer threshold, the LEDs will remain on and the timer will reset to the timer starting point. The illustrated embodiment includes this auto shutoff feature to provide efficient energy usage by shutting off or limiting power consumption by the light source when motion is not detected. This feature is factory set via a timer that expires such that after turn on, if there is no reactivation of the control to turn the LEDs on, the unit will automatically turn the LEDs off when the timer expires. In alternate embodiments, there may be more than one auto shutoff timer, there may be an adjustable auto shutoff timer with a method to select the desired auto shutoff time, and the like. This feature may be set by toggling or setting a switch or switches, may be dial selectable, may be set by a potentiometer, may be programmable directly or by remote, and so on.","In the illustrated embodiment, the timer consists of an RC electrical circuit that discharges to the factory set voltage threshold over some period of time at which time, if not retriggered, will automatically shut off the LEDs. Other embodiments may have a timer built in any known timer circuit and allow features based on the timer value that automatically shut off the LEDs, automatically turn on the LEDs or automatically change the light intensity level. This feature may be set by toggling or setting a switch, may be dial selectable, may be set by a potentiometer, may be programmable directly or by remote, may include a fade-to-off effect, fade-to-dim effect, fade-to-glow effect, fade from one light intensity level to another light intensity level and so on. In some embodiments, the feature may include an increase in light intensity over time which may include an off-to-glow effect, glow-to-dim, glow-to-some light intensity level, an increase from one light intensity level to a higher light intensity level and so on. It is to be appreciated that the change from one light intensity level to another light intensity level may happen over any period of time that may be implemented with the timers. A second feature may have two or more auto shutoff levels set by multiple timers. For example the auto shutoff feature may control the light from bright to dim when the first timer expires and from dim to off when the second timer expires and so on. It is to be appreciated that any form of control by a wireless light bulb or wireless lighting module may trigger the feature of changing the lighting intensity level from one level to another including wireless control, direct control or intelligent programming to change the state.","Other embodiments can include a circuit that allows the unit to glow at a level such that the unit can be a marker in a dark environment and when motion is detected it turns on to a bright level for illumination to a level that a user can find their way. An alternate embodiment would include a circuit that allows the bulb to be on at a low light level to illuminate an area with enough light to see the area from a distance and when motion is detected the LEDs turns on to a bright level for illumination to a level that a user can accomplish any task desired. In another embodiment, the low light level blinks at some rate to provide a marker until a sensor triggers transitioning to a bright level. In some embodiments, the control of the brightness level at glow, low, bright or any brightness level the user may desire is controlled by a dial, buttons, switches, RF\/IR remote or any other known control to allow the user to set the different light levels to the individual user preference.","In another embodiment, the light can be programmed to fade over time such that the light is activated and slowly fades until it reaches either a glow level or a low light level. An example of this application is a wireless light bulb plugged into a light socket or lamp in the bedroom of a child that is on when they go to bed at night, but fades over time to a glow level or a low light level as they fall asleep. The design can include any controls, methods and circuits by which to achieve multiple light levels. In addition the design may include methods and circuits to achieve constant current control to achieve consistent brightness at the different light levels.","In the illustrated embodiment, the motion wireless light bulb  includes a passive infrared sensor configured to detect motion. In one embodiment, the passive infrared sensor has a range of approximately 10 feet and a viewing angle of 45 degrees. In alternative embodiments, the passive infrared sensor may have a range and viewing angle of any known passive infrared sensor. In one alternative embodiment, the passive infrared sensor is removably connected to the unit so that a user may connect any appropriate sensor. In some embodiments, the passive infrared sensor may be replaced or enhanced by a radar sensor, an ultrasound sensor, or any and all other form of motion sensor.","In other embodiments, any and all sensors may include a detection threshold or false detection rate that can be configured according to a user's preference. For example and without limitation, a light sensor may be configured to detect when incoming light crosses a user-preferred intensity threshold. The light sensor may contain many thresholds that can be detected. In such an example, the light source may be controlled in a different way upon each crossing of a threshold. For example, between any two thresholds detectable by the light sensor, the light source may be set to a particular brightness level. In such a case, as the ambient light increases or decreases (during dawn or dusk for example), the light source may slowly decrease or increase its brightness level based on preset levels. It is to be appreciated that hysteresis may be built in at the crossing of a threshold. It is also to be appreciated that there may be no thresholds and the light intensity is set based on the ambient light level detected such that the ambient light plus the light generated by the light source maintain a constant light level as set in the design or as set by the user. Control of this function may be done in the electrical circuit, done by a microcontroller, may include programmable thresholds, etc. A variety of other such examples will be appreciated, all of which are within the scope of the present disclosure.","In the illustrated embodiment, a Fresnel lens enables motion detections. The motion detector includes a Fresnel lens that guides infrared light over the PIR sensor in a substantially repeating pattern as a heat source (such as a person, vehicle, and so on) passes in front of the lens. The combination of the passive infrared sensor and Fresnel lens has a range of 15 feet and a viewing angle of 90 degrees. In embodiments, the Fresnel lens may be selected to provide a desired zone of coverage. It will be understood that a variety of embodiments of motion detectors including or excluding the Fresnel lens are possible.","With continued reference to , when the motion sensor  detects motion, logic  determines if the motion is above a predetermined threshold. If the motion is above the predetermined threshold, the logic  instructs an LED controller to turn on at least one LED . After the at least one LED  is turned on, the logic  starts a timer. The logic  will then instruct the LED controller to turn off the at least one LED  if no motion is detected before the timer reaches a predetermined threshold. In an alternate embodiment, the logic will control at least one LED  to revert to a glow or low light level when the timer reaches a predetermined threshold to conserve energy but also provide a low level of light until motion is detect to turn on to the bright light level. In an alternate embodiment, the logic  can maintain the bright light level for some period of time, but then can control the light to fade to off, to a glow or to a low light level by slowly dimming the at least one LED through pulse width modulation or any other known method over some preset or programmable period of time until it reaches off, the glow or the low light level.","A wireless light bulb can be controlled by any type of input signal that can be leveraged by the logic to manipulate operation of the LEDs. Thus, the input component can be a radio frequency (RF) or infrared (IR) receiver that can obtain an RF or IR signal communicated from an RF or IR transmitter that can be utilized by the logic to control operation of the LEDs. The RF or IR transmitter can come in the form of remote control, key fob, wall switch or any other controller that can house the RF or IR circuitry and user control mechanism. According to this example, the RF or IR transmission can be deciphered by the input component to effectuate switching the LEDs to an on or off state, changing a light color or a light intensity provided by the LEDs, and the like. By way of an example, dimming commands can control the wireless light bulb to specific levels in response to commands received from the RF or IR transmitter in a remote control or wall switch. Controls (mode buttons, control wheel, etc) on a remote control or wall switch can increase or decrease the light level, set the level to glow, low, high light level or the like directly. By way of an example, a PAR30 type AC powered wireless light bulb can be controlled by RF or by the wall switch with the light source AC powered. This type of wireless light bulb can be installed in a porch light fixture. The porch light can be controlled by a wall switch inside of a house, but also be controlled by a RF remote control. This is useful because it allows the porch light to be turned on from a car as the car enters a driveway. This may eliminate the need to keep the porch light on all of the time that the user is away from the house, but still allowing them to use the porch light to illuminate the area when needed.","In an alternate embodiment, a network of wireless light bulbs can be created by embedding an RF transceiver with intelligence (microcontroller, microprocessor, integrated circuit etc.) in the wireless light bulbs and using a communication protocol between the bulbs to control any size group of bulbs to accomplish any task described herein. Other control sources designed to communicate through the network such as wall switches, key fobs, remote controls, RF adapters that can plug into a computer and be controlled by a software program, etc. can also connect to the network and control wireless light bulbs in the network. By way of an example, the wireless light bulbs are a combination of RF transceiver and motion sensor. If one bulb detects motion, it sends out a message to all bulbs via its RF transmitter to turn all of the bulbs on to a specific brightness level. Bulbs can also receive a message via its RF receiver and retransmit it via its RF transmitter to extend the range of lights beyond what is within the range of the initial unit that detected motion. In an alternate example, the control source may be one or more remote controls with a push button that is pressed to turn the lights on and a push button, that is pressed to turn the lights off with a unique identifier that can be set that can select the wireless light bulbs to control, and the like. When either button is pressed, a command is transmitted by a remote control to the network to control the bulbs that receive it. The command may also be propagated through the network of bulbs via the RF transceiver in each bulb to control a portion of or the entire network of wireless light bulbs. It is to be appreciated that the bulbs can use any type of networking protocol (routing, flooding etc.) that may effectively distribute state information through the network of bulbs. When the auto shutoff timer of the originating wireless light bulb times out, it can send an off command which is also propagated through the network of light bulbs to shut them all off. The triggering method can be any method sensor described herein and the sending of signals from one wireless light bulb to another can be RF\/IF, wired or wireless network (WIFI, ZIGBEE, X10 etc.) or wired with any electrical control mechanism between wireless light bulbs that can be defined.","Additionally or alternatively, the input component can be one or more sensors that monitor a condition, and monitored information yielded by such sensor(s) can be utilized to effectuate adjustments associated with the LEDs. It is to be appreciated that any type of sensor(s) can be utilized in connection with the claimed subject matter instead of or in conjunction with a motion sensor. For example, the sensor(s) can be one or more of infrared sensors, light sensors, proximity sensors, magnetic switch sensor, acoustic sensors, voice activated sensor, motion sensors, radar sensors, sonar sensors, carbon monoxide and\/or smoke detectors, thermal sensors, electromagnetic sensors, mechanical sensors, chemical sensors, pressure sensor, RFID tag reader or detection circuit and the like. According to another example, the input component can be a connector, port, etc. that couples to a disparate device, sensor, etc. to receive the input signal. It is also appreciated that any combination of sensors can be utilized in connection with the claimed subject matter. The characteristics of the light output (off, glow, on at low level, on at bright level, color etc) and the transition between those characteristics can be controlled by any detectable state of the sensor or sensors. It is also to be appreciated that intelligence in the form of logic, electrical circuitry, microcontrollers, microprocessors, memory devices etc. contained in the bulb can leverage the sensors to monitor patterns of RF, IR or sensor inputs, keep the patterns in memory over time if necessary and adjust individual light characteristics based on the patterns detected. Thus the wireless light bulb has the ability to learn from inputs from its environment and change behavior accordingly.","The illustrated embodiment is a combination of a light sensor that will minimize power consumption by only allowing the LEDs to turn on when there is a low level of light in the environment and a motion sensor. When there is enough light in the environment, the motion sensor will control the LEDs to turn on when motion is detected. An alternate embodiment includes an RF receiver and motion sensor in the wireless light bulb and separate RF transmitter remote control that can override motion sensor control of the bulb when a user desires that it is turned on for an extended period of time or controlled remotely rather than by motion. One or more wireless light bulbs are controlled by either the motion sensors on the bulbs, by a separate RF remote control, RF wall switch or the like. The RF control element is used to turn on, turn off, control dimming, program timers for automatic control etc. in the wireless light bulbs. In an alternate embodiment, the remote control element contains a motion sensor and an RF transmitter to transmit commands based on motion detection or switches, buttons, dials or other controls on the remote control element to the one or more wireless light bulbs. The wireless light bulbs have an RF receiver but may or may not have a motion sensor.","In an alternate embodiment, the wireless light bulb can be controlled by only a light sensor. In this embodiment, the light will only turn on in a low level of light. Thus, when AC power is applied to the bulb and the level of ambient light is low enough, the bulb will turn on, otherwise it will remain off Alternately, the light source can be controlled based on the amount of light detected from the light sensor such that it turns on slowly in the evening as it gets darker outside and fades to off in the morning as the amount of ambient light increases slowly. For example, a pulse width modulation circuit or other brightness control can be set based on the state of the light sensor. In some embodiments a daylight harvesting function may be implemented where the light intensity is set based on the ambient light level detected such that the ambient light plus the light generated by the light source maintain a constant light level as set in the design or as set by the user. The light sensor light bulb can be used outside such that power on the wired circuit can be turned on all of the time, but the light sensor light bulb will not consume power from the wired circuit other than to power the light sensor associated circuit until the light sensor enables the bulb for operation.","Another alternative embodiment includes one or more wireless light bulbs with an RF receiver and a light sensor as input components controlling the light source and an RF transmitter remote combined with a motion sensor. The one or more wireless light bulbs may or may not glow all through the night. An example use of this embodiment is a driveway sensor that detects a car triggering the motion sensor to send an RF transmission to the light when the car enters the driveway. The light can stay on for some user set amount of time, for example ten minutes, then auto shutoff or revert to glow mode. In alternate embodiments, the RF transmitter and motion sensor may contain additional controls. For example, the RF transmitter and motion sensor may contain an on switch, off switch, toggle switch, dimmer control switches, motion sensitivity controls, a light sensor with and without sensitivity controls, shutoff timer controls, and the like, or any other type of control mentioned herein. By way of an example, an RF transmitter and motion sensor may contain an OFF push button. The unit may send an ON control message to a wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture when motion is detected to turn the light on. It may contain an auto-shutoff timer that may send an OFF control message when the auto-shutoff timer expires. In addition, if the user is leaving an area, rather than wait for the auto-shutoff timer to expire, an OFF push button on the unit may be pressed to send an OFF control message to the wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture to shut the light off. In some examples, the motion sensor may be briefly disabled for some period of time to allow the user to leave the area such that their motion when exiting does not retrigger the light immediately. For example, if the motion sensor is disabled for five seconds after the OFF push button is pressed, the user may be able to exit the area without retriggering the light. This function may allow the user to save power consumption in the wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture by providing the means to turn the light off manually when they know it will not be used. In some embodiments, the RF transmitter and motion sensor may mount to a bracket that can be mounted to a wall, ceiling, stake or the like such that the bracket may can be articulated to allow the motion sensor to be pointed in the direction that the motion needs to be detected. This may allow the ability to optimize the area of detection given the characteristics of the motion detector and the desired area where motion is to be detected. In alternate embodiments, multiple motion detectors may be built into the same housing to allow motion to be detected from more than one direction. For example, a motion detector with three sensors each with 120 degree coverage may cover 360 degrees of motion detection allowing a stake or pole mount sensor to detect motion from any direction. This stake may be mounted in an open area to detect motion from any direction and turn on the light source to illuminate an area.","As shown in the illustrated embodiment, the wireless light bulb power source is alternating current (AC) typical of hard-wired fixtures that can provide AC power to light bulbs. The wireless light bulb includes AC circuitry, including an AC\/DC converter to generate DC power for the circuitry and light source contained in the wireless light bulb. The AC\/DC converter may include line capacitors, a diode bridge, a fly back converter, a constant current circuit, DC regulator and so on to convert AC power from the line to DC power. It will be understood that a variety of AD\/DC converters are possible. In one known embodiment, a diode bridge, a constant current buck converter, a linear voltage regulator and protection circuitry are used to provide power to the control circuitry and light source.","In some embodiments the wireless light bulb may be powered directly from a DC input. In other embodiments the wireless light bulb can be powered off of a nominal 12V AC source. For example, an MR16 type wireless light bulb can be designed to take the 12V AC provided at the pin base and convert it to DC. In another example, the MR16 type wireless light bulb can include a full wave rectifier circuit to accept 12V AC or 12V DC input to power the circuitry and light source. It is appreciated that any AC or DC input can be converted to an operating power source for the circuitry and light source.","Wireless light bulbs powered from AC power with wireless control in the form of an embedded sensor or RF or IR receiver allow for individual wireless light bulbs on the same wired circuit to be controlled independently. In one example, individual wireless light bulbs with an embedded RF receiver and intelligence to process commands received over an RF communication link are on the same wired circuit and can be controlled by an RF wall switch. An RF transmitter circuit embedded in the wall switch can control individual bulbs on the wired circuit to turn them on or off, send dimming commands, program functionality to change state based on time of day, program on times, off times and brightness levels based on billing rates from the power company at different times of the day etc. The RF transmitter circuit may be combined with one or more other wireless control methods to implement additional functionality. For example, a motion sensor could be used in addition to the RF transmitter to control the light based on motion detection. The RF transmitter circuit can be battery powered and therefore offer the convenience of allowing it to be installed anywhere or the RF transmitter circuit can be part of an assembly that can replace or modify the wall light switch controlling the entire wired circuit to provide greater control of the lights on that wired circuit. In the case where the wall light switch is replaced by an RF transmitter wall light switch assembly, the RF transmitter circuitry may be battery powered, but it also may use AC as its power source and thus contain and AC\/DC circuit. In one example, the RF transmitter wall light switch assembly may use the existing on\/off switch of the wall light switch (i.e. be installed inside the wall light switch) or in another example the assembly may be installed to replace the wall light switch altogether. In another example, motion sensor controlled wireless light bulbs on a wired circuit can be installed to conserve power by detecting occupancy and only turn on when the light is needed. All of the bulbs can be motion sensor wireless light bulbs or there can be a mix of motion sensor wireless light bulbs and traditional light bulbs to conserve power when the additional light is not needed. It is to be appreciated that any sensor described herein can be used to individually control wireless light bulbs on a wired circuit.","In another embodiment, the power source can be one or more batteries embedded in the wireless light bulb instead of AC power. For instance, the power source can be any number, size, and type of rechargeable (e.g., nickel-cadmium) and\/or non-rechargeable (e.g., alkaline) batteries. Pursuant to a further illustration, the power source can be a solar cell. Moreover, the power source can be a combination of a solar cell and one or more batteries. Thus, for instance, a battery can supplement power supplied by the solar cell (or vice versa) and\/or the solar cell can recharge a battery. In accordance with a further illustration, the power source can wirelessly obtain power (e.g., to be utilized directly, employed to recharge batteries); for instance, power can be wirelessly delivered to the power source via collecting RF energy from the environment, electromagnetic induction, wave coupling, converting motion or heat to electrical energy, wireless power transmission, and the like. It is to be appreciated that any wireless power source or any combination of wireless power sources can be used to supply power to or recharge energy storage in the wireless light bulb. For example, a wireless light bulb can contain circuitry to collect RF energy from the environment and also contain rechargeable batteries to store the collected energy. In alternate embodiments the power source may include a fuel cell, such as and without limitation a hydrogen fuel cell, a reformed methanol fuel cell, or the like. In other alternate embodiments, the power source may include a capacitor, array of capacitors, super capacitors to store energy to be used as a power source similar to a battery, and the like.","By way of an example, the wireless light bulb can physically couple with a fixture to support the wireless light bulb in a particular position, yet electrical current need not flow between the fixture and the wireless light bulb. Thus, the fixture can be installed at substantially any location without needing to supply power (e.g., via hard-wiring the fixture); hence, the fixture can be physically placed, secured, mounted, installed, etc. in a locale without being hard-wired to a power source. A battery powered wireless light bulb allows for a fixture to be installed anywhere. Any type of fixture design (size, shape, style etc.) can be installed at any location suitable for installation of the fixture and using a battery embedded wireless light bulb it can be done without the need for wiring. Power is embedded in the bulb and control is provided by a sensor and\/or RF\/IR receiver that is also embedded in the bulb As another example, the battery embedded wireless light bulb allows for a lamp (table lamp, floor lamp, desk lamp etc.) to be placed anywhere independent of a need to be placed close to an electrical outlet, using an extension cord to cable power to the lamp or having an electrician wire power to a point where the lamp can be plugged into an AC power source. Alternately, a battery powered wireless light bulb can be used in an existing fixture or lamp to take advantage of wireless power and wireless control in that location. In an alternate embodiment, to use the switch control on the lamp that would control on and off when plugged into an AC socket, the lamp remains unplugged, however an electrically conducting cap or connector is placed on the end between the two AC prongs of the connector to short the two prongs together. Inside the wireless light bulb, a short circuit can be detected. When detected as a short circuit, the switch control is in the on position and the battery powered wireless light bulb is turned on. When it is detected as an open circuit, the switch is in the off position and the battery powered wireless light bulb is turned off.","In another example, a motion sensor wireless light bulb powered only by embedded batteries can replace one or more incandescent light bulbs on a wired circuit. By way of an example, there are six recessed fixtures containing six R30 incandescent bulbs controlled by a single wall switch. One of the incandescent bulbs is replaced by an R30 motion sensor wireless light bulb powered only by embedded batteries or one of the incandescent bulbs is replaced by a recessed fixture motion sensor wireless light bulb that mechanically replaces the entire recessed fixture and is powered only by embedded batteries. There are several advantages to this use scenario for the battery embedded wireless light bulb. First, the motion sensor wireless light bulb will work even in a power outage so it offers an emergency or safety lighting function. Second, even when the wall switch is turned off and the incandescent bulbs are off, the motion sensor wireless light bulb will still provide enough light when motion is detected to find a path to the wall switch to activate all of the lights. Third, there may be enough light from the motion sensor wireless light bulb such that the additional lighting is not necessary therefore the incandescent bulbs would not be used. This provides some savings in power consumption as well as a dim light level which may be preferable sometimes to the bright light offered by too much lighting in an area. In an alternate embodiment, the motion sensor wireless light bulb can have multiple light levels. For example, it can have a bright light level but revert to a glow or low light level when the timer reaches a predetermined threshold to conserve energy but also provide a low level of light until motion is detect to turn on to the bright light level. In an alternate embodiment, logic can maintain the bright light level for some period of time, but then can control the light to fade to a glow or low light level by slowly dimming the at least one LED through pulse width modulation or other brightness control method over some preset or programmable period of time until it reaches the glow or low light level. In an alternate embodiment, a light sensor may provide a measurement of the ambient light level to set the light intensity level for a daylight harvesting function where the light intensity is set based on the ambient light level detected such that the ambient light plus the light generated by the light source maintain a constant light level.","By way of another example, the one replacement wireless light bulb contains an RF receiver and can be controlled by RF via a remote control. The remote control can be kept in a convenient location, a bedside table for example, to turn on the replacement bulb that would provide enough light to get to the wall switch to turn on the brighter incandescent lights or it could turn on one or more RF controlled battery embedded wireless light bulbs that provide adequate light. Alternatively, the battery embedded wireless light bulb can be controlled by any combination of RF, IR, or any sensors mentioned herein.","In other embodiments, the battery powered wireless light bulb will contain rechargeable batteries such that the bulb can be recharged by connecting the bulb to an AC power source such as plugging the bulb into a recharging base, plugging the bulb into an AC light socket and the like. For example, a battery powered wireless light bulb containing rechargeable batteries can be used with a fixture or lamp. When the capacity of the rechargeable batteries dips below a level that the light output is no longer acceptable, a user can unscrew the battery powered wireless light bulb and screw it into a recharging base. The recharging base is comprised of the circuitry necessary to charge the batteries to capacity. When battery charging is complete, the user can remove the bulb from the recharging base and return it to the fixture or lamp. In another example, the bulb can be plugged into a standard light socket to charge the batteries. In one embodiment, the bulb can also be connected to a DC power source for recharging and as such would have circuitry to make use of the DC power source for recharging the batteries. In an alternate embodiment, the bulb has a USB connector on it that allows for charging by connection to a USB port. In other alternate embodiments any form of wireless power mentioned herein may be used for recharging a battery powered wireless light bulb. It is to be appreciated that any combination of charging approaches can be included in the same battery powered wireless light bulb.","In such a case when there is a USB connector on the bulb, the USB connector may also be used as a communication interface to program the bulb. An AC powered wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless light bulb may be able to attach to a computer via USB directly or over a USB cable to connect the bulb for programming. In other embodiments, different interface types on the bulb such as Ethernet, IEEE 1394 Fire Wire, Serial Port or the like can be used to connect to a computer directly or by cable to program the bulb. In another example, a programming adapter connected to the computer that the wireless light bulb can plug into or connect to electrically and mechanically in any known manner may serve as the interface to program the bulb. In other embodiments, an RF or IR adapter that can plug into a computer directly or via a cable using any of the interface types listed may send programming information to one or more wireless light bulbs containing an RF or IR receiver or transceiver to program the wireless light bulbs. In some embodiments, an RF or IR interface to the wireless light bulb may be provided by any device (remote control, keypad, PDA, computer, laptop, custom circuit etc.) with the RF or IR interface and the ability to communicate with the wireless light bulbs can be used to program the wireless light bulbs. A software program that allows a user to set the state of the bulb based on timer or time of day, auto shut-off times, color temperature, light strength (glow levels, low light levels, dimming\/fading functions), motion sensitivity and listening on times, light sensitivity, level of ambient light controlled by a photocell, energy usage control to control light output based on a desired amount of energy usage over time, network parameters (unique IDs, network IDs, multicast IDs, broadcast IDs, IP address, routing and forwarding information for the network, WIFI SSIDs, ZIGBEE PAN IDs and network IDs, X10 four bit house code, INSTEON address or the like), sensor parameters (detection thresholds for setting the state of the bulb, timer and time of day settings for when the sensor is active and the like) etc. is used to connect to and program the state of the bulb. It is to be appreciated that the AC powered or battery powered wireless light bulb may contain the intelligence necessary to implement the programmable functions.","Batteries in a battery powered wireless light bulb can also be removable and replaceable. In one embodiment, the bulb may have a battery compartment with a cover that can be removed to access the batteries. In an alternate embodiment, the bulb may have batteries that are accessible by unscrewing the top of the bulb and removing an assembly that contains the circuitry, light source and a battery holder containing the batteries. In another alternate embodiment, the batteries may be installed in a tray that may slide in and out of the battery powered wireless light bulb such that a user may slide out the battery tray, replace the batteries and slide the battery tray back into the battery powered wireless light bulb. In an alternate embodiment, the bulb may be a recessed fixture wireless light bulb with the ability to remove and replace the exposed face of the recessed fixture to access of battery holder inside the fixture. In an alternate embodiment, the bulb may be a fluorescent tube replacement with an LED or other type of light source where the batteries are embedded in the fluorescent tube replacement housing and may be removable and replaceable. Alternate embodiments may include but are not limited to any known method of accessing a wireless light bulb to remove and replace the batteries. The batteries can be non-rechargeable batteries that can be replaced or removed or can be rechargeable batteries that can be removed and recharged when capacity drops below a usable level then returned to the bulb. The batteries may be off the shelf batteries of standard sizes (e.g. AA, C, 18650, etc) or the batteries may be a custom size and shape. The non-rechargeable or rechargeable batteries also can be embedded in the bulb permanently with no method for removal and replacement. By way of an example, a battery powered wireless light bulb may be designed with a method allowing removal and replacement of the embedded batteries. The batteries may be rechargeable and the battery powered wireless light bulb may include battery charging circuitry that charges the embedded batteries when connected to an external power source.","According to another illustration, a light socket or fixture can provide AC power that can be leveraged by the wireless light bulb in addition to one or more alternate power sources embedded in the wireless light bulb. The alternate power sources can be non-rechargeable or rechargeable batteries, solar cell, fuel cell (such as and without limitation a hydrogen fuel cell, a reformed methanol fuel cell, or the like), collecting RF energy from the environment, electromagnetic induction, wave coupling, converting motion or heat to electrical energy, wireless power transmission, capacitors and any other form of wireless power mentioned herein. It is to be appreciated that the AC powered with alternate power source wireless light bulb can contain the intelligence and control circuitry necessary to make use of any disparate wireless power source or sources in addition to or instead of the AC power source. It is to be appreciated that the AC powered with alternate power source wireless light bulb can be in the form of any bulb type, fixture, down light assembly, and the like, such as mentioned herein.","In one embodiment, rechargeable or non-rechargeable batteries are embedded into the wireless light bulb such that the light source and control circuitry can use either the AC power source or the embedded battery power source. In one example, there is circuitry inside the wireless light bulb that may detect that AC power is no longer present (power failure) or some other characteristic that makes AC power no longer desirable to use (brownout conditions, electrical surges, overvoltage conditions, voltage sag or flickers, line noise, frequency variations, switching transients, harmonic distortion etc.) at the light socket, fixture or down light assembly. In this case the wireless light bulb can switch over to battery power automatically to power the control circuitry and light source. This application, the uninterruptable power supply light bulb, or UPS light bulb, provides emergency or safety lighting during a power outage. Additional intelligence may be designed into the UPS light bulb to provide features or extend the amount of time usable light may be available when powered by the embedded battery power source. The UPS light bulb may contain a colored LED that blinks when the battery source is being used to provide an indication that the UPS light bulb is being powered by the embedded battery source. The UPS light bulb may contain a method to indicate the battery capacity level. By way of an example, there may be a push button integrated on the bulb such that when it is pushed, an LED illuminates providing an indication of the battery capacity. By way of an example, a green indication may indicate that the charge level is acceptable, a yellow indication may indicate that it is low and a red indication may indicate that there is not enough battery capacity for the bulb to operate in an acceptable manner. In an alternate example, the push button may be remote from the bulb and communicate to the bulb through wires, RF, IR or another method to command the bulb to show the capacity level indication when the push button is pressed. In some embodiments, the UPS light bulb may contain intelligence to detect the battery capacity level and adjust the light intensity level to extend the amount of time there is usable light out of the UPS light bulb. This may take advantage of the characteristic of batteries that at lower continuous current levels the rate of battery drain will be lower. By way of an example, if there is a short power outage, the initial light intensity level may be a high level, however after some amount of battery drain over some period of time, the light intensity level may be dropped to a lower level requiring less continuous current from the batteries, extending the amount of time the light source may run on batteries (anticipating that the power outage may last a long period of time). In an alternate example, several UPS light bulbs may be installed in an area to provide egress lighting for emergency situations. The UPS light bulbs may revert in an emergency situation to a low level of light that meets requirements for emergency lighting in both light intensity and duration of time that the UPS light bulb may provide an acceptable level of illumination. By way of an example, the UPS light bulbs may provide emergency illumination for more than ninety minutes when normal lighting is not operational. By way of an example, the installed set of UPS light bulbs may provide an initial illumination of approximately one foot-candle and at any point a \u22129 minimum of 0.1 foot-candle measured at floor level in the egress path. The levels may decrease to a minimum of 0.6 foot-candle average and 0.06 foot-candle at any point at the end of ninety minutes. It is to be appreciated that any number of light intensity levels may be set based on any number of detected battery capacity levels. In alternate embodiments, the change in light intensity level may be controlled by time (timer, time of day clock etc) instead of monitoring battery capacity levels. In such a case, the UPS bulb may contain intelligence to use the timer or time source and adjust the light intensity level to extend the amount of time there is usable light out of the UPS light bulb. By way of an example, the UPS light bulb may have a short outage mode and a long outage mode. In short outage mode, the UPS light bulb may operate for fifteen minutes at 100% light intensity, then the UPS light bulb may change to long outage mode automatically reducing the light intensity to 25% for the remainder of the outage. In another example, the end user has a method to change from short outage mode to long outage mode for example by switches on the bulb, remote control to change modes or provide a capability to dim the light intensity to any desired level or any other control mentioned herein. It is to be appreciated that the length of time and light intensity may be any amount required by the application and any number of light levels that may be used. In an alternate embodiment, a light sensor may be present in the UPS light bulb to sense the amount of ambient light present and adjust the light intensity appropriately. In this embodiment, the light sensor may extend the amount of time there is usable light when the embedded battery power source is used by optimizing the amount of light output based on the detected light level. Using the light sensor as a day\/night sensor or to set the output light intensity based on detected light level may optimize the drain on the embedded battery power source. In alternate embodiments, the UPS light bulb contains one or more methods of wireless control that may be used to provide additional functionality. By way of an example, a motion sensor may be added to the bulb such that it will only operate when motion is detected. By way of another example, the UPS light bulb may contain a receiver to allow a remote control to turn it on, off, change light intensity, select the power source (allowing the UPS light bulb to be turned on or off independent of AC power) or control any feature that may be present the UPS light bulb. The UPS bulb may use a sensor as an alarm indication and in some cases use that sensor information to select the power source. By way of an example, a thermal sensor may detect heat and when the temperature level rises above a threshold it may cause the UPS bulb to switch to battery power and blink the light source in a way to indicate an alarm situation. In alternate embodiments of the UPS bulb or any wireless light bulb, they may contain one or more thermal sensors and be able to transmit via an RF or IR transmitter temperature information back to a thermostat or any device that may display or make use of temperature information in any way.","The UPS light bulb may include circuitry to detect at the UPS light bulb conditions that may allow an intelligent decision on which power source to use. The UPS light bulb may need to detect whether the controlling switch or breaker applying power to the UPS light bulb is open or closed, if input AC power is present, if the quality of the input AC power is acceptable, and the like. The UPS light bulb may monitor the presence and quality of the input AC power with circuitry in the bulb to detect the presence of AC power and make a measurement of the characteristics of the AC power. It may also measure the impedance, resistance, and\/or capacitance across the AC power input and return or may measure any other electrical characteristic of the AC power input and return to determine whether the controlling switch or breaker is open or closed (or if electricity has been turned off at any point up to the AC input of the UPS light bulb). It is to be appreciated that the switch or breaker may be any type of switch or breaker used to control an electrical or lighting circuit such as but not limited to toggle switches, dimmer switches, three way or multi-way switches, timer controlled switches, motion sensor switches, push button or touch switches, paddle switches, solid state switches, slide switches, rotary switches, switches with specialized intelligence built in, open fuses in the electrical or lighting circuit, poly fuses or poly switches, low, medium or high voltage circuit breakers, magnetic circuit breakers, thermal magnetic circuit breakers, common trip circuit breakers, residual current circuit breakers, earth leakage circuit breakers and the like. In some embodiments, the UPS light bulb may store information such that the bulb may be able to operate as it was when the outage occurred. For example, the UPS light bulb may be controlled by a dimmer switch, the UPS light bulb may store the dim level and when there is a power outage, the UPS light bulb may switch to PWM dimming that is similar to the light intensity level that had been set by the dimmer switch, and the like. By way of an example, if the controlling switch or breaker is open, there may be a high impedance detected across the input AC power and return. If the controlling switch or breaker is closed, there may be a measureable impedance, resistance and\/or capacitance or electrical characteristic different from when the controlling switch or breaker is open. A threshold may be set in the bulb such that if the measurement is above or below the threshold, the switch or breaker is closed, and if the measurement is on the opposite side of the threshold, the switch or breaker is open. The UPS light bulb may be controlled by the state of the controlling switch or breaker (on or off), but may also detect the condition when the controlling switch or breaker is closed but AC input power is not present or is not acceptable and may be able to switch over to the rechargeable or non-rechargeable batteries that are embedded as the power source. Thus, the UPS light bulb may be able to switch to embedded battery power without directly knowing whether the switch is open or closed, but rather by measuring the electrical characteristics of the AC input. In some embodiments, the UPS bulb may have circuitry to be able to detect the switch transition from on to off or off to on. By way of an example, in a power outage, the wall switch may still be used to control the UPS bulb that is powered by battery to on or off such that even when AC is not applied, a transition from switch closed to switch open will turn off the UPS bulb that is powered by the embedded power source.","In some embodiments, the UPS light bulb may perform an impedance discontinuity check to determine if the controlling switch or breaker is open or closed. In some embodiments, the UPS light bulb may generate a signal onto the line and monitor the electrical response of the line to determine if the response indicates an impedance discontinuity typical of an open circuit that may be indicative of a switch or breaker open in the lighting circuit or if the response indicates a closed circuit typical of a switch or breaker closed in the lighting circuit. By way of an example, the UPS bulb may perform a function typical of a time domain reflectometer by generating a short rise time pulse at the connection to input and monitor the input for a reflected signal that would be indicative of an open or closed circuit. If the reflected signal exceeds a set threshold, it may indicate an open circuit. In some embodiments, the UPS bulb may need to learn where such a threshold should be set. The UPS bulb may be installed in many variations of lighting circuits where the amount, length, gauge or type of wiring to the switch or breaker may vary and where there may be many other sources of loads on the lighting circuit (such as other bulbs, multiple switches or controls etc.) therefore it may have to adjust its detection circuitry to operate properly. It is to be appreciated that the setting of the threshold may be done automatically by the UPS bulb or manually by a user through any process that may allow the bulb to be set to a threshold where one side of the threshold indicates the switch or breaker is open and the other side of the threshold indicates the switch or breaker is closed. It is to be appreciated that when the switch sense functionality is implemented, the switch or breaker may still be able to turn on and off power to the UPS light bulb or wireless light bulb even when running off of the embedded battery power source because the UPS light bulb or wireless light bulb may be able to determine if the switch is on or off and apply power or not apply power to the UPS light bulb or wireless light bulb based on the switch position. In such a case, the switch sense circuitry may still need to be powered along with any other necessary circuitry to implement this function even when the light source is not being powered. In some embodiments, a device may be designed that may be electrically and mechanically attached to an existing switch or breaker of any type mentioned herein such that it may have electrical characteristics that may be easily detected by the UPS light bulb in an outage. The device, a UPS light switch detection module, may be an electrical circuit that may monitor the state of the switch, open or closed, and whether power is present at the input side of the switch. If there is no input power, whether the switch is open or closed, the device may insert a circuit with the electrical characteristics that may be easily detected by the one or more UPS light bulbs on the lighting circuit. This allows the UPS light bulb to be able to detect an outage even when the controlling switch or switches are open by allowing it to be electrically connected to the input side of the switch. There may be control on the device such that the user may enable the UPS light bulb to turn on when the light switch is open and there is no power at the input of the switch. If this function is disabled, the user may control the UPS light bulb by the controlling switch, but if the function is enabled, the UPS light bulb may be capable of switching to battery power whether the controlling switch is open or closed. In alternate embodiments, the device is not a device that attached to a switch or breaker, but is the switch or breaker itself thus the function may be installed by replacing an existing switch or breaker. In alternate embodiments, the device may physically and electrically be connected anywhere in a lighting or electrical circuit that it would be desirable to detect a power outage. In some cases, the UPS light bulb or bulbs may not be able to reliably detect the state of the switch in which case the device may added to make the detection of the switch state reliable. In alternate embodiments, the switch sense mechanism or command to switch to battery power is not by detection of an electrical characteristic on the lighting circuit, but rather is communicated on the lighting circuit from the switch or breaker to the one or more UPS light bulbs on a circuit on the power lines (e.g. X10, INSTEON, Broadband over Power Lines, proprietary communication scheme etc). By way of an example, a circuit inside a light switch detects whether power is present on the input of the switch. If power is not present at the input, the circuit may send a command over the power lines to the UPS light bulb or bulbs to switch to battery power. In some embodiments, the communication may be bidirectional such that the UPS light bulb or UPS light switch detection module may initiate the communication or respond to the communication. It is to be appreciated that the UPS light switch detection module may be a passive circuit, may be an active circuit that derives power from the AC or DC line depending on what type of power is on the lighting circuit, may be an active circuit that contains an embedded power source such as a battery allowing it to be powered in the absence of input power.","In some embodiments the UPS bulb may be removed from the socket such that it may be carried around as a light source. As such the UPS bulb may detect a different set of electrical characteristics of the AC input of the UPS bulb when it is removed from the socket. Alternatively, the UPS bulb may be able to detect the switch transition from on to off, off to on or be able to detect that neither transition happened but there was a change in the electrical characteristics and as such determine that the bulb was removed from the socket. The removed bulb may become a \u201cflashlight\u201d when carried around by itself, plugged into a base unit that has a handle or handheld in any manner conceivable such that it can be carried around. The base unit may have a switch on it with a circuit connected to the socket where the UPS bulb plugs in and can detect electrical characteristics of the switch and circuit (similar to the measurement of impedance, resistance and\/or capacitance mentioned herein) such that the switch may be used to turn the UPS bulb on and off. It is to be appreciated that the functionality described for the UPS light bulb may be designed in any size or shape housing to meet the requirements of any standard size bulb (e.g. PAR30, PAR38, A19, R30, MR16 etc), non-standard size bulb, fixture, compact fluorescent bulb, fluorescent bulb or lamp (e.g. T4, T5, T8, circular etc.) or down light assembly (e.g. recessed fixtures, fluorescent fixtures or down light fixtures for residential, commercial or industrial lighting), or the like.","In one embodiment where rechargeable batteries are the alternate power source, circuitry can also be present in the bulb to control the recharging of the batteries while AC power is applied (trickle charge, slow charge, fast charge etc.) and under what conditions the recharging will happen (time of day, battery capacity level, any time AC power is applied etc.). It is also to be appreciated that the batteries can be recharged through an alternate interface such as a USB connector or any form of wireless power on the wireless light bulb mentioned herein.","In such a case when there is a USB connector on the bulb, the USB connector may also be used as a communication interface to program the bulb. The AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb can attach to a computer via USB directly or over a USB cable to connect the bulb for programming. In other embodiments, different interface types on the bulb such as Ethernet, IEEE 1394 Fire Wire, Serial Port or the like can be used to connect to a computer directly or by cable to program the bulb. In another example, a programming adapter connected to the computer that the wireless light bulb can plug into or connect to electrically and mechanically in any known manner may serve as the interface to program the bulb. In other embodiments, an RF or IR adapter that can plug into a computer directly or via a cable using any of the interface types listed may send programming information to one or more wireless light bulbs containing an RF or IR receiver or transceiver to program the wireless light bulbs. In some embodiments, an RF or IR interface to the wireless light bulb can be provided by any intelligent device (remote control, keypad, PDA, computer, laptop, custom circuit design etc.) with the RF or IR interface and the ability to communicate with the wireless light bulbs can be used to program the wireless light bulbs. A software program or other device that allows a user to set the state of the bulb based on timer or time of day, auto shut-off times, color temperature, light strength (glow levels, low light levels, dimming\/fading functions), motion sensitivity and listening on times, light sensitivity, level of ambient light controlled by a photocell, energy usage control to control light output based on a desired amount of energy usage over time, network parameters (unique IDs, network IDs, multicast IDs, broadcast IDs, IP address, routing and forwarding information for the network, WIFI SSIDs, ZIGBEE PAN IDs and network IDs, BLUETOOTH, X10 four bit house code, INSTEON address or the like), sensor parameters (detection thresholds for setting the state of the bulb, timer and time of day settings for when the sensor is active and the like) etc. is used to connect to and program the state of the bulb. It is to be appreciated that the AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb may contain the intelligence necessary to implement the programmable functions.","In addition to controlling the lighting installation, the sensors and intelligence that are designed into wireless light bulbs and communication interface implemented in the wireless light bulbs may allow the wireless light bulbs installed to also perform functions in addition to lighting. This applies to AC powered, battery embedded, AC powered battery embedded or any combination of power source wireless light bulbs mentioned herein. The embedded sensors and intelligence together with the communication interface may allow a single wireless light bulb to implement functionality beyond just lighting. Multiple wireless light bulbs may form a sensor network to add useful functions to a lighting installation where multiple wireless light bulbs may be individually controlled or work as a network to implement one or more functions in addition to lighting. A software program or intelligent device may allow a user to gather status from a sensor in the wireless light bulb or from intelligence designed into the wireless light bulb over the communication interface such as but not limited to temperature, ambient light levels, battery capacity levels, energy usage statistics, on and off time records, sensor detection data and statistics (motion detections per some unit of time, switch actuation information to generate an alarm, smoke detector alarm signals etc.), network usage statistics or information that can be gathered from any sensor or intelligence built into the wireless light bulb. A software program or intelligent device may also receive a stream of data collected by a sensor of the wireless light bulb over the communication interface such as but not limited to audio from a microphone, a video stream from a camera, pictures from a digital camera, RFID tag read information (i.e. an RFID tag reader), etc. A software program or intelligent device may also control a device inside the wireless light bulb over the communication interface to implement any function such as but not limited to a speaker to make announcements or generate sound, a horn to generate alarms, enable a circuit to energize or de-energize a relay or other switch control, turn on or off a motor, etc.","In one use case, the design is a par30 motion sensor wireless light bulb or a 6\u2033 recessed fixture motion sensor wireless light bulb. They are installed in office space in 50 different locations in addition the lighting that is installed. Software running on a computer allows a security guard to communicate with and receive status from the wireless light bulbs. When a wireless light bulb detects motion, it sends a message to the security guard's computer that motion has been detected and which bulb has detected the motion (i.e. the location where the motion is). The security guard receives a message or an alarm that motion has been detected in one of 50 locations which may provide an indication of a security issue or that someone is not where they are supposed to be. In some embodiments, a software application may send an e-mail, XML message or any other type of message to provide alerts to the end user based on the message received from a wireless light bulb or wireless lighting module. In some cases, a software application may store in memory or a database a record of the motion detections over time. In an alternate use case, the wireless light bulbs record a statistic called \u201cnumber of motion detections since last read\u201d. A software application can read that statistic from each wireless light bulb and determine how to most efficiently use the lighting by time of day and usage profile. It can be used not only to control lighting but for occupancy studies in building management, used to record the flow of traffic past a certain point, and the like. In one possible use, the sensor may not control lighting, but is used for the information provided by the sensor in addition to the light that is used for illumination.","In another use case, the design is a recessed fixture RFID reader wireless light bulb. They are installed in office space in 50 different locations in addition the lighting that is installed. Employees and guests are issued identification, such as badges that are RFID tags or access cards that can be read by the RFID reader or the access card reader in the wireless light bulb. In addition, RFID tags can be attached to assets for operational efficiency and theft prevention. Software running on a computer receives the reads of the identifications badges or asset tags and can provide an indication of current or last know location within the building with respect to the location of the RFID reader wireless light bulbs. This provides the building manager the ability to find, track or review the real time or historical movements of employees, guests or assets. This functionality can be used for safety, security, operational efficiency, etc.","In another use case, a wireless light bulb has a speaker or alarm horn in it that allows announcements to be made (like an intercom system which could be two way if the units had a microphone on them also) or alarm sounds to be generated in certain emergency situations. In an alternate use case, a wireless light bulb is installed as a porch light with a microphone and speaker built in. A user can push a button on an intercom box inside of their house to talk or listen to a visitor through the porch light microphone and speaker.","In another use case, a wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture may have a motion sensor and RF transmitter in addition to the light source. When motion is detected, the light source may be turned on and an indication that motion was detected may be transmitted to an RF receiver. The RF receiver may be connected to an intelligent device such as a computer that may allow the motion indication to be interpreted. For example, in a health care application, a wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless light fixture may be installed in the bathroom of a hospital room or in the hallway of the hospital floor. When motion is detected in the bathroom or hallway, the light may be turned on and an indication that motion was detected may be received at the nurse's station. If there is a reason that a patient should not be moving, then that indication may be an alarm indication providing allowing the nurse to take action immediately. Unique IDs may be set in each of the wireless light bulbs or battery powered wireless lighting fixtures such that, by knowing the location of the installed wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture, the location of the source of motion may be known.","Batteries in an AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb can also be removable and replaceable. In one embodiment, the bulb may have a battery compartment with a cover that can be removed to access the batteries. In an alternate embodiment, the bulb may have batteries that are accessible by unscrewing the top of the bulb and removing an assembly that contains the circuitry, light source and a battery holder containing the batteries. In another alternate embodiment, the batteries may be installed in a tray that may slide in and out of the AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb such that a user may slide out the battery tray, replace the batteries and slide the battery tray back into the AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb. In an alternate embodiment, the bulb is a recessed fixture wireless light bulb with the ability to remove and replace the exposed face of the recessed fixture to access of battery holder inside the fixture. In an alternate embodiment, the bulb may be a fluorescent tube replacement with an LED or other type of light source (ie uninterruptable power supply tube) where the batteries are embedded in the uninterruptable power supply tube housing. Alternate embodiments may include but are not limited to any known method of accessing a wireless light bulb to remove and replace the batteries. The batteries can be non-rechargeable batteries that can be replaced or removed or can be rechargeable batteries that can be removed and recharged when capacity drops below a usable level then returned to the bulb. The batteries may be off the shelf batteries of standard sizes (e.g. AA, C, 18650 etc) or the batteries may be a custom size and shape. The non-rechargeable or rechargeable batteries also can be embedded in the bulb permanently with no method for removal and replacement. By way of an example, a UPS light bulb may be designed with a method allowing removal and replacement of the embedded batteries. The batteries may be rechargeable and the UPS light bulb may include battery charging circuitry that charges the embedded batteries when connected to a power source. Power may be received through the input at the Edison base or it may be received through an alternate connection to the UPS light bulb. A battery charging circuit may be present that detects when rechargeable batteries of one or more types are installed and when non-rechargeable batteries are installed such that the UPS light bulb may use rechargeable or non-rechargeable batteries based on user preference. This allows the battery power source to be changed in the field to extend the life of the product beyond the life of the embedded battery. The UPS light bulb may only accept non-rechargeable batteries and may not contain a battery charging circuitry such that when the non-rechargeable batteries capacity is below a level where they may power the UPS light bulb to an acceptable light output, the user may remove and replace the batteries.","In one embodiment, a PAR30 AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb contains a single battery cell and a charge pump LED driver to generate the necessary drive voltage and current for the LED light source. In this example, the single battery cell is a NiMH rechargeable D cell battery. Using a single battery cell allows the design to fit within the design constraints of the PAR30 bulb type. It is to be appreciated that any number or type of battery can be used. A charging circuit that supports NiMH charging in circuit is also part of the electronics inside the bulb. There is also circuitry inside the bulb to allow each power source to be used independently or to share the load depending on whether each power source is present and able to supply power to the wireless light bulb. It is to be appreciated that any form of wireless control mentioned herein can be used in conjunction with this embodiment.","In an alternate example, the UPS light bulb also contains an RF receiver that allows the UPS light bulb to receive control commands over an RF communication link. In one example, an RF transmitter can be coupled with an AC detection circuit such that when it detects that AC power has dropped out (i.e. there is a power outage) or some other characteristic that makes AC power no longer desirable to use (brownout conditions, electrical surges, overvoltage conditions, voltage sag or flickers, line noise, frequency variations, switching transients, harmonic distortion, etc.) it will send a command to the UPS light bulb to switch it over to battery power. Upon detection that AC power is back on or is desirable to use, the RF transmitter can send a command to switch over to AC power. It is to be appreciated that the power outage module may detect a drop out of any type of power source that may be required by the application including but not limited to AC power, DC power, an energy harvesting power source and the like. This power outage module in the form of an RF transmitter and AC detection circuitry in a housing can be designed to operate plugged into an electrical wall socket, hardwired into or as a replacement for an AC wall light switch to allow detection of the state of AC power prior to the switch independent of the on\/off position of the wall switch, can be hardwired directly into a breaker box to determine the state of power where it enters a residence or building, can be wired into an emergency circuit and respond to an emergency on signal or can be wired into any point in a power distribution system that a user may want to detect a drop out in AC power. The RF transmitter and AC detection circuitry can be powered off of AC power or powered by batteries. In addition to controlling a AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb, it is to be appreciated that the RF transmitter and AC detection circuitry can control battery or AC powered fixtures that may not be wireless light bulbs, but rather stair lights, spotlights, path lights, exit signs and lighting, stair well lights, floor lights, ceiling lights etc to provide lighting in an emergency situation. It is to be appreciated that a network of wireless light bulbs and fixtures with RF transceivers may be created to propagate control messages through the network to control any installed lights from one or more RF transmitter and AC detection circuits. It is to be appreciated that any command can be sent as it relates to the state of AC power as detected by the detection circuitry. For example, to conserve energy or save money on an energy bill, the RF transmitter and AC detection circuitry may monitor power usage on a wired circuit and send a dimming command or a command to set the brightness of the lights on the wired circuit to a lower level when power usage exceeds some threshold, but at some later time send a second command returning the lights on the wired circuit to a brighter level thus allowing power usage on that wired circuit to stay below some average usage level. In some embodiments, the RF transmitter and AC detection circuitry contains circuitry to act as a load control switch receiving a load control command from the power company and transmitting to one or more wireless light bulbs to turn off, change light intensity, switch over all or a portion of the load to battery power etc. In alternate embodiments, the unit does not contain AC detection circuitry and is just a load control switch with an RF transmitter that may control the wireless light bulbs in an installation in a demand response energy efficiency system, for load control purposes and the like. This wireless lighting load control switch may contain a timer such that after it receives a command from the power company to change to a lower energy consumption state, the wireless lighting load control switch may start a timer and when the timer expires the wireless lighting load control switch will send a command returning to the original state of operation or to another state of operation.","In some embodiments the power outage module may be connected to an emergency lighting circuit such that if the emergency lighting circuit forces a switch to emergency lighting, the emergency lighting power outage module will detect the emergency lighting circuit turning on and will transmit a message to the UPS light bulbs, wireless light bulbs and battery powered wireless lighting fixtures to switch on or to some dedicated emergency lighting function. For example, the UPS light bulbs, wireless light bulbs and battery powered wireless lighting fixtures may switch to a lower light level when switched over to battery power in an emergency situation to extend battery life during the emergency. In another example, the UPS light bulbs, wireless light bulbs and battery powered wireless lighting fixtures may blink the lights to indicate the emergency situation.","In some embodiments, the power outage module may contain a light source such that in cases where it is detachable, it may be removed and used as a light source powered by batteries. In such a case, a user may detach the power outage module and walk around using it in a manner similar to a flashlight. In some embodiments, the RF transmitter and AC detector circuit may contain forms of wireless controls such as sensors to control the lights during a power outage but also in normal operation. By way of an example, a power outage module may work as described, but also contain a motion sensor such that when motion is detected under normal circumstances, a control message is transmitted to the wireless light bulbs and wireless lighting modules within range to control them, but in a power outage situation would transmit a different control message. In alternate embodiments, sensors may be modules that plug into the power outage module. In such a case, the power outage module may contain a connector to allow a sensor module to be installed. By way of an example, a user may plug in a light sensor module such that a measurement of the amount of ambient light detected by the light sensor may be transmitted to the wireless light bulbs and wireless lighting modules. It is to be appreciated that the sensor may be plugged in permanently or plugged in temporarily. In the example using the light sensor module, the light sensor module may be used to make a one-time measurement of ambient light in an area to adjust the light, then removed or it may be permanently installed to allow the wireless light bulbs and wireless lighting modules to continuously adjust light intensity to match the ambient light detected to maintain some net light level. In some embodiments, the power outage module may send any type of message to control the wireless light bulbs and wireless lighting modules to achieve any functionality mentioned herein. By way of an example, the power outage module may send a message setting the light intensity level, programming an auto shutoff time, changing the way the controlled lights manage power and the like. It is to be appreciated that the power outage module may control UPS light bulbs, wireless light bulbs with integrated power sources, battery powered wireless lighting fixtures etc.","In some embodiments the power outage module may be a removable module and may act as a remote control such that a user may be able to remove the module or a part of the module from where it is installed and walk around with a remote control to control the wireless light bulbs and battery powered wireless lighting fixtures. In such an embodiment, the remote control power outage module may have button, switches, dials and the like to allow it to select and control lights on, off, the light intensity level etc. In some embodiments, the remote control power outage module may have an LCD touch screen or the like that would allow the user to control the lighting. In some cases, the remote control power outage module may be a control panel mounted to a wall that monitors the AC input and allows a user to control the lighting installation. In one embodiment, the power outage module remains in place, but an alternate remote control may be used to control the lighting. By way of an example, an IPHONE running an application and with a communication interface that may communicate with the wireless light bulbs and wireless lighting modules may allow control of the lights. It is to be appreciated that the remote control may use any communication interface and may contain any type of control mentioned herein. In some embodiments, the remote control power outage module or any other remote control mentioned herein may automatically detect when a bulb or fixture has been powered on.","In some embodiments, a power outage module may contain wireless power source such as a battery. Thus, the power outage module may be able to continue operation in the absence of AC power. The power outage module may draw its power from AC, its embedded wireless power source or both. It is to be appreciated that the power outage module will contain the circuitry and\/or intelligence to manage which power source to use. In alternate embodiments, the power outage module may not contain an embedded wireless power source. In this embodiment, the power outage module may send regular messages (\u201ckeep alives\u201d) to the wireless light bulbs and wireless lighting modules such that as long as the wireless lights continue to receive the messages on a regular interval, the wireless lights should continue to operate normally. If the power outage module detects a problem with the AC power or its AC power is no longer present (i.e. it shuts off and hence stops transmitting), the wireless light bulbs and wireless lighting modules will not receive these keep alive messages from the power outage module for some period of time and as such determine that there is a problem with detected AC power and change state as necessary. By way of an example, the wireless light bulbs and wireless lighting modules may switch to an emergency mode and change their behavior in some way. Using a mechanism such that the wireless light bulbs and wireless lighting modules are required to hear the transmission of the power outage module at regular intervals prevents the case where the power outage module is disabled or blocked from transmitting in an emergency situation.","In some embodiments, a power outage module may be designed as a current loop that may detect the flow of current in wires inside the loop by detecting the magnetic field created by the electrical current. The current loop power outage module may contain a wireless transmitter. The current loop power outage module may contain a power source such as a battery that may power the current loop power outage module. In such an embodiment, the current loop power outage module may be installed on the power lines entering a house, on an individual circuit etc such that when a power outage is detected, the current loop power outage module may transmit on, off, dim, test or other commands to wireless light bulbs and battery powered wireless lighting fixtures. In some embodiments, the current loop power outage module may transmit a measurement of the amount of electric current detected flowing through the wires it is monitoring. In alternate embodiments, the current loop power outage module may contain a small display such as an LCD display to show the amount of current flowing through the loop or to show the amount of power consumed on the measured circuit.","In some embodiments, a wireless transmitter remote module may detect a power outage or disruption in input power and transmit control to wireless light bulbs or battery powered wireless lighting fixtures where the wireless transmitter remote module allows any external device to interface to the wireless transmitter remote module to transmit ON, OFF, DIM UP, DIM DOWN, TEST or any other control that may be implemented. It is to be appreciated that the external device may provide the indication to the wireless transmitter remote module that a power outage has occurred. In some embodiments, the wireless transmitter remote module is removable and replaceable from the external device. The wireless transmitter remote module may contain an LED to allow wireless transmitter remote module to act as a light source during a power outage or to allow the wireless transmitter remote module to be used in a manner similar to a flashlight. In some embodiments, the wireless transmitter remote module may emit sound to indicate where it is. In some embodiments, the wireless transmitter remote module contains an communication interface to a network, such as a Zigbee, Ethernet, Wifi, Bluetooth, which allows it to send an email, text message, make a phone call, make a phone call by Skype etc when a power outage or power disruption occurs. The wireless transmitter remote module may have on\/off controls such as one or more pushbuttons such that lights that the device controls may be controlled during outage. The wireless transmitter remote module may have a test button to provide an indication of battery capacity level of battery powered wireless lighting fixtures where the indication is displayed on the wireless transmitter remote module. In such a case, the wireless transmitter remote module may require a wireless receiver such that it may receive the results of the test command back such that it may indicate the results. In embodiments containing a wireless receiver, the wireless transmitter may receive commands, data etc from any type of device that it may be able to communicate with. In embodiments, the wireless transmitter remote module may have an indicator that displays the battery life of each separate wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture.","In some embodiments, a power outage module may be designed as a wall switch plate replacement that has a light source integrated and may be connected to the switch electrically to allow it to detect a disruption in power at the switch. In such an embodiment, the wall switch plate replacement may also contain a wireless transmitter to allow it to control wireless light bulbs or battery powered wireless lighting fixtures upon the detection of a disruption in power. By way of an example, a power outage system may be created using a wall switch plate replacement that has a light source integrated for illumination and a number of battery powered wireless lighting fixtures that may receive control as transmitted from the wall switch plate replacement.","In some embodiments, a power outage lighting socket module may be contemplated in which the module may be connected to a light socket and controlled by a wall switch. The power outage lighting socket module may transmit on, off, dim, test or other commands to wireless light bulbs and battery powered wireless lighting fixtures. In embodiments with a dimming capability, the power outage lighting socket module may transmit a dim up, dim down or specific dim level to the receiving bulbs or fixtures. By way of an example, a power outage lighting socket module may be designed to screw into an Edison socket and may contain a wireless transmitter to allow the transmission of commands to one or more wireless light bulbs or battery powered wireless lighting fixtures upon the detection of a power outage. In some embodiments the power outage lighting socket module may be integrated into another device such as an LED light bulb, for example a UPS light bulb, and may transmit the same control delivered to the device it is integrated into. In some embodiments it may transmit different control than the control delivered to the device it is integrated into. In alternate embodiments, the power outage lighting socket module may be an adapter such that a bulb, lamp, tube or other lighting source may plug into the adapter but the adapter may also contain a transmitter to allow for commands to be transmitted to wireless light bulbs and battery powered wireless lighting fixtures. In embodiments of the power outage lighting socket module the device may have an integrated power source such as a battery or super capacitor such that it may be able to transmit while power to the outlet or socket is off. By way of an example, a large capacitor may be integrated into the module such that when the power is turned off at the wall switch, the logic and transmitter will still be able to transmit one or more commands such as an off command for some period of time.","In some embodiments, a power outage module may contain an interface that may allow it to be connected to an external device that may trigger the power outage module to transmit commands. In one embodiment, the power outage module is connected to a smoke detector or a system of smoke detectors. When a state change is detected in the smoke detector such as an alarm condition occurs, the smoke detector may trigger the power outage module over the interface to transmit an on command, an off command or some other command to control the wireless light bulbs and battery powered wireless lighting fixtures as needed. In another embodiment, a power outage module is integrated into an emergency light such as a stairwell or hallway light with a function of illuminating the area in an emergency. The power outage module may contain an interface that may allow the emergency light to control it to transmit such that when the emergency light goes on, the power outage module may transmit a command to turn on one or more battery powered wireless lighting fixtures. By way of an example, when an emergency light in a stairwell turns on, the power outage module transmitter sends a command to stair lights that are mounted in the stairwell where there is less light from the emergency light thus providing greater illumination during an emergency situation. Another advantage is that an battery powered wireless light fixture used only for emergency situation may have a much longer run time than 90 minutes or similar typical of emergency lights. By way of an example, a stair light powered by 3 C batteries and generating 50 lumens of light may have a continuous ON time of 40 hours. In another embodiment, the power outage module may interface to or be integrated with a home security system such that the security system may trigger the power outage module to transmit commands to the wireless light bulbs or battery powered wireless lighting fixtures. In such an embodiment, the home security system may turn on or blink the emergency lights upon the detection of an intruder. The home security system may communicate with the power outage module over the interface to implement any control of the wireless lighting bulbs or battery powered wireless lighting fixtures that may be required. It is to be appreciated that the power outage module may be integrated into the housing of any device that may desire to control the wireless lighting installation or the power outage module may be external to the device in which case the power outage module may contain its own housing and mounting mechanism. It is to be appreciated that the control over the interface may be for any purpose including purposes other than lighting during a power outage or emergency. By way of an example, the home security system may turn on the lights periodically as a method of security to provide an appearance that a residence is occupied while the residents are away.","In embodiments, a Wireless Emergency Lighting System may be controlled by a power outage module. In such an embodiment, battery powered wireless lighting fixtures containing a wireless receiver may be controlled by a power outage module such that upon detecting a disturbance in the power input, the power outage module may transmit a command to any number or type of battery powered wireless lighting fixtures to turn the light sources on. When power is restored, the power outage module may transmit a command to turn the light sources off. The battery powered wireless lighting fixtures may be stair lights, spotlights, path lights, exit signs and lighting, stair well lights, floor lights, ceiling lights etc to provide lighting in an emergency situation. It is to be appreciated that the fixtures are battery powered and wirelessly controlled therefore they may be mounted anywhere without the need for a connection to the grid or a wired power source. The battery powered wireless lighting fixtures may contain one or more indicators such as an LED to represent the battery capacity level of the battery powered wireless lighting fixture. The indicator may be any color and may represent the status of the battery in any way such as a green LED may indicated that the battery is healthy, a yellow LED may indicate a low battery level, a red LED may indicate a need to change the battery, a multicolor LED may allow several indications in the same LED. Battery powered wireless lighting fixtures may have an icon with light bars. The light bars may show the battery life of each light fixture. The indicators may always be illuminated or illuminated when button on the fixture or on a remote is pressed. The battery powered wireless lighting fixture may contain a push button such that a user may test the battery by pushing the button rather than containing an always on indication. The push button may be an illuminated push button to provide the indication. The command to test the light may come wirelessly from the power outage module or a separate remote control. In either scenario, the power outage module or remote control may have a mechanism to initiate the test such as a push button to trigger an indication of the status of the battery powered wireless lighting fixtures used in the Wireless Emergency Lighting System. In some embodiments, the battery powered wireless lighting fixtures may be used for general illumination and not just during an emergency. By way of an example, the battery powered wireless lighting fixtures may have a glow mode or low light level mode such that they may be used at night for general illumination. The fixture may be used in a child's room to provide additional lighting in an emergency or power outage but also may be used as a night light. In an alternate example, a user may have a separate remote control in addition to the power outage module that may be used to control the battery powered fixtures independent of the power outage module. It is to be appreciated that any functionality previously described for battery powered wireless lighting fixtures may be used in the Wireless Emergency Lighting System including auto shutoff functionality, environmental sensors capability, embedded programming of microcontrollers, microprocessors or the like to implement intelligent functionality and so on. It is to be appreciated that the battery powered wireless lighting fixture may be able to reconcile inputs from multiple control sources to make a decision on any input or combination of inputs to provide lighting as needed. In some embodiments, the power outage module is a module that contains the circuitry and a defined interface that may be connected to physically and electrically by an external device. Thus, the module may be integrated into or connected to any device that may interface physically and electrically and may be required to transmit control to installed lighting devices or lighting control devices. In some embodiments the power outage module may be an electrical circuit on a printed circuit board that may be integrated into another device. In some embodiments the power outage module may be removable and replaceable.","In one use case of an Wireless Emergency Lighting System, the battery powered wireless lighting fixtures consists of an RF ceiling light and an RF nightlight that are off grid and may receive transmission from a power outage module that contains an RF transmitter, plugs into a wall outlet and directly monitors AC power such that a detected condition that would require a switchover to emergency lighting, such as a power outage or disruption in power, would initiate a transmission to the RF ceiling light and RF nightlight to turn them on. When the power outage module detects that power is acceptable again, the power outage module may initiate a transmission to the RF ceiling light and RF nightlight to turn them off. The power outage module may contain a light source that provides light during the emergency condition. The power outage module may contain controls such as push buttons for on and off that allow a user to initiate control of the battery powered lighting fixtures. Alternatively, the power outage module may contain controls to provide a dimming capability such that a user may be able to adjust the light intensity of the battery powered wireless lighting fixtures. The power outage module may contain environmental sensors such as a motion sensor that may be used for control of the Wireless Emergency Lighting System. The power outage module may contain a power source such as a battery that may allow it to be removed and operated as a remote control. In some embodiments, the power outage module is an adapter that plugs into the wall outlet and contains an outlet allowing a device to plug into it and receive power. In some embodiments, the power outage module contains surge suppression or protection circuitry to protect its own circuitry and to protect any device plugged into it in the case that it is configured as an adapter. It is to be appreciated that RF controlled battery powered wireless lighting fixtures such as stair lights, spotlights, path lights, exit signs and lighting, stair well lights, floor lights, ceiling lights etc may be added to the Wireless Emergency Lighting System and controlled by the same power outage module. In embodiments, there may be a channel number or other method of addressing specific battery powered wireless lighting fixtures so that multiple Wireless Emergency Lighting Systems may be installed within range of each other but may operate independently.","In an alternate embodiment, a device similar to the power outage control module may be used as a switch wireless lighting control module rather than for power outage control. By way of an example, a switch wireless lighting control module may be plugged into a power outlet that is controlled by a wall switch. The wall switch may turn the power outlet on and off. When the power outlet is on, ie power is present, the switch wireless lighting control module may transmit an on command to one or more wireless light bulbs and battery powered wireless lighting fixtures. When the power outlet is off, ie power is not present, the switch wireless lighting control module may transmit an off command to one or more wireless light bulbs and battery powered wireless lighting fixtures. In this scenario, the wall switch may be used to control wireless lights not connected to the grid. In an alternate embodiment, a lighting socket lighting control module may be contemplated in which the lighting control module may be connected to a light socket and controlled by a wall switch. The lighting socket lighting control module may transmit on, off, dim, test or other commands to wireless light bulbs and battery powered wireless lighting fixtures. In embodiments with a dimming capability, the lighting socket control module may transmit a dim up, dim down or specific dim level to the receiving bulbs or fixtures. In some embodiments, the lighting socket control module may detect the dim level as represented by the waveform, for example a triac chopped AC waveform, and transmit an appropriate command such as a specific dim level to bulbs and fixtures if dimming is implemented. By way of an example, a lighting socket lighting control module may be designed to screw into an Edison socket and may contain a transmitter to allow the transmission of commands to one or more wireless light bulbs or battery powered wireless lighting fixtures. In some embodiments the lighting socket lighting control module may be integrated into another device such as an LED light bulb such as the UPS light bulb and may transmit the same control delivered to the device it is integrated into. In some embodiments it may transmit different control than the control delivered to the device it is integrated into. In alternate embodiments, the lighting socket lighting control module may be an adapter such that a bulb, lamp, tube or other lighting source may plug into the adapter but the adapter may also contain a transmitter to allow for commands to be transmitted to wireless light bulbs and battery powered wireless lighting fixtures. In embodiments of the switch lighting control module or lighting socket lighting control module the device may have an integrated power source such as a battery or super capacitor such that it may be able to transmit while power to the outlet or socket is off. By way of an example, a large capacitor may be integrated into the module such that when the power is turned off at the wall switch, the logic and transmitter will still be able to transmit one or more off commands for some period of time.","In another embodiment, the AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb can be controlled by a motion sensor. It may or may not also be controlled by a light sensor to enable operation only in a low level of ambient light. The batteries can be rechargeable or non-rechargeable. The motion sensor controls the AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb such that when motion has not been detected, the light source is set to a glow or a low light level powered by the embedded batteries. When motion is detected and a brighter light is required, the light will be turned on powered by the AC power source and it will be turned on to a bright level. The motion sensor can be powered by the batteries or by the AC power source. In one embodiment, the AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb can work even when the AC power switch is off. For example, at night the AC wall light switch can be turned off, but the motion sensor and light source will still work using the embedded batteries as a power source. By way of an example, an R30 type AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb can be controlled by motion sensor or by the wall switch with the light source powered by AC when AC power is applied and can be controlled by a motion sensor with the light source powered by the batteries when AC power is not present. The motion sensor is powered by the batteries in this example. In another example, the motion circuitry and low level light are powered by battery power, but when AC is applied, the light is set to it bright level independent of the motion sensor.","In an alternate embodiment, the AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb can have multiple light levels that are controlled by the motion sensor. For example, it can have a bright light level but revert to a glow or low light level when the timer reaches a predetermined threshold to conserve energy but also provide a low level of light until motion is detect to turn on to the bright light level. In an alternate embodiment, logic can maintain the bright light level for some period of time, but then can control the light to fade to a glow or low light level by slowly dimming the light source over some preset or programmable period of time until it reaches the glow or low light level. In another alternate embodiment, the motion sensor can control the bulb if it is operating using the AC power source or if it is operating using the embedded battery power source. For example, there are two operational modes. First, if AC power is on the motion sensor and associated logic controls whether the light source is on or off and what brightness level it is on at. Second, if AC is off, the motion sensor operates with the light powered by the battery power source. The brightness level may or may not be different whether power is from the AC source or the battery source.","In another embodiment, the AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb can be controlled by RF or IR. Thus, the input component can be an RF or IR receiver that can obtain an RF or IR signal communicated from an RF or IR transmitter that can be utilized by logic inside the bulb to control operation of the light source. The RF or IR transmitter can come in the form of remote control, keyfob, wall switch or any other controller that can house the RF or IR circuitry and user control mechanism. According to this example, the RF or IR signal can be deciphered by the input component to effectuate switching the light source to an on or off state, changing a light color or a light intensity, and the like. By way of an example, dimming commands can be sent to control the AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb to specific levels in response to commands received from the RF or IR transmitter in a remote control or wall switch. Controls (switches, push buttons, dials, control wheel, etc) on a remote control or wall switch can increase or decrease the light level, set the level to glow, low or high light level directly etc. The wireless light bulb can be commanded to use AC power, battery power, switch from on to the other at various times as set by timers, time of day or sunrise\/sunset calendar information maintained by intelligence in the bulb, can be commanded to switch over when an AC outage is detected, can be commanded to energy conservation modes automatically switching to different light levels upon any detectable state of the power or controls of the bulb etc. By way of an example, a PAR38 type AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb can be controlled by RF or IR or by the wall switch with the light source powered by AC when AC power is applied and can be controlled by RF or IR with the light source powered by the batteries when AC power is not present.","Additionally or alternatively, the input component of the AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb can be one or more sensors that monitor a condition, and monitored information yielded by such sensor(s) can be utilized to effectuate adjustments associated with the light source and the selection of which power source to use and under what conditions. It is to be appreciated that any type of sensor(s) can be utilized in connection with the claimed subject matter. For example, the sensor(s) can be one or more of infrared sensors, light sensors, proximity sensors, magnetic switch sensor, acoustic sensors, voice activated sensor, motion sensors, radar sensors, sonar sensors, carbon monoxide and\/or smoke detectors, thermal sensors, electromagnetic sensors, mechanical sensors, chemical sensors, pressure sensor, RFID tag reader or detection circuit and the like. According to another example, the input component can be a connector, port, etc. that couples to a disparate device, sensor, etc. to receive the input signal. It is also appreciated that any combination of RF, IR, motion or the sensors listed herein can be utilized in connection with the claimed subject matter. It is also appreciated that the light (off, glow, on at low level, on at bright level etc) and the transition between light levels can be controlled by any detectable state of the sensor or sensors. It is also to be appreciated that intelligence in the form of logic, electrical circuitry, microcontrollers, microprocessors, memory devices etc. contained in the bulb can leverage the sensors to monitor patterns of RF, IR or sensor inputs, keep the patterns in memory over time if necessary and adjust individual lights based on the pattern. Thus the AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb has the ability to learn from inputs from its environment and change behavior accordingly.","In an alternate embodiment, the wireless light bulb can take commands from a communication interface from an external source by wired connection over a power distribution network, for example on the AC power lines (X10, INSTEON, Broadband over Power Lines, proprietary communication scheme etc), or wirelessly through a wireless interface (dedicated RF communication link, ZIGBEE, WIFI, ENOCEAN, BLUETOOTH etc). For example, the electric company can control or gather status from AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulbs throughout its power distribution network to remotely offload power usage at times when power demand is high by commanding some portion or the entire distributed network of wireless light bulbs to switchover to battery backup. Rechargeable batteries can be charged for some period of time to store power when power usage is off peak, then be used to off load some of the demand by supplying power for the bulb when power usage is on peak. Non-rechargeable batteries can also be used for emergency power requirements. In an alternate example, the control of wireless light bulbs can be local in a residence or commercial building through a central source controlling building lighting to optimize energy consumption. The control and gathering of status may be done by an intelligent electrical meter, smart meter, and the like. In such a case the meter may directly communicate with one or more wireless light bulbs over an appropriate communication interface using a protocol that allows the wireless light bulbs and meter to exchange information. By way of an example, the wireless light bulb may measure the amount of power consumed over a period of time and an intelligent electrical meter, smart meter, a remote device, and the like, through an intelligent electrical meter, smart meter, and the like (for example via the smart grid), may retrieve that information to provide that information for any purpose. In another example, an intelligent electrical meter, smart meter, a remote device, and the like, through an intelligent electrical meter, smart meter, and the like, may control the wireless light bulb to turn it on, off, set the light intensity level, control which power source or sources are used (battery, AC and\/or a wireless power source), retrieve any information from a wireless light bulb or control any sensor or intelligence present in a wireless light bulb in the lighting installation. In addition to controlling a switchover to battery power, other applications are possible. Information or a record of usage can also be stored and retrieved. The stored data may pertain to power usage however it may also pertain to sensor gathered information. For example, the bulb can contain an occupancy sensor, like a motion sensor, that can record times and levels of occupancy in an area that can later be retrieved.","In embodiments, a building management unit in the form of a separate piece of equipment may communicate with the installed wireless light bulbs with existing power lines, tapping onto existing power lines or through a wireless interface such as a dedicated RF communication interface in residential or commercial buildings. This unit may send commands using one of the possible communication interfaces such that wireless light bulbs in the lighting installation can be programmed, controlled, and information or status can be retrieved for energy control and conservation, emergency functions, for safety and security, for convenience and any other functionality desired by a user. The building management unit may be controlled to implement the desired functionality via any method mentioned herein. By way of an example, the building manager unit with an RF communication interface may communicate to a network of wireless light bulbs that allows it to communicate with any wireless light bulb in the network. The unit may also have an Ethernet interface on the unit and have an IP address assigned to the interface. A software program running on the unit may allow a user to open a web browser and type in the IP address assigned to the unit. A graphical user interface served by the building management unit may open up providing a method for the user to implement the desired functionality. The building management unit may communicate with a an intelligent electrical meter, smart meter, and the like, over an appropriate communication interface using a protocol that allows the building management unit, which controls the installation of wireless light bulbs, and meter to exchange information. For example, the building management unit may communicate over a communication interface with an intelligent electrical meter, smart meter and the like by wired connection over a power distribution network, for example on the AC power lines (X10, INSTEON, Broadband over Power Lines, proprietary communication scheme etc), or wirelessly through a wireless interface (dedicated RF communication link, ZIGBEE, Wi-Fi, ENOCEAN, BLUETOOTH etc). By way of an example, the building management unit may measure the amount of power consumed over a period of time and an intelligent electrical meter, smart meter, a remote device, and the like, through an intelligent electrical meter, smart meter, and the like (for example via the smart grid), may retrieve that information to provide that information for any purpose. In another example, an intelligent electrical meter, smart meter, a remote device, and the like, through an intelligent electrical meter, smart meter, and the like, may control the building management unit to control the lighting installation to turn lights on, off, set the light intensity level, control which power source or sources are used (battery, AC and\/or a wireless power source), retrieve any information from the wireless light bulbs in the lighting installation or control any sensor or intelligence present in the wireless light bulbs in the lighting installation.","In an alternate embodiment, a lighting circuit control unit may be attached to one or more electrical circuits within a residential or commercial building and implement building management unit functionality on the circuit or circuits it is connected to. The lighting circuit control unit may attach electrically to the circuit at any point or communicate through an RF or IR communication interface. It may come in any form that allows it to use those communication interfaces. For example, it can be an RF transceiver with keypad, a hard wired box etc. retrofit into the wall switch, connected elsewhere in the circuit or as a standalone unit. The unit can control all wireless light bulbs it can communicate with or through a network of wireless light bulbs for energy control and conservation, emergency functions, for safety and security, for convenience and any other functionality as desired by a user based on an input from a sensor, time of day clock, human input, etc. Unique or group IDs may be assigned to multiple circuits, individual circuits or individual wireless light bulbs such that a user can control the lighting installation one wireless light bulbs, distinct groups of wireless light bulbs or the entire lighting installation from one or more lighting circuit control units. By way of an example, a wall switch is retrofit with a lighting circuit control unit that is electrically inserted in line with AC power to a lighting circuit consisting of six R30 AC powered battery backed wireless light bulbs inserted into recessed fixtures. The lighting circuit control unit has an LCD display and push buttons that allow a user to scroll through a list of configuration items that can program the wireless light bulbs or a list of status that can be gathered from the lighting circuit working much like a thermostat for the lighting installation. The lighting circuit control unit communicates with the wireless light bulbs using a proprietary communication over power lines method to implement the functionality set by the user. The lighting circuit control unit may communicate with a smart meter over an appropriate communication interface using a protocol that allows the lighting circuit control unit, which controls the installation of wireless light bulbs, and meter to exchange information. For example, the lighting circuit control unit may communicate over a communication interface with an intelligent electrical meter, smart meter and the like by wired connection over a power distribution network, for example on the AC power lines (X10, INSTEON, Broadband over Power Lines, proprietary communication scheme etc), or wirelessly through a wireless interface (dedicated RF communication link, ZIGBEE, Wi-Fi, ENOCEAN, BLUETOOTH etc). By way of an example, the lighting circuit control unit may measure the amount of power consumed over a period of time and an intelligent electrical meter, smart meter, a remote device, and the like, through an intelligent electrical meter, smart meter, and the like (for example via the smart grid), may retrieve that information to provide that information for any purpose. In another example, an intelligent electrical meter, smart meter, a remote device, and the like, through an intelligent electrical meter, smart meter, and the like, may control the lighting circuit control unit to control the lighting circuit to turn lights on, off, set the light intensity level, control which power source or sources are used (battery, AC and\/or a wireless power source), retrieve any information from the wireless light bulbs on the lighting circuit or control any sensor or intelligence present in the wireless light bulbs on the lighting circuit.","In an alternate embodiment, a direct personal control ability exists such that a user may control one or more wireless light bulbs and wireless lighting modules from their computer, handheld, remote control etc. In such a case, there may be a building management unit or larger software control system in place, but direct personal control may allow a user direct control of the lighting that affects that user. It is to be appreciated that the building management unit or larger software control system may contain the intelligence to identify that a user locally changed the configuration and update its configuration appropriately or notify a system administrator of the change implemented locally. The direct personal control ability may allow a user to configure one light or a group of lights to implement a coordinated function. By way of an example, an employee in an office may have a software application running on their computer and an adapter connected to the computer that allows the software application to communicate with the group of lights associated with the employee office and the hallway outside of the employee office. That employee has knowledge of when they will be in their office and when they will not. They may arrive early and leave early during the day, have multiple meetings such that they will not be in the office and so forth. That employee may also have preferences for the lighting in their office. The employee may use the software application to configure the wireless light bulbs and wireless lighting modules in their office and hallway outside of their office for any of the functionality offered by the wireless light bulbs and wireless lighting modules. In this case, the direct personal control system may be implemented using the communication interface from the computer on the employee's desk to the wireless light bulbs and wireless lighting modules. Because the intelligence in the wireless light bulbs and wireless lighting modules is distributed, the employee may configure the units locally no matter what the state of the larger system is.","In embodiments containing a coordinated lighting group, there may be individually addressable lights as well as groups of lights (multicast and broadcast groups). Thus, a light may need to have multiple addresses assigned to it and as such may need to respond to control and return status based on every address assigned to it whether it is an individual address or group address. It is also to be appreciated that multiple individual addresses may be assigned to the same light such that the controlling sources may use different addresses to communicate with a light. By way of an example, direct personal control coming from a user's computer may communicate with a light on a different address than the building management system. This may be done so that there are different levels of access to the bulb from a security perspective. The system administrator may have access to more functionality than the user therefore multiple addresses may be used to define privileges. In some embodiments, a light may listen to commands intended for another lights and respond accordingly. By way of an example, a light may be the master and the other lights in a coordinated lighting group may be slaves. When the master is commanded to implement a daylight harvesting change, for example it is commanded to change its light intensity based on a new configuration, the slave lights may receive that command. After some period of time when the master has completed adjusting its light intensity change, the slave lights will then change their light intensity to also implement the daylight harvesting change. In this manner, the lights may gracefully implement daylight harvesting in a sequence that they will not be adjusting against each other.","In another embodiment, the AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb contains rechargeable batteries. The light source can be powered by AC power, battery power or both. For example, power to the light source can be diode or-ed such that AC power and battery power share the load. The battery power can be charged all of the time or can contain the intelligence to be programmed to charge only when billing rates from the electric company are low. The sharing of the load between AC power and battery power given that the batteries will charge at least some of the time at off peak billing rates from the electric company and the light source will be on for at least some of the time that billing rates are higher or at their peak will result in energy savings and conservation. The bulb can contain the intelligence (microcontroller, microprocessor, real time clock etc.) such that it can be programmed to charge the battery power at the times when the billing rates are at their lowest the energy savings and conservation can be maximized. Thus, the AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb has the ability of \u201cmoving power in time\u201d by storing power at some time and using the power at another time. The AC powered battery embedded bulb may or may not contain a sensor to control operation. The intelligence may use a real time clock and be programmed to use the AC input and charge the batteries during off peak billing times and use battery power during on peak billing times such that there is an overall cost savings in energy usage. By way of an example, the AC powered battery embedded bulb may be programmed for operation based on a Time of Use (TOU) price plan from the energy company. The rechargeable battery capacity may or may not be enough to power the light source for the entire duration of the on peak billing time. In such a case, the intelligence may be able to switch between power sources or control a sharing of the load between battery power and AC input power based on a measurement of battery capacity level, power use from the embedded batteries and from the AC input, by measuring the current draw or power consumed from one or more of the sources of power that may power the bulb and adjusting the amount of power consumed from the one or more sources, such as by PWM or other known method of controlling the power consumed from a source or any other measurable parameter that allows for an optimization for cost or minimize power consumption of the combined use of embedded batteries and AC input power.","In embodiments, the electric company may implement load shedding or load leveling using AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulbs, building management units and\/or lighting control units throughout its power distribution network by remotely offloading power usage at times when power demand is high by commanding some portion or the entire distributed network of wireless light bulbs to switchover to battery power. In some embodiments, the wireless light bulbs, building management units and\/or lighting control units may receive a load control signal from the electric company or end user to implement load shedding. The control may force a reduction in power consumption from the AC input by either reducing power usage (by dimming light levels for example) or by switching some portion of or all of the power source to battery power. In some embodiments, the wireless light bulbs, building management units and\/or lighting control units may respond to supply conditions to implement demand response during peak or critical times or based on market prices by adjusting usage or by switching some portion or all of the power source to battery power. In some embodiments, load shedding or demand response may happen without an explicit command from the electric company. By way of an example, the power source for the wireless light bulb may be shared by the AC input and embedded rechargeable batteries all of the time. The rechargeable batteries may be charging all of the time or only during off peak times. Thus, during peak times, by having the AC input and rechargeable batteries share the load, the average power drawn from the AC input will be significantly lower during peak times if the AC input supplied all of the power. In alternate embodiments, the embedded batteries may always be the power source and the AC input power is used to charge the battery. Thus, the power required from the AC input will only be as much as is required to charge the battery and at its peak will only be as much as the battery charging cycle requires. The functionality to manage power and distribute the load during peak times may be programmed into an intelligent wireless light bulb and not require an external command to enter the load shedding mode. The intelligence may also be embedded in the wireless light bulb to receive commands to perform further load shedding functions if needed. For example, the percentage load from the AC input and from the embedded battery may be programmable based on time of day if there is a particular knowledge of when the peak demand times are, the light intensity level may be programmable to further reduce power consumption, a sensor such as a motion sensor may be enabled to switchover to occupancy sensing to reduce power consumption etc.","In alternate embodiments, the AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb contains rechargeable batteries and can return power to the grid. The rechargeable battery is charged when AC is on or can be programmed to charge at specific times or under specific conditions. The bulb can return power to grid when the bulb is off or when power can be returned because power stored exceeds power usage by some level. The result, as more bulbs are installed, is a distributed power network that allows power to be \u201cstored\u201d in every home, office building, retails space etc. that the bulbs are installed in and the stored energy can be returned to the grid when needed by the electric company. Backup storage capabilities that can be used to feed the grid during peaks in energy demand can offload the burden of power generation on the grid and can provide revenue or savings on the energy bill to end users. It is to be appreciated that any form of wireless power can be present in the bulb to harvest energy from the environment and charge the embedded batteries to form an energy generation source to send power from the environment to the grid. In some embodiments, the electric company may perform load shedding or load leveling by commanding an end user to use some local stored energy or the electric company may make use of the returned stored power to meet peak demand requirements. This may be done independently as determined by intelligence in the wireless light bulb, may be commanded by the user or may be commanded by the electric company (for example through a load control signal or a new type of signal that triggers the return of stored power to the grid).","In another embodiment, battery backup is built into AC powered recessed fixtures or down light assemblies for residential or industrial lighting. The battery backup can be switched over to if there is a dropout of AC power or some other characteristic is detected that makes AC power no longer desirable to use (brownout conditions, electrical surges, overvoltage conditions, voltage sag or flickers, line noise, frequency variations, switching transients, harmonic distortion, etc.) to the fixture for emergency or safety applications or for energy efficiency purposes. In addition, a sensor or RF control may be built into the fixture or down light assembly such that they can be wireless controlled or programmed. For example, an RF receiver can be built into the fixture or down light assembly. In alternate embodiments, the fixtures or down light assemblies may contain and use as a power source any combination of AC power and\/or wireless power sources mentioned herein.","In another illustrative embodiment, a version of the wireless light bulb may provide for AC powered battery embedded LED recessed fixture  applications.

In the illustrated embodiment, the AC powered battery embedded LED recessed fixture  includes a housing , an AC input , a printed circuit for AC\/DC conversion and battery management functions , a battery holder , a printed circuit for a motion sensor circuit and LED drive circuitry , a plurality of LEDs  and a motion sensor . In an alternate embodiment, the AC input is not used and the unit is solely powered by the embedded batteries thus elements  and  are not present or are not used.","By way of an example, an LED based 2\u00d72, 2\u00d74, and the like fluorescent replacement wireless light bulb may be designed with rechargeable or non-rechargeable batteries embedded and a circuit that makes the LED replacement bulb look like a fluorescent bulb to the ballast controller or otherwise allows the LED replacement bulb to operate with the ballast in place. An LED based 2\u00d72, 2\u00d74 and the like fluorescent replacement wireless light bulb with batteries embedded then may allow for the replacement of a fluorescent bulb with an LED battery backed bulb. This may allow a retrofit for battery backup for the consumer such that rather than incur the expense of the battery backed ballast controller (or battery backup elsewhere) and an electrician to do the electrical work to wire it in, the retrofit with battery backup can be done by the replacement of the fluorescent bulb. In alternate embodiments, the LED based 2\u00d72, 2\u00d74, and the like fluorescent replacement bulb may contain and use as a power source any combination of AC power and\/or wireless power sources mentioned herein.

In some embodiments, the wireless light bulb may replace a fluorescent lamp or fixture that is connected to a resistive, reactive, or electronic ballast in which case the wireless light bulb may also contain circuitry to take the output of the ballast and convert it to DC power suitable for the light source and wireless control. By way of an example, a version of the wireless light bulb containing an RF receiver and a motion sensor may be designed into a housing that fits into a 2\u00d72 ceiling grid. The wireless light bulb may also contain rechargeable batteries, an AC to DC converter and ballast conditioning circuit to connect to a ballast in the case where the wireless light bulb is a retrofit of a fluorescent fixture, and the like. It is to be appreciated that the ballast conditioning circuit may operate the wireless light bulb whether the wireless light bulb is connected to a ballast or not. There may also be intelligence (microcontroller, microprocessor, integrated circuit etc.) inside the wireless light bulb such that is can be programmed to draw power from the AC input, from the rechargeable batteries or both. The intelligence may use a real time clock and be programmed to use the AC input and charge the batteries during off peak billing times and use battery power during on peak billing times such that there is an overall cost savings in energy usage. The unit may be programmed for operation based on a Time of Use (TOU) price plan from the energy company. The rechargeable battery capacity may or may not be enough to power the light source for the entire duration of the on peak billing time. In such a case, the intelligence may be able to switch between or control a sharing of the load between battery power and AC input power based on a measurement of battery capacity level, power use from the embedded batteries and from the AC input or any other measurable parameter that allows for an optimization for cost or minimizes power consumption of the combined use of embedded batteries and AC input power.","Alternate embodiments of the wireless light bulb may be designed with a housing that allows installation in a 2 or 4 pin plug-in fluorescent socket. In this embodiment, the housing may contain any of the features of a wireless light bulb and is designed with a 2 or 4 pin plug that allows it to be installed in a plug in fluorescent light fixture.

In such a case where electrical current does not flow between the fixture and the wireless light bulb, the wireless light bulb may contain one or more wireless power sources that provides power to the bulb. The wireless light bulb may contain one or more wireless control sources. In some embodiments, the wireless light bulb may replace a fluorescent light that is connected to a resistive, reactive or electronic ballast in which case the wireless light bulb may also contain circuitry to take the output of the ballast and convert it to DC power suitable for the light source and wireless control.

It is to be appreciated that any power conditioning circuitry required to convert the AC input from the 2 or 4 pin connector to the appropriate input for the wireless light bulb will reside in the socket. In some embodiments, bulbs other than a wireless light bulb, for example any off the shelf incandescent, LED or CFL bulb, may plug into the 2 or 4 pin adapter. In such cases, the adapter may contain any form of wireless control, wireless power, intelligence or networking capability to provide wireless light bulb functionality to the installed off the shelf bulb.","Alternate embodiments of the wireless light bulb may be installed into a housing that allows installation in a fluorescent troffer, high bay fixtures, layin fixtures, strip fixtures, under cabinet fixtures, wall mount fixtures, wrap around fixtures, and the like. In this embodiment, the housing may contain one or more sockets such that wireless light bulbs in any standard size bulb (e.g. PAR30, PAR38, A19, R30, MR16 etc) or non-standard size bulb form factor may plug in. By way of an example, the housing may contain multiple Edison sockets such that PAR30 bulbs may be screwed in. Thus, with a housing that supports wireless light bulbs that screw or plug in, any type of wireless light bulb may be installed in the fixture. The housing may also have a connection to an AC input, wiring from the input to the sockets and any external circuitry to condition the AC input for use by the wireless light bulbs. In an alternate embodiment, a fluorescent retrofit LED bulb may be designed to be a retrofit in fluorescent tube applications where it is not designed in traditional fluorescent tube housing. A flat housing may be designed that contains LEDs and electronics down the length of the housing with pins allowing it to be installed in a socket for fluorescent tubes. In some embodiments, the shape of the flat housing and orientation of the LEDs may be such that two of the flat housings may be installed in a dual troffer such that they are geometrically opposed. In such a case, when both fluorescent LED retrofit bulbs are installed, there is an even pattern of LEDs installed in the troffer. By way of an example, two L-shaped fluorescent retrofit LED bulbs are designed such that the bottom part of the L contains an array of LEDs. When the two L-shaped fluorescent retrofit LED bulbs are installed, the two arrays of LEDs fill the entire space to provide the appearance of evenly spaced LEDs in the housing. It is to be appreciated that any shape of LED bulb and number of LED bulbs may be designed to fit into the space of a fluorescent troffer.

Any number of light levels may be implemented in the wireless light bulb. An RF remote or other control method sends commands to change light levels in the wireless light bulb. By way of an example, an AC powered wireless light bulb is designed with an RF receiver inside. An RF remote with a single push button allows control of the light levels. From off, the first time the button is pushed, the light output goes to a low brightness level. The second time the button is pressed, the light output goes to a medium brightness level. The third time the button is pressed, the light output goes to a high brightness level. The fourth time the button is pressed, the light turns off. Any number of light levels, any brightness levels or sequence of brightness levels or method of control is possible. In an alternate embodiment, the number of light levels, brightness levels and sequence of brightness levels may be programmable by the user based on user preference. In alternate embodiments, the \u201cThree Way\u201d light bulb may respond to a switch on a lamp such that there are four levels\u2014off and three light intensity levels. When the switch is turned once, the light intensity level goes from its first light intensity state to its next. By way of an example, the \u201cThree Way\u201d light bulb starts in the off position. When the switch is turned to the next position, the bulb detects the switch transition and changes the light intensity level from off to on at the lowest intensity level. When the switch is turned again to the next position, the bulb detects the switch transition and changes the light form the lowest intensity level to the next higher intensity level and so on. It is to be appreciated that the number of light levels, brightness levels and sequence of brightness levels that the \u201cThree Way\u201d light bulb may have in any of its embodiments may be factory set or programmable by the user based on user preference.","A plurality of use cases are possible in the use of AC power, wireless power sources and any combination thereof. In one use case, an AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb contains an RF energy harvesting circuit.

In an alternate use case, a PAR30 type battery embedded wireless light bulb may contain a wireless power transmission receiver circuit and rechargeable batteries. The wireless power transmission circuit may allow the batteries to be charged off line, then have the wireless light bulb returned to the light socket for use.","In another illustrative embodiment, a battery embedded wireless light bulb may contain solar cells on its surface and rechargeable batteries to power the wireless control and light source. With reference to , illustrated is a perspective view of an embodiment of a battery embedded solar recharged PAR30 wireless light bulb . In the illustrated embodiment, the battery embedded solar recharged PAR30 wireless light bulb  includes a housing , one or more solar cells , a printed circuit for interfacing to the solar cell or cells and battery management functions, motion and light sensor circuitry , a battery holder , a plurality of LEDs  and a motion sensor  and light sensor.

Note that there is some power consumption from the circuitry on the PCB to charge the batteries, for the motion detector, for the LED drive circuit etc., so it is to be appreciated that the power consumption and on time the battery embedded solar recharged PAR30 wireless light bulb can sustain every evening is equal to the amount of recharge that can be done by the solar cells and rechargeable batteries. It is to be appreciated that any form of wireless control or wireless power mentioned herein can be used in conjunction with this embodiment. It is to be appreciated that any size and shape of the solar cells can be used and they be placed on the housing in any manner conceivable. It is also to be appreciated that any size or type of rechargeable battery can be used in conjunction with this embodiment. In an alternate embodiment, there is a method to replace the batteries designed in, thus if the amount of on time exceeds the recharge rate, the rechargeable batteries can be removed, recharged to full or close to full capacity and then returned to the wireless light bulb. In this use case, the motion sensor provides for a highly efficient use of the power consumption such that for a limited amount of recharging (e.g. small solar cells used on the bulb), an appropriate amount of light can be provided for short periods of time such that the average power consumption is low over time, but power consumption is high for brief periods of time only when the light is needed.","In references to battery embedded, AC powered battery embedded, or any combination of power source wireless light bulbs, it is to be appreciated the chargeable and rechargeable batteries can be replaced by any energy storage element mentioned herein. For example, a battery embedded wireless light bulb can be a fuel cell embedded wireless light bulb. An AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb can use one or more super capacitors as a power source to power a glow mode in certain applications.","An external light socket adapter may be designed with batteries embedded to battery backup any kind of light bulb that plug into a socket. The external light socket adapter can be designed as an adapter for any type of socket to provide the described functionality for any of the plurality of bulb types mentioned herein. By way of an example, an adapter plugs into an Edison socket and also has an Edison socket that accepts an A19 type bulb. An incandescent, compact fluorescent, and LED type light bulb can plug into the socket adapter. The socket adapter may contain embedded rechargeable or non-rechargeable batteries, the circuitry to switch over to the embedded batteries, an AC\/DC converter, a DC\/AC inverter, a charging circuit to charge the embedded batteries, and the intelligence to implement a switchover between AC power and backup power.

It is to be appreciated that the same functionality provided by the UPS wireless light bulb mentioned herein may be implemented by the external light socket adapter and a standard bulb plugged in.","An AC outlet adapter or an AC outlet replacement may be designed with batteries embedded to provide power to any kind of electrical device that plugs into the outlet. By way of an example, an adapter may plug into an AC wall outlet and also have an AC socket that an electrical device that plugs into an AC outlet can plug into. In this example, the adapter that plugs into an AC wall outlet may have more than one AC socket that electrical devices may plug into. In an alternate example a cable with an AC plug on one end and the adapter at the end of the cable may be designed similar to an electrical extension cord or power strip where the assembly adapter at the end may contain the embedded batteries.

In alternate embodiments, the AC powered device of any kind may be designed with the batteries embedded inside the device to provide power to the device. In alternate embodiments, an external light socket adapter may be designed with the batteries embedded inside the device to provide power to any light source or device connected to it. The AC powered device, socket adapter, outlet adapter or outlet replacement may contain embedded rechargeable or non-rechargeable batteries, the circuitry to switch over to the embedded batteries, an AC\/DC converter, a DC\/AC inverter, a charging circuit to charge the embedded batteries, and the intelligence to implement a switchover between AC power and battery power. In embodiments, power may be switched over to battery if there is a dropout of AC power or some other characteristic is detected that makes AC power no longer desirable to use (brownout conditions, electrical surges, overvoltage conditions, voltage sag or flickers, line noise, frequency variations, switching transients, harmonic distortion, etc.) to the outlet, socket or AC powered device. Power may be switched to AC power, battery power or both power sources may be used for emergency or safety applications, for energy efficiency, for energy cost savings or peak load reduction (load leveling) purposes. In addition, a sensor or RF control may be built into the AC powered device, socket adapter, outlet adapter or outlet replacement such that they can be wireless controlled, status can be gathered from it, commands may be sent to switch to a different power source, it may be remotely programmed, and the like. For example, an RF transceiver can be built into the AC powered device, socket adapter, outlet adapter or outlet replacement and a device such as a wall switch, remote control, RF transceiver that can plug into a computer and be controlled by a software program, etc. may communicate with the AC powered device, socket adapter, outlet adapter or outlet replacement. In alternate embodiments, the AC powered device, socket adapter, outlet adapter or outlet replacement may contain and use as a power source any combination of AC power and\/or wireless power sources mentioned herein. In alternate embodiments, an AC circuit with battery embedded device performing the same function of the AC outlet adapter with embedded batteries may be installed to support multiple AC outlets or connected AC powered devices by inserting the device in-line at the point of entry for AC power for that electrical circuit. By way of an example, in a residence, the battery embedded device can be installed in-line after the circuit breaker that can provide battery power on multiple AC drops such that the embedded batteries inside the device may supply power to all of the devices that may be drawing AC power on the circuit in a manner as described for the AC powered device, external light socket adapter, AC outlet adapter or AC outlet replacement.","A wall switch or lighting control component of any kind may be designed with batteries embedded to allow battery power to be the power source for the lighting circuit or any AC powered device connected to the circuit controlled by the wall switch (for example a device plugged into an AC outlet controlled by the switch). The wall switch or lighting control component may be designed any size or shape for any type of wall switch or lighting control component to provide the described functionality for any of the plurality of bulb types mentioned herein. By way of an example, a wall switch with three switches may be used to control multiple light sockets or wall outlets in a residential or commercial application. In addition to the three switches, internally the housing of the wall switch may have embedded batteries. An incandescent, compact fluorescent, LED type light bulb or AC powered device of any kind may derive power from the AC input, embedded batteries or both. It is to be appreciated that any size or shape wall switch or lighting control component may have any size or shape embedded batteries. The wall switch or lighting control component may contain embedded rechargeable or non-rechargeable batteries, the circuitry to switch over to the embedded batteries, an AC\/DC converter, a DC\/AC inverter, a charging circuit to charge the embedded batteries, and the intelligence to implement a switchover between AC power and battery power. In embodiments, this function may match that of the UPS wireless light bulb but with the batteries external to the bulb such that any standard bulb could be used. It is to be appreciated that the same functionality provided by the UPS wireless light bulb mentioned herein may be implemented by the wall switch or lighting control component and any type of bulb plugged in or AC powered device connected. In addition, monitoring the sense of the wall switch (open or closed) and the ability to monitor whether AC power is present and acceptable before the switch allows intelligence in the switch to select the power source. For example, if the switch is closed and AC power is not present, the wall switch may be able to switchover to battery power because it may assume there is a power outage. In addition, intelligence in the wall switch may need to detect changes in the state of switch or the AC power input to switch back over to AC power when it is present and acceptable again and may need electrical circuitry, a relay, an optoisolator etc. to allow the sharing of the load by power sources or the switching from one power source to another power source. In alternate embodiments, additional intelligence, wireless controls and wireless power sources may be embedded in the wall switch or lighting control component to implement any of the functionality mentioned herein. By way of an example, a wall switch plate with two positions for wall switches may be replaced with a wall switch plate with one switch installed and an embedded power source such as one or more rechargeable or non-rechargeable batteries in the position where the second switch may be installed. In an alternate example, both switches may be there, but the rechargeable or non-rechargeable batteries may occupy any available space within the depth of the switch plate. In an alternate embodiment, there may be a battery door, battery tray or custom hot pluggable battery that may allow a user to replace the embedded battery or remove to test and replace. It is to be appreciated that the unit, a UPS wall switch, may be designed in any size, shape or with any electrical interface necessary to provide the UPS functions as described herein for the lights and\/or devices on the lighting and\/or electrical circuits the one or more switches control. It is also to be appreciated that any type of switch may be replaced such as a toggle switch, push button switch, dimmer switch and the like such that the UPS functionality may be incorporated. In an alternate example, the grid shifting functions mentioned herein may be implemented using the battery embedded wall switch plate such that intelligence built into the embedded wall switch replacement may store and use power from the grid for optimal use for power savings, cost savings, safety and security or convenience.","In embodiments, an external light socket adapter, AC outlet adapter, an AC outlet replacement, an AC powered device, an AC circuit with embedded battery device designed with batteries embedded, wall switch or lighting control component and the like, may include intelligence (microcontroller, microprocessor, integrated circuit etc.) designed in such that it may be programmed to draw power from the AC input, from the rechargeable batteries, or both. In alternate embodiments, an external light socket adapter, AC outlet adapter, AC outlet replacement, AC powered device, AC circuit with embedded battery device, wall switch or lighting control component and the like, may contain and use as a power source any combination of AC power and\/or wireless power sources (batteries, fuel cells, super capacitors, solar cells, RF energy harvesting circuit etc.) mentioned herein and the included intelligence may be used to make decisions when and how to use the power sources. The intelligence may use a real time clock and be programmed to use the AC input and charge the batteries during off peak billing times and use battery power during on peak billing times such that there is an overall cost savings in energy usage. The intelligence may use a real time clock and be programmed in any way to implement load leveling such as to use the AC input and charge the batteries during off peak times and use battery power during on peak times such that there is an reduction in energy usage during peak times. Thus, the external light socket adapter, AC outlet adapter, AC outlet replacement, AC powered device, AC circuit with embedded battery device, wall switch or lighting control component and the like have the ability of \u201cmoving power in time\u201d by storing power at some time and using the power at another time. By way of example, the device may be programmed for operation based on a Time of Use (TOU) price plan from the energy company. The rechargeable battery capacity may or may not be enough to power the device plugged in for the entire duration of the on peak billing time. In such a case, the intelligence may be able to switch between or control a sharing of the load between battery power and AC input power based on a measurement of battery capacity level, power use from the embedded batteries and from the AC input or any other measurable parameter that allows for an optimization for cost or minimize power consumption of the combined use of embedded batteries and AC input power. The control and gathering of status from an external light socket adapter, an AC outlet adapter, an AC outlet replacement, an AC powered device, an AC circuit with embedded battery device, wall switch or lighting control component and the like, may be done by an intelligent electrical meter, smart meter, control software and the like. In such a case the meter or control software may directly communicate with one or more of the adapters or devices over an appropriate communication interface using a protocol that allows the adapters or devices and smart meter or control software to exchange information. By way of an example, the adapters or devices may measure the amount of power consumed over a period of time and an intelligent electrical meter, smart meter, a remote device, control software and the like, through an intelligent electrical meter, smart meter, and the like (for example via the smart grid), may retrieve that information to provide that information for any purpose. In another example, an intelligent electrical meter, smart meter, a remote device, control software and the like, through an intelligent electrical meter, smart meter, and the like, may control the adapters or devices to turn them on, off, set the light intensity level, control which power source or sources are used (battery, AC and\/or a wireless power source), retrieve any information from adapters or devices or control any sensor or intelligence present in adapters or devices. In addition to controlling a switchover to battery power, other applications are possible. Information or a record of usage from each power source may be stored and retrieved. The stored data may pertain to power usage, however it may also pertain to sensor gathered information. For example, an external light socket adapter, an AC outlet adapter, an AC outlet replacement, an AC powered device, an AC circuit with embedded battery device, wall switch or lighting control component and the like may contain an occupancy sensor, like a motion sensor, that can record times and levels of occupancy in an area that can later be retrieved.","In embodiments of an external light socket adapter, AC outlet adapter, an AC outlet replacement, an AC powered device, an AC circuit with embedded battery device designed with batteries embedded, wall switch or lighting control component and the like, the electric company may implement load shedding or load leveling using these components throughout its power distribution network by remotely offloading power usage at times when power demand is high by commanding some portion or the entire distributed network of components to switchover to battery power. In some embodiments, the external light socket adapter, AC outlet adapter, an AC outlet replacement, an AC powered device, an AC circuit with embedded battery device designed with batteries embedded, wall switch or lighting control component and the like may receive a load control signal from the electric company or end user to implement load shedding. The control may force a reduction in power consumption from the AC input by either reducing power usage (by turning AC powered devices such as appliances off for example) or by switching some portion of or all of the power source to battery power. In some embodiments, external light socket adapter, AC outlet adapter, an AC outlet replacement, an AC powered device, an AC circuit with embedded battery device designed with batteries embedded, wall switch or lighting control component and the like, may respond to supply conditions (demand response) during peak or critical times or based on market prices by adjusting usage or by switching some portion or all of the power source to battery power. In some embodiments, load shedding or demand response may happen without an explicit command from the electric company. By way of an example, a clothes dryer may be plugged into an AC outlet adapter with the capabilities mentioned herein. In response to a load shedding command, the AC outlet adapter may turn off power to the clothes dryer or alternatively transfer some or all of the load to the battery power source. In an alternate example, when run during peak billing times, the AC outlet adapter the clothes dryer is plugged into may draw some or all of the load from the battery power source to reduce the cost of usage of the clothes dryer. In some embodiments, the electric company may perform load shedding by commanding an end user to use some local stored energy or the electric company may make use of the returned stored power to meet peak demand requirements. This may be done independently as determined by intelligence in the external light socket adapter, AC outlet adapter, an AC outlet replacement, AC powered device, an AC circuit with embedded battery device designed with batteries embedded, wall switch or lighting control component and the like, may be commanded by the user or may be commanded by the electric company (for example through a load control signal or a new type of signal that triggers the return of stored power to the grid). In embodiments of an external light socket adapter, AC outlet adapter, an AC outlet replacement, an AC powered device, an AC circuit with embedded battery device designed with batteries embedded, wall switch or lighting control component and the like that may use an AC power input and embedded battery power with an intelligent, programmable controller may also contain grid tie inverter circuitry to allow the stored battery power to be converted to AC. The grid tie inverter circuitry may allow the external light socket adapter, AC outlet adapter, an AC outlet replacement, an AC powered device, an AC circuit with embedded battery device designed with batteries embedded, wall switch or lighting control component and the like to be directly connected to the grid and to supply power back to the grid. The grid tie inverter may allow stored battery power to be used locally or to be sold back to the utility in the case that there is surplus power. The control of the return of energy to the grid may be based on battery capacity level, time of day, the (TOU) billing plan from the energy company, commands received over the communication interface to return or stop returning energy to the grid either from local intelligence (intelligent electrical meter, smart meter, and the like) or from the energy company, known or learned energy consumption patterns where the additional energy may be needed or any other reason that it may be desired to return energy to the grid.","In embodiments of an external light socket adapter, AC outlet adapter, an AC outlet replacement, an AC powered device, an AC circuit with embedded battery device designed with batteries embedded, wall switch or lighting control component and the like, a function similar to the UPS light bulb may exist such that there is circuitry inside the device that may detect that AC power is no longer present (power failure) or some other characteristic that makes AC power no longer desirable to use (brownout conditions, electrical surges, overvoltage conditions, voltage sag or flickers, line noise, frequency variations, switching transients, harmonic distortion etc.) at the device power input. In this case the device may switch over to battery power automatically to power the control circuitry and to continue providing power to the device. This application, the uninterruptable power supply external light socket adapter, AC outlet adapter, an AC outlet replacement, an AC powered device, an AC circuit with embedded battery device designed with batteries embedded, wall switch or lighting control component and the like, provides power during a power outage using the embedded battery power source. Additional intelligence may be designed into the device to provide features or extend the amount of time usable power may be available when powered by the embedded battery power source. The device may also measure the impedance, resistance, and\/or capacitance across the AC power input and return or may measure any other electrical characteristic of the AC power input and return to determine whether the controlling switch or breaker is open or closed (or if electricity has been turned off at any point up to the AC input of the device). By way of an example, if the controlling switch or breaker is open, there may be a high impedance detected across the input AC power and return. If the controlling switch or breaker is closed, there may be a measureable impedance, resistance and\/or capacitance or electrical characteristic different from when the controlling switch or breaker is open. A threshold may be set in the device such that if the measurement is above or below the threshold, the switch or breaker is closed, and if the measurement is on the opposite side of the threshold, the switch or breaker is open. The device may be controlled by the state of the controlling switch or breaker (on or off), but may also detect the condition when the controlling switch or breaker is closed but AC input power is not present or is not acceptable and may be able to switch over to the rechargeable or non-rechargeable batteries that are embedded as the power source. In some embodiments, the UPS light bulb may perform an impedance discontinuity check to determine if the controlling switch or breaker is open or closed. In some embodiments, the device may generate a signal onto the line and monitor the electrical response of the line to determine if the response indicates an open circuit that may be indicative of a switch or breaker open in the lighting circuit. By way of an example, the device may perform a function typical of a time domain reflectometer by generating a short rise time pulse at the connection to input and monitor the input for a reflected signal that would be indicative of an open circuit. If the reflected signal exceeds a set threshold, it may indicate an open circuit. In some embodiments, the device may need to learn where such a threshold should be set. The device may be installed in many variations of power distributions circuits where the amount or type of wiring to the switch or breaker may vary and where there may be many other sources of loads on the circuit (such as other devices, multiple switches or controls etc.) therefore it may have to adjust its detection circuitry to operate properly. It is to be appreciated that the setting of the threshold may be done automatically by the device or manually by a user through any process that may allow the device to be set to a threshold where one side of the threshold indicates the switch or breaker is open and the other side of the threshold indicates the switch or breaker is closed. It is to be appreciated that when the switch sense functionality is implemented, the switch or breaker may still be able to turn on and off power to the device even when running off of the embedded battery power source because the device may be able to determine if the switch is on or off and apply power or not apply power to the device based on the switch position. In such a case, the switch sense circuitry may still need to be powered along with any other necessary circuitry to implement this function even when the device is not being powered.","In an illustrative embodiment shown in , the block diagram shows an example AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb system  that may use an AC power input and embedded battery power with an intelligent, programmable controller to provide cost savings, security and convenience benefits to a lighting installation. In the illustrated embodiment, the AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb system  may include an AC\/DC converter , a charging circuit with rechargeable batteries , power selection and conditioning circuitry , an intelligent, programmable time of use and power source\/charging controller , a light source or load  and a communication interface , and the like. The AC input may be connected to the AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb system  by a light socket, wall outlet, terminal block, connector, hardwired connection or any common connection that a device requiring AC power may have to an AC power input. The AC input block may contain a transformer, line cap, fuse, inrush limiter or other type of power circuitry commonly found at the input of an AC\/DC converter or an AC powered device. The output of the AC\/DC converter  may be a regulated DC source such as a DC\/DC converter circuit. It may be a constant current source to the load for example to provide constant current to a chain of LEDs in series. In some embodiments there may be multiple circuits at the output of the AC\/DC converter such that one circuit may provide a power source for low current draw circuitry such as the an intelligent, programmable time of use and power source\/charging controller  and communication interface  and a second circuit may provide a power source for high current draw circuitry such as the light source or load . It is to be appreciated that any number power sources may be created at the output of the AC\/DC converter to meet the needs of the application.","The output of the AC\/DC converter may be connected to a charging circuit with rechargeable batteries . In one embodiment, the charging circuit includes an integrated circuit, such as a Microchip MCP73838 battery charge management controller with some external components to monitor and charge one or more Li-Ion rechargeable batteries embedded in the AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb system . It is to be appreciated that any charging circuit or type of rechargeable battery may be used in the AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb system . The intelligent, programmable time of use and power source\/charging controller  may be a microcontroller, microprocessor, integrated circuit, electrical circuit or the like. In the embodiment using a MCP73838 and Li-Ion batteries, a microcontroller such as the FREESCALE SEMICONDUCTOR MC68HC908QT microcontroller may be used to monitor the charge status of the Li-Ion batteries, control the charge current to the Li-Ion batteries, put the charging circuit in standby mode, detect when charging is complete, detect a battery temperature fault, start a timer to time the duration of charging or any other status or control function relevant to charging circuitry or rechargeable batteries.","Power selection and conditioning circuitry  may be used to select the power source for the internal circuitry and light source or load . The power selector and conditioning circuitry  may be configured to select AC power as the power source, the embedded batteries as the power source with the selection controlled by the intelligent, programmable time of use and power source\/charging controller , and the like. In one embodiment, the selection may be done with a pair of MOSFETs that can be controlled by the controller such that either the AC source is selected or the embedded battery power source is selected. With the addition of diodes, the AC source and embedded battery power source may share the load of the light source or load . In an alternate embodiment, the selection of power source may be done automatically with a single MOSFET and a Schottky diode such that if the AC source is present, the power source will automatically be the AC source however if the AC source is not present, the power source will automatically switch to the embedded battery power source. The Schottky diode provides protection to prevent reverse current from flowing to the AC power source. When the AC power source is present the embedded battery may or may not be in a charging mode. In another alternate embodiment, there is an additional wireless power source on the AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb system  that may provide a power source or battery charging source (energy harvesting methods such as solar cells, wireless power transfer, capturing radio frequency energy etc.). In this case, the power selection and conditioning circuitry  would be expanded to allow for selection and use of all of the power sources. It is to be appreciated that any number of wireless power sources may be used in conjunction with the claimed subject matter.","In one embodiment, the light source or load  may be one or more LEDs. The power selection and conditioning circuitry  may also include any driving circuit required to power the light source or load . In the embodiment where LEDs are used as the light source and the one or more LEDs are arranged in series, the AC power source or embedded battery power source may require an LED driver circuit at the output of the power selection and conditioning circuitry  to generate a constant current source or to generate the required DC voltage to turn on all of the LEDs in the series. In an alternate embodiment, the output of the AC\/DC converter may have the proper characteristics to drive the LEDs, however the embedded battery power source may require an LED driver circuit to generate a constant current source and\/or to step of the DC voltage to the required DC voltage to turn on all of the LEDs in the series. In alternate embodiments, the light source may be a compact fluorescent lamp or fluorescent lamp and the block diagram shown constitutes an electronic ballast integrated into the lamp. In this case, there may also be an inverter circuit (DC\/AC circuit) in the power selection and conditioning circuitry  to create the proper starting and operating electrical condition for the fluorescent light source. In alternate embodiments the load may be an external light socket adapter or a device connected to an AC outlet adapter or an AC outlet replacement. In any of these embodiments, there may be a DC\/AC inverter circuit to create the proper AC output power for the attached device. In some embodiments, the AC\/DC converter may only be used to charge the batteries and power local circuitry. The AC power source may be switched to the load via a relay, solid stated device, or other switching device or the embedded battery power source may be selected by the intelligent, programmable time of use and power source\/charging controller  to supply power to the load. In the case where the embedded battery power source is a chosen power source, the DC\/AC inverter would take the embedded battery DC output and convert to AC power to create the proper AC output power for the attached device. In some embodiments, there may be a very large, super or ultra capacitor in or before the power selection and conditioning circuitry  for energy storage in addition to the rechargeable batteries. This may take advantage of some characteristics of capacitors to offset limitations in rechargeable batteries such as the fast charging time of capacitors.","In the illustrated embodiment, an intelligent, programmable time of use and power source\/charging controller , a light source or load  and a communication interface  may be used to control the operation of the AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb system . In the embodiment containing a MC68HC908QT microcontroller and an LED light source, the microcontroller may be used to control the light source based on firmware programmed into flash memory on the microcontroller. The microcontroller may control the light source to turn it on or off, control the intensity of one or more LEDs via pulse-width modulation or other methods to control the current through the light source to provide power savings, provide dimming functionality, multiple light levels, a glow function, and so on, control which power source or sources are used (battery, AC and\/or a wireless power source), control state changes based on time of day, set specific on times, off times and brightness levels based on billing rates from the power company at different times of the day (for example based on time of use, TOU billing plans), automatic shut-off times or timers, automatic turn on times or timers, change color or may be programmed in substantially any manner to control the light source. The microcontroller may also control the selection of the power source or sources based on a program that can set state and change state based on the inputs to the microcontroller. The microcontroller may also be used to gather status on any of the power sources, the light source or the usage there of. For example, with additional circuitry necessary to gather the information, the microcontroller may record power usage, temperature of the components in the system, battery capacity level, light output, light color etc.","A communication interface  may be used by an external computer-related entity, either hardware, software (e.g., in execution), and\/or firmware to communicate with the intelligent, programmable time of use and power source\/charging controller . The external entity may use the communication interface such that the intelligence in the AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb system  in the lighting installation may be programmed, controlled and information or status can be retrieved for energy control and conservation, emergency functions, for safety and security, for convenience and any other functionality desired by a user. It is to be appreciated that the AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb system  may contain processing resources and computer program such that it can implement a wide range of functionality or the AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb system  may contain only a few functions and the processing resources and computer program reside in the external entity. In this way the intelligence may either be distributed in the AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulbs that are installed or be centralized in the external computer-related entity.","It is to be appreciated that the AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb system  may be designed in any size or shape housing to meet the requirements of any standard size bulb (e.g. PAR30, PAR38, A19, R30, MR16 etc), non-standard size bulb, fixture, compact fluorescent bulb, fluorescent bulb or lamp (e.g. T4, T5, T8, circular etc.) or down light assembly (e.g. recessed fixtures, fluorescent fixtures or down light fixtures for residential, commercial or industrial lighting), or the like. It is also to be appreciated that the AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb system  may be designed in any size or shape housing to meet the requirements of any external light socket adapter, AC outlet adapter, an AC outlet replacement or an AC circuit with embedded battery device designed with batteries embedded application.","In an illustrative embodiment shown in , the block diagram shows an example AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb system that may use an AC power input and embedded battery power with an intelligent, programmable controller but also contains grid tie inverter circuitry to allow the stored battery power to be converted to AC. The grid tie inverter circuitry may allow the AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb system to be directly connected to the grid and to supply power back to the grid. The grid tie inverter may allow stored battery power to be used locally or to be sold back to the utility in the case that there is surplus power. In the illustrated embodiment, the grid tied AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb system  may include an AC\/DC converter , a charging circuit with rechargeable batteries , power selection and conditioning circuitry , an intelligent, programmable time of use and power source\/charging controller , a light source or load , a communication interface , a grid tie inverter , and the like. In alternate embodiments there may be one or more additional energy harvesting circuits  (including energy harvesting methods such as solar cells, wireless power transfer, capturing radio frequency energy, etc.) that may provide power for the light source or load , charge the embedded batteries or may provide power to the grid tie inverter to return to the grid. The grid tied AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb system  may provide all of the functionality described for the AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb system , but the intelligent, programmable time of use and power source\/charging controller  may also control the return of energy to the grid (for local use and\/or to be sold back to the utility). The control of the return of energy to the grid may be based on battery capacity level, time of day, the (TOU) billing plan from the energy company, commands received over the communication interface to return or stop returning energy to the grid either from local intelligence (intelligent electrical meter, smart meter, and the like) or from the energy company, known or learned energy consumption patterns where the additional energy may be needed or any other reason that it may be desired to return energy to the grid.","In an alternate embodiment, there may not be a grid tie inverter in the grid tied AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb system  but rather wires into the housing that allow for an electrical connection to the grid tied AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb system  such that multiple grid tied AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb systems can be connected externally to an inverter to provide power for local use or to a grid tie inverter to provide power to the power grid. There may be a typical AC power input to the grid tied AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb system , but also two or more wires that can be chained or connected separately to an inverter, to a grid tie inverter or to a connection panel that can combine and condition the inputs to then connect to an inverter or grid tie inverter. In this way, one electrical circuit containing multiple grid tied AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb systems or an entire lighting installation containing multiple grid tied AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb systems can be fed back to one or more inverters or grid tie inverters to implement similar functionality as if the inverter or grid tie inverter was located in the grid tied AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb system . It is to be appreciated that the output onto the two or more wires may be AC or DC in nature. For example, the output may be 12 VDC and ground, the output may be 48 VDC and ground, the output may be 12 VAC and ground etc. In the case where DC power is output, there may be no inverter and there may be a DC\/DC converter to generate the required DC output voltage. It is also to be appreciated that the grid tied AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb system  may include circuitry to allow chaining of the wiring (diode-ored for example) or may connect to independent wiring back to an inverter, to a grid tie inverter or to a connection panel that can combine and condition the inputs to then connect to an inverter or grid tie inverter. In some embodiments, there may be an additional charge controller and external battery or batteries for additional energy storage outside of the grid tied AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb systems.","In embodiments, the grid tie inverter may need to ensure that the power supplied by the grid tie inverter will be in phase with the grid power. To synchronize phase with grid power, there may be circuitry in the grid tied AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb system  to monitor the AC input power and lock to the phase with a phase locked loop, an AC power zero crossing detector circuit or the like. This may be used to set the phase of the output of the grid tie inverter to be in sync with the grid. In alternate embodiments, the phase of grid power may not be directly detected in the grid tied AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb system  but may be detected in an external device that can communicate the phase of the grid power to the grid tied AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb system  via the a communication interface . A grid tie inverter may also ensure that the voltage of the grid tie inverter output is slightly higher than the grid voltage to enabling current to flow out to the grid. The detection of the grid voltage may be done with circuitry inside the grid tied AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb system  or in some embodiments the grid voltage may be detected in an external device that can communicate the grid voltage to the grid tied AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb system  via the a communication interface . By way of an example, a separate device connected to grid power (at an AC outlet, at the circuit breaker box etc.) may detect the phase of grid power and\/or the grid voltage. It may also contain an RF transmitter that can transmit wirelessly to the grid tied AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb system  enough information to know the phase of the grid power (analog to digital representation of the waveform, times of zero crossing etc.) and\/or the grid voltage such that embedded intelligence, such as a microcontroller, could control the grid tie inverter such that it is in sync with grid power and the output voltage is slightly higher than the grid voltage. There may be a mechanism to allow the grid tie inverter to be disconnected from the power grid. The disconnect from the grid may be automatically controlled allowing a disconnect from the grid if the grid voltage is turned off, if the phase of grid power cannot be synchronized with, if there is no information from an external source about the phase of grid power, etc, or it is not appropriate to supply power back to the grid via the grid tie inverter for any reason. It may also disconnect anytime the grid tied AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb system  may not be supplying power back to the grid. Embedded intelligence may be programmed based on battery capacity level, time of day, the (TOU) billing plan from the energy company, commands received over the communication interface to return or stop returning energy to the grid either from local intelligence (intelligent electrical meter, smart meter, and the like) or from the energy company, known or learned energy consumption patterns where the additional energy may be needed or any other reason that it may be desired to return energy to the grid. By way of an example, multiple grid tied AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb systems on the same circuit or in the same residence, commercial or industrial building or geographical area may or may not return power to the grid at the same time. An intelligent device such as a computer running a software program, a remote control, a building management unit, a lighting circuit control unit etc. may implement a scheme to enable the grid tied AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb systems such as time division multiplexing algorithm, an algorithm to control which grid tie inverter is on and which grid tie inverter is off to make sure there is no or limited contention, an algorithm to control which grid tie inverters are on based on a knowledge of the energy needs of the consumer or billing plan of the consumer, an algorithm based on the battery capacity level of the grid tied AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb systems, etc.","It is to be appreciated that the grid tied AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb system  may be designed in any size or shape housing to meet the requirements of any standard size bulb (e.g. PAR30, PAR38, A19, R30, MR16, etc), non-standard size bulb, fixture, compact fluorescent bulb, fluorescent bulb or lamp (e.g. T4, T5, T8, circular etc.) or down light assembly (e.g. recessed fixtures, fluorescent fixtures or down light fixtures for residential, commercial or industrial lighting), or the like. It is also to be appreciated that the grid tied AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb system  may be designed in any size or shape housing to meet the requirements of any external light socket adapter, AC outlet adapter, an AC outlet replacement or an AC circuit with embedded battery device designed with batteries embedded application.","In embodiments containing rechargeable batteries, a charge management controller and intelligence, the intelligence may be used to optimize rechargeable battery life by controlling recharge cycles in such a way to optimize the usable life of the batteries. By way of an example, a microcontroller built into a wireless light bulb may monitor the depth of discharge of the rechargeable battery. Based on the status of the battery depth of discharge, the microcontroller may start a recharge cycle early rather than allow the rechargeable batteries to be deeply discharged. The usable capacity of rechargeable batteries may depend on the rate of discharge and the allowable voltage at the end of discharge. An intelligent program running on a microcontroller may adjust the charge cycles to optimize the usable life of the rechargeable batteries. In the example of the AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb, the end result is the ability to extend battery life such that with either an optimization of the recharge cycles or sizing battery capacity to lessen the depth of the discharge needed, the limiting factor of an AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb when the light source is LEDs may be the life of the LEDs rather than the expected usable life of the rechargeable batteries.","In an illustrative embodiment shown in , the block diagram shows an example system that uses an electronic ballast and embedded battery power in a compact fluorescent lamp with an intelligent, programmable controller. In the illustrated embodiment, the AC powered battery embedded CFL wireless light bulb  may include an electronic ballast , a charging circuit with rechargeable batteries , power selection and conditioning circuitry , an intelligent, programmable time of use and power source\/charging controller , a fluorescent tube , a communication interface , and the like. The functionality is very similar to the AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb system , however in this case, a charging circuit with rechargeable batteries  is connected prior to the DC\/AC inverter in the electronic ballast. The power selection and conditioning circuitry  may be used by the an intelligent, programmable time of use and power source\/charging controller  to select the power source for the fluorescent tube  or to supply no power to the fluorescent tube  to turn it off. It is to be appreciated that the intelligent functions described AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb system  for the intelligent, programmable time of use and power source\/charging controller  and that may be done over the communication interface  are applicable to the AC powered battery embedded CFL wireless light bulb . In one embodiment, the AC powered battery embedded CFL wireless light bulb  may be designed to operate similar to or the same as a UPS wireless light bulb. In an alternate embodiment, the CFL wireless light bulb is only AC powered and has no embedded power source. In such a case, the AC powered CFL wireless light bulb may contain wireless control and\/or wireless power as well as be able to implement any of the intelligent functionality as mentioned herein for any wireless light bulb product such as a motion wireless light bulb, a RF controlled wireless light bulb with a transceiver and the capability to form a mesh network, a programmable wireless light bulb etc. In an alternate embodiment, the AC powered battery embedded CFL wireless light bulb  may not have an AC input and runs off of power supplied by an embedded rechargeable or non-rechargeable battery and with a DC\/AC inverter to convert to AC power to create the proper AC output power for the fluorescent tube. In an alternate embodiment, the AC powered battery embedded CFL wireless light bulb  may contain a grid tie inverter. In such a case where the AC powered battery embedded CFL wireless light bulb  contains a grid tie inverter, it is to be appreciated that the intelligent functions described grid tied AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb system  for the intelligent, programmable time of use and power source\/charging controller  and that may be done over the communication interface  along with the functionality gained by having the grid tie inverter in the bulb are applicable to the AC powered battery embedded CFL wireless light bulb .","It is to be appreciated that the AC powered battery embedded CFL wireless light bulb  may be designed in any size or shape housing to meet the requirements of any standard size bulb (e.g. PAR30, PAR38, A19, R30, MR16 etc), non-standard size bulb, fixture, compact fluorescent bulb, fluorescent bulb or lamp (e.g. T4, T5, T8, circular etc.) or down light assembly (e.g. recessed fixtures, fluorescent fixtures or down light fixtures for residential, commercial or industrial lighting), or the like.","In another illustrative embodiment, an AC powered battery embedded PAR30 wireless light bulb may be AC powered and may contain rechargeable batteries to power the wireless control and light source. With reference to , illustrated is a perspective view of an embodiment of an AC powered battery embedded PAR30 wireless light bulb . In the illustrated embodiment, the AC powered battery embedded PAR30 wireless light bulb  may include a housing , a wireless control module , a thermal heat sink , a plurality of LEDs , a battery holder , an AC\/DC converter and power management circuitry , a socket connector , and the like. The size of the embedded battery may be set to match the anticipated power consumption based on the application. The illustrated embodiment is an example of an AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb system  as described herein. The housing  shown may be a standard PAR30 housing. In an alternate embodiment, the housing may be a custom housing that is larger than the PAR30 housing to accommodate a larger a battery holder  and significantly more battery capacity but still may plug via a socket connector  into any fixture that can accommodate the size of the housing. By way of an example, the housing may be designed to fit into a six inch recessed fixture to use the entire volume of the fixture such that the most battery capacity possible can be used in the application. It is to be appreciated that the disclosed functionality may be designed in any size or shape housing mentioned herein. A wireless control module  may be present. The wireless control module  may be an electrical circuit that contains any type of sensor mentioned herein, an RF\/IR receiver or transceiver and\/of intelligence to change the state of the AC powered battery embedded PAR30 wireless light bulb . In one example, the wireless control module  may contain a motion sensor and a light sensor and control the light source based on the state of the motion sensor and light sensor. In another example, the wireless control module  may contain an RF receiver and a microcontroller to receive commands from an external entity like a computer, remote control, building management unit, lighting circuit control unit etc. and control the light source based on the commands received. In another example, the wireless control module  may contain an acoustic sensor that controls the light source based on any sound detected.","In the illustrated embodiment, the wireless control module  is shown above the thermal heat sink . In the embodiment, the wireless control module  may be an electrical circuit on a printed circuit board mounted to the thermal heat sink  with screws, nails, fixing posts, flanged heads of fasteners, and other known mounting devices. The wireless control module  may be mounted to a cover that is mounted to the heat sink. In the illustrated embodiment, the cover may be constructed of plastic. Alternately, the cover may be constructed of metal or any other known material. The advantage to mounting the wireless control module  above the heat sink is that the position allows the sensor or antennas of an RF transceiver to be exposed above the heat sink. The AC powered battery embedded PAR30 wireless light bulb  may contain a method to shield or insulate the wireless control module  from heat from the thermal heat sink . The wireless control module  may have diminished performance or reduced usable life when used at a higher operating temperature. For example, in the example where the AC powered battery embedded PAR30 wireless light bulb  contains a motion sensor and a light sensor, the passive infrared (PIR) sensor that can detect motion may have diminished performance if operated at a higher temperature. The heat shield or insulator may be mounted to the heat sink or plastic cover such that it is situated between the wireless control module  and thermal heat sink . The heat shield or insulator may be constructed of ceramic, fiberglass or any other known material. In an alternate example, the wireless control module  may be mounted to the cover with some space left between wireless control module  and the thermal heat sink . The cover may also have some ventilation holes or other methods to allow the heat to escape and keep the temperature of the wireless control module  and the heat sink as low as possible. The wireless control module  may also be mounted below the heat sink and in such a case the sensor or antennas may need to be separated from the printed circuit board and with some components above the heat sink and some wiring through or around the heat sink to those components. There may also be a heat shield or insulator through the heat sink and above the heat sink to shield or insulate the components above the heat sink and the wiring to the components. By way of an example, a passive infrared (PIR) sensor may need to be located on the face of the AC powered battery embedded PAR30 wireless light bulb  however the accompanying circuitry to amplify the output of the PIR sensor and detect threshold crossing may be done by circuitry on a printed circuit board below the heat sink. In this case, the leads or wires to the PIR sensor may be shielded or insulated through the heat sink and the PIR sensor itself may also be shielded or insulated from heat by a heat shield or insulator as mentioned herein to keep the operating temperature of the PIR sensor as low as possible such that there is no diminished performance because of higher temperature. It is to be appreciated that the wireless control module  can be mounted in any location within the AC powered battery embedded PAR30 wireless light bulb . In alternate embodiments where there is a power source embedded in the AC powered battery embedded PAR30 wireless light bulb , such as in a UPS light bulb or grid shifting light bulb, the bulb may contain a method to shield or insulate the battery holder  from heat from the thermal heat sink  and\/or from the AC\/DC converter and power management circuitry . Power sources, for example rechargeable or non-rechargeable batteries, may have diminished performance or reduced usable life when used at a higher operating temperature. In the example where the AC powered battery embedded PAR30 wireless light bulb  contains one or more Li-Ion rechargeable batteries, the Li-Ion batteries will have diminished performance over time if operated or stored at a higher temperature. For example, Li-Ion batteries will irreversibly lose capacity over time and the loss in capacity will happen at a faster rate when operated or stored at a higher temperature. Heat shields or insulators may be mounted to the heat sink or plastic cover such that it is situated between the battery holder  and thermal heat sink  and\/or may be mounted between the battery holder  and AC\/DC converter and power management circuitry . The battery holder  may be isolated from the heat sources in this manner. By way of an example, the batteries may be located between the thermal heatsink and the AC power circuitry with a thermal shield or insulator above and below such that the batteries are isolated from both sources of heat. In some embodiments there may be ventilation or some other means to allow the heat to be released from this thermally isolated area. The heat shield or insulator may be constructed of ceramic, fiberglass or any other known material. In some embodiments, a heat sink may be attached to the battery to remove heat from the battery. In some embodiments, a thermistor or other temperature measurement device may be attached to the battery or near the battery to detect the temperature level of the battery and adjust the operation of the device to lower the temperature level of the battery.","In the illustrated embodiment, the AC\/DC converter and power management circuitry  may contain an AC\/DC converter, a charging circuit with rechargeable batteries and power selection and conditioning circuitry implementing functionality as described for the AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb system . In an alternate embodiment, the AC powered battery embedded PAR30 wireless light bulb  may also contain a grid tie inverter and implement functionality as described for the grid tied AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb system .","In alternate embodiments, an AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb system may be implemented such that the primary power source is the embedded battery and the AC input is the secondary power source. Under normal conditions, the embedded battery may always be providing power for the wireless light bulb through a DC\/AC inverter and the AC input is used to charge the embedded batteries continuously. In some embodiments the wireless light bulb may include electrical circuitry, a relay, an optoisolator etc. to allow the AC input to be switched in to be used as the power source. With reference to , the block diagram shows an embodiment of an on line wireless light bulb  architecture where the battery may be selected at the primary source and the AC input path may be selected as the power source (on line wireless light bulb AC switched ). In an alternate embodiment, DC power may be present at the switch. In this embodiment, there may be no DC\/AC inverter after the battery and where there may be an AC\/DC converter in the AC input path after the filter (on line wireless light bulb DC switched ). In another embodiment, there may be a grid tie inverter at the output of the battery to allow stored energy to be returned to the line.","In embodiments of the AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb system, there may be a step up DC\/DC converter after the one or more battery to step up the voltage such that the output of the one or more batteries may drive one or more chains of LEDs that may have a higher voltage drop requirement than the one or more batteries may provide. In alternate embodiments, there may be a circuit present to provide a constant current supply for the one or more chains of LEDs. In some embodiments, the AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb may contain circuitry to allow for the shutdown of power from the AC source, the shutdown of charging, the shutdown of drive to the LEDs and\/or the control of the current supplied through the LEDs to set light intensity (pulse width modulation, adjustable resistor value etc.). It is to be appreciated that any combination of controls may be implemented. By way of an example, power supplied from the input AC source may be shutdown, but the drive to the LEDs from the battery may be enabled and the current through the LEDs may be adjusted to an intensity level as required by the application. It is to be appreciated that any architecture mentioned here in for an AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb may contain a DC\/DC converter to step up the voltage to the proper level to drive a chain of LEDs. By way of an example, a 6\u2033 recessed fixture AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb retrofit may contain batteries and a DC\/DC converter to step up the voltage to drive the one or more LED chains. In another example, a fluorescent tube AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb may contain batteries and a DC\/DC converter to step up the voltage to drive the LEDs. In another example, an External Power Supply with Battery LED recessed fixture may be designed with a DC\/DC converter to step up the voltage to drive the required voltage to the recessed fixture. In another example, a DC powered wireless light bulb such as an MR16 with a 12 VDC input, may contain one or more embedded batteries and also contain a DC\/DC converter to step up the voltage to drive a chain of LEDs. In embodiments of the an external light socket adapter, AC outlet adapter, an AC outlet replacement, an AC powered device, an AC circuit with embedded battery device designed with batteries embedded, wall switch or lighting control component and the like containing embedded batteries, the device may contain a DC\/DC converter to step up the DC voltage to a level required to output a higher DC voltage at its output or to improve the efficiency of the DC\/AC inverter at the output.","In an alternate embodiment of a wireless light bulb powered from only AC power or powered only by battery power, the wireless light bulb may contain intelligence to control the light source based on time of day and may contain a communication interface to communicate with an external device. In this case, the intelligence may be programmed to set the times of day that the AC powered or battery powered wireless light bulb is on or off and what the intensity of the light output is. By way of an example, an AC powered wireless light bulb with a microcontroller containing a real time clock may be programmed to set the intensity of the light output to fifty percent of maximum light intensity during daylight hours when there is some ambient light and to set the intensity of the light output to maximum light output during evening hours when there is little ambient light. This will provide some cost savings in energy usage when lighting needs to be on most or all of the day. It is to be appreciated that there may be any number of changes in the light output and the light intensity may be set to any level from off to maximum light intensity of the wireless light bulb. The communication interface may be any communication interface mentioned herein. The external device communicating with and controlling or programming the wireless light bulb may be a computer running a software program, a custom remote control, a building management unit, a lighting circuit control unit etc. and may have the communication interface allowing it to communicate with the wireless light bulb. In the example that is only powered by battery power, the intelligence may also use battery capacity level to set the light intensity output. In such an example, battery power may be rechargeable or non-rechargeable batteries or fuel cells. It is to be appreciated that any wireless power source or any combination of wireless power sources may be used to supply power to or recharge energy storage in the wireless light bulb in connection with the battery powered wireless light bulb controlled based on time of day.","In wireless light bulb embodiments containing an AC power source and an embedded battery power source, there may need to be a mechanism in place to communicate to the wireless light bulb when to use AC power and when to use embedded power. By way of an example, the UPS wireless light bulb may operate off of AC power. When AC power is turned off, whether intentionally by a user turning the light switch off or unintentional when there is a power outage etc., the UPS wireless light bulb may automatically switch over to battery power. In an alternate use case, the user may desire that at times the UPS wireless light bulb does not automatically switch over to battery power but rather that the on\/off wall switch operates the light and that there be a method to select that the UPS wireless light bulb is enabled to operate in a mode that automatically switch over to battery power. In this alternate case, a slide switch on the UPS wireless light bulb that enables or disables automatic switch over may accommodate this function however it may be inconvenient for a user to change the slide switch position (because of the installation location for example in a recessed fixture in the ceiling). An alternate method to enable or disable automatic switch over to battery is by including an RF receiver in the UPS wireless light bulb such that a command enabling or disabling the automatic switch over can be sent via RF to the UPS bulb. Another alternate method to enable or disable automatic switch over to battery is to create a mechanism such that the wireless light bulb detects a sequencing of the power applied to it. By way of an example, if the on\/off wall switch is turned on, then off in less than one second, the automatic switch over to battery function is enabled the next time the wireless light bulb is turned on. If the on\/off wall switch is turned on, then off in less than one second, then on in less than one second or if the unit is turned on then left on for greater than one second the automatic switch over to battery function is disabled and control of the wireless light bulb is by the on\/off wall switch. In such a case, battery power may be used to power the wireless light bulb during the power sequencing or a large capacitor is charged enough that an electrical circuit is powered and can latch the state of the on-off power sequencing such that it may change the mode of the bulb appropriately even in the absence of AC power or if the embedded battery power is discharged and is not usable. It is to be appreciated that any number of power cycles may be done to put the wireless light bulb in any number of modes it may operate in and any type of wireless power source or sources in the wireless light bulb may be controlled. The on\/off wall switch may contain circuitry and an alternate way to select the mode such that the power sequencing is transparent to the user. For example, there may be a slide switch on an on\/off wall switch that selects the mode. When the user turns the on\/off wall switch on, the electrical circuit inside the on\/off wall switch sequences the power appropriately to set the mode of operation. In an alternate embodiment, there may be a real time clock and intelligence inside the UPS light bulb such that it may be programmed to use one mode of operation during certain times of the day and another mode of operation during other times of the day. By way of an example, the user may program the UPS light bulb to be in UPS mode during the day when the user knows the light needs to be on even in a power outage, however it may change modes to switch control or automatically shut off and enter switch control mode during times of the day when the user knows the lights should be off.","In wireless light bulb embodiments containing an AC power source and a sensor or RF\/IR control, there may need to be a mechanism in place to communicate to the wireless light bulb when to use the sensor or RF\/IF control the wireless light bulb and when to use the on\/off wall switch to control the wireless light bulb. By way of an example, the AC powered wireless light bulb may have a motion sensor that may turn the bulb on when motion is detected. In an alternate use case, the user may desire that at times the AC powered wireless light bulb does not automatically turn on when motion is detected but rather that the on\/off wall switch operates the light and that there is a method that the AC powered wireless light bulb may be enabled to operate in a mode that uses the motion sensor to control the light. In this alternate case, a slide switch on the AC powered wireless light bulb that enables or disables motion detection control (and that when the bulb is turned on it is always on) may accommodate this function however it may be inconvenient for a user to change the slide switch position (because of the installation location for example in a recessed fixture in the ceiling). An alternate method to enable or disable motion detection control is by including an RF receiver in the AC powered wireless light bulb such that a command enabling or disabling the motion detection may be sent via RF to the AC powered wireless light bulb. Another alternate method to enable or disable motion detection control is to create a mechanism such that the wireless light bulb detects a sequencing of the power applied to it. By way of an example, if the on\/off wall switch is turned on, then off in less than one second, then on in less than one second motion detection is enabled. If the unit is turned on and left on for greater than one second, the control of the wireless light bulb is by the on\/off wall switch (i.e. it remains on whether there is motion or not and is turned of by the on\/off wall switch). When the unit is turned off and left off for a period of time, the next time the on\/off wall switch is used, it can again set the mode of the wireless light bulb. In such a case, it may be required that a small amount of power storage exists in the wireless light bulb, for example small battery is present or a large capacitor is charged enough that an electrical circuit is powered and can latch the state of the on-off power sequencing such that it may change the mode of the bulb appropriately even in the absence of AC power briefly. It is to be appreciated that any number of power cycles may be done to put the wireless light bulb in any number of modes it may operate in and any type of sensor or sensors in the wireless light bulb may be controlled. The on\/off wall switch may contain circuitry and an alternate way to select the mode such that the power sequencing is transparent to the user. For example, there may be a slide switch on an on\/off wall switch that enables or disables motion detection. When the user turns the on\/off wall switch on, the electrical circuit inside the on\/off wall switch sequences the power appropriately to set the mode of operation. In an alternate embodiment, there may be a real time clock and intelligence inside the wireless light bulb such that it may be programmed to use one mode of operation during certain times of the day and the other mode of operation during other times of the day. By way of an example, the user may program an AC powered motion sensor wireless light bulb to be controlled by a motion sensor during the evening hours when the user knows there is typically low occupancy, however it may change modes to wall switch control during times of the day when the user knows the lights should always be on due to typically high occupancy. In another example, the AC powered motion sensor wireless light bulb may have an embedded battery such that the user may also be able to select the power source based on time of day.","In wireless light bulb embodiments containing an AC power source, an embedded battery power source and\/or other wireless power sources, there may be many reasons to switch from one power source to another or to have power sources share the load. The reasons to switch from one power source to another or to have power sources share the load may be sensor or RF\/IR controlled, controlled by intelligent decision and\/or controlled by power management functions. In the case of sensor or RF\/IR control, the switch over may be based on motion detection, light detection, power consumption measurements or any other sensor parameter that may necessitate a switch to a different power source. For example, an AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb may have a glow or low light function that is powered by battery, but when motion is detected, the bulb turns on to full brightness and is powered by AC power. In the case of control by intelligent decision, intelligence in the wireless light bulb (microcontroller, microprocessor, integrated circuit etc.) may control the bulb based on time of day or timers, knowledge gained over time based on monitoring of sensors, a user program based on a knowledge of the use patterns required for a particular wireless light bulb, an individual profile based on an identification from the area (detect an RFID personnel tag on an individual for example) etc. For example, an AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb may have a motion sensor in it and a real time clock. Over a number of days a microprocessor may build a profile of occupancy based on motion detections recorded at particular times of the day that it may plug into an algorithm to automatically set the light intensity to a very low level running off of battery power when it is apparent that there should be no motion detected or it may anticipate when it should detect motion and switch to AC power and turn on to full intensity prior to that time (for example first thing in the morning at an office a few minutes prior to when the first employee is expected to show up based on the profile of occupancy built by the microprocessor). In the case of switch over controlled by power management functions, the control of power source to use may be due to low battery capacity, AC not being present or not being usable, whether a wireless power source is present and is usable (solar cells collecting enough energy to share the load), depth of discharge thresholds to manage the life cycle of rechargeable batteries, the sharing of the load by power sources to optimize energy use for cost savings or conservation purposes etc. By way of an example, solar cells in a wireless light bulb may generate enough power to share the load at any time. If the wireless light bulb monitors the solar power source and determines that it is an appropriate power source to use based on the power consumption requirements, it may use the solar power source exclusively or may share the load between multiple power sources including the solar power source.","In wireless light bulb embodiments containing an AC power source, an embedded battery power source and\/or other wireless power sources, there are a number of methods by which the load is shared by the sources (i.e. some amount of power required by the load is supplied by more than one source). It has been mentioned that the sources may be diode ored prior to the load as one method of placing power sources in parallel. Other methods of paralleling power sources to source power to the load may include circuits with diodes, FETs, transistors, op amps, power converters and the like. Once the power sources are paralleled such they may independently supply power to the load, there may also be control to determine the amount of power each source may deliver. By way of an example, there may be two power sources for a light source (chain of LEDs etc.)\u2014an AC power source and an embedded battery power source. The output of the AC power source and the embedded battery power source are diode ored prior to the light source such that they may both supply power to the light source. The output of the embedded battery power source may be followed by a constant current source circuit that may be adjusted to any current level required from zero percent of the power supplied to the light source to one hundred percent of the power supplied to the light source. There may be circuitry to measure the amount of current flowing through the LEDs and there may be circuitry to measure the amount of current flowing through the constant current at the output of the embedded battery source. If the application requires that fifty percent of the load is delivered by the embedded battery source, the constant current supplied by the embedded battery source may be adjusted until the amount of current supplied is fifty percent of the measurement of current flowing through the chain of LEDs. By way of an example, a microcontroller with the ability to take an analog to digital measurement at the constant current circuit at the output of the embedded battery source and at some point in the chain of LEDs, then adjust the amount of current at the constant current circuit (by setting the value of a digital potentiometer or the like) until the desired ratio of load sharing is achieved. In an alternate embodiment, the output of the embedded battery source is connected to an LED driver circuit that may drive a chain of LEDs and also has the capability of control by pulse width modulation that controls the percentage of current supplied from the embedded battery source. In alternate embodiments, the amount of power supplied by the AC power source is controlled. The AC power source may have a constant current circuit at the output, may be a constant current source by design and have the ability to adjust the amount of current supplied by pulse width modulation and the like. The embedded battery power source would supply the remainder of the power to the load. It is to be appreciated that any number of power sources may be used in connection to the claimed subject matter.","In an illustrative embodiment shown in , the block diagram shows an example AC powered super capacitor embedded wireless light bulb system  that may use an AC power input and a super or ultra capacitor power source with an intelligent, programmable controller to provide cost savings, security and convenience benefits to a lighting installation. In the illustrated embodiment, the AC powered super capacitor embedded wireless light bulb system  may include an AC\/DC converter , one or more super or ultra capacitors , power selection and conditioning circuitry , an intelligent, programmable time of use and power source controller , a light source or load , a communication interface , and the like. The AC input may be connected to the AC powered super capacitor embedded wireless light bulb system  by a light socket, wall outlet, terminal block, connector, hardwired connection or any common connection that a device requiring AC power may have to provide an AC power input. The AC input block may contain a transformer, line cap, fuse, inrush limiter or other type of power circuitry commonly found at the input of an AC\/DC converter or an AC powered device. By way of an example, an inrush limiter may be used to guarantee that the inrush current does not exceed a certain threshold especially with a large capacitance potentially charging when AC power is first applied. The output of the AC\/DC converter  may be a regulated DC source such as a DC\/DC converter circuit. It may be a constant current source to the load for example to provide constant current to a chain of LEDs in series. In some embodiments there may be multiple circuits at the output of the AC\/DC converter such that one circuit may provide a power source for low current draw circuitry such as for an intelligent, programmable time of use and power source controller  communication interface , and the like, and where a second circuit may provide a power source for high current draw circuitry such as the light source or load . It is to be appreciated that any number power sources may be created at the output of the AC\/DC converter to meet the needs of the application.","The output of the AC\/DC converter may be connected to one or more super or ultra capacitors . The large capacitance at the output of the regulator may provide power to the light source or load  in the absence of AC input power. The larger that the capacitance in the capacitor or bank of capacitors, the longer that the capacitance at the output of the regulator may power the circuit. It is to be appreciated that the one or more super or ultra capacitors  may be in series, parallel or any combination as required by the application. The one or more super or ultra capacitor  may charge when AC input is available. The power source controller may control the regulator to disable it such that even if the AC input is available, the circuitry will be powered by one or more super or ultra capacitor . The power source may pulse width modulate the control of the regulator to accomplish any amount of load sharing between the AC input and the one or more super or ultra capacitor . In an alternate embodiment, the one or more super or ultra capacitors may be in the AC\/DC controller prior to the regulator and there may or may not be one or more super or ultra capacitors  after the regulator. In this case, the capacitance in the AC\/DC controller may provide the filtering for the output of the rectifier circuit but will also be able to provide a power source to the circuit in the absence of AC input power for some period of time. In alternate embodiments, there may also be a rechargeable battery and charging circuit after the regulator in addition to the one or more super or ultra capacitors . The combination of a rechargeable battery and large capacitance as a rechargeable power source may allow the design to contain the positive aspects of both approaches. The capacitive energy storage will charge and be available quickly whereas rechargeable batteries will provide a lot of storage for a low cost.","In some RF or IR transmitter embodiments, the RF or IR transmitter may rely on energy harvesting techniques to power or charge the device. For example, a transmitter in a housing that can mount to a wall may contain one or more solar cells, a large capacitor, a microcontroller, an RF transmitter, and the like. The microcontroller and RF transmitter may typically be in a low current sleep mode. The solar cells and capacitor may be sized to provide enough energy storage and recharge capability such that the switches on the RF transmitter may be pressed several times sending commands to a wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless light fixture before the capacitor cannot supply enough energy to transmit the command. Under normal usage, the solar cells and capacitor may contain enough power and recharge capability such that there may not be an instance that the button would be pushed and not transmit a command. In an alternate embodiment, instead of a solar cell, a piezoelectric device may be designed on a handheld transmitter such that energy is harvested from the motion of the device. In this case, when the user waves the piezoelectric powered device in the direction of the light with a button pressed, the device may transmit a command to turn the light on or off. In another example, perhaps a button does not need to be pushed and that the waving of the device may transmit a toggle command when enough energy is harvested from the motion to toggle the state of the light. It is to be appreciated that any form of energy harvesting may be used in conjunction with the RF or IR transmitter concepts mentioned herein.","In another RF or IR transmitter embodiment, a wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture may be controlled by a remote light sensor with an RF transmitter. The measured light level may be periodically transmitted to one or more wireless light bulbs or battery powered wireless lighting fixtures. The wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture may contain an RF receiver and an intelligent device such as a microcontroller that may allow the measured light level to be interpreted and such interpretation may lead to a state change. By way of an example, a wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless light fixture may be installed in a hallway that receives some ambient light from windows or other lights in the area. The desired light level may be programmed into the wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture. The remote light sensor may be placed on the floor or wall of the hallway below the light that is to be controlled. Every five seconds, the light sensor with an RF transmitter may transmit the measured light level to the wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture. When received, the light intensity may be left unchanged, adjusted up or adjusted down automatically to set the light intensity to be at a preprogrammed level or range. In an alternate embodiment, the remote light sensor is a handheld device that a user may use to set the light intensity level for the daylight harvesting function where the light intensity is set based on the ambient light level detected such that the ambient light plus the light generated by the light source maintain a constant light level. In this embodiment, the user may walk into a room with the remote light sensor handheld device and press a button to take a reading. The remote light sensor handheld device may have a transmitter such that it may transmit the reading to the wireless light bulb battery powered wireless lighting fixture. The wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture may be programmed by the transmission or it may use the detected light level information to set its light intensity level appropriately. Alternately, the user may use an alternate method to enter the detected lux reading into the wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixtures. For example, the user may open a graphical user interface with a software application that would allow the user to enter the settings for the daylight harvesting functions as well as the detected light levels. There may be net light values based on time of day or any other input to the unit that user may desire a different net light value. In another example, the user may manually adjust the constant light level using a control, such as a dial, on the RF transmitter, on the wireless light bulb or on the battery powered wireless lighting fixtures based on the reading. In alternate embodiments, the remote light sensor with an RF transmitter device may have multiple light sensors pointing in different directions out of the housing to allow the receiving bulbs or modules to change light intensity based on multiple light sensor readings. The housing of the remote light sensor with an RF transmitter device may be designed with the light sensors designed into the housing in a way that they are reading light intensity in different directions.","In some embodiments, there may be multiple remote light sensors and multiple wireless light bulbs or battery powered wireless lighting fixtures in the same area. By way of an example, in a conference room, multiple PAR38 wireless light bulbs may be installed in recessed fixtures. In this example, three remote light sensors are placed in the conference room on top of each end of and on top of the center of the conference room table. The multiple wireless light bulbs may receive the light intensity measurements and adjust the light intensity output as programmed. Unique IDs may be set in each of the wireless light bulbs such that all wireless light bulbs may receive all remote light sensor transmissions or the wireless light bulbs and remote light sensors may be grouped in areas by setting the unique IDs to create operational groups. In some embodiments, the user may have a separate remote controller that may allow programming the wireless light bulbs or battery powered wireless lighting fixture to respond in different ways to the remote light sensor input. The remote controller may have multiple scenes programmed in. In the conference room example, there may be a presentation scene where there are different light intensities in different parts of the room or there may be a meeting scene where the lights are set to high light intensity throughout the room. The remote controller may allow methods to create scenes and program the details (light intensity, timing, time of day response, groups of lights etc) into the wireless light bulbs. The remote controller may have a method to override the use of the remote light sensors and allow a user to directly control the light intensity of one or more wireless light bulbs or battery powered wireless lighting fixtures.","A daylight harvesting kit may be constructed consisting of an AC powered wireless light bulb with a receiver and a remote light sensor transmitter. There may be a control on the AC powered wireless light bulb or on the remote light sensor transmitter to set the net light level that a user desires or it may be programmed in some other manner over the communication interface. A user may install the wireless light bulb and place the remote light sensor transmitter in a location where the user wants a net light value to be maintained. The user then turns on the wireless light bulb and sets the net light value through the means of control provided. Thereafter the wireless light bulb may receive periodic transmissions from the remote light sensor transmitter and adjust its light intensity appropriately.","In some embodiments a wireless light bulb or wireless lighting module may be controlled by a light sensor designed into the unit. In such a case a daylight harvesting function may be implemented where the light intensity generated by the light source is set based on the ambient light level detected such that the ambient light plus the light generated by the light source maintain a constant light level. In some embodiments, the net amount of light may be set by a user either by programming the net light value into the wireless light bulb or wireless lighting module through a programming method over the communication interface or it may be set directly on the unit through a method of control such as a dial, push buttons, slide switches and the like where a user may set the net light they desire directly and thereafter the wireless light bulb or wireless lighting module will adjust the output light intensity to maintain the detected light level at the user setting. In alternate embodiments, there may be more than one net light setting where the selection of which light intensity setting to use is based on time of day, inputs from other forms of wireless control designed into the bulb, intelligent decisions made based on inputs to the wireless light bulb or wireless lighting module such as battery charge level and the like. In order to measure the amount of ambient light in the area, the wireless light bulb or wireless lighting module may turn off the light source or prior to the light source being turned on initially, read and analyze the ambient light measurement, then set the light intensity of the light source. In alternate embodiments, the wireless light bulb or wireless lighting module may change the light intensity slightly, find the delta of change of measured light, then adjust the light intensity. The wireless light bulb or wireless lighting module may make several readings and adjustments in this manner to set the light intensity to the configured light level. The wireless light bulb or wireless lighting module may store the net light setting in memory inside the unit such that when power is turned off the user setting is not lost. In the case where there is a dial, push buttons, switches and the like on the unit, the unit may read and analyze those inputs as needed to set the desired net light value. It is to be appreciated that the daylight harvesting function may be used in conjunction with any form of wireless control or any intelligent function mentioned herein. A daylight harvesting wireless light bulb or wireless lighting module housing may be designed to isolate the light sensor from the light sources such that the detected light level is not influenced significantly by the daylight harvesting wireless light bulb or wireless lighting module light source or sources. By way of an example, the housing may be designed such that the light sensor is recessed in the housing, is inside a plastic tube directed toward where the light is to be detected or is designed in any way necessary to obscure the light sensor from the bulb or module light source or sources. It is to be appreciated that the housing design may take any size or shape to isolate the light sensor from the light sources. In alternate embodiments, a daylight harvesting wireless light bulb or wireless lighting module may have multiple light sensors pointing in different directions out of the housing to allow the bulb or module to change light intensity or light direction in a way to generate light output in the desired manner. In some embodiments, the daylight harvesting wireless light bulb or wireless lighting module may have an RF transceiver such that several bulbs or modules in an area may transmit and receive the light sensor information to allow bulbs or modules to use light sensor information from other units to adjust their light output appropriately or to allow multiple bulbs or modules to work in a coordinated fashion to illuminate an area.","By way of an example, a wireless light bulb may contain a light sensor and a dial on the light sensor to set the net amount of light. The user may install the wireless light bulb, turn it on, then turn the dial on the bulb until the amount of light generated is what the user desires. Thereafter, whatever amount of ambient light that is detected, the bulb will automatically set the light intensity to provide the desired light output. In another example, a battery powered RF controlled LED spotlight contains a light sensor and a slide switch that allows multiple net light settings to be selected. The spotlight may then set the light output based on the desired net light value and the detected ambient light level. When the user turns on the spotlight via a remote control, the spotlight may then read and analyze the input from the light sensor, then set the light intensity of the output appropriately to meet the net light value. In another example, an AC powered battery embedded wireless light bulb designed to retrofit into a 6\u2033 fixture contains a light sensor. Intelligence in the unit may store energy in the rechargeable battery during off peak hours and use the battery to power the light source during on peak hours. If the unit implements a daylight harvesting function, battery life may be extended and the user may then continue to get the desired net light, thus the lighting installation may operate as necessary and there may be a cost savings through controls.","In another embodiment, a wireless light bulb or wireless lighting module may contain a light sensor and the ability to adjust the light output to compensate for the deterioration of LED performance over the life of the bulb. It is known that LED performance may deteriorate over time. The light sensor may be used to help ensure that the light output remains consistent, such as by increasing the drive current to the LEDs based on the detected light level. In an alternate embodiment, the wireless light bulb or wireless lighting module may contain only a timer or real time clock internally and may keep a record of the number of hours the wireless light bulb or wireless lighting module has been used. Based on the number of hours the LED light source has been illuminated, the wireless light bulb or wireless lighting module may contain the intelligence to increase the drive current to the LEDs based on an algorithm that predicts the rate of deterioration in the performance of the LEDs. In some embodiments, the user may have access to the stored information of number of hours of on time and drive level such that a user may determine the health or level of performance of the LEDs at any time. In an alternate embodiment, the wireless light bulb or wireless lighting module may contain a transmitter such that it may transmit the performance information to a processor to keep a record of the performance and\/or for analysis.","In one embodiment, a wireless light bulb or wireless lighting module may contain an array of light sensors (CdS or photodiodes) sensitive to different bands of light wavelength such that it may be used to create a \u201cspectrum analyzer\u201d of light in the desired band. This may be designed into a wireless light bulb, wireless lighting module or it may be a separate unit with a transmitter that may detect the information of the spectrum and transmit the information to a wireless light bulb or wireless lighting module containing a receiver. The wireless light bulb or wireless lighting module may use the information to adjust the color of the output light to meet a specific light or wireless lighting module spectrum envelope. By way of an example, an array of eight CdS sensors occupying consecutive parts of the band of visible light from 2800K to 4400K, with the first sensor measuring lux from 2800K to 3000K, the second sensor measuring lux from 3000K to 3200K and so on. The measured spectrum of light may then be used to set the mix of red, green and blue LEDs to create the desired spectrum of light output. In some embodiments, this sensor may be used to provide the user with different light options, such as tungsten, natural light, candle light, fluorescent, and such, to match the user's preference, or to match the other lights in the vicinity.","In another illustrative embodiment, a version of the wireless light bulb is used in External Power Supply with Battery LED recessed fixture  applications. With reference to , illustrated is a perspective view of an embodiment of an External Power Supply with Battery LED recessed fixture . In the illustrated embodiment, the External Power Supply with Battery LED recessed fixture  includes a housing , an AC input , an external power supply for AC\/DC conversion and battery management functions , a DC input , a printed circuit for wireless control and LED drive circuitry , a plurality of LEDs  and a heatsink . In this embodiment, the AC\/DC power supply and batteries are external to the housing, electronics, thermal management and light source. The batteries may be rechargeable or non-rechargeable and may be internal to the housing of the AC\/DC power supply. In alternate embodiments, the batteries may be external to the housing of the AC\/DC power supply and are electrically connected to the power supply. In alternate embodiments, the AC\/DC power supply and batteries may be external to the recessed fixture and may both be connected to the fixture. In such an embodiment, electronics for wireless control and LED drive circuitry  may make an intelligent decision on which power source to use. It is noted that the External Power Supply with Battery LED recessed fixture  may be designed in any size or shape housing  to meet the requirements of any standard size bulb (PAR30, PAR38, A19, R30, MR16 etc), non-standard size bulb, fixture, fluorescent bulb or lamp (T4, T5, T8, circular etc.) or down light assembly (recessed fixtures, fluorescent fixtures or down light fixtures for residential or industrial lighting), or the like. It is noted that the external power supply may be designed in any size or shape to meet the requirements with typical characteristics of an AC input, DC output and in the case where external batteries are used a connection to those batteries. The external power supply may have intelligence built in to make a decision to use the AC input, internal or external batteries or both to power the External Power Supply with Battery LED recessed fixture . In alternate embodiments, the external power supply may have a grid tie inverter and associated circuitry designed in such that it may return stored energy to the grid as described herein. In alternate embodiments, the external power supply is replaced by a ballast for fluorescent lighting applications. In such a case there may be rechargeable or non-rechargeable batteries internal to the housing of the ballast. In alternate embodiments, the batteries may be external to the housing of the ballast and are electrically connected to the ballast where the ballast contains the intelligence to select the power source. In an alternate embodiment, there is a controller separate from the ballast that works in conjunction with the ballast to control the lighting. In such a case there may be rechargeable or non-rechargeable internal to the housing of the controller. In alternate embodiments, the batteries may be external to the housing of the controller and are electrically connected to the controller. In such an embodiment, the controller may contain wireless control or an intelligent device in the form of a microcontroller, microprocessor, integrated circuit etc to make an intelligent decision on storing power in the batteries and which power source to use.","In some wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture embodiments, there may be an LED on the bulb or fixture that the battery capacity is below a threshold (battery low indication) or that there may be a fault condition in the bulb or fixture. An LED may be a colored LED and it may display status in by being on solid or blinking in some manner that may provide an indication of the nature of the fault condition. An LED may provide a positive indication also. By way of an example, a green LED may be on a bulb or fixture to indicate that the battery level is good. A multicolored LED may be used to provide multiple indications. By way of an example, when the LED is green, the battery level is good, when the LED is yellow the battery level is marginal and when the LED is red the battery level is too low. In alternate embodiments, there may be a transmitter on the wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture that may transmit an indication of the status of the bulb or fixture to a receiver that can process and make use of the indication. By way of an example, in a safety lighting system that contains battery embedded power, the bulb or fixture may transmit an indication of a low battery level to a central controller to allow the battery to be changed or guarantee that the battery may be recharged. A network of bulbs or fixtures may be used to forward the transmitted indications back to a central controller to process the information.","In some embodiments, a wireless light bulb may be connected an AC input that is triac dimmer controlled. In this case, the wireless light bulb may detect a zero crossing of the AC waveform, may be able to determine the amount of the waveform that has been shut off by the triac and may adjust a PWM dimming control to one or more LEDs such that the triac dimmer control that is in a wall switch or similar device may still control the intensity of the light output. In a triac dimmer control, the power delivered to the wireless light bulb may be enough to power the wireless light bulb even if a portion of the power delivered to the wireless light bulb is eliminated by the triac. By way of an example, the dimming function for the wireless light bulb may work down to a level where only twenty percent of the power is delivered to the wireless light bulb because the power after the diode bridge and prior to a regulator circuit may still be enough to provide power to the light source and circuitry in the wireless light bulb. In this example, the light intensity controlled by the PWM control of the one or more LEDs may set the light intensity to zero output when only twenty percent of the AC input waveform is detected by the wireless light bulb. From twenty percent to one hundred percent of the waveform, the dimming levels will be set in the PWM control to provide a full dimming range for the wireless light bulb. In alternate embodiments, there may be also an alternate power source available in the wireless light bulb such as batteries or a super capacitor that allows the AC input detection circuitry and intelligence in the wireless light bulb to operate even when the AC input is below a threshold that would power the wireless light bulb. In such a case, the wireless light bulb may use the AC input as long as it has determined that it is acceptable for use, but then switch over to the alternate power source when it is not acceptable to use. The alternate power source may be used to power the light source and control circuitry all of the time and the AC input with triac dimmer control may only used to allow the wireless light bulb to detect the waveform to set the PWM control of the LEDs to achieve the desired light intensity and to recharge the batteries. In some embodiments, the triac dimming control wall switch plate may be replaced by an RF transmitter wall switch plate with dimming controls that send dim up and dim down commands to one or more wireless light bulbs with RF receivers allowing them to perform the PWM dimming control to set the light intensity. In other embodiments, the dimming function is implemented by amplitude modulation of the AC power input. In such a case, the wireless light bulb may measure the amplitude of the input and generate the PWM control of the LEDs to create a light intensity level that reflects the amplitude level. In some embodiments, the wireless light bulb may contain an embedded power source such as a non-rechargeable battery, a rechargeable battery, a super capacitor or the like such that the wireless light bulb may power an embedded microcontroller or similar circuitry that may contain the light intensity level even when power to the wireless light bulb is removed. In such a case, the wireless light bulb may continue to generate light at the dimmed light intensity level power the wireless light bulb from the embedded power source. In alternate embodiments, the embedded power source provides internal power to remember the state of the dimmed light intensity level such that when the light is turned back on it will start out at the previous light intensity level. For example, if the dimming function is performed by sending a command to the bulb over the power lines or by a wireless input such as RF communications or the like, the bulb may be able to return to the remembered light intensity immediately when power is applied the next time. In alternate embodiments, the dim level is stored in non-volatile memory in the wireless light bulb when the dim level is set or when the bulb is powered down.","Preset lighting zones and scenes may be programmed into a wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture to allow a user to select a specific light intensity or setting. The lighting zones and scenes may be preprogrammed (as part of a specific embodiment of a bulb or fixture with settings that a user would typically require for certain applications) or they may be setup and programmed by the user. Lighting zones may be set up using unique IDs such that some of the bulbs or fixtures in a certain area may operate similarly.","In some battery powered wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture embodiments, there may be energy harvesting methods employed to supplement and recharge embedded battery power. In one use case, a wireless light bulb parking lot light or street lamp may be designed that may harvest wind power to power the light source and control circuitry and\/or charge embedded battery power. In the example use case, a small wind mill is built inside the housing of the parking lot light or street lamp. The housing has openings to allow wind to turn the mechanism, but the wind mill is not visible. In some embodiments, the wind mill may be visible. The wind energy is converted to electrical energy and either directly powers the light or is stored in the embedded battery. The parking lot or street lamp may or may not have an AC power source in addition to the wind power and embedded battery power sources. In alternate use cases, energy is harvested from a turnstile, for example at a subway station or sporting event. The spinning motion of the turnstile generates electricity that powers the light source and control circuitry and\/or charges embedded battery power. In another use case, the wireless lighting module is similar to a collar that opens and closes. When closed it may be locked onto whatever it closes on. The inside portion spins and the outside portion remains fixed. By way of an example the wireless lighting module may be affixed to the roof of a revolving door with screws or another attachment mechanism and the inner portion is attached to the spinning part of the revolving door. The outside portion has the light in it, the inside portion spins with whatever it is attached to and generates electricity as it spins. In this use case, the wireless lighting module may be attached to anything that is spinning to generate electricity for use by the wireless lighting module. This may be used in revolving doors, carousels, turnstiles etc. In alternate use cases, the wireless lighting module may mount to a pole and blades may be attached to the spinning portion to allow for wind energy to be converted to electrical energy to power and\/or charge batteries in the wireless lighting module.","In some use cases the wireless lighting module may be designed to harvest energy from the opening and closing of a door. When the door is opened or closed, a porch light that is outside of the door stores energy via electromagnetic induction or any other energy harvesting method from the opening and closing of the door. In another use case, a computer keyboard may be designed with a piezoelectric device under each key such that when the key is pressed, electricity is generated. An electrical circuit may be wired from the keyboard along with the keyboard connection to the computer to a wireless lighting module in the form of a desk lamp that may be powered from the electricity harvested from the key presses. The desk lamp may contain rechargeable batteries to store the energy generated by the key presses. In another use case, a wireless lighting module may be designed such that a portable water mill may be place in flowing water and cabled to a wireless lighting module in the form of a path light or spotlight mounted to the ground with a stake. The wireless lighting module may contain rechargeable batteries to store energy for later use. The wireless lighting module may contain an RF receiver such that it may be controlled with a remote control to turn the light on or off as needed. In alternate use cases, a similar wireless lighting module may be used on a boat as a power source and charging source for wireless lighting modules on the boat. As the boat moves through the water, electricity may be created to power the light on the boat.","In some wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture embodiments, there may be a receiver control module such that the same design of light source, thermal management, AC\/DC circuit, regulator circuitry, housing, battery management etc may be used, but the wireless control and embedded intelligence may change to use different communication interfaces, different types of sensors, different types of embedded intelligence or different types of LED control and power management. This may allow changing from one control type to another (LEDs, thermal, AC\/DC etc stay same, lighting control module changes to allow the bulb or fixture to be part of different control topologies). By way of an example, a receiver control module may be a printed circuit board containing intelligence (microcontroller, microprocessor, integrated circuit etc.), a communication interface, battery charging and control circuitry, light source drive and control circuitry, and the like. For example, one module may be designed for a wireless light bulb that uses ZIGBEE as a communication interface. An alternate module may be designed for a wireless light bulb that uses BLUETOOTH as a communication interface in a printed circuit board that may be the same form factor as the ZIGBEE based receiver control module. An alternate module may be designed for a wireless light bulb that uses the ENOCEAN protocol as a communication interface in a printed circuit board that may be the same form factor as the ZIGBEE based or BLUETOOTH based receiver control module. In those three cases, the base wireless light bulb design may remain the same, but the receiver control module may be changed to create three wireless light bulb options that could be integrated with different system architectures. In another example, the receiver control module with a real time clock embedded may be installed to control the light source based on time of day. Alternately, the receiver control module that may receive and forward commands in a mesh network may be installed to create a mesh network of wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture. It is to be appreciated that the receiver control module may contain any combination of intelligence, communication interfaces, sensors, battery charging and control circuitry and light source drive and control circuitry mentioned herein. In some embodiments the module may be referred to as a sensor control module as it may provide sensor functions that may operate with or without a communication interface. In some embodiments, the module may be referred to as a transceiver control module as it would contain a transmitter and receiver such that the module may transmit, receive and in some embodiments be part of a network of wireless light bulbs or battery powered wireless lighting fixtures. In other embodiments, the module may be an intelligent control module that may provide intelligent function such as programmable time of day control. It is to be appreciated that a module may be designed that contains any mix of functionality of the modules mentioned herein.","In some embodiments, the receiver control module may be built into the wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture. In other embodiments, the receiver control module may be replaceable by opening the wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture, removing receiver control module and replacing it with a different receiver control module. In this case, the receiver control module may have a connector to allow it to make electrical and mechanical connection to the bulb or fixture. In other embodiments, the receiver control module is external to the bulb or fixture and is in its own housing of any size or shape as required by the application. In this case, there may be a connector on the bulb or fixture and on the receiver control module to allow it to be plugged into or unplugged from the bulb or fixture. It is to be appreciated that the receiver control module may be changeable in place (i.e. it may be reprogrammed over the communication interface such that the same hardware provides a different set of functionality).","In embodiments of the wireless light module or apparatus where there is a wireless power source, there may exist the capability that the wireless lighting module or apparatus may be removed from its installed location and used as a mobile light source (i.e. carried around, attached to a vehicle etc). In some embodiments, the entire wireless lighting module or apparatus may be a mobile light source, but in other embodiments some part of the wireless lighting module or apparatus may be removed and used as a mobile light source. By way of an example, an LED spotlight with any type of wireless power and wireless control source may be installed at any location. If desired, a user may remove the LED spotlight or a portion of the LED spotlight from its installed location and walk around with the spotlight using it as a light source. In one example, the LED spotlight is attached to a tree without driving into the tree to mount the spotlight.","In embodiments, a wireless lighting module or wireless light bulb may use a real time clock to maintain timer or time of day information for use by intelligent functions. In alternate embodiments, a wireless lighting module or wireless light bulb may maintain timer or time of day information through the use of a microcontroller, microprocessor, integrated circuit etc. that may keep track of time independently or with an associated crystal oscillator, clock oscillator, electrical circuit that oscillates or the like. An external time source may be used to calibrate or update the timer or time of day clock to synchronize with the external time source to set the internal time source and\/or compensate for clock drift of the internal time source. In alternate embodiments, a module or bulb may use an atomic clock receiver inside the module or bulb to receive accurate and reliable time of day clock from a clock source provided by a radio transmitter. By way of an example, the transmitting clock source may be the WWV or WWVB radio controlled clocks that are transmitted by the NIST time signal radio station or the like. In such a case, a user may not need to set the time of day. It may be set automatically by receiving a radio signal containing clock information that may be used to update the time of day information kept in the module or bulb. In such a case, the module or bulb will be able to regularly update its internal clock to keep it as accurate as possible. It may also be able to automatically adjust for daylight savings time changes. In some embodiments, a module or bulb that may be able to receive atomic clock information may retransmit it to other stations that cannot receive the atomic clock information for any reason. In this case, a network of wireless lighting modules or wireless light bulbs may benefit from the distribution of time of day information that is distributed though the network. In alternate embodiments, Network Time Protocol (NTP) or any other time distribution protocol may be used to distribute timer and\/or time of day information in a network of wireless lighting modules and wireless light bulbs. By synchronizing modules and bulbs to a common clock, complete lighting installations will be able to operate synchronized in time. In addition, in a case where intelligence inside the modules and bulbs will be used to change state at particular times or times of day, a synchronized clock across the network may allow them to do so independently, but still synchronized in time. In alternate embodiments, the wireless light module or wireless light bulb may contain an astronomical time clock that maintains day, date, sunrise, sunset and daylight savings information to allow the module or bulb state to be changed based on the information from the astronomical time clock.","In another embodiment, a version of the wireless lighting module may target wireless LED spotlight applications where there is a mounting mechanism to mount the spotlights to support bars of a drop ceiling. In an alternate embodiment, there is a mounting mechanism to mount the spotlights directly to the ceiling, wall or under cabinet. In either case, the spotlight has the ability to have the direction of the light source changed. Thus, one or more wireless LED spotlights may be used to be installed similar to track lights but use wireless power therefore they may be installed in any location the user desires (\u201cwireless track light\u201d). By way of an example, a wireless track light may be created by one or more wireless LED spotlights that illuminate an area of approximately one hundred fifty square feet. Alternate embodiments may include but are not limited to any known light source including LEDs, compact fluorescent, incandescent bulbs, and the like, and can illuminate any size area required by the application.","The wireless track light may include one or more wireless power sources such as a battery. By way of an example, the wireless track light may consist of one or more spotlights powered by 3 D batteries. It should be understood that in alternate embodiments any number and type of known batteries may be used, including without limitation all known alkaline and nickel-cadmium batteries, depending on size and power requirements. According to another example, the power source may be any number and type of rechargeable batteries and\/or non-rechargeable batteries. Pursuant to a further illustration, the power source may be a combination of a solar cell and one or more batteries (e.g., rechargeable, non-rechargeable). Thus, for instance, a battery can supplement the power supplied by the solar cell (or vice versa) and\/or the solar cell can recharge a battery.","In embodiments, the wireless power source may supply power to the spotlights to enable installing, moving, replacing, etc. the wireless track light at substantially any indoor or outdoor location while mitigating the need for expensive and time consuming wiring and\/or utilization of aesthetically unpleasing and potentially inconvenient cords commonly associated with conventional lighting. In alternate embodiments the power source may include a fuel cell, such as and without limitation a hydrogen fuel cell, a reformed methanol fuel cell, or the like. In alternate embodiments, the power source may include a capacitor, array of capacitor, super capacitor, and the like, to store energy to be used as a power source similar to a battery. There may exist a charging mechanism such as a connector that allows the lights to plug into a charging base, a DC jack such that a wall transformer may be plugged into a normal AC outlet and into the DC jack to charge the unit or the light may contain a battery door allowing the rechargeable batteries to be removed, charged and replaced and the like.","In embodiments, it is to be appreciated that the wireless LED spotlight used to create the wireless track light may use RF or IR control, sensor control or any form of wireless control mentioned herein. By way of an example, the wireless track light with multiple RF controlled wireless spotlights may be controlled by a remote control RF transmitter. It is to be appreciated that the wireless LED spotlight may contain the intelligence necessary to implement the programmable functions for a wireless light module or apparatus mentioned herein. In some embodiments, the housing may not be similar to a spotlight but rather it may be similar to the ceiling light or any other form of housing for a wireless lighting module or apparatus mentioned herein. In some embodiments, there may be a rail or bar that mounts to the ceiling, wall or under cabinet and the wireless lights that make up the wireless track light attach to the rail or bar. In an alternate embodiment, the rail or bar may contain a wireless power source such as batteries such that the wireless lights are powered by that power source and may not contain a power source internally. In such a case, there may be electrical wiring from the power source within the rail or bar to the individual wireless lights. In an alternate embodiment, the rail or bar contains one or more connector that the lights plug in to that provide a power source and control. In some embodiments, the rail or bar may also contain a wireless control source that is wired to the wireless lights or is available at the connectors the lights plug into such that a single point of wireless control may control all of the wireless lights used with the wireless track light. In the embodiment where there is a mounting mechanism to mount the spotlights to support bars of a drop ceiling, there may be wireless power or wireless control installed above the support bar (i.e. hidden from sight) and wired to the wireless lights via wires that enter the wireless light at the mounting mechanism above the support bars of the drop ceiling.","In embodiments of the ceiling light, there may exist in the ceiling light module a carbon monoxide, smoke detectors, heat detector, flame detector and\/or thermal sensors in addition to any other form of wireless control or wireless power that may be present. In some embodiments there may be an indication of an alarm when the detector crosses some threshold. In such a case, the alarm may be audible through a bell, buzzer, horn, speaker etc. The ceiling light may also provide a visible indication of the alarm for example by blinking the light, illuminating a different color light source like a red LED or the like. In some embodiments, the ceiling light may contain a transmitter that may transmit a message to indicate an alarm and a disparate device may take action based on the alarm. By way of an example, the ceiling light may include a smoke detector that may transmit a message to a fire alarm system. In an alternate example, the ceiling lights may form a mesh network such that the detection of an alarm in one location may be propagated through the network such that other ceiling lights installed in the area may provide an alarm indication even if they do not directly detect the alarm situation. In one use case of this example, a set of eight ceiling lights with one or more of the sensors mentioned herein work as a group such that when one ceiling light detects the alarm, all of the ceiling lights generate an alarm automatically. In this case, there may be no need for a central controller and the distributed intelligence in the ceiling lights provides a standalone safety system. In an alternate embodiment, the ceiling light may contain a motion sensor such that it may be able to transmit a message to a home alarm system to provide an indication of an intruder. There may also be a button on the ceiling lights that allow a user to push the button to test the one or more ceiling lights such that when the button is pushed, the alarm message is propagated through the network. In alternate embodiments the unit is in the form of a night light or sensor light that may be mounted anywhere, there may exist in the night light or sensor light module a carbon monoxide, smoke detectors, heat detector, flame detector and\/or thermal sensors in addition to any other form of wireless control or wireless power that may be present and the indication of an alarm may be as mentioned herein. By way of an example, a motion sensor night light that is battery powered may operate under normal conditions as a night light that may be installed anywhere, however it may also contain a smoke detector such that when smoke is detected, an alarm indication of some type is asserted such as a buzzer to provide an audible indication of the alarm condition.","In another embodiment, a version of the wireless lighting module may target wireless LED spotlight applications where a UV or IR light source is present in the spotlight. When motion is detected, the LED spotlight turns on the UV or IR light source such that a detector (security camera etc) may be able to see the area illuminated by the UV or IR light without the light being visible to anyone or anything in the area. By way of an example, this application for safety and security may allow a user to see an intruder without the intruder knowing that they have been detected.","A number of methods have been mentioned herein by which a wireless light bulb or wireless lighting module may be programmed or configured for operation. The methods in embodiments of the programmable wireless light bulb or programmable wireless lighting module may include direct configuration or control of the unit through one or more buttons, dials, toggles, switches, levers, knobs, an LED touch screen, a keypad, or any such controls on the unit, configuration of the unit via the communication interface, configuration of the unit by design, configuration of the unit by factory pre-programming, configuration of the unit through processing the inputs and adjusting state appropriately, configuration of the unit through some sequence of action to indicated to the unit a configuration and the like. It is to be appreciated that any combination of programming or configuration method is possible in embodiments of a wireless light bulb or wireless lighting module.","In a direct configuration example, configuration and programming is controlled by the setting and use of one or more input devices accessible to the user on the unit itself. By way of an example, an AC powered wireless light bulb with a light sensor may have a dial on the unit that allows the user to set the net light level directly. To do this, the user may turn the light on in an environment with any amount of ambient light and turn the dial until the light intensity provided by the light plus the amount of ambient light is at a level desired by the user. Intelligence within the AC powered wireless light bulb with light sensor will thereafter monitor the detected light level from the light sensor and adjust the light intensity output to match the user setting. In an alternate direct configuration example, an AC powered wireless light bulb in a PAR30 form factor the user may have access to a slide switch with multiple positions each position representing a light output level. Intelligence, electrical circuitry etc in the bulb may detect the switch position and adjust the light intensity level based on the switch setting. For example, the light output level of the bulb in one setting may be equivalent in light output to a typical 40 W incandescent light bulb, in a second switch setting it may be equivalent to a 60 W incandescent light bulb and in a third switch setting it may be equivalent to 75 W incandescent light bulb. Thus the user may have one PAR30 light bulb that, by changing the switch position on the bulb, have available to them three different light bulb types. In an alternate example, the slide switch is replaced by a dial and the user may turn the dial to a more exact brightness level. In this example, when the dial is turned to the lowest setting, the bulb may have a light output equivalent to a typical 20 W incandescent light bulb and when the dial is turned to the highest setting, the bulb may have a light output equivalent to a typical 75 W incandescent bulb. Thus, the light output may be adjusted using the dial from equivalent to a 20 W incandescent bulb to the equivalent of a 75 W incandescent bulb. This function may be used a dimmer switch for bulbs that are used in applications where the bulb is within reach of the user, for example a desk lamp, a reading lamp, an interior automotive lamp etc where the dimmer switch is in effect located on the bulb itself.","In a configuration of the unit via the communication interface example, a wired or wireless connection to the unit may allow a user to configure or program a wireless light bulb or wireless lighting module by sending and receiving messages over the communication interface to program any functionality mentioned herein. It is to be appreciated that the wireless light bulb or wireless lighting module may contain volatile and\/or non-volatile memory to store the configuration or program information. In the example of the light bulb that may be set to a 40 W, 60 W or 75 W incandescent bulb equivalent, a command may be sent to the bulb over a communication interface to select the light intensity level for operation. In another example, the unit has a connector on the unit that a user may plug a cable with the other end plugged into some type of programming apparatus (computer, handheld etc.) such that a user may configure or program the unit using the programming apparatus. In a configuration of the unit by design or by configuration of the unit by factory pre-programming example, a wireless light bulb or wireless lighting module may have a level preset such that the user may expect the functionality to operate as such. For example, there may be a single auto-shutoff timer in a motion sensor controlled product where the auto-shutoff time is set in the design or pre-programmed at the factory based on a customer order. In an alternate example, a daylight harvesting wireless light bulb is preset such that the output light intensity plus the measurement of the ambient light level is maintained at a constant light level. In this case, a daylight harvesting bulb that maintains the equivalent ambient light level as a 60 W incandescent bulb by setting its output light intensity to meet the preprogrammed light detection level equivalent to the 60 W incandescent bulb.","In a configuration of the unit through processing the inputs and adjusting state appropriately or configuration of the unit through some sequence of action to indicate to the unit a configuration, the unit may learn its configuration and in effect program itself for operation. For example, a motion sensor controlled wireless light bulb or wireless lighting module that also contains a time of day clock may detect a lot of motion at certain times of the day. If the motion statistics exceed a certain level, the unit may program itself to turn on automatically at that time of day just prior to when the detections would indicated the expected motion. In an alternate example, power sequencing may be used to configure the operation of a wireless light bulb. If the power is sequenced on, then off, then on again in durations of time understood by the wireless light bulb, the bulb may be configured for a specific operation. For example, if a motion controlled wireless light bulb is turned on and left on, the motion sensor may be disabled. If the power is sequenced in the manner described, the motion sensor may be enabled and controls the wireless light bulb until power is turned off.","In an embodiment, a wireless AC outlet may be designed with batteries embedded to provide power to any kind of electrical device that plugs into the outlet. The adapter may contain an integrated wireless power source (batteries for example), a DC\/AC inverter and control that is either wireless control or manual control such as a switch on the wireless AC outlet that may turn it on or off. The user may then plug in AC powered devices to the wireless AC outlet to power that device. By way of an example, a wireless AC outlet may be mounted to a wall in any location the user desires or it may be mounted to a post that may be driven into the ground. It is to be appreciated that the wireless AC outlet may be designed in any housing and contain any mounting mechanism as required by a particular application. It is to be appreciated that the power supplied by the wireless AC outlet may be limited to the energy delivery capacity of the integrated power source. By way of an example, a wireless AC outlet with a single AC socket and 4 C alkaline batteries may be limited to the power that the C batteries may be able to provide to an AC powered device. In embodiments that are powered by batteries, the wireless AC outlet may contain a battery door that allows the batteries to be removed and replaced with fresh batteries. In an alternate embodiment, the wireless AC outlet may contain rechargeable batteries and a method to charge the batteries. The wireless AC outlet may contain a connector that allows it to plug into a charging base, it may contain a DC jack such that a wall transformer may be plugged into a normal AC outlet and into the DC jack on the wireless AC outlet, it may contain a battery door allowing the rechargeable batteries to be removed, charged and replaced and the like. In alternate embodiments, the wireless AC outlet may contain an energy harvesting wireless power source and integrated rechargeable batteries such that the energy harvesting source may provide power to the wireless AC outlet and\/or charge the batteries as necessary. By way of an example, a wireless AC outlet contains solar cells and an electrical circuit necessary to take the energy received from the solar cells and provide power for the wireless AC outlet, charge the batteries and\/or share the load between the solar cells and batteries.","In embodiments containing a grid tie inverter, the capability for a user to explicitly command a return of power to the grid may exist. For example, a user may have a control mechanism that may detect the battery charge levels in a device containing a grid tie inverter and if the user desires to return power to the grid the ability to command such a return exists. It may exist through software control or the like, but it may also exist through direct control on the device itself. In some embodiments, the user may have the ability to command the return of power to the grid based on battery capacity level such that there will be some reserve energy storage if needed. The user may set an upper threshold of battery capacity level to begin the return of power to the grid and a lower threshold of battery capacity level where the return of power to the grid may stop to maintain a reserve energy storage level or to prevent over discharge of the battery to optimize rechargeable battery life. Thus the user may be able to control the return of energy to the grid such that there is not a situation when a battery is fully charged when it is advantageous to be charging the battery (for example some time prior to off peak hours when the battery may start charging again). In alternate embodiments, the explicit command to return energy to the grid may come from the power company, from a smart meter, from a remote connection where the user may access such controls over the Internet and so on.","In an embodiment of a wireless lighting apparatus, a book light consisting of a book with circuitry embedded, integrated power source such as a battery, switch and one or more LEDs may be designed such that when a reader opens the book, a switch opens or closes with the opening the book and the LED is illuminated. When the book is closed, the LED is turned off. In some embodiments, there may be another switch to enable or disable the LED light if the user desires. In some embodiments, the one or more LEDs may be attached to an arm that elevates as the book opens. In this case, the one or more LEDs may be directed in a way that they would point toward the area where the illumination is needed. By way of an example, the book light may be used in a restaurant check book such that when a diner opens the book to view their check, the LED illuminates the check area. When they close the check book, the LED shuts off. In this example, the check book light consists of a coin cell battery, a push button that disables the light by pressing the button while the check book is closed and an LED to illuminate the check book when open.","In an embodiment, an AC outlet adapter may be designed with batteries embedded to provide power to an alarm clock when there is a power outage. By way of an example, the adapter may plug into an AC wall outlet and also have an AC socket that the alarm clock plugs into. In an alternate embodiment, the AC outlet adapter that the alarm clock plugs into provides backup power for the alarm clock but also contains an LED reading light that is powered by the AC outlet adapter. The LED reading light may be attached to a flexible arm such that the user may be able to articulate the light in the direction needed to provide illumination as necessary. There may be a control mechanism, such as an on\/off switch, at any point on the LED reading light such that the user may turn the LED reading light on or off as desired without affecting the battery backup for the alarm clock.","In embodiments of the wireless light bulb or wireless lighting module where one communication interface is WIFI, the wireless light bulb or wireless lighting module may also be able to act as a WIFI repeater device. In such a case, the wireless light bulb or wireless lighting module is capable of operating on a single channel and receive then transmit packets on WIFI. In alternate embodiments, the wireless light bulb or wireless lighting module may operate on multiple WIFI channels such that the unit may be able to receive traffic on one channel and transmit that traffic on a different channel. It is to be appreciated that as a WIFI repeater, the wireless light bulb or wireless lighting module operate on any number of channels as required.","In embodiments of the wireless light bulb or wireless lighting module, the light source may be LED, compact fluorescent, fluorescent, induction, halogen, gas discharge, organic LED (OLED), plasma, radio generated plasma or incandescent. In one example, a wireless light bulb may be designed with one or more OLED panels as the light source. The OLED wireless light bulb may be designed in any type of housing mentioned for a wireless light bulb. In one example, the OLED wireless light bulb is designed to mount to a ceiling or replace a ceiling panel. The OLED wireless light bulb may contain any form of wireless control, power source and\/or intelligence control typical of a wireless light bulb. In another example, wireless light bulb may be designed with a radio generated plasma light source. The radio generated plasma wireless light bulb may be designed in any type of housing mentioned for a wireless light bulb. In one example, the radio generated plasma wireless light bulb is designed in an A19 bulb housing. The radio generated plasma wireless light bulb may contain any form of wireless control, power source and\/or intelligence control typical of a wireless light bulb.","The previously mentioned wireless lighting modules can be grouped into kits to meet specific user applications. A residential or commercial power saver kit can be constructed of any mix of wireless lighting module light bulbs in a kit to allow installation in a residential or commercial building for savings on energy bills. For example, a home power saver kit that includes ten AC powered, battery backed wireless lighting module light bulbs can be used by a consumer to replace the R30 incandescent bulbs in their house that would typically be used in recessed lighting fixtures at substantial savings on power consumption.","A residential or commercial emergency lighting kit can be constructed of any mix of wireless lighting module light bulbs in a kit to allow installation in a residential or commercial building for switching over automatically to battery backup when an AC power outage is detected. For example, an emergency lighting kit that includes twenty AC powered, battery backed wireless lighting module light bulbs can be used by a consumer to replace the R30 incandescent bulbs in their house that would typically be used in recessed lighting fixtures at substantial savings on power consumption.","In embodiments of wireless light bulbs or battery powered wireless lighting fixtures containing a PIR device for motion sensing, a thermal sensor may be present to provide a measurement of temperature to allow temperature compensation of the threshold for motion detection. In some embodiments, a temperature dependant voltage may be generated using a thermistor, a resistor network and a supply voltage where the output voltage is dependent on the resistance of the thermistor and that output voltage may be used to derive the threshold voltage used for motion detection. Thus, the change in sensitivity of the motion sensor over temperature may be compensated for by changing the threshold of the motion detection circuit. By way of an example, an operational amplifier used as a comparator at the output of the motion sensing circuitry has a threshold that the voltage that is a representation of the detected motion is compared against. Over temperature, the amplified output of the PIR sensor may vary to the point that false triggers may occur which would turn the light on when motion is not detected or has not been detected sufficiently to turn the light on. If the threshold at the comparator varies with temperature, the threshold may move higher or lower compensating for the changes in performance of the PIR sensor and motion detector circuitry. In an alternate embodiment, the temperature is measured, converted from analog to digital, read by a microcontroller and the microcontroller may set a threshold value through a digital to analog conversion based on the temperature reading. In such a case, to determine the proper threshold level the microcontroller may have an algorithm programmed in it to calculate the required threshold based on the measured temperature, the microcontroller may contain a lookup table such that stored in memory a lookup using the read temperature will return the required threshold value and the like. In another embodiment, the wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture may have a communication interface such that a processor that has a measurement of temperature may send a command to the bulb or fixture to set the motion detection threshold for compensation. It is to be appreciated that any method of measuring temperature and using that information to modify the threshold based on the input temperature may be used.","In embodiments of wireless light bulbs or battery powered wireless lighting fixtures containing any type of sensor, power circuitry, LED driver circuit or LED device that may change performance over temperature, a thermal sensor may be present to provide a measurement of temperature to allow the behavior of the sensor, power circuitry, LED driver circuitry or LED device to be adjusted over temperature. The adjustment based on detected temperature may be measured using any type of temperature measuring mechanism mentioned herein. An electrical circuit, microcontroller, microprocessor, ASIC etc may be present to process the measured temperature make an adjustment based on the measurement. By way of an example, one or more thermal sensors may be connected to the heatsink which the one or more LED devices are attached to. A measurement of the heatsink temperature may be used to adjust the LED driver circuit current to a lower or higher drive level based on the temperature reading. For example, if there is a maximum heatsink temperature allowable, when the detected temperature is read at or close to that level, an electrical circuit, microcontroller, microprocessor, ASIC etc may reduce the drive current such that there is less heat generated by the LEDs and subsequently the temperature will remain the same or start to lower due to the change in drive current. It is to be appreciated that the drive current may be adjusted based on the temperature measurement of any one or more components of a wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture or a measurement of the ambient temperature inside or outside of the wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture. By way of another example, a light sensor may be used for daylight harvesting such that the detected value of the ambient light level may be used to set the light intensity of the light source such that the total light maintains some constant level. A thermal sensor may be used for compensation of the light sensor over temperature such that the ambient light measurement is adjusted over temperature. For example, a microcontroller may read a voltage level at the output of a light sensor circuit through an analog to digital converter. The microcontroller may also read a temperature dependant voltage that is generated using a thermistor, a resistor network and a supply voltage. The microcontroller may control the light intensity of the light source based on the reading of the ambient light level adjusted based on the temperature measurement. In another example, the measured temperature may be used to change the gain of a receiver circuit for better operation over the operating temperature range. It is to be appreciated that the measured temperature may be used to adjust any sensor, power circuitry, LED driver circuit or LED device with preset temperature curves that determine a lookup table to provide the adjustment, an algorithm to derive the adjustment to be done based on temperature and\/or time, an automatic adjustment done by an electrical circuit designed to make the adjust based on the temperature reading, an adjustment received over a communication interface and the like.","In one embodiment, an AC powered battery embedded motion wireless light bulb contains rechargeable batteries and a PIR motion sensor. In some embodiments, there may be a light sensor inside the bulb to enable the motion sensor for operation or to be used for daylight harvesting. A charging circuit that supports recharging the batteries in circuit may be inside the bulb. There may be circuitry to allow either power source to be used independently or to share the load depending on whether each power source is present and able to supply power to the wireless light bulb. An electrical circuit, microcontroller, microprocessor, ASIC etc may be present to perform the selection of which power source to use. The selection of which power source to use may be programming into the wireless light bulb through preprogramming at the factory or the like, through a programming method over a communication interface that may be present in the bulb or it may be set directly on the unit through a method of control such as a dial, push buttons, slide switches and the like where a user may set whether to use the AC power source, the battery power source or a sharing of the load between AC and battery power, to enable or disable the motion sensor, to set the auto-shutoff time period, to set the light intensity level in a mode of operation or to enable or disable the light sensor. In some embodiments, there may be a time of day clock or timer present to control state changes or change the configuration based on time of day. By way of an example, the AC powered battery embedded motion wireless light bulb may be enabled during daytime hours to be controlled by the AC wall switch where the unit is AC powered. During evening hours or during a detected power outage, the AC powered battery embedded motion wireless light bulb is powered by battery power and is controlled by the motion sensor to turn the light source on and off. In some embodiments, the AC powered battery embedded motion wireless light bulb may include a fade-to-off effect, fade-to-dim effect, fade-to-glow effect, fade from one light intensity level to another light intensity level and so on. In some embodiments, the AC powered battery embedded motion wireless light bulb may include an increase in light intensity over time which may include an off-to-glow effect, glow-to-dim, glow-to-some light intensity level, an increase from one light intensity level to a higher light intensity level and so on. It is to be appreciated that the change from one light intensity level to another light intensity level may happen over any period of time that may be implemented with the timers. In some embodiments, the AC powered battery embedded motion wireless light bulb may include a daylight harvesting function which allows for the light intensity level of the light source to be set based on the detected ambient light level.","In some embodiments, the AC powered battery embedded motion wireless light bulb may sense the state of one or more switches or breakers in the controlling circuit and switch over to battery power if the detected switch state indicates that the AC power should be present, but AC power is not present. The device may also measure the impedance, resistance, and\/or capacitance across the AC power input and return or may measure any other electrical characteristic of the AC power input and return to determine whether the controlling switch or breaker is open or closed (or if electricity has been turned off at any point up to the AC input of the device). By way of an example, if the controlling switch or breaker is open, there may be a high impedance detected across the input AC power and return. If the controlling switch or breaker is closed, there may be a measureable impedance, resistance and\/or capacitance or electrical characteristic different from when the controlling switch or breaker is open. A threshold may be set in the device such that if the measurement is above or below the threshold, the switch or breaker is closed, and if the measurement is on the opposite side of the threshold, the switch or breaker is open. The device may be controlled by the state of the controlling switch or breaker (on or off), but may also detect the condition when the controlling switch or breaker is closed but AC input power is not present or is not acceptable and may be able to switch over to the rechargeable or non-rechargeable batteries that are embedded as the power source. In some embodiments, the AC powered battery embedded motion wireless light bulb may perform an impedance discontinuity check to determine if the controlling switch of breaker is open or closed. In some embodiments, the AC powered battery embedded motion wireless light bulb may generate a signal onto the line and monitor the electrical response of the line to determine if the response indicates an open circuit that may be indicative of a switch or breaker open in the lighting circuit. It is to be appreciated that when the switch sense functionality is implemented, the switch or breaker may still be able to turn on and off power to the AC powered battery embedded motion wireless light bulb even when running off of the embedded battery power source because the AC powered battery embedded motion wireless light bulb may be able to determine if the switch is on or off and apply power or not apply power to the AC powered battery embedded motion wireless light bulb based on the switch position. In such a case, the switch sense circuitry may still need to be powered along with any other necessary circuitry to implement this function even when the AC powered battery embedded motion wireless light bulb is not being powered.","In embodiments of wireless light bulbs or battery powered wireless lighting fixtures containing a motion sensing capability, there may be a number of methods by which motion is detected. There may be a radar based motion sensor where a transmitter exists in the wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture to transmit pulses of radio frequency or microwave. The wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture may contain a receiver to receive the reflected waves allowing it to determine if there is an object in range, how far away the object is, the velocity of the object and other characteristics of the object. Thus, using a radar based motion sensor may allow detection of an object in the detection area, not just that the object is moving. A radar based motion sensor may provide information about the range to the object which may allow for intelligent decisions to be made about whether the object that is detected should trigger a change of state of the wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture. By way of an example, a wireless light bulb may turn on only when an object is within 20 feet of the wireless light bulb. A radar based motion sensor may determine that an object is 30 feet away and thereby, even though the object is detected, still not turn the light on or turn the light on to a lower light intensity until the object moves within 20 feet. It is to be appreciated that the transmitter may be disparate meaning that the transmitter may not be built into the bulb or fixture but rather may be a separate standalone unit where a receiver in the bulb or fixture may receive the transmitted pulses and reflections of the transmitted pulses that were generated by the disparate transmitter device and react based on the reception without having to have transmitted the pulses. It is to be appreciated that a radar wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture may operate in any radio band with any form of modulation where a radar based motion sensor may be operate.","In other embodiments of wireless light bulbs or battery powered wireless lighting fixtures containing a motion sensing capability, there may a sonar based motion sensor where sound propagation is used by the wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture to detect objects in the field of view. An acoustic transmitter that may transmit any frequency acoustic wave creates the wave and a receiver listens for the echo return of the transmission. Intelligence in the wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture may analyze the received signal and determine if an object is in the field of view and the distance to that object. Thus, using a sonar based motion sensor may allow detection of an object in the detection area, not just that the object is moving. A sonar based motion sensor may provide information about the range to the object which may allow for intelligent decisions to be made out whether the object that is detected should trigger a change of state of the wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture. It is to be appreciated that the acoustic transmitter may be disparate meaning that the transmitter may not be built into the bulb or fixture but rather may be a separate standalone unit where a receiver in the bulb or fixture may receive the echo return of the transmissions that were generated by the disparate transmitter device and react based on the reception without having to have transmitted the pulses.","In some embodiments of wireless light bulbs or battery powered wireless lighting fixtures there may be a disparate magnetic switch and an RF or IR transmitter that detects when the magnetic switch is open, closed or has just changed state and may transmit the state information to a wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture containing a receiver. Thus, a magnetic switch sensor may be placed anywhere (where the magnet and magnetic switch may be separate housings) to detect a make or break of the magnet and magnetic switch. By way of an example, the magnetic switch may be attached to a door or window frame and the magnet may be attached to the door or window. When the door or window is closed, the magnetic switch may be actuated. When the door or window is opened, the magnetic switch changes state and the disparate magnetic switch and transmitter transmits the change of state information to one or more wireless light bulbs or battery powered fixtures that may be controlled by the disparate sensor. It is to be appreciated that the magnetic switch and magnet may be attached to any two items that a user may desire a separation of the two items to change the state of one or more wireless light bulbs or battery powered lighting fixtures. In alternate embodiments the magnetic switch is not a disparate device but rather is located in or on the housing of the wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture and the magnet is external to the housing such that the wireless light bulb or battery powered fixture receives a direct indication of the state or change in state of the magnetic switch with respect to the magnet.","In some embodiments of wireless light bulbs or battery powered wireless lighting fixtures there may be a disparate pressure switch and an RF or IR transmitter that detects when the pressure switch is open, closed or has just changed state and may transmit the state information to a wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture containing a receiver. Thus, a pressure switch sensor may be placed anywhere to detect when an actuating force is applied to the switch. By way of an example, a pressure switch may be embedded in flooring such that when an object is detect on the flooring, for example a person walking across the floor, the pressure switch changes state and transmits the state information to one or more wireless light bulbs or battery powered wireless lighting fixtures that may be controlled by the disparate sensor. It is to be appreciated that the pressure switch may be attached to any item that a user may desire a detection of pressure applied to the item to control the state of one or more wireless light bulbs or battery powered lighting fixtures. In alternate embodiments the pressure switch is not a disparate device but rather is located in or on the housing of the wireless light bulb or battery powered fixture such that the wireless light bulb or battery powered fixture receives a direct indication of the state or change in state of the pressure switch. In alternate embodiments, more than one pressure switch is monitored and the result of a state change of any of the pressure switches may be transmitted by the RF or IR transmitter. By way of an example, a large mat of pressure switches may be installed under carpeting such that any pressure switch change of state may be transmitted to the wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture. This way the pressure switches may cover an area and it would be less likely that someone or something may pass the pressure switch mat without being detected.","In some embodiments of wireless light bulbs or battery powered wireless lighting fixtures there may a disparate infrared beam or laser beam created by a transmitter and receiver and an RF or IR transmitter that detects when the infrared beam or laser beam between the infrared or laser transmitter and receiver is present or broken or has just changed state and may transmit the state information to a wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture containing a receiver. Thus, an infrared beam or laser beam break may be detected by placing the infrared or laser transmitter and separate receiver anywhere. By way of an example, an infrared transmitter and receiver may be installed at the end of a driveway such that when an automobile drives into the driveway, it breaks the infrared transmission that is detected by the receiver. The infrared beam changes state due to the beam break and the infrared receiver device transmits the state information to one or more wireless light bulbs or battery powered wireless lighting fixtures that may be controlled by the disparate infrared beam break. It is to be appreciated that the infrared or laser transmitter and receiver may be attached to any two items that a user may desire a detection of an object between the infrared or laser transmitter or receiver to control the state of one or more wireless light bulbs or battery powered lighting fixtures. In alternate embodiments the infrared receiver is not a disparate device but rather is located in or on the housing of the wireless light bulb or battery powered fixture such that the wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture receives a direct indication of the state or change in state of the infrared or laser transmitter and receiver beam break.","In embodiments of wireless light bulbs or battery powered wireless lighting fixtures containing a motion sensing capability, there may be a number of mechanisms to control how the motion sensing is used to control the wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixtures. In some embodiments, the motion sensor may be enabled or disable through the use of a time of day or timer control such that the motion sensor will be enabled or disabled based on a time setting that is programmed into the bulb or fixture. In some embodiments, there may be an external control mechanism that allows a user to enable or disable the motion sensor. By way of an example, a motion sensor wireless light bulb may be controlled by a wall switch that has an additional switch on it allowing a user to enable or disable the motion sensor (i.e. override the motion sensor) such that the primary control mechanism will be the wall switch or some other mechanism when the switch is in one position and the primary control mechanism will be the motion sensor when the switch is in the other position. By way of another example, there may be an RF or IR receiver in the wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture that would allow a user to enable or disable motion sensor control using a remote control that may transmit the control to the bulb or fixture. The remote control may be have controls such as pushbuttons, switches, dials etc that enables, disables or changes the sensitivity of the motion sensor control. The remote control may set time of day or timer control of when the motion sensor control is active. A light sensor may be used to enable or disable the motion sensor. The light sensor may be used to disable the motion sensor during the daytime when the amount of ambient light that is detected is above a threshold. The light sensor may be used to determine which other control mechanisms may be used instead of motion sensing. By way of an example, in an embodiment of the wireless light bulb, the light sensor may enable motion detection during the night, but during the daytime the wall switch will control power to the wireless light bulb.","In embodiments of wireless light bulbs or battery powered wireless lighting fixtures containing a motion sensing capability, there may be an ability to change the field of view of the motion sensor by positioning the motion sensor to change the field of view. By way of an example, a wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture may contain a PIR sensor that is mounted to a mechanical apparatus that may allow for \u201ctelescoping\u201d the sensor such that it may be pointed in any direction required for motion detection. In an alternate embodiment, a radar or sonar transmitter and\/or receiver may be capable of pointing in any direction required for a field of view where motion is to be detected. Thus, the capability to telescope or point the motion sensor in any direction allows the motion sensor to be placed in the optimal position for motion detection.","In some embodiments of wireless light bulbs or battery powered wireless lighting fixtures there may be an ability to detect sound or spoken commands and change the state of the bulb or fixture based on the sound or spoken commands. By way of an example, a wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture may contain a microphone and the intelligence to process speech such that if a user speaks commands such as \u201cBulbs on\u201d, \u201cBulbs off\u201d, \u201cDim up\u201d, \u201cDim down\u201d or the like the bulb or fixture may change state based on the command detected by speech.","In an embodiment of a wireless light bulb powered from only AC power or powered only by battery power or in embodiments of a battery powered wireless lighting fixtures, the wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture may contain intelligence to control the light source based on time of day and may be programmed by controls on the housing of the bulb or fixture. Those controls may be in the form of pushbuttons, switches, dials etc. By way of an example, the time of day wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture may contain ON, OFF and PROGRAM pushbuttons. At the specific time of day that the user desires the bulb or fixture to automatically turn on, the user presses the ON and PROGRAM buttons simultaneously. A microcontroller, microprocessor, ASIC etc may contain a time source, such as a real time clock, free running timer or the like, and may contain the intelligence to record that time and a state change based on that time such that every day at that time or on regular intervals of the free running timer, the time of day wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture will automatically turn on. At another specific time during the day that the user desires the bulb or fixture to turn off, the user presses the OFF and PROGRAM buttons simultaneously. In alternate embodiments, there may be controls to set the light intensity of the bulb or fixture. In such embodiments, there may be a DIM UP and DIM DOWN pushbutton, dial switch or the like control and a method to use the PROGRAM button or similar to record the change in light intensity at that time. By way of an example, the user may desire to reduce the light intensity during the day due to the higher ambient light levels and therefore may use the DIM DOWN control to set the new light intensity level first thing in the morning, then use the PROGRAM button in some manner to program that light intensity level change at that time of the day every day. The user may then set a higher intensity level at night time by using the DIM UP control to increase the light intensity level and then use the PROGRAM button to program that light intensity level at that time every day. There may be a CLEAR control mechanism that may allow a user to clear programmed state changes. It is to be appreciated that the user may program as many on, off and light intensity setting at different times of day as may be programmed into the device. Programming by time of day may provide some cost savings in energy usage when lighting needs to be on most or all of the day. It is to be appreciated that there may be any number of changes in the light output and the light intensity may be set to any level from off to maximum light intensity. In alternate embodiments, the same control may be provided by a communication interface in the bulb or fixture such that similar ON, OFF, DIM UP, DIM DOWN, PROGRAM and the like controls are on a remote control. The external device communicating with and controlling or programming the bulb or fixture may be a computer running a software program, a custom remote control, a building management unit, a lighting circuit control unit etc. and may have the communication interface allowing it to communicate with the bulb or fixture. It is to be appreciated that settings programmed in the bulb or fixture may be stored in non-volatile memory such that when the device is powered down, the programming is not lost. It is to be appreciated that there may be an integrated power source that may allow the real time clock or timers to continue running when power to a wireless light bulb is turned off. In embodiments that are only powered by battery power, the intelligence may also use battery capacity level to set the light intensity output. In such an example, battery power may be rechargeable or non-rechargeable batteries or fuel cells. It is to be appreciated that any wireless power source or any combination of wireless power sources may be used to supply power to or recharge energy storage in the bulb or fixture in connection with the battery powered bulb or fixture controlled based on time of day.","In an embodiment of the UPS light bulb, the UPS light bulb is not in a typical housing such as a standard size bulb, non-standard size bulb, fixture, fluorescent bulb, fluorescent lamp or down light assembly, but is rather an adapter that plugs into an existing fixture that a standard size bulb, non-standard size bulb, fluorescent bulb or lamp would plug into such that this UPS light bulb adapter may provide all of the functionality of the UPS light bulb including a light source in the UPS light bulb adapter in addition to the off the shelf bulbs or lamps plugged into it. By way of an example, the UPS light bulb adapter has a light source in the adapter. The UPS light bulb adapter typically will pass power through to the bulb or lamp plugged into it such that the bulb or lamp may be the light source. When the UPS light bulb adapter detects that power has dropped out (i.e. there is a power outage) or some other characteristic that makes power no longer desirable to use (brownout conditions, electrical surges, overvoltage conditions, voltage sag or flickers, line noise, frequency variations, switching transients, harmonic distortion, etc.), the adapter may turn on its embedded light source powered by the power source integrated into the UPS light bulb adapter. Thus, a UPS light bulb adapter may typically consist of a connector allowing it to plug into a socket, a socket connector allowing a bulb or lamp to plug into it, a housing allowing it to fit into the fixture where it will be installed, a light source, an integrated power source and charging circuitry if needed, power circuitry such as an AC\/DC converter, input from a ballast controller or the like, circuitry to monitor the power input and any wireless control that may be used to control the UPS light bulb adapter such as a receiver allowing a remote transmitter to control the UPS light bulb adapter. It is to be appreciated that the light source may be located in a manner to direct light out of an existing fixture to provide light coming out of the existing fixture with the bulb or lamp plugged into it. For example, if a PAR30 light bulb plugs into the UPS light bulb adapter in a fixture and the UPS light bulb adapter contains an LED light source, the one or more LEDs may be mounted on UPS light bulb adapter housing such that the light emitted from the one or more LEDs is pointed to the outer edge of the PAR30 light bulb. When the LED light source of the UPS light bulb adapter is turned on, the light emitted by the LED light source will be from behind the PAR30 light bulb, but will be directed toward the opening between the edge of the PAR30 light bulb and the fixture such that the PAR30 light bulb would obstruct as little of the light as possible. By way of an example, in a six inch recessed fixture, the UPS light bulb adapter is plugged into the Edison socket. An R30 bulb is plugged into the UPS light bulb adapter. The UPS light bulb adapter may switch on the backup light source and integrated power source for any reason. For example, the UPS light bulb adapter may have the circuitry present to monitor the input AC power at the Edison socket. If the UPS light bulb adapter detects that power is not present at the Edison socket, the light source may be turned on. The UPS light bulb adapter may contain a relay or switching circuit such that power to the bulb or lamp plugged in may be opened by the UPS light bulb adapter whether power is present or not. In such a case, the UPS light bulb adapter may make intelligent decisions based on programming, wireless control or sensors on the adapter to switch to the backup light source or a user may explicitly switch over to the backup light source. The UPS light bulb adapter may contain the circuitry to sense the state of the one or more controlling switches or breakers in the lighting circuit in any manner mentioned here in (measuring the impedance, resistance, and\/or capacitance at the AC power input, testing for an impedance discontinuity in the path to the AC input etc).","In one use case of an emergency lighting system, the lighting consists of wireless light bulbs or battery powered wireless lighting fixtures that are off grid and may receive transmission from a power outage module or an emergency lighting power outage module such that a detected condition that would require a switchover to emergency lighting, such as a power outage, would trigger a transmission to a detached emergency lighting system consisting of wireless light bulbs or battery powered wireless lighting fixtures containing one or more wireless power sources. They may have a connection to grid power, but typically the detached emergency lighting system will be entirely off grid. The wireless light bulbs or battery powered wireless lighting fixtures may have one or more forms of wireless control. The bulbs or fixtures may have a transceiver that would allow them to wirelessly communicate with one or more disparate wireless light bulbs and battery powered wireless lighting fixtures to enable coordinated operation between more than one bulb and\/or fixture. Following this example, an input can be retransmitted within a network of wireless light bulbs and battery powered wireless lighting fixtures, where the network of lighting modules can be dispersed within a geographic area to create a detached emergency lighting system over a large area. By way of an example, an outdoor emergency lighting system may be created that is detached by using battery powered wireless lighting fixtures and a power outage module. Because the battery powered wireless lighting fixtures may be installed anywhere, a user may install them where there are no on grid power connections and still get lighting in an emergency situation. The battery powered wireless lighting fixtures may come in the form of stair lights, spotlights, path lights, exit signs and lighting, stair well lights, floor lights, ceiling lights, hallway lights, sconces etc to provide lighting in an emergency situation. If all of the battery powered wireless lighting fixtures are within range, the power outage module may directly turn them on during an emergency situation. If all of the battery powered wireless lighting fixtures are not in range, a network may be formed to propagate the emergency lighting commands to all of the lights in the detached emergency lighting system. In another example, the emergency lighting system provides egress or exit lighting to meet emergency lighting requirements using wireless light bulbs and\/or battery powered wireless lighting fixtures that may be on and\/or off grid and directly detect a power outage by monitoring the power connection by detecting a loss of power, by using the switch sense capability or other methods for determining that a switchover to the internal power source is necessary and switching to its internal power source in the emergency situation. In some cases, the bulbs and fixtures may have a transceiver that would allow them to wirelessly communicate with one or more disparate wireless light bulbs and battery powered wireless lighting fixtures to enable coordinated operation between more than one bulb and\/or fixture such that some devices may detect the emergency condition and a network of wireless light bulbs and battery powered wireless lighting fixtures may propagate the emergency indication through the network. In an alternate example, the bulbs and\/or fixtures used for egress or exit lighting may receive transmission from a power outage module or an emergency lighting power outage module such that a detected condition that would require a switchover to emergency lighting, such as a power outage, would trigger a transmission to the elements of the emergency lighting system consisting of wireless light bulbs or battery powered wireless lighting fixtures containing one or more wireless power sources.","In some embodiments, a wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture may be built into an explosion proof or flame proof housing. The wireless light bulbs or battery powered wireless lighting fixtures may have a connection to on grid power and also have an integrated power source such as rechargeable batteries. In an emergency situation, such as an explosion or a fire in an industrial environment, the wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture may switch over to the integrated power source to continue to provide lighting after the emergency situation for an extended period of time. It is to be appreciated that there may be one or more lenses, reflectors, optical filters, aperture, and so on that are integrated into the housing of the explosion or flame proof wireless light such that the light source may be protected from the cause of the hazard.","In some embodiments, a wireless light bulb or a battery powered wireless lighting fixture used may have an indication of a low battery level. There may be a method to test the bulb or fixture, such as a button that may be pressed to briefly test that the light output powered by an integrated power source is healthy, that may provide an indication of the battery level. In some embodiments where there is an external power source, a button or switch may be used to break the connection of external power into the wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture to perform a test of the operation of the bulb or fixture when powered by the internal power source. In alternate embodiments, the button or switch may be replaced by a remote control and wireless receiver that provides the same operation when the button or switch on the remote control is actuated. By way of an example, a user may walk under a wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture and press a button on the remote control forcing a test of the light, forcing an indication of the battery level to become active or alternately forcing a break in the connection of external power into the bulb or fixture so that the user may determine that the light is operating properly using the integrated power source. In alternate embodiments, the wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture may have a transmitter designed in that may transmit a representation of the battery charge level to allow an external system such as a computer, laptop, handheld computer, dedicated hardware etc. to provide a user with a status on whether the battery power is at an acceptable level. By way of an example, in an emergency lighting system, a battery powered wireless lighting fixture may transmit its battery charge level to a central controlling station that would then provide an alarm to a user when the battery charge level is below a threshold. The user may then replace the batteries. In alternate embodiments, there is one or more colored LEDs or a multicolor LED on the wireless light bulb or wireless lighting module that may provide a visual indication of the battery charge level.","In some embodiments of wireless light bulbs and battery powered wireless lighting fixtures there may be a receiver that may receive an emergency broadcast such as a radio broadcast of the emergency broadcast system. In such embodiments, the bulbs or fixtures that detect the broadcast switch over to a mode to indicate to the users that there is an emergency situation such as blinking the lights. In alternate embodiments, the bulbs or fixtures may receive a local broadcast that a user may make to provide a visual indication provided by the lighting of an event. For example, a user may blink the lights three times to indicate that it is the end of break time and that workers on a break need to return to their stations. In another example, a school may blink lights some number of times in certain areas to indicate that the end of a period or session. In another example, an office building may blink some number of lights continuously to indicate an emergency situation. It is to be appreciated that wireless light bulbs or battery powered wireless lighting fixtures may receive a command and control the light output, color and intensity in any way possible to communicate a message to an audience. Any type of remote control can wirelessly communicate with the wireless light bulbs or battery powered wireless lighting fixtures to control or program this functionality into them. For instance, the remote control can be a stand-alone remote control and\/or incorporated into a disparate device (e.g., incorporated into a key fob, a programmable wireless transceiver integrated in an automobile.). Moreover, the remote control can be a personal computer, a cellular phone, a smart phone, a laptop, a handheld communication device, a handheld computing device, a global positioning system, a personal digital assistant (PDA), and\/or any other suitable device.","In some embodiments of an emergency lighting system, there may be a UPS light bulb, wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture with a receiver and a remote light sensor transmitter. The remote light sensor transmitter may be configured to detect the level of light and transmit to the UPS light bulb, wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture to turn them on or off. A user may install one or more bulbs or fixtures and place the remote light sensor transmitter in a location where the user knows it should detect a high amount of ambient light. If the remote light sensor transmitter is no longer detecting light, it may mean there is a power outage and the lighting is disabled. The remote light sensor transmitter would then transmit to the UPS light bulb, wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture a command to change state such as switch to back up power, turn on, change the light intensity etc. It is to be appreciated that the remote light sensor transmitter may be detecting lighting that is not a UPS light bulb, wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture. In such a case, the remote light sensor transmitter may be used to switch to an alternate light source for example for the purpose of emergency lighting. In other embodiments, the light sensor is built into the UPS light bulb or wireless light bulb and detects when the lights go off due to a power outage or other reason. In such a case, the light sensor is powered by the integrated power source. When input power is lost, the UPS light bulb or wireless light bulb may detect this because the light sensor will no longer detect light coming out of the UPS light bulb or wireless light bulb at which point the bulb may switch over to the integrated power source until it may detect that input power is restored. Thus, the light sensor, whether remote or built directly into a light, will provide an indication when there is not light coming out and may effect a state change based on that information. In one use case, a remote light sensor transmitter is installed at a six inch recessed fixture where there is an R30 bulb and battery powered wireless lighting path lights are installed around the perimeter of the area. The remote light sensor transmitter is installed in the recessed fixture where it may detect whether light is coming out of that recessed fixture. If the remote light sensor transmitter detects that light is not coming out, it may transmit a command to the path lights installed around the perimeter to turn on. It is to be appreciated that the remote light sensor transmitter may have controls built in such as buttons, switches, dials etc to configure it for operation. For example, a dial may be present to set the threshold ambient light level that would trigger the transmitter to send a message to the lights it is controlling to turn them on, change light intensity etc. In another example, the remote light sensor transmitter may be disabled with a push button to turn off detection when a user does not wish it to be active. In some embodiments, the remote light sensor transmitter has multiple levels of ambient light that it may detect. By way of an example, it may detect when a high intensity discharge (HID) light is on (level 1), a backup or emergency light is on but the HID light is off (level 2) and when all light is off (level 3).","An embodiments of the wireless light bulb may take the form of an exit sign retrofit LED wireless light bulb such that the housing of the bulb is designed to fit into an exit sign (T5 tube, T6 tube etc), but the exit sign retrofit LED wireless light bulb also has a battery embedded in it such that an exit sign may operate without the need for an emergency lighting power circuit or a local power source. When power to the bulb is not detected, the exit sign retrofit LED wireless light bulb will automatically switch to battery power. Battery power may be rechargeable or non-rechargeable. If the battery power is rechargeable, there may be a charging circuit that manages the rechargeable batteries to maintain the charge level at an acceptable level for the exit sign. In alternate embodiments, the integrated power source is a super capacitor or the like. The exit sign retrofit LED wireless light bulb may contain red, green, white or any other color LED that may be desired for illumination.","In embodiments of the wireless light bulb or wireless lighting fixture containing batteries, there may be a heat shield or insulator mounted in a way to keep the temperature generated by the other components in the bulb or fixture, such as the heat sink, from increasing the temperature of the batteries. The heat shield or insulator may be constructed of ceramic, fiberglass or any other known material. In an alternate example, the shield or insulator separating the batteries from the other components may be mounted to the cover with some space left between the batteries and the thermal heat sink. The cover may have some ventilation holes or other methods to allow the heat to escape and keep the temperature of the batteries as low as possible. There may also be a heat shield or insulator through the heat sink and above the heat sink to shield or insulate the batteries from the heat sink and components. In alternate embodiments, there may be a thermal sensor connected to a point where a measurement of the battery temperature may be made and a change in the use of or charging of the batteries may be made. For example, if the battery temperature exceeds some set limit, a measurement of the temperature of the battery may trigger a reduction of the light intensity which would subsequently lower the battery temperature by lowering the current draw on the batteries and the amount of heat generated by the LEDs. In another example, the battery charging current may be reduced in response to the measurement of the battery temperature exceeding some set limit. This is important to optimize the usable life of the batteries in a wireless light bulb or wireless lighting fixture. By way of an example, a thermistor such as an NTC or PTC device or similar temperature measurement method may be attached to the battery to measure the temperature of the battery. Based on the temperature measurement, a change to the operation of the wireless light bulb or wireless lighting fixture may be made to reduce the effect of some heat generating device in the wireless light bulb or wireless lighting fixture such as the current supplied to the LEDs may be reduced, reducing the light intensity but also reducing the amount of heat generated by the LEDs. A change may be made and some time may need to elapse before checking for a subsequent change in temperature before a decision may be made to make another change to reduce temperature. It is to be appreciated that an algorithm may be implemented to optimize the storage and operating temperature of the embedded batteries by changing the behavior of any heat source within the wireless light bulb or wireless lighting fixture. In alternate embodiments, active cooling may be implemented such that the measurement of the temperature of the batteries triggers the use of active cooling. Examples of active cooling are an embedded fan that may be turned on to provide airflow when needed or a thermoelectric cooling device that may convert a temperature difference into a voltage difference such that the heat may be removed from the batteries to their environment based on this conversion.","In one use case of an AC outlet adapter, the AC outlet adapter may be designed with a real time clock and a method that a user may program times during the day when the adapter will turn on and off as well as when the plugged in device will use battery power versus AC input power. The adapter may operate off of and pass through AC power, may contain an integrated wireless power source (batteries for example), a DC\/AC inverter and control that is either wireless control or manual control such as a switch on the wireless AC outlet that may turn it on or off. The user may then plug in AC powered devices to the AC outlet adapter to power that device. By way of an example, the time of day AC outlet adapter may contain ON, OFF and PROGRAM pushbuttons. At the specific time of day that the user desires the adapter to automatically turn on, the user presses the ON and PROGRAM buttons simultaneously. A microcontroller, microprocessor, ASIC etc may contain a time source, such as a real time clock or the like, and may contain the intelligence to record that time and a state change based on that time such that every day at that time, the time of day wireless light bulb or battery powered fixture will automatically turn on. At another specific time during the day that the user desires the bulb or fixture to turn off, the user presses the OFF and PROGRAM buttons simultaneously.","In some embodiments, a virtual load control switch may be designed which contains circuitry to act as a load control switch receiving a load control or demand response command from the power company and may transmit over a communication interface to one or more wireless light bulbs or battery powered wireless lighting fixtures to turn off, change light intensity, switch over all or a portion of the load to battery power etc. In some embodiments, the unit may control the wireless light bulbs or battery powered wireless lighting fixtures in an installation in a demand response energy efficiency system, for load control purposes and the like. This virtual load control switch may contain a timer such that after it receives a command from the power company to change to a lower energy consumption state, the virtual load control switch may start a timer and when the timer expires the virtual load control switch will send a command returning to the original state of operation or to another state of operation. The virtual load control switch may communicate with the power company infrastructure in a manner similar to a load control switch containing a relay that the power company may remotely control to cut power to devices that draw a lot of power like appliances, HVACs etc however the load control command would be received by the virtual load control switch and instead control any wireless light bulbs or battery powered wireless lighting fixtures that may be desired. In such a case, the virtual load control switch may be programmable. By way of an example, the virtual load control switch with an RF communication interface may communicate to a network of wireless light bulbs or battery powered fixtures that allows it to communicate with any wireless light bulb or battery powered fixture in the network. In one example, the virtual load control switch may be programmable over the RF communication interface. In another example, the virtual load control switch may have an Ethernet interface on the unit and have an IP address assigned to the interface. A software program running on the unit may allow a user to open a web browser and type in the IP address assigned to the unit. A graphical user interface served by the virtual load control switch may open up providing a method for the user to implement the desired functionality. The virtual load control switch may communicate with a an intelligent electrical meter, smart meter, energy gateway, lighting control software and the like, over an appropriate communication interface using a protocol that allows the virtual load control switch, which controls the installation of wireless light bulbs and battery powered wireless lighting fixtures and meter etc. to exchange information. The virtual load control switch may allow a user to configure that the lighting turns off, that the lighting changes intensity levels, that the lighting switch some or all of the energy that is used over to an integrated power source in a wireless light bulb. By way of an example, a typical response to a load control command in lighting is to turn off or reduce the light intensity in either case reducing power consumption at the cost of a reduction in the light output. A wireless light bulb with an integrated power source, for example rechargeable batteries, allows a response to the load control command where the wireless light bulb uses stored power to power the light source partly or entirely. If the load control command intended to reduce the light intensity levels, the wireless light bulb may reduce the power consumption from the power company, but maintain the normal light intensity levels (the light intensity level prior to receipt of the load control command) by supplying some power from stored power in the wireless light bulb. In another example, the wireless light bulb turns off all power consumption from the power company and powers the light source only from stored power in the integrated power source. In some embodiments, the virtual load control switch may be designed into a wireless light bulb such that it receives the load control command directly from the power company. In some cases, a wireless light bulb in a network of or a coordinated group of wireless light bulbs may propagate the load control information to other wireless light bulbs such that groups of wireless light bulbs may change state based on the load control command without having to have received it directly.","In alternate embodiments, a virtual load control switch may be designed which contains circuitry to act as a load control switch receiving a load control command from the power company and may transmit over a communication interface to one or more external light socket adapters, AC outlet adapters, AC outlet replacements, AC powered devices, AC circuit with embedded battery device designed with batteries embedded, wall switch or lighting control component and the like to turn off or switch over all or a portion of the load to battery power in the devices. In some embodiments, the virtual load control switch may be designed into a external light socket adapters, AC outlet adapters, AC outlet replacements, AC powered devices, AC circuit with embedded battery device designed with batteries embedded, wall switch or lighting control component and the like such that it receives the load control command directly from the power company.","In some embodiments, demand response may be implemented in wireless light bulbs by designing a receiver into the bulbs that may receive a load shed signal from a lighting panel over existing electrical wiring that the wireless light bulbs may use to either turn off lights, change lighting intensity levels or that the wireless light bulb switch some or all of the energy that is used over to an integrated power source in a wireless light bulb. In one example, the wireless light bulb may reduce the power consumption from the power company, but maintain the normal light intensity levels (the light intensity level prior to receipt of the load control command) by supplying some power from stored power in the wireless light bulbs.","In embodiments of the wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture, the devices may be able to receive commands from smart grid devices (smart meters, energy gateways, lighting control panels, software control systems and the like) and have the intelligence built inside the bulbs or fixtures to implement load control, receive pricing signals and manage demand based on dynamic pricing, reduce usage based on pricing or load reduction signals, allow access remotely to control the lighting installation, allow customers to manage the lighting locally and the like. By way of an example, a pricing signal may be received by one or more wireless light bulbs. A wireless light bulb with an integrated power source may have a pricing threshold set such that below that threshold when the pricing is such that it is advantageous to buy power, the wireless light bulb will consume power in addition to that necessary to power the light source and will charge the integrated power source. The stored power in the integrated power source may then be used at a later time when energy pricing is higher. In some cases, the wireless light bulb will have an upper pricing threshold that triggers the use of stored power and a lower price threshold that triggers the storage of power. In alternate embodiments, the wireless light bulbs contain a grid tie inverter and there is a net metering capability that allows the bulbs to return power to the grid. This ability to control the use of and return of stored power to the grid may be controlled by a smart meter, energy gateway, lighting control panel, software control systems and the like. In one use case, a wireless light bulb is designed as a six inch recessed fixture retrofit with rechargeable batteries embedded. A smart meter may communicate using ZIGBEE with the six inch recessed fixture retrofit wireless light bulb to implement any control mentioned herein. It is to be appreciated that any type of wireless light bulb or any communication interface type herein may be used in conjunction with the claimed subject matter.","In embodiments of external light socket adapters, AC outlet adapters, AC outlet replacements, AC powered devices, AC circuit with embedded battery device designed with batteries embedded, wall switch or lighting control component and the like, the devices may be able to receive commands from smart grid devices (smart meters, energy gateways, lighting control panels, software control systems and the like) and have the intelligence built inside to implement load control, receive pricing signals and manage demand based on dynamic pricing, reduce usage based on pricing or load reduction signals, allow access remotely to control the devices, allow customers to manage the device locally and the like.

In the illustrated embodiment, the stair light  illuminates an area of approximately ten square feet. Alternate embodiments may include but are not limited to any known light source including LEDs, compact fluorescent and incandescent bulbs and can illuminate any size area required by the application.","In the illustrated embodiment, the housing  is constructed of plastic. Alternatively, the housing  can be constructed of metal or any other known material. In one embodiment the housing can be waterproof, UV resistant and\/or corrosion resistant for use outdoors or difficult environments. In one embodiment (not shown), the housing  includes a mounting device for mounting the stair light, step light or nightlight to a wall, stair well, deck post, or other surface. Exemplary mounting devices include screws, nails, adhesive, suction cups, magnets, VELCRO, fixing posts, flanged heads of fasteners, and other known mounting devices. In this embodiment, the housing  is configured to be mounted on a wall of a room, stairwell, closet, attic, basement, garage, storage area, shed, hallway, stairway, emergency exit path, alley or porch, or in any other indoor or outdoor location where light may be desired. It is to be appreciated that the housing  can be any size and\/or shape and is not limited to the depicted illustration (e.g., the housing  can be dome shaped, pyramid shaped, cylindrical, rectangular, square).","In one embodiment the housing is mounted on an articulating bracket mounted to a surface that allows the user to mount the light to any angle wall or surface and articulate the light straight up, down or at any angle desired. In another embodiment, the housing can be mounted to a stake or post made of plastic, metal or any other known material allowing any of the mounting devices described to be used to mount the light onto the stake or post. The stake or post can be driven into the ground, can be on a tripod or stand to be free standing or fixed to the area or can be attached to an area in any possible way to create a path light that can illuminate walkways, sidewalks, alleys, or in any other indoor or outdoor location where light might be desired.  shows an example of path light created by mounting the stair light  to a stake  that can be driven into the ground.","As shown in the illustrated embodiment, the stair light  includes a power source , such as a battery. In the illustrated embodiment, the stair light is powered by 3 C batteries. In another illustrated embodiment, as shown in , the sensor light , a smaller version of the stair light that emits less light and is in a smaller housing, three \u201cAA\u201d size alkaline batteries are used as a power source. In the illustrated embodiment, the sensor light  includes a housing , a plurality of LEDs , a motion sensor , logic , a power source , and a light sensor . It should be understood that any number and type of known batteries may be used, including without limitation all known alkaline and nickel-cadmium batteries, depending on size and power requirements. According to another example, the power source can be any number and type of rechargeable batteries and\/or non-rechargeable batteries. Pursuant to a further illustration, the power source can be a combination of a solar cell and one or more batteries (e.g., rechargeable, non-rechargeable, . . . ). Thus, for instance, a battery can supplement the power supplied by the solar cell (or vice versa) and\/or the solar cell can recharge a battery. In some embodiments of the foregoing arrangement, a solar cell may be diode or-ed with a battery and the battery may be non-rechargeable.","The battery  supplies power to the stair light  to enable installing, moving, replacing, etc. the unit at substantially any indoor or outdoor location while mitigating the need for expensive and time consuming wiring and\/or utilization of aesthetically unpleasing and potentially inconvenient cords commonly associated with conventional lighting.","In alternate embodiments the power source may include a fuel cell, such as and without limitation a hydrogen fuel cell, a reformed methanol fuel cell, or the like.","In some embodiments the power to the unit may be powered directly from AC or from a DC input that comes from an external AC to DC converter. In other embodiments, the unit will contain rechargeable batteries such that the unit can be recharged by connecting the unit to an AC power source, cabling to an AC power source or plugging the unit into a recharging base.","With continued reference to illustrated embodiment shown in  the input component is a motion sensor. When the motion sensor  detects motion, logic  determines if the motion is above a predetermined threshold. If the motion is above the predetermined threshold, the logic  instructs an LED controller to turn on at least one LED. The motion sensor will only be operational if the light sensor  detects that detected light is at a low enough level to allow the unit to turn on (i.e. the unit will only work in the dark or whatever low light level is set by the light sensor and its detection circuitry). After the at least one LED is turned on, the logic starts a timer. The logic will then instruct the LED controller to turn off the at least one LED if no motion is detected before the timer reaches a predetermined timer threshold. If motion is detected before the timer reaches the timer threshold, the LED will remain on and the timer will reset to the timer starting point. The illustrated embodiment includes this auto shutoff feature to extend battery life. This feature is factory set via a timer that expires such that after turn on, if there is no reactivation of the control to turn the LEDs on, the unit will automatically turn the LEDs off when the timer expires.","In the illustrated embodiment, the timer consists of an RC electrical circuit that discharges to the factory set voltage threshold over some period of time at which time, if not retriggered, will automatically shut off the LEDs. Other embodiments may have a timer built in any known timer circuit. This feature may be set by toggling or setting a switch, may be dial selectable, may be set by a potentiometer, may be programmable directly or by remote, may be responsive to a battery's level, may include fade-to-off effect and so on. A second feature may have two or more auto shutoff levels set by multiple timers. For example the auto shutoff feature may control the light from bright to dim when the first timer expires and from dim to off when the second timer expires and so on.","The illustrated embodiment includes a circuit that allows the unit to glow at a level such that the unit can be a marker in a dark environment and when motion is detected it turns on to a bright level for illumination to a level that a user can find their way on stairs, steps or where a night light would be desirable. An alternate embodiment would include a circuit that allows the unit to be on at a low light level to illuminate an area with enough light to see the area from a distant and when motion is detected it turns on to a bright level for illumination to a level that a user can find their way on stairs, steps or where a night light would be desirable. In another embodiment, the low light level blinks at some rate to provide a marker until a sensor triggers transitioning to a bright level. In some embodiments, the control of the brightness level at glow, low, bright or any brightness level the user may desire is controlled by a dial, buttons, switches, RF\/IR remote or any other known control to allow the user to set the different light levels to the individual user preference.","In the illustrated embodiment, the shape of the hollowed out face in the housing  is designed to enhance the appearance of the glow level of the LEDs as well as better reflect the light when the light is turned to a bright light level. In other embodiments, an optical lens or lenses or reflectors to direct the light, reflect the light or change the viewing angle of the LEDs. The housing of the unit may include any number of optical elements. The optical elements may serve to focus, diffuse, filter, collimate, or otherwise affect light produced by the LEDs . In embodiments, the optical elements may include one or more lenses, reflectors, optical filters, aperture, and so on. The lenses may be fixed, a multiple lens array, adjustable, and so on.

An example of this application is a light in the bedroom of a child that is on when they go to bed at night, but fades over time to a glow level or a low light level as they fall asleep. The design can include any controls, methods and circuits by which to achieve multiple light levels. In addition the design may include methods and circuits to achieve constant current control to achieve consistent brightness at the different light levels.","A feature can be added such that when the batteries are detected to reach a predetermined low level of charge, the light will blink to indicate to the user that the batteries need to be replaced. In an alternate embodiment, the light may include a push button with a light bar that would show the battery level when the button is pushed.","The stair light may also include an on\/off switch, a push button to disable the sensor from activating the light for some period of time or a push button providing a sleep function that will shut the light off until the next time the light is enabled to operate when the light sensor senses a transition from light to dark. An alternate embodiment could include a sleep\/awake button or buttons such that the light can be put into sleep mode either until that button or another button is pushed to transition back to operational or until the next time the light is enabled to operate when the light sensors senses a transition from light to dark. Alternate embodiments may also allow for control of the light by time of day or timer controls such as dials to set when the light is enabled and when it is disabled. The time of day or timer to control the light can be set in any manner can be conceived of.","In the illustrated embodiment, the stair light  includes a passive infrared sensor configured to detect motion. In one embodiment, the passive infrared sensor has a range of approximately 30 feet and a viewing angle of 110 degrees. In alternative embodiments, the passive infrared sensor may have a range and viewing angle of any known passive infrared sensor. In one alternative embodiment, the passive infrared sensor is removably connected to the unit so that a user may connect any appropriate sensor. In some embodiments, the passive infrared sensor may be replaced or enhanced by a radar sensor, an ultrasound sensor, or any and all other form of motion sensor.","In other embodiments, any and all sensors may include a detection threshold or false detection rate that can be configured according to a user's preference. For example and without limitation, a light sensor may be configured to detect when incoming light crosses a user-preferred intensity threshold. A variety of other such examples will be appreciated, all of which are within the scope of the present disclosure.","In the illustrated embodiment, a Fresnel lens enables motion detections. The motion detector includes a Fresnel lens that guides infrared light over the PIR sensor in a substantially repeating pattern as a heat source (such as a person, vehicle, and so on) passes in front of the lens. In embodiments, the Fresnel lens may be selected to provide a desired zone of coverage. It will be understood that a variety of embodiments of motion detectors including the Fresnel lens are possible.","With continued reference to , when the motion sensor  detects motion, logic  determines if the motion is above a predetermined threshold. If the motion is above the predetermined threshold, the logic  instructs an LED controller to turn on at least one LED . After the at least one LED  is turned on, the logic  starts a timer. The logic  will then instruct the LED controller to turn off the at least one LED  if no motion is detected before the timer reaches a predetermined threshold.","The unit can be controlled by any type of input signal that can be leveraged by the logic  to manipulate operation of the LEDs . Thus, the input component can be a radio frequency (RF) receiver that can obtain an RF signal communicated from an RF transmitter (not shown) that can be utilized by the logic  to control operation of the LEDs . According to this example, the RF signal can be deciphered by the input component to effectuate switching the LEDs  to an on or off state, changing a light color or a light intensity provided by the LEDs , and the like. Additionally or alternatively, the input component can be one or more sensors that monitor a condition, and monitored information yielded by such sensor(s) can be utilized to effectuate adjustments associated with the LEDs .","It is to be appreciated that any type of sensor(s) can be utilized in connection with the claimed subject matter instead of or in conjunction with a motion sensor. For example, the sensor(s) can be one or more of infrared sensors, light sensors, proximity sensors, acoustic sensors, motion sensors, carbon monoxide and\/or smoke detectors, thermal sensors, electromagnetic sensors, mechanical sensors, chemical sensors, and the like. According to another example, the input component can be a connector, port, etc. that couples to a disparate device, sensor, etc. to receive the input signal.","It is also appreciated that any combination of sensors can be utilized in connection with the claimed subject matter. The illustrated embodiment is a combination of a light sensor that will conserve battery life by only allowing the LEDs to turn on when there is a low level of light in the environment. When there is enough light in the environment, the motion sensor will control the LEDs to turn on when motion is detected. An alternate embodiment includes an RF receiver and motion sensor in the light with an RF transmitter remote that can override motion sensor control of the unit when a user desires that it is turned on for an extended period of time or controlled remotely rather than by motion. In one embodiment, the sensor light  is designed with a motion sensor and an RF receiver. One or more sensor lights  are controlled by either the motion sensors on the lights, by an RF remote control or alternately by an RF wall switch. The RF control element is used to turn on and off both sensor lights. In an alternate embodiment, the remote control element contains a motion sensor and an RF transmitter to send the on and off command to the two sensor lights. In the alternate embodiment, the sensor lights have an RF receiver but may or may not have a motion sensor.","Another alternative embodiment includes one or more units used as stair lights or path lights with an RF receiver as the input component controlling the light source and an RF transmitter remote combined with a motion sensor. An example use of this embodiment is a driveway sensor that detects a car triggering the motion sensor to send an RF transmission to the light when the car enters the driveway. The light can stay on for some user set amount of time, then auto shutoff.","The combination of sensors can also be used to communicate between units and network the units together. For example, the units are a combination of RF transceiver and motion sensor. If one unit detects motion, it sends out a message to all units via its RF transmitter to turn all of the units on. Units can also receive a message via its RF receiver and retransmit it via its RF transmitter to extend the range of lights beyond what is within the range of the initial unit that detected motion. The triggering method can be any method sensor described and the sending of signals from one unit to another can be RF\/IF, wired or wireless network or wired with any electrical control mechanism between lights.","In an alternate embodiment, a group of lights that have a light sensor and are controlled by RF\/IR are used as path lighting. When the light sensor detects low light levels, the light will be turned on to a glow level marking the path. When the user wants to illuminate the path, expecting visitors for example, an RF remote control or RF wall switch can be used to transmit a signal or control message to the group of lights to turn on to a bright level. The user can also transmit a signal or control message to the light to return them to glow mode or turn them off. An auto shutoff feature can also be included such that after some period of time at the bright level, the light will automatically return to glow mode.","In another embodiment, the stair lights or path lights are used for emergency purposes to light up a walkway when there is a power outage. The stair light or path light has a light source and RF receiver to control the light source. A circuit that can detect when AC power is not present is combined with an RF transmitter in a housing. The RF transmitter unit can be plugged into an electrical socket, hardwired to an AC wall switch prior to the switch, wired directly in at the breaker box or at any point in a power distribution system that a user may want to detect a drop out in power. Upon detecting the loss of AC power at the monitor point, a signal is sent to the lights turning them on, emergency lighting is provided and the path to a safe area is illuminated. In an alternate embodiment, the RF transmitter unit is connected to the residential or commercial building security or safety system. If an alarm is present in the security or safety system that requires emergency lighting, the system will send a command to the lights to turn them on.","In another embodiment, the LEDs or OLEDs are designed into a strip that can be attached to the floor, wall, ceiling, sidewalk, pathway, stairwell or any known walkway or structure. The strip can be attached with screws, nails, adhesive, suction cups, magnets, VELCRO or in any other known way. The strip can be battery powered and have a motion sensor built in such that the light strip will glow all of the time until motion is detected, then turn on brighter. After some period of time, the light strip will go back into glow mode. The light strip can also contain a light sensor such that the light will only turn on if the level of ambient light drops below a certain level. In an alternate embodiment, the light strip contains an RF receiver and is controlled by an RF transmitter remote control. It is to be appreciated that any type of sensor(s) can be utilized in connection with the claimed subject matter instead of or in conjunction with a motion sensor. It should be understood that any type of wireless power defined can be used in connection with the light strip.","An example application is for use in a hallway to light up a path for children during the night to the bathroom. It should also be understood that the strip can be designed such that multiple separate light strips can light up to illuminate an entire path if one strip is activated. In this case, the light strips would need to be networked together and the first activated light strip would need to communicate to the other strips to turn on to a bright level. Another example application is that the light strips have a smoke detector or thermal sensor integrated or receive a message from an alarm system to light up a path to a fire exit. Note that in addition to illumination, the light strips may also use different color LEDs to identify different paths. For example, a path of green LEDs leads to a bathroom and a path of red LEDs leads to a fire exit. It is to be appreciated that the LED strip can be made of multicolor LEDs such that a user can select the color upon installation. In the previous example, there are two identical light strips and there is a switch on the light strip allowing the user to set the light strip to be a green light strip if the switch is in one position or a red light switch if the switch is in another position.","An alternate application is for a media room environment in which either stair lights or strip lights are used and are controlled by RF\/IR. The user can allow the lights to glow when the television is on and use the remote to turn on the lights to a brighter level when desired. Alternatively, in addition to RF\/IR control directly, the lights can also respond to controls from the television or media system remote control such that when the television is off, the recording is paused or stopped. Upon any other detectable state of the media system, the lights will turn on to a bright light but under normal television viewing conditions, the lights will be in glow mode. It is appreciated, that the media room lighting system can be programmed in any manner it is capable of in response to any detectable state of the media system. It is also to be appreciated that instead of for illumination, the lighting system can be constructed of any color lights possible and the control system can set the color of light. For example, the user can hold down a button on the remote and the lighting system will cycle through the possible light colors until the light is the desired colored at which time the user releases the button on the remote leaving the lighting system at the desired color of light.","The previously mentioned lights and lighting systems can be grouped into kits to meet specific user applications. A fall prevention kit can be constructed of any mix of stair lights, step lights, night lights, path lights or strip lights in a kit to allow installation in a residential or commercial building to prevent falls. The target market for such a kit is the elderly, but it can be used by any consumer or business motivated to prevent injurious falls.  shows the components of an example fall prevention kit . An example fall prevention kit includes six motion sensor stair lights , two RF controlled stair lights  with one RF remote control  and associated mounting hardware.","A deck lighting kit can also be constructed or assembled. This kit allows a user to install battery powered, RF controlled lights to the posts of the deck such that installation included no AC wiring. An example of this kit would include eight RF controlled stair lights with one RF wall mount switch and associated mounting hardware.","A power outage kit can also be sold. The power outage kit can include all of the lights, batteries and temporary or permanent installation hardware to allow the user to install battery powered lighting throughout their house or business in the event that there is a power outage. An example power outage kit would include a plastic case containing sixteen motion sensor stair lights with batteries that have adhesive on the back to allow it to stick to a wall. In the event of a power outage, the user can quickly walk through their house, for example, and install the lights by remove the backing to the adhesive and attaching the light to the wall.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0464","num":"0463"},"figref":"FIG. 34","b":["3400","3410","3420","3410"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0465","num":"0464"},"figref":"FIG. 35","b":["3500","3510","3520"]},"The use scenario can be expanded such that there is no remote control but rather only the three stair lights . In this use scenario, the stair lights contain a motion sensor, RF transmitter and RF receiver.  shows three stair lights. The stair lights can be controlled either by motion detection or by a message received by the RF receiver. Thus, in this use scenario, if motion is detected by one stair light, it can turn its light on and also send a message by it RF transmitter to turn on the other stair lights. The other stair lights will receive a message to turn on by their RF receivers and will subsequently turn on. They can also then send a message by their RF transmitters to turn on other stair lights. This message will also contain an indication that this is a retransmitted message (not from the original source of the motion detection). Thus, a single motion detection by one stair light can turn on many stair lights even those not within range of its RF transmitter. When the originating stair light reaches its auto shutoff time, it can turn its light off and send a message by its RF transmitter to turn off the other stair lights. There are many use scenarios that can result from this function. For example, the stair light can be mounted to a stake as in  to become a path light. Path lights can be installed throughout a large garden or backyard such that motion detection by any of the path lights will result in a flood of messages through the network of path lights to ultimately turn any on any path light within range of any other path light. As another example, several path lights can be installed along a long driveway perhaps several hundred yards long. The path lights can glow and when any path light detects motion, it can send a message to turn on or off the other path lights that will be flooded through the network of path lights. In another example, the stair light can be used and mounted on the perimeter of a large building every 25 feet. If motion is detected at any point around the perimeter of the building all of the stair lights will be illuminated. It is to be appreciated that the scope of messages and how the networking of the lights works can be as sophisticated or simple as is required by the application. It is also to be appreciated that any control mentioned herein can be built into messages and be transmitted through the network of lights.","In alternate embodiments, a network of wireless lighting modules may be created by embedding an RF transceiver with intelligence (microcontroller, microprocessor, integrated circuit etc.) in the wireless lighting modules and using a communication protocol between the modules to control a plurality of modules to accomplish a task, such as described herein. In embodiments there may be other control sources designed to communicate through the network, such as wall switches, key fobs, remote controls, RF adapters, and the like, that can plug into a computer and be controlled by a software program, etc. that may also connect to the network and control wireless lighting modules in the network. By way of an example, the wireless lighting modules may be a combination of RF transceiver and motion sensor. For instance, if one module detects motion, it may send out a message to other modules via its RF transmitter to turn other modules on to a specific brightness level. Modules may also receive a message via its RF receiver and retransmit the message via its RF transmitter to extend the range of lights beyond what is within the range of the initial unit that detected motion. In an alternate example, the control source may be one or more remote controls with a push button that is pressed to turn the lights on and a push button that may be pressed to turn the lights off with a unique identifier that can be set that may select the wireless lighting modules to control, and the like. When either button is pressed, a command may be transmitted by a remote control to the network to control one or more modules that receive it. The command may also be propagated through the network of modules via the RF transceiver in each module to control a portion of or the entire network of wireless lighting modules. It is to be appreciated that the modules may use other types of networking protocol (e.g. routing, flooding, etc.) that may effectively distribute state information through the network of wireless lighting modules. In embodiments, when an auto shutoff timer of the originating wireless lighting module times out, it may send an off command which may also be propagated through the network of light modules to shut them all off. The triggering method may utilize any sensor described herein, the type of control of the wireless lighting module may be any control mentioned herein, and the sending of signals from one wireless light module to another may be RF\/IR, wired or wireless network (e.g. WIFI, ZIGBEE, X10 etc.) wired with an electrical control mechanism between wireless lighting modules that can be defined, and the like. It is also to be appreciated that any standard or proprietary protocol (e.g. networking protocols such as IP, TCP, UDP, routing protocols etc. and physical layer protocols such as WIFI, Ethernet, ZIGBEE etc.) may be used to communicate between wireless lighting modules. In embodiments, a unique identifier of a wireless lighting module may be the identifier used in a standard protocol (e.g. IP address, Ethernet or WIFI MAC address, PAN ID, House Code, etc.), a proprietary protocol (set at dip switch, identifier programmed into the wireless lighting module etc.), and the like. It is to be appreciated that the network of lights in the lighting installation may be comprised of wireless lighting modules, wireless light bulbs, a lighting fixture, any mix of these, and the like.","In addition to wireless lighting modules, a repeater device that can communicate with the network of wireless lighting modules may be designed to extend the range of the network. This device may or may not have a light source. The repeater device may be installed in locations with a primary function of extending the range of the network of wireless lighting modules or filling in areas with poor or no coverage. The repeater device may be powered by any form of wireless power mentioned herein or may be designed to connect to AC power. The repeater device may also contain an RF\/IR, wired or wireless network (WIFI, ZIGBEE, X10 etc.) or wired with any electrical control mechanism that it requires to be communicate with wireless lighting modules. It is also to be appreciated that any standard or proprietary protocol (e.g. networking protocols such as IP, TCP, UDP, routing protocols etc. and physical layer protocols such as WIFI, Ethernet, ZIGBEE etc.) may be used to communicate between repeaters and wireless lighting modules. The repeater device may communicate with wireless lighting modules, wireless light bulbs or any mix of the two.","In another illustrative embodiment, a version of the wireless lighting module may target wireless remote controlled LED spotlight applications.

In this embodiment, the housing may contain any of the features of the RF Ceiling Light, but is designed in a ceiling tile form factor. In alternate embodiments, the housing may be designed in any form factor to be used in place of a fluorescent fixture such as but not limited to high bay fixtures, lay-in fixtures, strip fixtures, under cabinet fixtures, wall mount fixtures, wrap around fixtures, and the like. In embodiments, the wireless lighting module may be designed to fit into place in the socket of the fixture (i.e. as a bulb replacement) or the entire wireless lighting module fixture may be the same form factor as the fluorescent fixtures listed and be applicable for use in similar applications. The ceiling light may contain non-rechargeable or rechargeable batteries. In alternate embodiments, the wireless lighting module may have any type of connector on it that allows for charging by connection to a mating connector and that provides the AC or DC power source. In some embodiments the ceiling light may also allow a connection to an AC input and may contain the required circuitry to convert AC to DC for the light source and wireless control. In some embodiments, the RF Ceiling Light may replace a fluorescent light that is connected to a resistive, reactive, or electronic ballast in which case the ceiling light may also contain circuitry to take the output of the ballast and convert it to DC power suitable for the light source and wireless control. By way of an example, a version of the RF Ceiling Light containing an RF receiver and a motion sensor may be designed into a housing that fits into a 2\u00d72 ceiling grid. The RF Ceiling Light may also contain rechargeable batteries and an AC-to-DC converter and ballast conditioning circuit to connect to a ballast in the case where the RF Ceiling Light is a retrofit of a standard fluorescent fixture. There may also be intelligence (microcontroller, microprocessor, integrated circuit etc.) inside the RF Ceiling Light such that is can be programmed to draw power from the AC input, from the rechargeable batteries, or both. The intelligence may use a real time clock and be programmed to use the AC input and charge the batteries during off peak billing times and use battery power during on peak billing times such that there is an overall cost savings in energy usage. The unit may be programmed for operation based on a Time of Use (TOU) price plan from the energy company. The rechargeable battery capacity may or may not be enough to power the light source for the entire duration of the on peak billing time. In such a case, the intelligence may be able to switch between or control a sharing of the load between battery power and AC input power based on a measurement of battery capacity level, power use from the embedded batteries and from the AC input or any other measurable parameter that allow for an optimization for cost or minimize power consumption of the combined use of embedded batteries and AC input power.","In an alternate embodiment the RF Ceiling Light  may include an RF transmitter built into the ceiling light such that there is both an RF transmitter and RF receiver. In addition, there may or may not be a motion sensor, light sensor, or any other form of wireless control or sensor mentioned herein. A network of RF Ceiling Lights  may be created by embedding an RF transceiver with intelligence (microcontroller, microprocessor, integrated circuit etc.) in the ceiling light and using a communication protocol between the ceiling lights to control any size group of ceiling lights to accomplish any task described herein. Other control sources designed to communicate through the network such as wall switches, key fobs, remote controls, RF adapters, and the like, that can plug into a computer and be controlled by a software program, etc. may also connect to the network and control the ceiling lights in the network. By way of an example, if one ceiling light detects motion, it may send out a message to all ceiling lights via its RF transmitter to turn all of the ceiling lights on to a specific brightness level. When that ceiling light reaches an auto shutoff time, it may then send out a message to one or more ceiling lights via its RF transmitter to turn one or more of the ceiling lights off, set them to a glow, set them to a low level of light, and the like. Ceiling lights may also receive a message via its RF receiver and retransmit it via its RF transmitter to extend the range of lights beyond what is within the range of the initial unit that detected motion. In an alternate example, the control source may be one or more remote controls with a push button that is pressed to turn the lights on and a push button, that is pressed to turn the lights off with a unique identifier that can be set that may select the ceiling light or lights to control, and the like. When either button is pressed, a command may be transmitted by a remote control to the network to control the ceiling lights that receive it. The command may also be propagated through the network of ceiling lights via the RF transceiver in each ceiling light to control a portion of or the entire network of ceiling lights. It is to be appreciated that the ceiling lights may use any type of networking protocol (e.g. routing, flooding etc.) that may effectively distribute state information through the network. In embodiments, when an auto shutoff timer of the originating ceiling light times out, it may send an off command which is also propagated through the network of ceiling lights to shut one or more ceiling lights off. In embodiments, the triggering method may utilize any sensor described herein, the type of control of the ceiling lights may be any control mentioned herein, and the sending of signals from one ceiling light to another may be RF\/IR, wired or wireless network (WIFI, ZIGBEE, X10 etc.) or wired with any electrical control mechanism between ceiling lights that can be defined. It is also to be appreciated that any standard or proprietary protocol (e.g. networking protocols such as IP, TCP, UDP, routing protocols etc. and physical layer protocols such as WIFI, Ethernet, ZIGBEE etc.) may be used to communicate between ceiling lights.","By way of an example, the ceiling lights may contain any of the functionality described herein, but also contain a ZIGBEE transceiver and the networking stack necessary to create a ZIGBEE mesh network of ceiling lights. In this case, the RF transmitter and receiver may be compliant to ZIGBEE standards. The networking stack allows for the creation of a mesh network that provides all of the routing and forwarding capabilities found in a typical ZIGBEE network. In addition, a ceiling light may act as a ZIGBEE access point allowing ZIGBEE compliant wireless sensors and devices to connect to the mesh network of ceiling lights. Thus a user may install lighting and a ZIGBEE network with the installation of the ZIGBEE capable ceiling lights. A ZIGBEE compliant adapter that can be plugged into a computer, for example into a USB port of a computer directly or by cable, may allow a software program running on the computer to program functionality into, control, or gather status from the network of ceiling lights. Intelligence designed into the ceiling light (microcontroller, microprocessor, integrated circuit etc.) and use of the ZIGBEE communication protocol between the ceiling lights and with the ZIGBEE adapter connected to the computer may allow software to communicate with the ceiling lights to implement the desired functionality. Thus, the intelligent control may be distributed (e.g. each ceiling light may contain a microprocessor running specific software to implement functionality) or centralized (e.g. software running on the computer can contain most of the intelligence and can control the ceiling lights as required). It is to be appreciated that the ZIGBEE capable ceiling lights may be individually addressable such that the control may be from a single ceiling light up to the entire network of ceiling lights. In addition, if ZIGBEE compliant wireless devices or sensors are also installed, the software program may interface with those devices and provide additional functionality independent of the lighting installation. It is to be appreciated that any wireless lighting module or wireless light bulb may be designed to provide this functionality. In alternate embodiments, the ZIGBEE functionality may be replaced by WIFI, Z-Wave, BLUETOOTH, or any other network that may be useful in a deployment in addition to the lighting installation.","In other embodiments, the wireless lighting module may contain rechargeable batteries such that the module may be recharged by connecting the module to an AC power source such as plugging the module into a recharging base, plugging the module into an AC outlet directly, connecting the module to an AC outlet by cable, plugging a wall transformer to the wall then connecting a DC jack to the wireless lighting module, and the like. In some embodiments, the wireless lighting module may contain circuitry to convert the AC power source to DC and charge the batteries and may or may not power the light source while charging the batteries. In some embodiments, the wireless lighting module may be connected to a DC power source for recharging and as such would have circuitry to make use of the DC power source for recharging the batteries and may or may not power the light source while charging the batteries. By way of an example, an RF ceiling light containing rechargeable batteries may be mounted to the ceiling or wall. When the capacity of the rechargeable batteries dips below a level that the light output is no longer acceptable, a user may unscrew the RF ceiling light and connect it to a charging base. The charging base may be comprised of the circuitry necessary to charge the batteries to capacity as well as the electrical and mechanical configuration necessary to electrically and physically connect a ceiling light to the base. When battery charging is complete, the user may remove the ceiling light from the charging base and return it to the ceiling or wall. In another example, a motion spotlight containing rechargeable batteries that contains a 2.5 mm jack and accepts a DC input can be connected to a wall transformer with a 2.5 mm jack. The DC output of the wall transformer falls within the range of the DC input to charge the batteries. The motion spotlight may contain circuitry required to recharge the batteries and may or may not power the motion spotlight during the charging of the batteries.","In alternate embodiments, the wireless lighting module may have any type of connector on it that allows for charging by connection to a mating connector and that provides the AC or DC power source. In an alternate embodiment, the module may have a USB connector on it that allows for charging by connection to a USB port. In other alternate embodiments any form of wireless power mentioned herein may be used for recharging a wireless lighting module. By way of an example, one or more external thin film solar cells may be connected to the wireless lighting module by cable and provide a DC input to recharge the batteries. It is to be appreciated that any combination of charging approaches may be included in the same wireless lighting module.","In embodiments of a wireless lighting module, there may be a USB connector on the wireless lighting module. The USB connector may also be used as a communication interface to program the wireless lighting module. The wireless lighting module may attach to a computer via USB directly or over a USB cable to connect the module for programming.

Once set, the automatic grid shifting wireless light bulb may act autonomously based on those settings and\/or the pre-programmed or designed function. The settings may be changed on occasion by the user.","By way of an example, an automatic grid shifting wireless light bulb may be designed in as a PAR38 bulb with embedded rechargeable batteries and a connection to power through the Edison socket. Intelligence in the form of logic, electrical circuitry, microcontrollers, microprocessors, memory devices etc. contained within the bulb may control the rate of charging, time of charging or any other aspect of the charging of the embedded power source, may control the consumption of power from the input and\/or embedded power source including when to use each source or what the level of sharing of the load is on each source, may control the amount of power consumption by controlling the drive to the LEDs through PWM control or the like or may control any other function of charging and power consumption.

In such a case, the control module may be designed with a printed circuit board connection that matches the LED printed circuit footprint such that the control module may be directly soldered to the LED footprint. Therefore, a control module may be added to a product by replacing a single LED with the control module. By way of an example, an LED light bulb may have seven LEDs mounted to a metal core printed circuit board in a pattern with six LED around the outside and a seventh LED in the center. The seventh LED may be removed and in its place a motion sensor control module may be soldered to the printed circuit board to add motion sensor control to the LED light bulb. In such an example the motion sensor control module may require an electrical connection to power and for control of the bulb. Control may include on\/off control, light intensity control and the like. In an alternate embodiment, the control module may not have an electrical connection to the LED driver circuitry for control (ie it would only have an electrical connection to the LED driver circuitry to power the control module), but rather may control the on\/off state of the bulb by controlling a switch that opens and closes the connection across the LED that it replaces. By way of an example, in the case of seven series LEDs where the seventh LED has been replaced by a control module, when the control module closes the switch, current will flow through the series chain of LEDs turning the LEDs on. When the control module opens the switch, current will not flow through the series chain of LEDs turning the LEDs off. It is to be appreciated that the switch may take the form of a relay, FET, transistor, solid state switch or the like. In an alternate embodiment, the control module may insert a resistance into the path to alter the light intensity and as such provide a method to have multiple light levels or dimming functionality.

In some embodiments, the control module may replace more than one LEDs. In alternate embodiments, the control module does not replace any LEDs, but rather is electrically connected across one or more LEDs such that the control module may use the one or more LEDs as a voltage reference to power the control module. In such a case, the control board may be physically mounted in any manner with respect to the LED board or boards. It is to be appreciated that the housing may include bulb housings, such as PAR30, PAR38, A19, MR16 etc, tube housings, such as T4, T8 etc, fixture retrofits, such as 6\u2033 recessed fixtures, fluorescent fixtures etc., battery powered fixtures such as a spotlight, stair light, ceiling light, night light, undercabinet light, parking garage light etc. In some embodiments, the control module may include a power source such as a rechargeable battery, non-rechargeable battery, capacitor, supercapacitor or the like to allow the control module to be powered locally. It may have a method to recharge the power source when power is applied to the LED chain.","In an illustrative embodiment shown in , the figure shows an example Motion Sensor LED Module  that may be a module containing a motion sensor that physically and electrically mounts to an LED location on a circuit board with six LED locations.

In such a case, the motion sensor would be able to turn on the light when motion is sensed. The motion sensor circuit board may control the light levels to allow multiple light levels or dimming based on the state of the motion sensor and timer circuits that control a change of state of the light.","In embodiments of wireless lighting fixtures or wireless light bulbs containing a sensor, a remote control may be designed to transmit a datastream to the fixture or bulb to control or configure the fixture or device by creating a signal that the sensor may detect and such that the fixture or bulb may decode the datastream. In one embodiment, a wireless lighting fixture or wireless light bulb may contain a light sensor.

A remote control may be designed that contains a light source that may be modulated or blinked at a rate such that control or a configuration command may be detected by the microcontroller, microprocessor, digital circuit or the like which the light sensor is connected to. The remote control may contain a method to control or configure the fixture or bulb with switches, dials, buttons etc. such that the setting of the switches, dials, buttons etc. on the remote control will be used to create the datastream to control or configure the fixture or bulb. By way of an example, the remote control may contain a narrow angle LED and buttons, dials, switches and other similar controls. In an example, a remote control may contain a pushbutton and a dial. The dial setting may be translated into the net light output of a daylight harvesting capable fixture or bulb. The dial setting may configure a wireless light bulb to set the light intensity of its light source in response to a light level detected at its light sensor to be a particular level. Different dial settings may configure the wireless light bulb to set the light intensity in response to the detected light level to an associated level. When the push button is pressed, the remote control may read the dial setting and subsequently control the light source on the remote control to transmit a command. In some embodiments, the command may consist of a preamble, sync word, one or more bytes to configure the fixture or bulb and error checking. It is to be appreciated that the command may take any form that may be detected by the fixture or bulb and be used to control or configure the fixture or bulb. It is also to be appreciated that the user may need to direct the light source of the remote control toward light sensor on the fixture or bulb. In this example, the datastream transmitted by the remote control may be detected by measuring differences in the light level detected by the light sensor. In alternate embodiments, other sensors that are resident on the fixture or bulbs may be used with a remote control to control or configure the fixture or bulb. By way of an example, a fixture or bulb with a motion sensor may be used with a remote control containing an infrared device that may be capable of transmitting an infrared signal that the motion sensor may detect and an attached microcontroller, microprocessor, digital circuit or the like may be able to decode a datastream as transmitted by the remote control.","In an illustrative embodiment shown in , the block diagram shows an example Battery Embedded LED Controller Module  that may be used in a UPS light bulb, grid shifting light bulb or any type of externally powered battery embedded wireless light bulb.

In the illustrated embodiment, the external power supplied at the input connection  is AC power. In alternate embodiments, the external power supplied at the input connection  may be DC power. The switching circuitry  in the illustrative embodiment consists of a p-channel FET and a schottky diode. In an alternate embodiment, the switching circuitry may consist of two diodes to diode-or the power sources together and a p-channel FET between the battery and step up LED driver such that when power is supplied by the LED driver , the battery is disconnected from the step up LED driver  and when power is not supplied by the LED driver  the p-channel FET connects the battery to the step up LED driver  and the step up LED driver  supplies power to the one or more LEDs .

It is to be appreciated that any type of step up DC\/DC converter and\/or LED constant current driver circuit may be used to drive the one or more LEDs  with the desired drive characteristics. In an alternate embodiment, the LED driver  is an AC\/DC converter and the switching circuitry  may be connected to the input of the TPS61500 LED driver. In this embodiment, the switching circuitry  switches between the AC\/DC supply and the embedded battery supply  therefore the only constant current driver is the TPS61500 LED driver. It is to be appreciated that any alternate LED driver may be used instead of the TPS61500 and that driver may be a step up driver, a step down driver, a buck boost driver or the like.","In the illustrated embodiment, the embedded battery supply  is a dual cell Li-Ion battery pack. It is to be appreciated that the embedded battery supply  may be any rechargeable battery type mentioned herein. In alternate embodiments, the embedded battery supply  may be non-rechargeable such as one or more alkaline batteries. In other embodiments, the embedded battery supply  may be a capacitor, super capacitor, fuel cell etc. In the illustrative embodiment, the dual cell Li-Ion battery pack is charged with dual cell Li-Ion charging circuit based on the Microchip MCP73213 battery charger. It is to be appreciated that any type of battery charger circuit may be used to charge the desired type rechargeable battery used as the embedded battery supply . The DC\/DC converter  may be required to provide the required voltage to the battery charger circuit if the battery charger circuit is not be capable of being powered directly from the output of the LED driver . In the illustrated embodiment, there may be a resistor divider circuit or a resistive drop to set the voltage at the input of the DC\/DC converter . In an alternate embodiment, there may not be a DC\/DC converter  but rather the LED driver  may provide the proper input for the battery charger and other circuit. In alternate embodiments, the Battery Embedded LED Controller Module  may receive DC power from an external source. There may be a power and ground input and may be one or more control lines such that the Battery Embedded LED Controller Module  may be able to control the operation of the LED driver  with the control lines.","In the illustrative embodiment, there is switch sensing circuitry  may be used to detect the state of a controlling light switch or breaker. The switch sensing circuitry  may measure capacitance, impedance or any other electrical characteristic of the input that may provide an indication of the state of the controlling circuit to allow the controller to make a decision on which power source to use or not to apply power to the one or more LEDs  at all. The switch sensing circuitry  may detect impedance discontinuities through a time domain reflectometry (TDR) method by transmitting an electrical signal on the input and evaluating the return to make a determination whether the controlling switch or break is open or closed. In alternate embodiments, the switch sensing circuitry  is replaced by an RF or IR receiver. In such an embodiment, the determination of which power source the Battery Embedded LED Controller Module  should use may be made external to the Battery Embedded LED Controller Module  and is transmitted to the device to module to control the switch to select the source or no source at all. In alternate embodiments, the switch sensing circuitry  is replaced by a transceiver and the Battery Embedded LED Controller Module  has the ability to communicate control to disparate Battery Embedded LED Controller Module , wireless light bulbs and\/or battery powered wireless fixtures. In such a case, a network of bulbs and fixtures may be created to propagate commands, control and status throughout the network to coordinate operation or transport commands, control, status and responses to devices on the network. In alternate embodiments, the switch sensing circuitry  is replaced by or augmented with a sensor such as a motion sensor, light sensor etc to control the bulb. It is to be appreciated that any combination of switch sensing, receiver, transceiver and sensor functionality may be used in conjunction with the Battery Embedded LED Controller Module . It is to be appreciated that the switch sensing circuitry  or any alternate in its place may be powered from the LED driver  directly or indirectly through a DC\/DC converter  or it may be powered by the embedded battery supply . In some embodiments, the Battery Embedded LED Controller Module  may include an adjustable resistor, adjustable transformer, PWM controllable FET or transistor, PWM control of the step up LED driver  or similar device to allow the light source to be dimmable or to support more than one light level if the application benefits from dimming or multiple light levels or for the purpose of extending battery life. In such an embodiment, the Battery Embedded LED Controller Module  may use any combination of switch sensing, receiver, transceiver and sensor functionality to set the light intensity level.","In the illustrated embodiment, the LED return  is connected to the feedback input of the TPS61500 to allow the TPS61500 to maintain the desired drive characteristics and the feedback input is connected through a resistor to the battery return. The LED return  is also connected to the LED driver  thus whether the LED driver  is the power source or the embedded battery supply  is the power source there exists a return for the power source. In alternate embodiments, the returns may be switched with a switching circuit along with the switching circuitry  such that whichever power source may be switched to the one or more LEDs , the return is switched back to the power source with no connection between the embedded battery supply  and return for the LED driver . In some embodiments, the feedback mechanism may be modified such that when the battery is charging and is thus drawing additional current from the LED driver , the current delivered to the LED circuitry may be less thus producing less light output while the battery is charging. One feedback resistor value may be inserted into the feedback path to accommodate the charging current in addition to the LED current. When charging is complete, a second feedback resistor may be inserted to maintain constant current through the LEDs and thus constant brightness. In alternate embodiments, the feedback mechanism may allow for any resistance to be set in response to the charging and LED drive current requirements. By way of an example, a digital potentiometer may be inserted in the feedback path and logic may adjust the value of the potentiometer based on the requirements. For example, this may be necessary if the current drawn by the charging of the battery changes over time. In the embodiment that uses an AC\/DC converter and switches power as an input to the TPS61500, a constant current will be maintained without having to adjust the feedback in any way.","In an alternate embodiment targeting a HID retrofit lamps or recessed fixture retrofit, the Battery Embedded LED Controller Module  may contain a high voltage step up LED driver such as the Linear Technology LT3755 to drive a higher voltage and thus a longer series chain of LEDs which would put out a higher light intensity. In such an embodiment, the output drive requirements are higher but otherwise the architecture is similar to the described architecture. Thus, the Battery Embedded LED Controller Module  may be integrated into any standard size bulb (PAR30, PAR38, A19, R30, MR16, and so on), non-standard size bulb, fixture, fluorescent bulb or lamp (T4, T5, T8, circular, and so on), down light assembly (recessed fixtures, fluorescent fixtures or down light fixtures for residential or industrial lighting), HID lamp or the like to provide a battery backup, grid shifting capability or for any other benefit that an embedded battery would provide in the device.","In embodiments of the wireless light bulb, if an auxiliary power supply is required for the control circuitry it may be provided by placing a resistor divider tapping off of the drive to the light sources and using that divided down voltage to power the control circuitry. In some embodiments, this resistor divider may be connected to the feedback or LED return. In this case, the LED driver will continue to supply current to the control circuitry even when the LEDs are off. The resistor divider may provide enough of a drop in voltage such that the feedback voltage is maintained at a level to keep the LED driver supplying current to the control circuitry even when the LEDs are off thus the LED driver will supply power for the control circuitry even when the LEDs are not on. In some embodiments, the resistor divider may connect to a DC\/DC converter to provide a supply voltage to the control circuitry. In some embodiments, a transistor, FET or a similar switching mechanism may be used to disconnect power to the LEDs while power is still applied to the control circuitry. In some embodiments, the control circuitry may set or alter the light intensity of the LEDs using pulse width modulation or similar method by controlling the transistor, FET or a similar switching mechanism. By way of an example, in a typically LED light bulb, the light is turned off by disconnecting power to the bulb by a light switch or similar. In this example, by allowing the control circuitry to disconnect the power source from the LEDs but still draw power from the LED driver, the control circuitry may control the bulb thus keeping the light switch or similar on, the control circuitry may still be able to control the state of the bulb. The control circuitry may include a motion sensor; may include a light sensor; may include an RF or IR receiver, transmitter, or transceiver; may include an embedded battery; may include an embedded programmable timer control; and so on to control the operation of the wireless light bulb. In some embodiments, the control circuitry may be powered using the LEDs as a reference. By way of an example, the control circuitry may connect to the LEDs in a series chain of LEDs at a point where the forward voltage drop may be used as a reference. In a series chain of LEDs of more than two LEDs, the forward voltage drop across the final two LEDs may provide a stable reference voltage for the control circuitry. In an example, the control circuitry contains an embedded battery and battery charging circuit. When the LEDs are on, the embedded battery may charge. When the LEDs are off, the embedded battery may provide power to the control circuitry that may include other control circuitry to control the state of the LED light source.","In embodiments of wireless light bulbs and battery powered wireless fixtures that contain rechargeable batteries, the batteries or battery packs may be organized such that the bulb or fixture may use multiple batteries and battery packs for increased reliability or to increase battery life in the product. Reliability may be increase with multiple batteries or battery packs by allowing for architectures such as N+1 redundancy such that a single battery that has failed or reached the end of its usable life through capacity loss or similar degradation may be tolerated by switching out the failed cell. Battery life in the product may be increased with multiple batteries or battery packs by increasing the number of charge cycles by alternating between batteries and battery packs. By way of an example, a UPS light bulb or grid shifting wireless light bulb may contain two dual cell Li-Ion battery packs. The UPS light bulb or grid shifting wireless light bulb may contain the intelligence and a switching mechanism to alternate between the battery packs over a period of time. For example, on one day, the bulb may use battery pack #1 and on the next day it may use battery pack #2. The total number of charge cycles that the bulb may allow is increased by alternating the battery pack used. In some embodiments, the architecture may allow the battery or battery pack to be charged more slowly when it is not being used because instead of needing to be charged for everyday use, it may only need to be charged for use every other day. In some embodiments, the battery or battery pack may be kept at a lower capacity level when not being used, then charged as rapidly as possible. This may decrease the capacity loss of Li-Ion cells, for example, by keeping the Li-Ion cells at a lower capacity level when the storage temperature is high.","In embodiments of the wireless light bulb and battery powered wireless lighting fixtures containing an embedded power source, a statistical record of the usage of the embedded power source, input power source, on time of the light source etc. may be made and stored in the bulb or fixture. This record may be used to improve the performance of the use of the battery, to have a knowledge of the usage pattern of the product, for warranty or refurbishment purposes to know the amount of usage of the battery, for maintenance purposes for battery replacement etc. By way of an example, a count in number of seconds of light source ON time from the input power source, light source ON time from the embedded power source, OFF time and the like may be maintained by a microcontroller and may be stored in memory. The counts may be retrieved in the field or at the factory as a means to determine product usage over time. The counts may also be used to determine how often the embedded power source has been used for purpose of maintenance or to determine the availability of the input power. In some embodiments, the stored information may be retrieved over a communication interface into the device. By way of an example, the use level of the embedded power source may be retrieved from a central location over a network, for example over the Internet, such that an organization may be able to determine when the embedded power source may need to be replaced in a number of locations. In this example, a retail chain may be able to query individual locations and gather maintenance information to allow it to warehouse replacement parts at a central location.","In an illustrative embodiment shown in , the block diagram shows an example UPS Lighting Adapter  that may be used to connect into a lighting socket of any type where it will receive input power with any type of bulb, tube, lamp or light source connected to the output connection of the UPS Lighting Adapter  (incandescent, compact fluorescent, LED, fluorescent, HID etc) and either pass input power through if it is available or provide output power to the bulb, tube, lamp or light source using an embedded power source in the absence of input power.

In the illustrated embodiment, the input connection  is an screw shell typical of a light bulb that would screw into an Edison socket such that the adapter connects to the existing Edison socket where the electrical connection delivers AC power typical on a lighting circuit and an LED bulb, Compact Fluorescent bulb, incandescent bulb etc. may screw into the UPS Lighting Adapter . It is to be appreciated that the electrical input may be AC or DC and with whatever electrical characteristics are required to allow any type of bulb, tube, lamp or light source to connect at the output and operate properly.

In one embodiment, the UPS Lighting Adapter  contains a light sensor that may be used for a daylight harvesting function as described herein. Based on the detected light level, the UPS Lighting Adapter . In an alternate embodiment, there is no embedded battery supply and the primary function of the device is daylight harvesting and the device is a daylight harvesting lighting adapter.","In some embodiments of the UPS Lighting Adapter, the lighting adapter is used as a grid shifting device rather than for backup power. In such an embodiment the Grid Shifting Lighting Adapter may be designed to store power from the input power source and use power from the embedded power source. The functionality may be pre-programmed, factory set, designed in a custom electrical circuit or the like to respond to sensors on the adapter and\/or a pre-programmed algorithm to implement the grid shifting function. The functionality may be implemented in conjunction with sensors on the adapter and an intelligent program that may change the behavior of the adapter based on the feedback received from the one or more sensors on the adapter. The sensors may include a light sensor, motion sensor, an atomic clock or time receiver, temperature sensor or any other sensor mentioned herein that may allow the Grid Shifting Lighting Adapter to make a decision on which power source to use. In some embodiments, there may not be a sensor on the adapter and the grid shifting function is performed based on an intelligent program internally. The intelligent program may contain a real time clock that may be set at the factory or set by the user such that the intelligent program may use time of day or a calendar to perform the grid shifting functionality. The grid shifting function may be used for cost savings, energy efficiency, convenience and safety\/security. A Grid Shifting Lighting Adapter may have switches, dials, knobs etc on the adapter to set time of day or sensor thresholds such that a user may be able to control how the intelligent program manages the adapter. Once set, the Grid Shifting Lighting Adapter may act autonomously based on those settings and\/or the pre-programmed or designed function. The settings may be changed on occasion by the user. In some embodiments, the Grid Shifting Lighting Adapter may contain a wireless receiver such that it may receive commands and\/or be controlled remotely. By way of an example, the Grid Shifting Lighting Adapter may receive a load control signal, may receive a command to change behavior based on a need to implement demand response, may receive a command shifting power to or from the embedded power source for cost savings reasons or the like. In some embodiments, the Grid Shifting Lighting Adapter may contain a transceiver such that it may be part of a network allowing control to be received and\/or propagated through the network as mentioned herein.","By way of an example, a Grid Shifting Lighting Adapter may be designed with embedded rechargeable batteries and a connection to power through an Edison socket as well as a second Edison socket that would allow a bulb to plug into the adapter. Intelligence in the form of logic, electrical circuitry, microcontrollers, microprocessors, memory devices etc. contained within the adapter may control the rate of charging, time of charging or any other aspect of the charging of the embedded power source, may control the consumption of power from the input and\/or embedded power source including when to use each source or what the level of sharing of the load is on each source, may control the amount of power consumption by controlling the drive to the light source by dimming it using a triac, amplitude modulation or the like or may control any other function of charging and power consumption. The intelligence may also leverage sensors on the adapter to monitor patterns of sensor inputs by which the adapter may adjust the charging and use of the power source to optimize the adapter's use of power for cost savings, energy efficiency, convenience, safety\/security, and the like. The intelligence may keep the patterns in memory over time if necessary and adjust grid shifting functionality based on the pattern. In the example, the Grid Shifting Lighting Adapter may be plugged into a recessed socket by an end user and an R30 LED light bulb may be plugged into the adapter. A time of day clock in the adapter may start storing energy in the embedded power source during a time interval preset for example in the evening hours when the energy rates are low. In the daytime, the adapter may use the embedded power source entirely while capacity is available, share the electrical load with the input power or may use the embedded power source. The adapter may be pre-programmed to work based on the TOU rate plan offered by a particular power company and the intelligence in the adapter may be optimized to save as much money on the energy bill of a customer as possible. Alternately, the adapter may be pre-programmed with a time of day clock and a calendar such that the adapter may grid shift on days known to be peak energy usage days for a particular power company reducing the peak usage of a customer on those days and times of day when it is desirable to reduce peak energy usage. It is to be appreciated that the input and output connections of the Grid Shifting Lighting Adapter may consist of any type of connector used by standard size bulb (PAR30, PAR38, A19, R30, MR16, and so on), non-standard size bulb, fixture, fluorescent bulb or lamp (T4, T5, T8, circular, and so on) or down light assembly (recessed fixtures, fluorescent fixtures or down light fixtures for residential or industrial lighting), ballast, power supply or the like such that the Grid Shifting Lighting Adapter may electrically and mechanically couple the input connection to the mating connection to mimic the connection on the bulb, fixture, lamp, assembly or the like that would connect to the output connection and accept any type of bulb, fixture, lamp, assembly etc at the output connection. In alternate embodiments, the Grid Shifting Lighting Adapter contains a grid tie inverter and may return power to the grid as mentioned herein.","In some embodiments, the grid shifting adapter may be used for applications other than lighting. By way of an example, a grid shifting module may be designed to mount inside of a refrigerator or freezer. In such a case, the same functionality as described for grid shifting lighting applications may apply where there may be a need to shift power use to the embedded power source for cost savings, convenience or backup power purposes. In the example of the refrigerator or freezer, the embedded power source may provide cost savings by storing energy when the electric rates are low and using the stored energy when the rates are high. In that example, it may also be used to power the refrigerator or freezer when there is a power outage thus providing power to the refrigerator or freezer for some period of time during the power outage. It is to be appreciated that a device of any kind such as a lamp, television, television peripheral, computer, servers, network equipment, storage devices, appliance, washer, clothes dryer, refrigerator, freezer, electric range, microwave oven, electric water heater, vacuum cleaner, cell phone charger, stereo, air conditioner, HVAC devices, electric or hybrid vehicles, electric motors, portable generators and backup power sources, uninterruptable power supplies (UPS), inverters, industrial and manufacturing machinery etc may contain a module in the path of power that may allow the grid shifting functionality to be implemented. In some embodiments, the grid shifting module may be removable and replaceable. In some embodiments, the grid shifting module contains a grid tie inverter and may return power to the grid as mentioned herein.","In some embodiments, a wireless light bulb with an embedded power source such as a battery may be dimmable by a typical dimmer switch. Switch sensing functionality may be able to detect the setting of the dimmer switch and control the current drawn from the embedded power source to set the light intensity level accordingly. In an alternate embodiment, the wireless light bulb may store the last dim level setting as detected from the input and when the bulb is switched over to the embedded power source set the light intensity level to the closest level possible as the last detected level. By way of an example, the wireless light bulb may detect the dim level by either detecting the average current level through the light source and when switched over to the embedded power source adjust the average current level to the closest level possible to the dim level set by the line. In another example, a triac dimmable wireless light bulb may detect the amount of the waveform that the triac setting is active and when switched over to the embedded power source adjust the average current level through PWM control or any known method to set the light intensity level to the closest level possible to the dim level set by the triac. In some embodiment, light intensity of the UPS light bulb may be controlled through the wall switch using the switch sense function. By way of an example, if the power is no longer present, the UPS light bulb may set the light intensity to 100 lumens which it may be able to maintain for some period of time. If the light intensity needs to be higher, the light switch may be turned off and then on again. The switch sense function detects the change in the controlling switch and resets the light intensity to 250 lumens. Turning the light switch off and on again sets the light intensity to 400 lumens and so on until the light intensity reaches the maximum level. Turning the light switch off and on again will then turn the light off. Turning the light switch off and on again will set the light intensity to 100 lumens. In this way, the light intensity is controllable when the UPS light bulb is powered by the embedded power source. It is to be appreciated that any number of light intensity levels at any light intensity may be implemented.","In an embodiment of a battery powered wireless lighting fixture, a high intensity battery powered flood light may be designed that mounts on a stand with a base containing a battery pack for commercial, industrial or security applications that can generate a light output, such as of 1,500 lumens and be controlled by RF. The high intensity battery powered flood light may be turned on to full brightness for a short period of time, then it may dim down to a much lower level as needed. By way of an example, road construction crews that have very bright flood lights aimed at their work area rely on high intensity standing lights. This would be a portable version that would not need a generator and allow RF control that would provide the convenience to turn on, turn off, dim, change a different light intensity level etc. The battery pack in the base may be a large battery providing continuous light for days. The battery pack may be rechargeable or non-rechargeable. At the top of the stand, the housing for the flood light may allow the light to be adjusted or articulated in the desired direction, then locked into place. In some embodiments, the light may contain an RF transceiver such that a network of flood lights may be controlled from one source. In some embodiments, the light may contain any type of sensor. By way of an example, a motion sensor may be on the flood light to allow motion control. In another example, a light sensor may be used as a day night controller such that the light will automatically turn on as necessary as the ambient light decreases. The detected ambient light level that the high intensity battery powered flood light is enabled may be adjustable by a potentiometer or similar means on the flood light. In some embodiments a daylight harvesting function may be implemented such that the light intensity slowly increases to the maximum level as it gets darker at night and slowly decreases as it gets the light gets brighter in the morning. In some embodiments, the electronics are in the base of the unit with the battery pack and the only device on the stand is the light source. By way of an example, a small LED light source, optics and a housing may be mounted at the top of the flood light and the only two wires that may need to be run from the base to the flood light housing through the stand are the LED drive and LED return lines. This allows the flood light housing to be as small as possible.","In another illustrative embodiment, a recessed fixture version of a wireless light bulb with a battery backup between the power supply and light source is described for use in Battery Backed LED Recessed Fixture  applications. With reference to , illustrated is a perspective view of an embodiment of a Battery Backed LED Recessed Fixture . In the illustrated embodiment, the Battery Backed LED Recessed Fixture  includes a fixture housing , a power input , a power supply , a controller and battery module , a power input to the fixture housing , a plurality of LEDs  and a control input . In this embodiment, the power supply  is external to the housing, electronics, thermal management and light source. The power supply  may provide power to the plurality of LEDs , to the fixture housing , to the control input  and\/or to the controller and battery module . In the illustrated embodiment, the power input  is an AC input and the power supply  is a constant current LED driver that may supply power to a series chain of LEDs. It is to be appreciated that the input may be AC or DC and the power supply may provide power to the Battery Backed LED Recessed Fixture  as needed. The LEDs may be configured in series, parallel or any other configuration typical of LED lighting. The controller and battery module  may be connected to the power supply  and light source such that the controller and battery module  may supply power to the plurality of LEDs . The embedded battery supply in the controller and battery module  may be recharged from the power supply . In some embodiments, the power supply  and\/or the controller and battery module  may allow the drive level to be adjustable by using a dial, toggle switch, rotary switch, push buttons or the like to allow the user to adjust the drive current to the light source. Thus the power consumption and light intensity may be adjusted based on the requirements of the application. In alternate embodiments, intelligence in the Battery Backed LED Recessed Fixture  may adjust the drive level automatically based on programming or in a preconfigured manner in response to a condition detected by the fixture. In embodiments, the controller and battery module  may make an intelligent decision on which power source, external power or internal battery, to use. The controller and battery module  may monitor the power input and if the power input is no longer available or should not be used, the controller and battery module  may switch to the internal power source. In some embodiments, the decision on which power source to use may be made based on a control input  to the controller and battery module . By way of an example, wiring may be run from a controlling source such as a light switch to the control input  such that the control input  may detect when power is no longer available or should not be used based on the state of the controlling source. In the example using a light switch, a circuit may monitor the power input prior to the switch and may monitor the state of the switch. If the switch is closed and power is present and usable at the controller and battery module , power is by the power supply . If the switch is closed and power is not present or not usable, the controller and battery module  may switch to battery power. If the switch is open and power is present and usable prior to the switch, power may not be supplied by the power supply  because the switch is open and the controller and battery module  will not supply power from the battery because the intent is for the light to be off. If the switch is open and power is not present or not usable prior to the switch, the controller and battery module  may switch to battery power because there is an indication that there is a problem with power even though the switch is open. In some embodiments, the control input  may consist of a wireless receiver that receives an indication of the state of the controlling circuit and input power allowing the controller and battery module  to decide which power source to use or not to power the light source.

It is to be appreciated that the embedded battery supply  may be any rechargeable battery type mentioned herein. In alternate embodiments, the embedded battery supply  may be non-rechargeable such as one or more alkaline batteries. In other embodiments, the embedded battery supply  may be a capacitor, super capacitor, fuel cell etc. In the illustrative embodiment, the dual cell Li-Ion battery pack is charged with dual cell Li-Ion charging circuit based on the Microchip MCP73213 battery charger. It is to be appreciated that any type of battery charger circuit may be used to charge the desired type rechargeable battery used as the embedded battery supply . The DC\/DC converter  may be required to provide the required voltage to the battery charger circuit if the battery charger circuit is not be capable of being powered directly from the input power. In the illustrated embodiment, the DC\/DC converter  is a National Semiconductor LM5008 switching regulator. In the illustrated embodiment, there may be a resistor divider circuit or a resistive drop to set the voltage at the input of the DC\/DC converter . In the illustrated embodiment, the LM5008 and LT3755 are high voltage devices allowing the Backup Controller and Battery Module  to operate at a high voltage (up to 75 VDC).","As mentioned herein, the external control input  may receive an input or detect a condition that allows the Backup Controller and Battery Module  to make a decision on which power source to use or not to power the light source. In the illustrated embodiment, the external control input  may receive an input or detect the condition and control the shutdown input to the LT3755 such that the LT3755 will not drive the output thus the embedded battery supply  will not supply power. In alternate embodiment, the external control input may enable or disable the embedded battery supply  to supply power using FETs, relays or any other type of control that would allow the external control input  to enable or disable embedded battery supply  and\/or the LED driver input  from supplying power and the switching devices may be at any position in the circuit to implement the required switching function. In alternate embodiments, power may be shared such that intelligence in the Backup Controller and Battery Module  may control both power sources such that they both supply some amount of power. In some embodiments the Backup Controller and Battery Module  contains a battery level detector  to provide an indication of the capacity remaining in the embedded battery supply . By way of an example, an external LED may be driven when the battery level voltage is below a threshold that may indicate a low battery level. In some embodiments, the Battery Backed LED Recessed Fixture  may be mounted in a ceiling. The external LED may be mounted in the ceiling to provide a visual indication of the battery capacity level. In some embodiments, the external LED is embedded in an illuminated switch such that when the switch is actuated, the battery level detector  may drive the LED in the illuminated switch such that when the switch is actuated an indication of the battery capacity level is provided. It is to be appreciated that an indication of the battery capacity level may be provided in any manner described herein.","In embodiments of lighting fixtures, a fixture may be designed containing any type of connector used for standard size bulb (PAR30, PAR38, A19, R30, MR16, and so on), non-standard size bulb, fixture, fluorescent bulb or lamp (T4, T5, T8, circular, and so on) or the like such that when the bulb, lamp or tube is connected to the socket of the lighting fixture, the lighting fixture may lock the bulb, lamp or tube in place such that the only way to replace the bulb, lamp or tube is to replace the entire fixture. In some embodiments, the locking device may be part of the fixture. In alternate embodiments, the locking device may be a separate assembly that mounts onto a fixture or a bulb, lamp or tube that implements the locking function. In some embodiments, the locking device is irreversible once it locks in place such that the bulb, lamp or tube may not be reasonably removed. In other embodiments, there may be a key that allows the device to be unlocked such that service personnel may unlock the bulb, lamp or tube for replacement. By way of an example, a PAR30 LED bulb with an Edison screw shell may be screwed into a recessed fixture. The recessed fixture has a mechanism built in such that when the PAR30 bulb is screwed into a certain depth and has made an electrical connection with the fixture, the mechanism applies pressure to the stem of the bulb such that bulb may not reasonably be unscrewed from the fixture. It is to be appreciated that the locking mechanism may come in any form that may secure the bulb, lamp or tube in place after it has been installed. In applications where the light source must meet requirements such that an end user should not be able to change the bulb, lamp or tube, this locking mechanism allows the installer to meet this requirement but also use any off the shelf bulb, lamp or tube instead of needing to purchase a fixture with a light source built in.","In another illustrative embodiment, a recessed fixture version of a wireless light bulb with a battery backup between the power supply and light source which is powered by the AC input is described for use in AC Input Battery Backed LED Recessed Fixture  applications. With reference to , illustrated is a perspective view of an embodiment of an AC Input Battery Backed LED Recessed Fixture . In the illustrated embodiment, the AC Input Battery Backed LED Recessed Fixture  includes a fixture housing , a power input , a power supply , a controller and battery module , a power input to the fixture housing , a light source , a control input  and an AC\/DC converter . In this embodiment, the power supply  is external to the housing, electronics, thermal management and light source. The power supply  may provide power to the light source , to the fixture housing , to the control input  and\/or to the controller and battery module . In the illustrated embodiment, the power input  is an AC input and the power supply  is a constant current LED driver that may supply power to a one or more LEDs which serve as the light source . It is to be appreciated that the input may be AC or DC and the power supply may provide power to the light source as needed. The LEDs may be configured in series, parallel or any other configuration typical of LED lighting. The controller and battery module  may be connected to the power supply  and light source  such that the controller and battery module  may supply power to the light source . The embedded battery supply in the controller and battery module  may be recharged from the AC\/DC converter . In some embodiments, the power supply  and\/or the controller and battery module  may allow the drive level to be adjustable by using a dial, toggle switch, rotary switch, push buttons or the like to allow the user to adjust the drive current to the light source. Thus, the power consumption and light intensity may be adjusted based on the requirements of the application. In alternate embodiments, intelligence in the AC Input Battery Backed LED Recessed Fixture  may adjust the drive level automatically based on programming or in a preconfigured manner in response to a condition detected by the fixture. In embodiments, the controller and battery module  may make an intelligent decision on which power source, external power or internal battery, to use. The controller and battery module  may monitor the power input and if the power input is no longer available or should not be used, the controller and battery module  may switch to the internal power source. In some embodiments, the decision on which power source to use may be made based on a control input  to the controller and battery module . By way of an example, wiring may be run from a controlling source such as a light switch to the control input  such that the control input  may detect when power is no longer available or should not be used based on the state of the controlling source. In one example, a connection to AC power prior to the light switch may be brought into the control input  such that the unswitched AC power will be available whether the controlling source intends to turn the light on or not. In the example using a light switch, a circuit may monitor the power input prior to the switch and may monitor the state of the switch. If the switch is closed and power is present and usable at the controller and battery module , power supplied by the power supply . If the switch is closed and power is not present or not usable, the controller and battery module  may switch to battery power. If the switch is open and power is present and usable prior to the switch, power may not be supplied by the power supply  because the switch is open and the controller and battery module  will not supply power from the battery because the intent is for the light to be off. If the switch is open and power is not present or not usable prior to the switch, the controller and battery module  may switch to battery power because there is an indication that there is a problem with power even though the switch is open. In some embodiments, the control input  may consist of a wireless receiver that receives an indication of the state of the controlling circuit and input power allowing the controller and battery module  to decide which power source to use or not to power the light source. By way of an example, a power outage module that consists of a wireless transmitter and method to detect a power outage may transmit the indication of the state of the controlling circuit to allow the AC Input Battery Backed LED Recessed Fixture  to make an intelligent decision on which power source to use to power the fixture. In some embodiments, the control input  may receive an input from over the wires such that it receives an indication of the state of the controlling circuit and input power by communication over the power input .

In some embodiments, a device may be attached to the controlling source such that the switch sensing function may detect the sense of the controlling source by being able to detect measurable electrical characteristics of the attached device. In such a case, the switch sense function along with a device attached to the controlling source would allow the AC Input Battery Backed LED Recessed Fixture  to be installed without the need for extra wiring to be run between the controlling source and fixture. In alternate embodiments, this architecture is applied to the UPS light bulb. In alternate embodiments, this architecture is applied to UPS tube replacements. It is to be appreciated that this architecture may be applied to any standard size bulb (PAR30, PAR38, A19, R30, MR16, and so on), non-standard size bulb, fixture, fluorescent bulb or lamp (T4, T5, T8, circular, and so on).","In some embodiments, battery backed LED recessed fixture may have an indication of a low battery level. There may be a method to test the fixture, such as a button that may be pressed to briefly test that the light output powered by an integrated power source is healthy, that may provide an indication of the battery level. In some embodiments where there is an external power source, a button or switch may be used to break the connection of external power into the fixture to perform a test of the operation of the fixture when powered by the internal power source. In alternate embodiments, the button or switch may be replaced by a wireless receiver integrated with the fixture and a separate remote control that provides the same operation when the button or switch on the remote control is actuated. By way of an example, a user may walk under a battery backed LED recessed fixture and press a button on the remote control forcing the indication of the battery level to become active or alternatively forcing a break in the connection of external power into the fixture so that the user may determine that the light is operating properly using the integrated power source. In alternate embodiments, the fixture may have a transmitter designed in that may transmit a representation of the battery charge level periodically to allow an external system such as a computer, laptop, handheld computer, dedicated hardware etc. to provide a user with a status on whether the battery power is at an acceptable level. By way of an example, in an emergency lighting system, a fixture may transmit its battery charge level to a central controlling station that would then provide an alarm to a user when the battery charge level is below a threshold. The user may then replace the batteries. In alternate embodiments, there is one or more colored LEDs or a multicolor LED on the fixture that may provide a visual indication of the battery charge level. In alternate embodiment, a UPS light bulb or UPS lighting adapter may have a method to test the bulb or adapter, such as a button that may be pressed to briefly test that the light output powered by the integrated power source of the bulb or adapter is healthy, that may provide an indication of the battery level. In some embodiments, a button or switch may be used to break the connection of external power into the fixture to perform a test of the operation of the bulb or adapter when power is supplied by the internal power source. In alternate embodiments, the button or switch may be replaced by a wireless receiver integrated with the bulb or adapter and a separate remote control that provides the same operation when the button or switch on the remote control is actuated.","In embodiments of the wireless light bulb with an LED light source, there may be a constant current driver that supplies a constant current drive to the LEDs but in addition an auxiliary power supply that provides a constant DC power source may also be provided. The constant current power source and constant DC power source may be derived from the same circuit or alternatively they may be independently operating circuits. By way of an example, a motion sensor circuit may be powered from the auxiliary power supply that may always be present and has the ability to turn on or off the constant current supply to the LEDs. In this example, the motion sensor circuit is always active and may control the power source to the LEDs independently. In another example, a rechargeable battery inside the wireless light bulb is recharged from the auxiliary power supply independent of the constant current drive to the LEDs. Thus, the rechargeable battery may be recharged without having to consume power from the constant current drive to the LEDs in which case the light output of the LED light source would not be affected while the battery is charging. It is to be appreciated that any type of sensor, wireless input, wired input or power management of an embedded power source may be used in conjunction with the auxiliary power supply to provide operation of the sensor, wireless input, wired input or power management of an embedded power source.","In embodiments of the wireless light bulb containing a motion sensor, the motion sensor may be powered by a capacitor, super capacitor, ultra capacitor or the like independent of the input power. In such an embodiment, the capacitor may be charged from the input power when the light source is on. When the light source is on and receiving power from the input power source, the capacitor may be used to power the motion sensor while that capacitor is being charged by the input power source. By way of an example, the motion sensor circuit powered by the capacitor detects motion and switches on power to the light source. While the light source is on, the capacitor may be charging. If the motion detector detects motion prior to an auto shutoff time, it will continue to switch on power to the light source and reset the auto shutoff timer. If the motion detector does not detect motion prior to the auto shutoff time, it will switch off power to the light source. The capacitor may continue to power the motion sensor such that it may be active but not draw power from the input power source. In alternate embodiments, the sensor powered by the capacitor may be a light sensor. In alternate embodiments, a wireless receiver is powered by the capacitor. In alternate embodiments, a microcontroller, microprocessor or other type of programmable device is powered by the capacitor. It is to be appreciated that any combination of sensor, wireless receiver, programmable device or the like may be powered by the capacitor. The advantage to using a capacitor versus a rechargeable battery is that in a high temperature environment such as an LED light bulb, LED light fixture etc a capacitor may have a considerably higher operating temperature and may not be subject to capacity loss like known types of rechargeable batteries. By way of an example, a motion sensor designed with a PIR sensor, operational amplifier to amplify the signal from the PIR sensor and a threshold detector that triggers when the level detected out of the PIR sensor exceeds some level may require 50 uA of power and may require a minimum operating voltage of 3 VDC. If a 10 F capacitor is used and initially is charged to 5 VDC, the dv\/dt=I\/C may determine the amount of time the capacitor may power the circuit before the voltage to the motion sensor drops below 3 VDC. In such a case, the dt=dv*C\/I=2 VDC*10 F\/50 uA=400,000 seconds or approximately 4.6 days thus the motion sensor may be operational for an extended period of time using a capacitor rather than using the input power. In alternate embodiments, the capacitor may be used to power the light source or other circuitry inside the bulb. By way of an example, the capacitor may power the light source at a glow level to allow the light to be used as a marker or a low light level to allow the light to be used for illumination at a low light intensity level.","In embodiments of wireless light bulbs or battery powered wireless lighting fixtures containing an integrated battery as a power source, a battery capacity and run time estimation may be performed to determine if a change to the drive level to the light source may be needed to extend the amount of time the light source may generate light. By way of an example, a light source may need to provide light at a minimum intensity level for greater than 90 minutes in emergency lighting applications. A battery capacity and run time estimation may be made by estimating the battery capacity level at an instant then factoring in an estimated capacity loss over time. The estimated capacity loss may be derived from a count of ON time as powered by the battery, ON time as powered by another power source and OFF time all in conjunction with a measurement of temperature. This information along with a knowledge of the current discharge profile of a particular battery may be used to alter the power requirements of the light source to alter the discharge and extend the time that light is available. The estimation of battery capacity level and run time estimation and adjustment in the operation of the bulb or fixture may be implemented in a programmable device such as a microcontroller, microprocessor or the like in the wireless light bulb or battery powered wireless lighting fixture to maintain the counts and temperature measurements over time, maintain a real time estimate of the current discharge profile and a control of the light intensity such that it may reduce the current discharge requirements to fit into a current discharge profile that would meet a time duration as required by an application. In some embodiments, the record of battery operation and adjustments over time may be retrieved by a user over a wired or wireless interface. In some embodiments, a current discharge profile may be reached that indicates that maintenance may be required such as a battery replacement. It is to be appreciated that the record of battery use may be retained in non-volatile memory.","In embodiments of UPS light bulbs, UPS lighting adapters, battery backed LED fixtures or battery powered wireless lighting fixtures a temperature fault indication may be provided when one or more temperatures measured by the device meets or exceeds a threshold. In some embodiments, the temperature fault may inhibit or alter the operation of the unit until the temperatures are measured below a threshold. It is to be appreciated that some hysteresis in the form of multiple thresholds may be used at the temperature fault thresholds to enable and disable operation. The temperature fault indication may be one or more additional indicator lights, an indication by modifying the operation of the device for example blinking the light source, an audible alarm etc. By way of an example, a UPS LED light bulb with a Li-Ion rechargeable battery that has a known maximum operating temperature may contain a red LED that may be turned on when the temperature measure by an NTC or similar device approaches or exceeds the maximum operating temperature of the Li-Ion battery. At the temperature fault, the UPS LED light bulb may turn off the light source to reduce the temperature and turn on the red LED to indicate the fault. In some embodiments, circuitry or intelligence in the UPS LED light bulb may reduce the light intensity to reduce the temperature by reducing the amount of heat generated by components of the UPS LED light bulb.","In embodiments of LED light bulbs, wireless light bulbs, UPS light bulb, UPS lighting adapter, battery backed LED fixtures, external light socket adapters, AC outlet adapters, AC outlet replacements, AC powered devices, AC circuit with embedded battery device designed with batteries embedded, wall switch or lighting control component, there may be protection circuitry built in to protect the device or attached devices from damage in the case of power surges or other disturbances in the power input that may damage the device or attached devices. In some embodiments with an embedded power source, when the protection mechanism is implemented the embedded power source may be used for some period of time to continue operation of the light source or attached device after the detected surge or other disturbance. After some period of time that no problem is detected, the bulb, adapter, fixture or device may switch back to the input power source. The protection circuitry may include metal oxide varistors (MOVs), diodes such as Zener diodes for transient suppression, selenium voltage suppressors, gas discharge tubes and the like. In some embodiments, the surge suppression circuitry may be designed such that the surge suppression circuitry inside the bulb, adapter, fixture or device may provide surge suppression functionality for other devices on the same electrical circuit outside of the bulb, adapter, fixture or device. By way of an example, a UPS lighting adapter may contain protection circuitry such that when a power surge occurs, the UPS lighting adapter detects the surge and protects the attached lighting device. In addition, the protection device in the UPS lighting adapter may protect other circuitry on the lighting circuit. The UPS lighting adapter may disconnect power to the attached lighting device or it may switch over power to its embedded power source. It is to be appreciated that an adapter may protect the device or devices attached to it.","In some embodiments, a wireless lighting control module may be designed to be integrated with other devices that may desire to control wireless lighting. The wireless lighting control module is a module that contains the circuitry and a defined interface that may be connected to physically and electrically by an external device. Thus, the module may be integrated into or connected to any device that may interface physically or electrically and may be required to transmit control to installed lighting devices or lighting control devices. In some embodiments, the wireless lighting control module may include an enclosure and have a mounting mechanism to allow it to be physically integrated with another device. In some embodiments the module may be removable and replaceable. In some embodiments, the module may contain an integrated power source. In some embodiments, the module may receive power from the external device over the interface. In some embodiments the module may be an electrical circuit on a printed circuit board that may be integrated into another device. By way of an example, a wireless lighting control module consists of an RF transmitter and an interface to a programmable logic controller (PLC) that may transmit control based on its programming to control wireless lights installed in an industrial environment. The PLC may have control output that may be wired to the wireless lighting control module such that it may control it to turn on, turn off, dim, test or otherwise control a lighting installation. In another use case, the wireless lighting control module may be integrated into a garage door opener and the transmitter may control battery powered wireless lighting fixtures that supply supplemental light when the garage door light is on. In an alternate example, the wireless lighting control module may be integrated into or plugged into a device such as a personal computer, laptop computer, handheld computer, smart phone or the like such that the wireless lighting control module may receive commands from the device or communicate with the device in some manner and control the installed lighting devices or lighting control devices as needed.","In some embodiments, a wireless lighting control module may be designed to be integrated with lights, fixtures, troffers, lamp bases, ballasts, lighting power supplies, lighting control devices and the like that may desire to control wireless lighting. In such an embodiment, the wireless lighting control module may be controlled over an interface. In some embodiments, the wireless lighting control module may electrically and physically connect to the control source or power input for the lights that the lights, fixtures, troffers, lamp bases, ballast, lighting power supplies, lighting control devices and the like are controlling. By way of an example, a wireless lighting control module may be electrically and physically connected to the Edison socket that is part of a light fixture such that it may determine whether the controlling device or devices for that fixture intend it to be on, off, dimmed etc. The wireless lighting control module may be physically inside the fixture. The wireless lighting control module may consist of an RF transmitter that may allow it to transmit commands based on the state of the lighting fixture to battery powered wireless lighting fixtures. In this way, the battery powered wireless lighting fixtures may provide additional or supplemental light to illuminate an area and those battery powered wireless lighting fixtures would be controlled by the same device that controls the fixture. By way of an example, a wireless lighting control module may be integrated into a fluorescent stairway light such that when the state of the fluorescent stairway light may trigger the wireless lighting control module to transmit control to the wireless light bulbs or battery powered wireless lighting fixtures. In this example, a battery powered stair light that may receive this control may be installed in the stairwell to provide supplemental lighting. In a similar example, the fluorescent stairway light provides emergency functionality such that upon detected an emergency situation, such as a power outage, the stairway light switches to its backup power source but may in addition transmit control to the battery powered stair lights such that they may turn on to provide supplemental light through the emergency.","In embodiments of wireless light bulbs, UPS light bulb, UPS lighting adapter, battery backed LED fixtures, external light socket adapters, AC outlet adapters, AC outlet replacements, AC powered devices, AC circuit with embedded battery device designed with batteries embedded, wall switch or lighting control component implementing the switch sense functionality, the device may measure resistance or capacitance across the input power and return to determine state of the controlling devices. By way of an example, the device may determine whether a controlling switch is open or closed based on the measurement of resistance and capacitance across the input power and return. In this example, a high resistance similar to an open circuit may indicated that one or more controlling switches or breakers are open and a lower resistance may indicate that the controlling switches and breakers are closed. By way of another example, if a triac dimmer or similar is the controlling device, the switch sense circuitry may detect changes in capacitance that represent different dimming levels. In some embodiments, the switch sense function that may detect the dimming level by measuring the capacitance across the input power and return may use the detection to set the dim level of the light source for example by setting the PWM control, embedded triac control, amplitude modulation control or the like of a light source to reflect the measured capacitance. In alternate embodiments, the bulb, adapter, fixture or device may generate a short pulse onto the input power line and monitor the return line for a return of the pulse. In a case where the device may be connected to a transformer at the source of the power, if the controlling devices are set to allow power through, a short pulse generated on the input power line may be received back on the return line. It is to be appreciated that the returning pulse waveform may be attenuated, distorted or altered in a number of ways. It is also to be appreciated that the pulse generator may be AC coupled onto the input power line. If the switch sense circuitry can detect the return pulse, it may allow the bulb, adapter, fixture or device to make a decision as to the state of the controlling devices and input power and switch over or not switchover to an embedded power source. In some embodiments, the switch sense function may trigger any decision to change state by the bulb, adapter, fixture or device as required by the application.","In embodiments, a UPS or Grid Shifting Lighting Fixture may be created integrating the UPS light bulb or UPS or grid shifting lighting adapter functionality into lighting fixture. The UPS or Grid Shifting Lighting Fixture may have an external power input and an embedded power source. Lighting fixtures that may make use of the UPS or grid shifting functionality include but are not limited to recessed cans, troffer lights, cove lights, floor lamps, chandeliers, pendant lights, sconces, track lights, undercabinet lights, emergency lights, exit signs, strip lights, light poles, street lamps, pathway lights, landscape lights, porch lights and the like. In alternate embodiments, the UPS or Grid Shifting Lighting Fixture may contain a grid tie inverter and may return power to the grid as mentioned herein.","In an illustrative embodiment, a wirelessly controlled LED light is described for use in Wireless Night Light  applications. With reference to , illustrated is a perspective view of an embodiment of a Wireless Night Light . In the illustrated embodiment, the Wireless Night Light  includes a transmitter , a pushbutton or switch , a transmitter electronic circuit , a receiver , a receiver electronic circuit , a power plug or battery  and a light source . The Wireless Night Light  allows a user to turn on and off a low intensity light used at night or in a dark area with a wireless signal. The Wireless Night Light  consists of a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter contains one or more pushbuttons or switches that command the receiver to turn on or off a remote light bulb, fixture or lamp by sending a wireless control signal to the receiver. The receiver receives the control message and turns a light bulb, fixture or lamp on or off based on the content of the message. The receiver, with a light source such as one or more embedded LEDs or a light bulb, fixture or lamp plugged into it, may be powered using a battery, may be plugged into an AC outlet or may have a DC power input. The transmitter is powered using a battery. The transmitter and receiver are electronic circuits mounted in separate enclosures. The transmitter and receiver may operate at a narrowband frequency in the frequency range from 300 MHz to 450 MHz. Data may be modulated using On-Off Keyed (OOK)\/Amplitude Shift Keyed (ASK) data. The electronic circuit on the transmitter may build a data message, modulate it into an OOK\/ASK data stream and transmit it using an antenna present in the transmitter enclosure. The electronic circuit in the receiver enclosure may receive the wireless signal using an antenna present in the receiver enclosure, de-modulate the OOK\/ASK data stream and decode the data message contained in the data stream. The data message format may contain the on or off command and any other information necessary to guarantee that the message received was directed to that receiver. An example of a use of the Wireless Night Light  is to allow a parent the ability to turn off a night light in a child's room without entering the room. A transmitter in the form of a handheld remote control or a wall switch plate mounted to the wall will allow a parent turn the light on or off. A receiver designed to plug into an AC outlet is plugged into the outlet. AC power to the AC outlet is set to be always on. The receiver may be designed to allow a light bulb or lamp to plug into it. When a pushbutton on the transmitter is pushed, the transmitter sends a wireless message to the receiver to command it to connect or disconnect power to the light bulb or lamp.","In an illustrative embodiment, a remote sensor wirelessly controlled LED light is described for use in Magnet Controlled Wireless Light Switch  applications. With reference to , illustrated is a perspective view of an embodiment of a Magnet Controlled Wireless Light Switch . In the illustrated embodiment, the Magnet Controlled Wireless Light Switch  includes a transmitter , a magnet , a pushbutton or switch , a magnetic switch , a transmitter electronic circuit , a receiver , a power plug or battery  and a light source . In an alternate embodiment, the light source  may be replaced by a receptacle  such as an AC power receptacle. The Magnet Controlled Wireless Light Switch  allows for the automatic wireless control of lighting based on whether a magnet is within range or outside of the range of a magnet. The Magnet Controlled Wireless Light Switch  consists of a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter may contain a magnetic switch. If the transmitter is within range of a magnet, the magnetic switch will be closed. If the transmitter is out of range of the magnet, the magnetic switch will be open. When the transmitter senses a change in the magnetic switch from open to closed or closed to open, it may send a wireless control message to the receiver to turn on or off a remote light bulb, fixture or lamp. The receiver may receive the control message and turns a light bulb, fixture or lamp on or off based on the content of the message. The receiver, with a light source such as one or more embedded LEDs or a light bulb, fixture or lamp, turns on or off the light source. By way of an example, if an AC powered bulb is plugged into an Edison socket that is the receptacle, the light may be turned on or off by energizing or de-energizing a relay to connect or disconnect power to the light bulb. The transmitter may also contain an override switch in the form of one or more pushbuttons that would allow control based on the magnetic switch to be disabled and allow for direct control using the pushbutton(s). When the magnetic switch is overridden, the wireless control messages commanding the receiver to turn the light bulb, fixture or lamp on or off will be sent when a pushbutton is depressed. The receiver, as a fixture or with a light bulb or lamp plugged into it, can be powered using a battery, can be plugged into an AC outlet or can be plugged into a standard light bulb socket. The transmitter is powered using a battery. The transmitter and receiver are electronic circuits mounted in separate enclosures. The transmitter and receiver may operate at a narrowband frequency in the frequency range from 300 MHz to 450 MHz. Data may be modulated using On-Off Keyed (OOK)\/Amplitude Shift Keyed (ASK) data. The electronic circuit on the transmitter may build a data message, modulate it into an OOK\/ASK data stream and transmit it using an antenna present in the transmitter enclosure. The electronic circuit in the receiver enclosure may receive the wireless signal using an antenna present in the receiver enclosure, de-modulate the OOK\/ASK data stream and decode the data message contained in the data stream. The data message format contains the on or off command and any other information necessary to guarantee that the message received was directed to that receiver. The intended use of the Magnet Controlled Wireless Light Switch  is to provide automatic wireless control of a light or lights turning on or off in an entryway, closet, drawer, window or door based on whether the condition of the entryway, closet, drawer, window or door is opened or closed. An example of a use of the Magnet Controlled Wireless Light Switch  is for automatic lighting control in a closet. A magnet is attached to the frame of the closet door. A transmitter is attached to the closet door aligned with the magnet. A receiver may be designed as a standalone battery powered wireless lighting fixture or to connect into a standard light bulb socket plugged into a light fixture that provides light inside the closet. The fixture is mounted to the wall as desired or the light bulb is plugged into the receiver. Batteries are installed in the battery powered wireless lighting fixture or AC power to the light fixture is set to be always on. When the closet door is closed, the transmitter will send a signal to the receiver to turn the fixture or light bulb off (disconnect power to the light source). When the closet door is open, the transmitter will send a signal to the receiver to turn the fixture or light bulb on (connect power to the light source).","In some embodiments, an Extendable Wireless Lighting Protocol allows for the wireless control of lighting based on the transmission of a serial data stream from one or more transmitters to one or more receivers. The Extendable Wireless Lighting Protocol may allow wireless lighting receivers to spend an extended time in low power mode without missing control transmitted by a wireless lighting transmitter. The wireless lighting receiver may employ a power sequencing algorithm to conserve power. In this embodiment, the receiver stays in a \u201chibernation\u201d mode to conserve power. The receiver is activated a few times per second by logic to monitor the receiver. After allowing the receiver some time to wake up from hibernation mode, the logic may begin looking for a preamble. The preamble is a sequence of data that the logic may detect and synchronize with. In some embodiments, the logic may know the data rate of the preamble as well as what the variance in data rate may be from different transmitters and the logic may use that information to determine if a preamble is being received. In some embodiments, the logic may automatically detect the baud rate of the preamble and determine if a valid preamble is being received. If the logic detects the start of a preamble from the receiver, it may continue to monitor the output of the receiver for a preamble. As long as the logic continues to detect a preamble, it will continue to search for the end of the preamble which is indicated by a known change in the sequence such as the reception of a start bit. Once the logic detects the start bit or similar, it may continue to decode the command. If the command is a valid command, the logic will take an action based on the command. If the logic detects that the output of the receiver is not a preamble, it will return to hibernation mode. The receiver will be taken out of hibernation mode per the power sequencing timing. The power sequencing of the receiver extends the battery life of the wireless light. The protocol requires that the preamble is transmitted for a long enough time period that the receiver will be able to receive the preamble during its periodic wake up times. The length of the preamble sent by the transmitter and the wake up frequency of the receiver must be set such that the logic will be guaranteed to detect a preamble. By way of an example, if the receiver wakes up every 100 ms and listens for a preamble, a transmitter preamble must be transmitted at least longer than 100 ms plus some time to make sure the receiver may start to detect the preamble at some point during the transmission. The baud rate of the preamble may affect power consumption of the receiver. By way of an example, if the period of a bit of the preamble is 100 us and the preamble consists of a pattern of ones and zeros similar to a square wave, the receiver may listen for the minimum amount of time required to determine if it might be receiving a preamble. For example, if the receiver listens for 200 us and determines that it is not receiving a preamble, it may return to hibernation mode. The average power consumption of such a case is dominated by the hibernation mode power consumption. The receiver will be powered in ON mode for 0.2 ms and in hibernation mode for 99.8 ms therefore the average power consumption will be close to the power consumption of hibernation mode. It is to be appreciated that the receiver will consume more power when it is receiving a frame or when environmental conditions make the output of the receiver appear to be a preamble.","The logic will read the data and execute commands according to a command protocol. Logic will monitor for received signals at a predetermined frequency. The command may be an \u201con\/off\u201d toggle command, an \u201con\u201d command, an \u201coff\u201d command, a \u201cdim\u201d command, a \u201cbrightness\u201d command, a \u201ccolor change\u201d command, a timer command or the like. In one embodiment, the logic reads a decoded channel number that is transmitted with the command and compares the decoded channel number to a module channel number. The module channel number may be selected by a user via a channel input device or it may be pre-programmed. In some embodiments, the protocol may include one or more synchronization bits after the preamble to verify the transmission prior to decoding the command. In some embodiments, a base command set is specified along with an indicator in the base command that additional commands are included. By way of an example, an 8-bit command may be transmitted including a 2-bit command and 4-bit channel number. If the last 2-bits of the command are \u201c11\u201d, then an additional command byte follows with the bits of the next command byte defined in any way required by the protocol. This type of extension may be implemented any number of times to any length.","In embodiments, a wireless lighting system may be provided such that a wireless signal indicating a detected power outage, alarm condition or emergency condition may be received by a battery powered wireless lighting fixture containing a microprocessor and LED light source. A remote detector may transmit the wireless signal upon detecting the power outage, alarm condition or emergency condition. By way of an example, the remote detector may be comprised of a smoke detector with a wireless transmitter. In another example, the remote detector may be comprised of a security system device and a wireless transmitter. In another example, the remote detector may be comprised of any device capable of detecting a condition related to a power outage, alarm condition or emergency condition that may transmit to and control battery powered wireless lighting fixtures. A protocol comprising of any combination of but not limited to a preamble, synchronization mechanism, command, channel number, data etc may allow the remote detector and battery powered wireless lighting fixture to communicate. Special functions may be present in different types of battery powered wireless lighting fixtures. For example, a night light mode may be included in a ceiling light allowing it to provide a low level of illumination.","In some embodiments, an Ultrasonic Motion Sensing LED Light Module may be designed to provide additional functionality for a stairwell or hallway emergency light.

In some embodiments, the interface may provide status information for the stairwell or hallway emergency light. By way of an example, if a battery or other internal power source is present in the stairwell or hallway emergency light, the interface may provide an indication of the battery capacity level. In this example, the module may provide an indication of the battery capacity level of the emergency light.","In embodiments of the Ultrasonic Motion Sensor LED Light Module, the ultrasonic motion sensor may be implemented using an ultrasonic transmitter, ultrasonic receiver and electronics to transmit and process the signal from the receiver. It may operate at any frequency, may have any viewing angle and may have any range as required by the application. By way of an example, the ultrasonic motion sensor may operate at 40 KHz, have a 180 degree viewing angle and have a range of operation of 7 meters.

In embodiments, the LED light source may illuminate in response to control over the interface from the emergency light. In some embodiments, the LED light source may be illuminated independent of the emergency light. By way of an example, the Ultrasonic Motion Sensing LED Light Module may directly monitor the input power or input from the emergency lighting circuit to independently illuminate the light source based on a determination that the light source is required. In some embodiments, the Ultrasonic Motion Sensing LED Light Module may have more than one light level. By way of an example, in the case where the state has changed such that the light source is illuminated, the Ultrasonic Motion Sensing LED Light Module may control the intensity of the light source based on the state of the ultrasonic motion sensor. In one example, when the ultrasonic motion sensor detects motion, the light intensity may be at a bright level, for example greater than 10 lux as detected on the surface of floor directly below the module, however if motion is not detected by the ultrasonic motion detector for some period of time, ie the auto shutoff timer expires without being retriggered by motion, the Ultrasonic Motion Sensing LED Light Module may change the light intensity to a lower level, for example greater than 1 lux as detected on the surface of the floor directly below the module. Using the ultrasonic motion sensor to control the light intensity such that the higher light intensity is only used when occupancy is detected may decrease the power consumption of the module and increase battery life.

It is to be appreciated that the control connection may be one or more lines and may use any method required to indicated the state of the controlling switches or devices that the Switch Sense Module is monitoring.","In one embodiment of grid shifting, a peak shedding module may be designed with an integrated power source, such as a rechargeable battery, to store and use power from the integrated power source, an input power connection, an output power connection and may contain the ability to identify a peak in power usage and transition some or all of the power required by a connected load to the integrated power source. The functionality may be pre-programmed, factory set, designed in a custom electrical circuit or the like to respond to sensors on the module or measurements of power usage made by the module and may contain a pre-programmed algorithm to implement the peak shedding function. The functionality may be learned using sensors on the module or measurements of power usage made by the module and an intelligent program that may change the behavior of the module based on the feedback received from the sensors or measurement devices on the module. The sensors or measurements may include a light sensor, motion sensor, an atomic clock or time receiver, temperature sensor or any other sensor mentioned herein, a measurement of power usage, a record of power usage over time, or any other measurement of the characteristics of the power that may be detected by the module that may allow the peak shedding function to meet the requirements of an application. In some embodiments, there may not be a sensor on the module and the peak shedding function is performed based on an intelligent program internally. The intelligent program may contain a real time clock that may be set by the user such that the intelligent program may use time of day or a calendar to perform the peak shedding functionality. The peak shedding function may be used for cost savings, energy efficiency or a reduction in demand. The peak shedding module may allow the power usage of an electrical circuit to be averaged over time so that an individual peak in the use of power no longer occurs or is reduced. A peak shedding module may have switches, dials, knobs etc on the module to set time of day, sensor or measurement thresholds such that a user may be able to control how the intelligent program manages the peak shedding module. Once set, the peak shedding module may act autonomously based on those settings and\/or the pre-programmed or designed function. The settings may be changed on occasion by the user.","In some embodiments, the peak shedding module may record a moving average of the power usage on the electrical circuit it is connected to. The peak shedding module may make an instantaneous measurement of power consumption of the electrical circuit. If the instantaneous measurement of power consumption of the electrical circuit exceeds some threshold, the peak shedding module may automatically transition some amount of power consumption to the integrated power source. It is to be appreciated that the peak shedding module may be able to transition power consumed on the electrical circuit quickly enough that it may reduce the subsequent peak in power consumption that may have occurred. In some embodiments, the peak shedding module may make adjustments over time based on the average power consumption such that it may adjust the threshold at which the peak shedding module begins to adjust power consumption.","To implement the sharing of power, the peak shedding module may monitor the power consumed by the electrical circuit from the input power. By way of an example, a very small resistor may be inserted in-line with the input power to output power connection in the peak shedding module and a voltage drop across the resistor may allow the peak shedding module to measure power being drawn from the input. The peak shedding module may have a diode OR connection to the power output such that the input power and power sourced from the integrated power source, such as a rechargeable battery, may be shared. A constant current circuit may be connected at the output of the rechargeable battery. By way of an example, an LM317 configured as a constant current source may be connected at the output of the battery with a programmable resistor in the circuit such that an external device, such as a microcontroller or microprocessor, may be able to change the amount of current sourced from the battery. By way of an example, a microcontroller that may be able to measure the power being drawn from the input power source may contain a program such that when the measured input power exceeds a programmed threshold, the microcontroller may adjust the resistance of the programmable resistor to set the current supplied from the battery. In supplying current from the battery, the amount of power required from the input source will reduce. By way of an example, in providing one hundred percent of the power to the electrical circuit, the input power consumption exceeds the threshold set in the microcontroller. The microcontroller may adjust the resistor in the constant current circuit as supplied from the battery to assume five percent of the power supplied. In response the input power consumption will be reduced. The microcontroller may make another measurement of the input power consumption and adjust the supply from the battery and so on. It is to be appreciated that the frequency of the measurements and adjustments may be any rate as required by the application. In an alternate embodiment, the sharing of power is done by FETs which may be PWM controlled from a device such as a microcontroller such that the power supplied from the input power source and the integrated power source may be adjusted using PWM to change the amount of power drawn from each source.","In some embodiments of the peak shedding module, there may be a communication interface such that the module may communicate with an external source by wired connection over a power distribution network, for example on the AC power lines (X10, INSTEON, Broadband over Power Lines, proprietary communication scheme etc), or wirelessly through a wireless interface (dedicated RF communication link, ZIGBEE, WIFI, ENOCEAN, BLUETOOTH etc). By way of an example, the electric company may control or gather status from peak shedding modules throughout its power distribution network to remotely offload power usage at times when power demand is high or is peaking by commanding some portion or the entire distributed network of peak shedding modules to battery backup. It is to be appreciated that a peak shedding module may be used with one or more devices on an electrical circuit such that the module may monitor and supply power to the one or more devices as determined by the peak shedding module. In embodiments, the one or more devices may be a lighting device, lighting adapter, lighting fixture, troffer, lamp or lamp base, ballast, lighting power supplies, lighting control device and the like, television, television peripheral, computer, servers, network equipment, storage devices, appliance, washer, clothes dryer, refrigerator, freezer, electric range, microwave oven, electric water heater, vacuum cleaner, cell phone charger, stereo, air conditioner, HVAC devices, electric or hybrid vehicles, electric motors, portable generators and backup power sources, uninterruptable power supplies (UPS), inverters, industrial and manufacturing machinery etc. In some embodiments, the peak shedding module may be connected to one or more electrical circuits in a facility. By way of an example, a lighting circuit controlled by a peak shedding module at a circuit breaker for the lighting circuit may receive a command from an external source such as a building management system to shift some amount of power required by the circuit to the integrated rechargeable battery. It is to be appreciated that the embedded power source of the peak shedding module may be any size required by the devices that it may be doing peak shedding for. By way of an example, a peak shedding module may contain an AC input, an AC output, an embedded rechargeable battery and the circuitry required to supply power from the AC input, the integrated power source or both.","In embodiments using the peak shedding module, a peak shedding system may be created using several peak shedding modules to distribute the implementation of peak shedding throughout a facility. By way of an example, a residence may contain a peak shedding module on every electrical circuit in the residence. Each individual peak shedding module may make adjustments as required by the electrical circuit it is performing the peak shedding function on. In such a manner, the distributed peak shedding function implemented by the peak shedding system may reduce or eliminate a peak power condition from the electric company. In some embodiments, the peak shedding modules may be designed into a single control panel. In alternate embodiments, the peak shedding modules may be integrated into the circuit breaker panel. In some embodiments a peak shedding module may be used on multiple electrical circuits simultaneously. It is to be appreciated that a peak shedding module may be any size and may use a rechargeable battery of any size to meet the requirements of the application.","Referring to , the present invention may provide for power outage management through a lighting facility A-H and a power outage detection device  connected to power distribution , where the lighting facility A-H may include an LED lighting source , a control facility , an internal power source , a power outage input device, and the like.

The current sense  may detect the amount of current flowing through the sense resistor  by measuring the voltage at one or both sides of the sense resistor . The current sense  will measure different amounts of current flowing if the wall switch is open or closed. If the wall switch is open, an open circuit exists and no current or a very small amount of current may flow through the sense resistor . If the wall switch is closed, a low impedance path exists and a larger current will be measured by the current sense . By way of an example, the processor  and current sense  may be implemented in a microcontroller. For example, the processor  and current sense  may be implemented in a commercially available Freescale MC9S08QA2 microcontroller with an analog to digital conversion capability. The microcontroller may convert the analog voltage measured at one or both sides of the sense resistor  to a digital value allowing firmware to determine whether the amount of current flowing through the sense resistor  may be indicative of an open switch or a closed switch. In such an embodiment, the Remote Switch Sensing Circuit  is detecting the electrical characteristics of the circuit by generating a signal and detecting the state of the generated signal without having to receive a return signal or measure characteristics of the power connection directly. The amount of current flowing out of the Remote Switch Sensing Circuit  may provide an indication of the state of controlling devices. By way of an example, a pulse may be generated that is 10 microseconds in duration and has a peak voltage of 3 volts and the sense resistor  has a value of 100 ohms. If the controlling switch is open, the current sense  may detect a voltage of 2.9 volts on one side of the sense resistor  after the voltage drop. If the controlling switch is closed, the current sense  may detect a voltage of 0.1 volts on one side of the sense resistor  after the voltage drop. The additional current flowing through the sense resistor  is there due to the low impedance present when the switch is closed. In alternate embodiments, devices outside of the Remote Switch Sensing Circuit  may present a resistance or impedance that the Remote Switch Sensing Circuit  may detect to determine the state of the controlling devices. By way of an example, an electrical circuit may be attached to a controlling device such that the electrical circuit monitors the input power to the controlling device. If the controlling device is open and no input power is present at the input of the controlling device, the electrical circuit may detect such a state and switch a resistance or impedance into the circuit such that the Remote Switch Sensing Circuit  may detect the switched in resistance or impedance. Thus, in a system with the electrical circuit monitoring the state of the controlling device and input power, the Remote Switch Sensing Circuit  may detect an open switch, closed switch and open switch with no input power as three different levels of current flowing through the sense resistor  and as such may implement a state change based on the detected external condition. In this example, the Remote Switch Sensing Circuit  may be able to detect a power outage when the controlling device or switch is open.","In embodiments of switch sense circuits, the switch sense circuit may need to adjust or learn thresholds based on the electrical characteristics of the wiring, controlling devices or attached devices on the electrical circuit that the switch sense circuit may be monitoring. By way of an example, in a lighting circuit one or more attached devices may be incandescent bulbs, CFL bulbs or LED bulbs which may provide an impedance on the lighting circuit affecting the detection done by a switch sense circuit. One or more incandescent bulbs may present a heavier resistive load as detected by the switch sense circuit. In the case of a Remote Switch Sensing Circuit , the heavier resistive load may change the amount of current detected by the Remote Switch Sensing Circuit . By way of an example, when a controlling switch is open on an AC power circuit, an incandescent bulb will still provide a heavily resistive load to the Remote Switch Sensing Circuit  because the incandescent bulb provides a path from the AC hot to AC neutral. When a controlling switch is closed, the low impedance path through the closed switch may be in parallel with the impedance of the one or more incandescent bulbs such that the Remote Switch Sensing Circuit  may be able to detect a difference in current sensed in the open switch state and the closed switch state however the difference will be less with the incandescent bulbs in parallel. In an alternate example, one or more CFL or LED bulbs may present an impedance that may affect the Remote Switch Sensing Circuit  detection. For example, the one or more CFL or LED bulbs may contain a small filter capacitor at their power input to filter out power line noise. The characteristics of the pulse generated by the Remote Switch Sensing Circuit , such as pulse width or periodicity, may be determined to allow the Remote Switch Sensing Circuit  to operate in the presence of devices such as the filter capacitors. It is to be appreciated that any embodiment of the switch sense circuit may need to operate in the presence of a lighting device, lamp, television, television peripheral, computer, servers, network equipment, storage devices, appliance, washer, clothes dryer, refrigerator, freezer, electric range, microwave oven, electric water heater, vacuum cleaner, cell phone charger, stereo, air conditioner, HVAC devices, electric or hybrid vehicles, electric motors, portable generators and backup power sources, uninterruptable power supplies (UPS), inverters, industrial and manufacturing machinery etc to allow a detection of a disruption of power and enable a change in state to use a backup power source, to provide an alarm or alert to a user or the like.","In embodiments of the switch sense circuit, the circuit may learn or detect the electrical characteristics of the circuit it is monitoring such that the switch sense circuit may set the thresholds at which a change of state is required based on the learned electrical characteristics of the monitored circuit. By way of an example, if the switch sense circuit is powered on with one or more incandescent bulbs in circuit but with the switch turned off, the switch sense circuit may store that state as the \u201coff\u201d state of the circuit. The user may then turn the switch on. When the switch sense circuit detects a change from the \u201coff\u201d state by detecting a change in the electrical characteristics of the circuit it is monitoring, the switch sense circuit may store the second state as the \u201con\u201d state of the circuit. Then, the switch sense circuit may set a threshold between the \u201coff\u201d state and \u201con\u201d state such that when the switch sense circuit detects the state of the circuit on one side of the threshold, the \u201coff\u201d state has been detected and when the switch sense circuit detects the state of the circuit on the other side of the threshold, the \u201con\u201d state has been detected. By way of an example, the Remote Switch Sensing Circuit  detects changes in state by sensing the current draw. If one or more incandescent light bulbs are in the circuit the Remote Switch Sensing Circuit  is monitoring, it may determine the \u201coff\u201d state by determining the amount of current drawn at power on and the \u201con\u201d state by detecting a change in current draw. The \u201coff\u201d state and \u201con\u201d state are two levels of current measured in the circuit and from this learned information the Remote Switch Sensing Circuit  may set a threshold allowing it to thereafter determine changes in state. In alternate embodiments, the switch sense circuit may detect that power has been applied and thus determine that the state is \u201con\u201d. In such an embodiment, the switch sense circuit may use power applied as a method to learn and store the electrical characteristics of the \u201con\u201d state. Thus the switch sense circuit may learn and store what the \u201cnormal open\u201d state and \u201cnormal closed\u201d state of a controlling device by measuring the electrical characteristics of the circuit in a one of the methods mentioned herein or the like. In some embodiments, the switch sense circuit may take multiple samples and use the statistical characteristics over multiple measurements to determine the state of the controlling device. By way of an example, the Remote Switch Sensing Circuit  may take make several analog to digital conversions over a sampling interval, take an average of the samples and from the average of the samples make a determination of the state of the controlling devices. In an example of the Remote Switch Sensing Circuit  monitoring the state of controlling devices over an AC power line, the AC power may affect the detection at different points based on the voltage of the AC waveform at the point that the sample is taken. In alternate embodiments, a switch sense circuit may select the minimum or maximum level detected over some sampling period and use the minimum or maximum level detected compared against some threshold for the purposes of determining the state of controlling devices. By way of an example, a Remote Switch Sensing Circuit  may detect different levels of current through the sense resistor due to devices in the path between the detector and the controlling devices, due to other devices on the lighting circuit or due to different voltages on the power input such as voltage changes in an AC waveform, voltage changes in the DC voltage (due to a changing voltage from a battery supply for example) or the like. The Remote Switch Sensing Circuit  may take the minimum or maximum level detected over a sample in such a case as the minimum or maximum level may provide the best indication of the state of the controlling devices.","In embodiments of the switch sense circuit generating a pulse or signal and monitoring the response to the pulse or signal to determine the state of the circuit and controlling switches, the pulse or signal generator may dither the pulses or signals if the pulses or signals are generated periodically creating a spread spectrum frequency response to reduce electromagnetic interference generated from the switch sense circuit. It is to be appreciated that the spreading rate, spreading style, modulation rate and modulation waveform may differ based on the switch sense circuit implementation. The short pulses or signals that may be generated to implement the switch sense function may have a wideband frequency response providing electromagnetic interference however the resulting electromagnetic interference may be enhanced by dithering the pulses.","In embodiments of the sensing the state of controlling devices remotely, a switch sense circuit may include protection circuitry to allow the switch sense circuit to monitor the power line in the presence of inrush current, power surges, voltage spikes, overshoot, undershoot and the like on the power lines being monitored. In embodiments, a switch sense circuit may need to monitor the power lines for the response to a stimulus generated by the switch sense circuit. The response may indicate the sense of the controlling devices. The switch sense circuit may need protection circuitry such as inrush limiters, surge suppressors, diode for clamping voltage, TVS devices and the like however these devices must allow the switch sense circuit to detect the response. By way of an example, a Remote Switch Sensing Circuit  may be detecting the state of a wall switch. When the wall switch is initially switched to the on position, an inrush current may be produced to the circuit. In addition, voltage spikes high and low may be seen by the switch sense circuit even with coupling circuitry in place because the wall switch may be closed at any point in the AC waveform such that some energy may get through the coupling circuit. In an example, the Remote Switch Sensing Circuit  may be connected to a 120 VAC 60 Hz power line. The coupling circuitry may be designed to block the 60 Hz signal in steady state however when the wall switch is switched to the on position, the coupling circuit may not block the signal for a brief period of time due to the initial state of the input power at turn on and any switch bounce that may be present from the wall switch. In such as case, an inrush current may get through the coupling circuit. In addition, voltage spikes as high as 170 volts may be detected after the coupling circuit without any protection circuitry. In this example, the switch sense circuit may include an inrush limiter to limit inrush current, may include a Schottky diode to clamp voltage after the coupling circuit from going below the isolated ground by more than the voltage drop of the Schottky diode and may include a zener diode to clamp voltage after the coupling circuit from going above the maximum operating voltage of any circuitry after the coupling circuit including the detection circuitry.","In an alternate embodiment of sensing the state of controlling devices, a signal generator circuit may be attached to a controlling device and encode a data stream to a receiver circuit inside the detecting device to provide a unidirectional indication of the state of the controlling device. By way of an example, in a lighting circuit, a short pulse generator may be designed using a gated oscillator design and installed in a lighting control device. Circuitry may be present to detect whether the controlling device intends to turn the lights on or off. Circuitry may also be present to detect whether input power is present at the controlling device. The circuitry embedded in the controlling device may be able to send a stream of pulses to the receiving lighting device to indicate that the lighting device should be on, should be off or should be on and powered by a power source integrated in the lighting device or somewhere on the lighting circuit. In the example using a short pulse generator, the receiver may contain the necessary gain, filtering and latching mechanism to detect and recover the pulses as well as decode the information about the state of the controlling device. Different characteristics of the pulse or pulse train may indicate the state of the controlling device. In the lighting circuit example, different separation in the pulses may indicate the state of the controlling device. In an alternate example, the width of the pulse may be changes to indicate the state of the controlling device. It is to be appreciated that the short pulses generated at the controlling device may be encoded in any manner that may allow the receiving device to change state in accordance with the commands from the controlling device. In alternate embodiments, bidirectional communication may be used between the controlling device and controlled device.","In some embodiments, a UPS Switch Sense Module may be designed to be integrated with a device receiving external power to implement a switch sensing function to detect the state of a controlling switches or devices remotely to allow the device to use an integrated or local power source based on the state of the remotely sensed controlling switches or devices. The UPS Switch Sense Module may contain the circuitry and a defined interface that may be connected to physically and electrically by an external device. The module may be integrated into or connected to any device that it may interface physically or electrically to and may be required to detect the state of one or more controlling switches or devices. In some embodiments, the UPS Switch Sense Module may be designed to be integrated with lighting devices, computers, servers, network equipment, storage devices, uninterruptable power supplies (UPS), inverters, appliances, cordless phones, televisions, television peripherals, security cameras, security systems and equipment, alarm clocks, electric or hybrid vehicles, electric motors, portable generators and backup power sources, industrial and manufacturing machinery etc and the like that may desire to detect the state of controlling switches or devices connected to them. In some embodiments, the UPS Switch Sense Module may include an enclosure and have a mounting mechanism to allow it to be physically integrated with another device. In some embodiments the module may be removable and replaceable. In some embodiments, the module may contain an integrated power source. In alternate embodiments, the module may receive power from a second external power source intended to provide a backup power source. In alternate embodiments, the module may receive power from the external device over the interface. In some embodiments, the module may have a connection to input power that is controlled by the one or more switches or devices of which the UPS Switch Sense Module may need to detect the state. In some embodiments the module may be an electrical circuit on a printed circuit board or the like that may be integrated into another device. By way of an example, a UPS Switch Sense Module may be used to detect the state of an on\/off wall switch controlling power to a portable generator plugged into a wall outlet providing AC power. As long as the on\/off wall switch is in the on position and AC power is available to use, AC power will be used by anything on that circuit. If the on\/off wall switch is in the on position and AC power is not available or if the wall switch is in the off position, the portable generator may provide power to devices on the circuit. In alternate examples, the portable generator will be started up or shut down when a transition is sensed from one state to another. By way of another example, a universal power supply (UPS) may detect the state of a controlling switch such that when the switch is in the off position, the UPS may not switchover to battery backup because the user may intend to turn off the attached devices. If the power switch is in the on position and no power is detected, the UPS may then provide power to the attached devices.","In embodiments of the switch sense function, a battery powered power outage alarm may be created for emergency situations that automatically detects a change in switch state of controlling devices or an emergency circuit as well as a disruption in power and creates a visual alarm, audible alarm, transmits an indication of the power outage to an alarm system or derangement panel and the like. By way of an example, a device may be designed integrated into a lighting fixture that contains a speaker to generate an audible alarm. The lighting fixture may be controlled by a wall switch such that under normal operation the lighting fixture may be turned on and off by the wall switch. During a disruption in power such as a power outage, the lighting fixture may generate an audible alarm to indicate that there is a power outage. In some examples, the lighting fixture may have a battery backup in the lighting fixture such that it may still provide light during the outage and would also provide a second indication in the form of an alarm that there is a disruption in power.","In embodiments a switch sense wireless light bulb powered locally by an internal power source containing a switch sense circuit may be designed. The switch sense circuit may be designed into the wireless light bulb such that a controlling device such as a wall switch, may still control turning the wireless light bulb on and off even though the wireless light bulb is not powered by power coming in on the connection to the wall switch. In some embodiments, there may be one or more energy harvesting power sources used in conjunction with the internal power source to power the wireless light bulb or recharge the internal power source of the wireless light bulb. By way of an example, a wireless light bulb with a non-rechargeable battery internal may be controlled by a wall switch via the switch sense circuit. In another example, a wireless light bulb with a rechargeable battery internal and solar cells on the face of the wireless light bulb to recharge the internal battery may be controlled by a wall switch via the switch sense circuit. It is to be appreciated that the switch sense wireless light bulb may be designed in any size or shape housing to meet the requirements of any standard size bulb (e.g. PAR30, PAR38, A19, R30, MR16 etc), non-standard size bulb, fixture, compact fluorescent bulb, fluorescent bulb or lamp (e.g. T4, T5, T8, circular etc.) or down light assembly (e.g. recessed fixtures, fluorescent fixtures or down light fixtures for residential, commercial or industrial lighting), or the like. It is to be appreciated that any combination of wireless control mentioned herein may be used in conjunction with the switch sense wireless light bulb. In alternate embodiments, a dimmer switch may be used to control the light intensity of the switch sense wireless light bulb. In such an embodiment, the switch sense circuit may need to detect the position of the dimmer switch such that it may set the light intensity of the switch sense wireless light bulb as necessary.","In embodiments a switch sense wireless switch powered locally by an internal power source containing a switch sense circuit may be designed along with a wireless transmitter in a housing that plugs into an outlet or connects to power distribution at some point such that a controlling device such as a wall switch, may still control turning remote devices on and off by transmitting wireless control as detected by the switch sense circuit to remote devices. Thus, when the wall switch is on, the switch sense circuit may detect the state and transmit an on command to remote devices and when the wall switch is off, the switch sense circuit may detect the state and transmit an off command to remote devices. In some cases, the switch sense wireless switch may transmit commands on changes in the state of the wall switch. In some embodiments, the switch sense wireless switch may be powered only by an internal power source. In some embodiments, the switch sense wireless switch may be powered or recharged by input power when available. In some embodiments, a wireless receiver may be designed into a device that would be controlled by the switch sense wireless switch. In some embodiments, the wireless receiver may be designed as a standalone module that another device may interface for control and or\/power. By way of an example, a wireless lighting system may be constructed using the switch sense wireless switch designed in a housing that may be plugged into an electrical outlet and one or more battery powered wireless lighting fixtures capable of receiving control from the switch sense wireless switch. In another example, a backup power system may be constructed using a switch sense wireless switch and an inverter with battery backup and a wireless receiver that an AC powered device may plug into. Using a wall switch that may control the switch sense wireless switch, the AC powered device may be turned on and off using the wall switch even though it is not directly plugged into the electrical outlet.","In embodiments a hybrid switch sense wireless light bulb powered locally by an internal power source, charged through a connection to an external power source and containing a switch sense circuit may be designed to allow the internal power source to be charged when the external power source is available. In addition, an intelligent wall switch controlling the hybrid switch sense wireless light bulb may be designed containing a timer to allow power to be applied to the bulb for the purposes of charging the battery based on time of day or some other timing mechanism when the user does not intend to illuminate the light source of the wireless light bulb. The intelligent wall switch may close the switch automatically at certain times when the wireless light bulb may be charging. In such an embodiment, the intelligent wall switch may provide a mechanism that may be detected by the switch sense circuit such that the switch sense circuit may know that the wall switch is in charging mode and as such not illuminate the light source. By way of an example, the intelligent wall switch may insert some impedance based on the charge mode approach that the switch sense circuit may detect as a third state that indicates charging mode. In alternate embodiments, the intelligent wall switch may periodically switch to charging mode when it detects that the wall switch is turned to the off position. The intelligent wall switch may learn over time typical times when the intelligent wall switch may be in the off position and create a schedule of charging times. In alternate embodiments, the functionality may be implemented by a controlling device and integrated circuitry or a module into the controlling device to implement the same functionality as the intelligent wall switch. In such embodiments, an existing controlling device may be retrofit with the integrated circuitry or module to allow it to provide the same or similar functionality as the intelligent wall switch. In embodiments, the light source may always be powered by the internal power source and as such the hybrid switch sense wireless light bulb may consume power from the line less than the amount of power required by the light source. In some embodiments, the light source may be powered through the connection to the external power source. The switch sense circuit may be designed into the wireless light bulb such that a controlling device such as the intelligent wall switch, may still control turning the wireless light bulb on and off even though the wireless light bulb is not powered by the external power source. By way of an example, a hybrid switch sense wireless light bulb may contain a rechargeable battery, connection to AC power as the external power source, two watt AC\/DC converter, battery charging circuit and a driver allowing the one or more LEDs to be driven from the internal power source. The battery may be charged from the AC\/DC converter when in charging mode but at no greater than two watts of power consumption from the external power source at any time. The LED driver powered out of the rechargeable battery may be to full light intensity. The LED driver may be powered from the two watt AC\/DC converter when the battery capacity level is measured below some acceptable level to power the light source. At times when power is out, the hybrid switch sense wireless light bulb may still operate. In this example, the power consumption from the external power source may not exceed two watts therefore the power to a light source used sporadically throughout the day would not draw peak power when turned on thereby implementing a form of peak shedding and\/or load leveling by balancing the power consumption through the day.","In an embodiment, a zero crossing detector may be designed for detecting the zero crossing point of an AC power waveform by generating a pulse, monitoring the waveform and determining the point on the cycle of the AC power waveform by measuring the response of the outgoing waveform to the generated pulse. As such, the zero crossing may be determined without directly measuring the AC power waveform. In the embodiment, the zero crossing detector includes a processor, a pulse generator, a sense resistor, a coupling circuit, a power connection, an inrush limiter and a current sense. The inrush limiter may change characteristics based on the pulse generated and the point on the AC power waveform at the time the pulse was generated. By creating many pulses through the duration of the AC power waveform and sampling the response, the processor may detect when the response to the pulse corresponds with a zero crossing. A zero crossing detector may be useful in synchronizing operation with an AC power input.","In embodiments of the intelligent wall switch, a wall switch may be designed to include a charging mode that may allow the switch to be closed to allow charging of a rechargeable integrated power source in the devices or on the circuit that it is controlling. The intelligent wall switch may provide a change in the electrical characteristics of the line to allow devices on the circuit to detect different modes. By way of an example, a device with a switch sense circuitry may be able to detect charging mode remotely and change state appropriately. In this example, detecting charging mode may allow a device to charge a rechargeable integrated power source without powering the device for normal operation.","In embodiments containing the ability to grid shift, an intelligent grid shifting system may be constructed using an intelligent wall switch and a device with a rechargeable integrated power source with the ability of the intelligent wall switch to enter a charge mode that the end device may detect or may be programmed to enter into a charge mode simultaneously with the wall switch. In some embodiments, the intelligent wall switch and\/or grid shifting device may be programmed directly at the switch or device via some user interface with the configuration maintained on the switch or device. In embodiments, the intelligent grid shifting system may communicate with control systems for status and control of the grid shifting function provided by the intelligent grid shifting system. In some embodiments, the intelligent wall switch includes the ability to communicate via wired or wireless connection as mentioned herein. In alternate embodiments, the intelligent wall switch and\/or grid shifting device may be programmed, configured or queried via the wired or wireless communication interface by an external controller. In charge mode, the intelligent wall switch may automatically close the wall switch or bypass the wall switch allowing power to be applied to the circuit at times when power was not intended to be applied to the circuit. If the end device may detect that the power is applied but the mode is charge mode, the end device may use the applied power only for charging purposes. The end device may detect charge mode using switch sense functionality, using a communication mechanism over the circuit, by means of synchronized operation with the intelligent wall switch such that both the switch and end device enter charge mode at the same time or the like. In one embodiment, an intelligent grid shifting lighting system may be developed using an intelligent wall switch and one or more lighting devices with a rechargeable integrated power source, charging circuitry, switch sense functionality and a light source that may be powered by either the external power input or the integrated power source. In such an embodiment, the intelligent wall switch may be programmed to use time of day to enter charging mode when the lighting device may not be used, for example during night hours when there is no occupancy in an office space. At those times, the lighting devices may detect that the intelligent wall switch is in charge mode and also enter charge mode. As such, the lighting devices use the external power source to charge the integrated power source if needed and do not illuminate the light source. The intelligent wall switch may have user control, for example an on\/off switch, such that a user may turn the lighting devices on and off as desired. If a user turns the lights on while in charging mode, the lighting devices may detect the change in switch state and illuminate the light source. In alternate embodiments, the lighting devices have a time of day clock and enter charging mode approximately at the same time as the intelligent wall switch. It is to be appreciated that the intelligent wall switch may be any type of switch or controlling device used to control an electrical or lighting circuit such as but not limited to toggle switches, dimmer switches, three way or multi-way switches, timer controlled switches, motion sensor switches, push button or touch switches, paddle switches, solid state switches, slide switches, rotary switches, control panels, lighting control systems, dedicated charge mode devices and the like. The intelligent grid shifting system may be used for grid shifting for energy efficiency, demand response applications, peak shedding, load control, load leveling, backup power or any other use of a hybrid power system mentioned herein.","In an illustrative embodiment, a method for implementing grid shifting that allows a sharing of the load among one or more power sources is described for use in a Power Sharing Approach for Grid Shifting . With reference to , illustrated is a block diagram view of an embodiment of a Power Sharing Approach for Grid Shifting . In the illustrated embodiment, the Power Sharing Approach for Grid Shifting  includes one or more power sources , a power sensing mechanism , power control , a sharing circuit , end devices  and a processor . The Power Sharing Approach for Grid Shifting  may be implemented inside a device, may be a module that may integrate into a device, may be implemented in a device that controls an electrical circuit where multiple end devices are controlled, may be implemented across multiple electrical circuits (ie at a breaker box or at the building level) etc. The Power Sharing Approach for Grid Shifting  may be implemented by monitoring the amount of power consumed from one or more power sources  via a power sensing mechanism  and a processor , then the processor  may configure a power control  mechanism to adjust the amount of power supplied from different sources. The result, using a sharing circuit , is the ability to control how much power comes from each source to power end devices  connected to the grid shifting solution. In some embodiments, the processor  may be programmed with an algorithm to determine the amount of sharing based on time of day, measurements of power consumed from different power sources, measurements of environmental variables such as battery capacity level or any other purpose that may benefit from the sharing of load by more than one power source. In alternate embodiments, the processor  may be configured via an external communication mechanism to configure or program the processor  to implement a power sharing algorithm. In one embodiment, the power sensing mechanism  may use sense resistors and a microcontroller with the ability to measure the amount of current through the sense resistors. The microcontroller may then use pulse width modulation or similar to implement a mechanism of power control to adjust the draw from the power sources based on the desired amount of sharing between the power sources. In one embodiment targeting LED lighting applications, two power sources may be an external power source such as AC power from the line and an integrated power source such as a rechargeable battery. In such a case, the LED lighting device may contain two LED drivers, one to drive the LEDs from line power and one to drive the LEDs from the integrated power source. The light source is the end device . The power control  mechanism may be the ability to PWM control each of the LED drivers such that the percentage of power drawn from each power source to provide power to the light source may be controlled by using PWM similar to how it is used for dimming purposes but in this case the dimming of the two power sources allows the processor  to control the amount of power from each source. The sharing circuit  may be a simple diode OR of the two power sources after the power control  mechanism and after the output of the LED drivers. In alternate embodiments, the Power Sharing Approach for Grid Shifting  may be implemented with multiple end devices powered by the output. By way of an example, an electrical circuit controlled by a 15 amp circuit breaker may have a device using the Power Sharing Approach for Grid Shifting  method to provide grid shifting among more than one power source to the electrical circuit. In the example, the two power sources may be AC power after the 15 amp circuit breaker and a local backup power device such as an inverter with an integrated battery. In such a case, the power sharing approach applies to AC power as it is distributed on the electrical circuit and some of the load typically supplied by AC power may be supplied by the inverter with an integrated battery. Any end devices on the circuit may benefit from the sharing approach.","In embodiments, a Battery Backed LED Driver may be constructed.  shows a block diagram of the Battery Backed LED Driver  that may use the external power source or integrated power source if the external power source is not available. The Battery Backed LED Driver  may include an external power input , an AC\/DC converter , battery charger circuitry , a power source selection circuit , a step up LED driver , an integrated power source  and an external control input . A Battery Backed LED Driver  may be designed with power source selection circuit  such that when external power is applied, the external power input  supplies power to the light source. When the external power is no longer present the power source selection circuit  may automatically switch such that the integrated power source  may supply power to the light source. In the illustrative embodiment, the light source is driven by the step up LED driver  whether the power source is the external power input  or the integrated power source . In the illustrative embodiment, the power selection circuit  consists of diode and a FET to allow for the automatic selection of the power source into the step up LED driver  such that when power is supplied by the external input, the battery is disconnected from the step up LED driver  and when power is not supplied at the external input the FET connects the integrated power source  to the step up LED driver . In alternate embodiments the switching circuitry may consist of a relay, solid state switch, discrete circuitry and the like such that the desired power source may be supplied. It is to be appreciated that several methods of selecting and switching the power source will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. In the illustrated embodiment, the step up LED driver  is a Linear Technology LT3755 step up LED driver . It is to be appreciated that any type of step up DC\/DC converter and\/or LED constant current driver circuit may be used to supply power with the desired drive characteristics. It is to be appreciated that any alternate LED driver may be used and that driver may be a step up driver, a step down driver, a buck boost driver or the like.","In the illustrated embodiment, the embedded battery supply  is a dual cell Li-Ion battery pack. It is to be appreciated that the integrated power source  may be any rechargeable battery type mentioned herein. In alternate embodiments, the integrated power source  may be non-rechargeable such as one or more alkaline batteries. In other embodiments, the integrated power source  may be a capacitor, super capacitor, fuel cell etc. In the illustrative embodiment, the dual cell Li-Ion battery pack is charged with dual cell Li-Ion charging circuit based on the Microchip MCP73213 battery charger. It is to be appreciated that any type of battery charger circuit may be used to charge the desired type rechargeable battery used as the integrated power source . In the illustrated embodiment, the AC\/DC converter  may be any AC\/DC converter circuit that meets the requirements of the application. In embodiments, the Battery Backed LED Driver  may be designed into a housing to allow it to be integrated into LED lighting devices or used external to LED lighting devices. The housing may have a mounting mechanism to allow it to be physically mounted inside or outside of an LED lighting device. Thus a Battery Backed LED Driver Module may be designed into a singular housing to provide LED drive and battery backup capabilities with the functionality to select the power source and drive the LED light source integrated into the module.","As mentioned herein, the external control input  may receive an input or detect a condition that allows the Battery Backed LED Driver  to make a decision on which power source to use to power the light source. In the illustrated embodiment, the external control input  may receive an input or detect the condition and control the shutdown input to the LT3755 such that the LT3755 will not drive the output. In alternate embodiment, the external control input may enable or disable the integrated power source  to supply power using FETs, relays or any other type of control that would allow the external control input  to enable or disable integrated power source  and\/or the external power input  from supplying power. The switching devices may be at any position in the circuit to implement the required switching function. In alternate embodiments, power may be shared such that intelligence in the Battery Backed LED Driver  may control the power sources such that they both supply some amount of power. In some embodiments the Battery Backed LED Driver  contains a battery level detector to provide an indication of the capacity remaining in the integrated power source . By way of an example, an external LED may be driven when the battery level voltage is below a threshold that may indicate a low battery level. The external LED may be mounted in the ceiling to provide a visual indication of the battery capacity level or if the battery is being charged. It is to be appreciated that an indication of the battery capacity level or charging may be provided in any manner described herein.","In embodiments of a battery embedded module for use in retrofit LED fixtures, the battery embedded module may be used for grid shifting applications. In some embodiments, the Grid Shifting Battery Embedded LED Driver Module may contain elements of the Power Sharing Approach for Grid Shifting  and the Battery Backed LED Driver  or the like to allow the integrated power source to be used for grid shifting for energy efficiency, demand response applications, peak shedding, load control, load leveling, backup power or any other use of a hybrid power system mentioned herein. In embodiments, intelligence may be designed into the module to implement a grid shifting algorithm to optimize the use of the device in a retrofit LED fixture.","In one use case, a peak shedding\/grid shifting module may be designed that allows grid shifting to occur regularly when battery capacity is available to support grid shifting to achieve cost savings however at certain times when a peak in power usage is expected, for example in the summer months, the module may provide a peak shedding function at those times. In some uses, the module may be integrated into a lighting device to provide this functionality. In other uses, the module may be integrated into any electrical device that may benefit from the peak shedding\/grid shifting operation of the module. The module may have intelligence integrated into it to allow the device to hold reserve capacity to guarantee that capacity will be available for the required function. By way of an example, the module may allow grid shifting only down to fifty percent capacity of the integrated power source so that if peak shedding is required, the module may be able to provide that function for a minimum period of time. It is to be appreciated that the module may have similar functionality to the automatic grid shifting wireless light bulb and peak shedding module mentioned herein. It is to be appreciated that grid shifting may be optimized for cost savings and energy efficiency and peak shedding may be optimized for reducing power consumption during peak times.","In embodiments targeting peak shedding, a peak monitoring device may be developed to communicate with devices capable of peak shedding to allow a central detection of a peak in power usage and subsequently control the peak shedding devices to transition power usage to integrated power sources to reduce power consumption during the peak times. When the peak in power usage is over, the peak monitoring device may communicate with the peak shedding devices to transition power back to the external power source. In some embodiments, the peak monitoring device may be electrically and physically connected to the monitored electrical interface. In alternate embodiments, the peak monitoring device may be a current loop to detect the flow of energy on power lines without the need for a direct electrical or physical connection. The method of communication may be wired or wireless and a network of peak shedding devices may allow communication to the devices in a store and forward architecture. In some embodiments, communication between the peak monitoring device and peak shedding devices may be bidirectional such that the peak monitoring device may receive acknowledgements, status, alarms and the like from the peak shedding devices. By way of an example, a peak monitoring device may be attached to the circuit breaker box in a building such that it may monitor power usage at the circuit breaker box. In such a case, the peak monitoring device may be programmed with peak levels such that when it detects a peak level of power usage, the peak monitoring device may communicate control to the peak shedding devices to transition some amount of power to the integrated power source. The communication may include the amount of power to transition to the integrated power source such that the peak monitoring device may control the reduction in load. In another example, the peak shedding devices are lighting devices with integrated power sources. The peak monitoring device may detect a peak in power usage and send a command to the peak shedding lighting devices to move a certain amount of power from the external power input to the integrated power source. One advantage is that the light intensity of the lighting devices does not change but the power consumed from the external power input (and from the source of the power where the peak monitoring device is monitoring) will be reduced during the peak time.","In embodiments of wireless light bulbs and controlling devices using an AC power input, the wireless light bulbs may use the frequency of the AC power input for clocking purposes such that several wireless light bulbs and controlling devices may be synchronized in counting such that local clocks on individual devices may be in sync. By way of an example, an intelligent wall switch that controls one or more wireless light bulbs on the same circuit may use a timer or time of day to determine when to enter charging mode. In embodiments where the wireless light bulbs may use a timer or time of day to enter charging mode, maintaining a count synchronized by the frequency of the AC power input that all devices on the circuit are able to detect provides a mechanism to allow the counts to remain synchronized while the AC power input is applied. In some embodiments, the wireless light bulbs may lock to the frequency provided by the AC power input. In such a case, when AC power is turned off to the wireless light bulbs, they may continue to count based on the last detected frequency. There may be some drift during the time that the wireless light bulb begins to count in the absence of the synchronizing frequency however the wireless light bulbs and controlling devices may be able to account for the drift and compensate for it. In some embodiments, there may be a method independent of the frequency of the AC power input to synchronize the intelligent wall switch and wireless light bulbs at some point in time thereafter the controlling devices and wireless light bulbs may use the frequency of the power to remain in sync.","In embodiments of battery backed LED lighting, a traffic signal may be constructed containing an internal battery backup, charging circuitry, connection to external power for normal operation and charging and the intelligence to switch over to battery backup and continue operation in the event of a power outage. In some embodiments, the battery backed LED traffic signal may continue operation as prior to the outage for example by continuing cycling between red, yellow and green based on the timing previously used. In these embodiments, the battery backed LED traffic light may need to learn the operational timing of the traffic light in terms of timing. In some embodiments, a traffic light may communicate with other traffic lights using wired or wireless communication to allow the timing of the lights to remain in sync during the power outage. In alternate embodiments, the battery backed LED traffic signal may enter a flashing operation such that upon a detected power outage, power for the traffic signal may be transitioned to the battery backup and the signal may flash the yellow light or red light. In these embodiments, the battery backed LED traffic signal may be programmable so the operation of the flashing light may be programmed with characteristics such as flashing color, duration of on and off time, light intensity of the light and the like. In the embodiment where the yellow light or red light are flashing, a battery embedded in the battery backed LED traffic signal allows for the traffic signal to operate autonomously without the need for control to be received from a controller cabinet. In some embodiments, the battery backed LED traffic signal may be pre-programmed with a number of operational scenarios that an end user may select via a user interface to produce the desired operation.","In embodiments of battery embedded LED traffic signals, the traffic signal may use the embedded battery for grid shifting for cost savings, peak shedding, demand response, load leveling etc in addition to providing a battery backup for power outage situations. In such a case, the battery embedded LED traffic signals may be designed to store and use power from the embedded power source. The functionality may be pre-programmed, factory set, designed in a custom electrical circuit or the like to respond to sensors on the traffic light and a pre-programmed algorithm to implement the grid shifting function. In some embodiments, the grid shifting function is performed based on an intelligent program internally that may use a real time clock, sensors or a communication interface to perform grid shifting. The intelligent program that uses a real time clock may be set by the user such that the intelligent program may use time of day or a calendar to perform the grid shifting functionality. The grid shifting function may be used for cost savings, energy efficiency, convenience and safety\/security. A battery embedded LED traffic signal may have switches, dials, knobs, USB connector etc on or inside the traffic signal housing to set time of day or sensor thresholds such that a user may be able to control how the intelligent program manages grid shifting. Once set, the battery embedded LED traffic signal may act autonomously based on those settings and\/or the pre-programmed or designed function. The settings may be changed on occasion by the user. A battery embedded LED traffic signal may allow battery backup in power outage situation, cost savings by storing energy when the rates are cheap then using the stored energy when it is expensive and peak shedding functionality. In some embodiments of battery embedded LED traffic signals, an energy harvesting power source may be included, such as solar cells, capturing radio frequency energy and the like to allow an additional power source to power the traffic light or recharge the embedded battery. In these embodiments, the energy harvesting method may be directly integrated into the housing of the traffic light. By way of an example, solar cells may be installed on the top of the housing of the traffic light. In another example, an antenna and circuit to capture radio frequency energy may be integrated into the traffic light. In alternate embodiments, an external energy harvesting method may be used. In the example of solar cells, a larger solar panel may be installed and positioned to optimize energy harvesting and a cable over to the battery embedded LED traffic light may allow the power consumption of the traffic light to be partially supplied by the solar panel or the solar panel may be used to charge the embedded battery.","Referring to , a switch sense electrical fixture  may contain a processor  and backup power  to external power that is delivered through an external power control switch , where the processor  provides intelligent control of the switch sense electrical fixture  under conditions where the external power has been removed or lost.

The management of power usage may be through the amount of load shared by the power sources.","In embodiments, the present invention may provide for power management of a lighting source, including providing a lighting facility, where the lighting facility may include the lighting source, an input device, an internal control facility, an energy storage device, a connection to external power, and the like. Sharing power usage between the external power and the energy storage device may be controlled by the internal control facility, where the internal control facility includes an intelligence capability that may utilize a resident program and information received through the input device in the sharing of power usage. In embodiments, the resident program may be stored on memory running on a processor in the internal control facility. Information received through the input device for power sharing may be processed in the internal control facility through dedicated circuitry. The lighting source may be an LED light. The external power may be external AC power. The external power may be external DC power. Sharing of power may be a partial sharing of power between the external power and the energy storage device, where both the external power and the energy storage device as a result of the information received are now supplying power. The input device may receive a program control input to alter the program, input from a remote control, input from a wireless network, input from a sensor, and the like. The input device may receive an external control signal, where a utility company, a networked software application, and the like may generate the external control signal. The external control signal may be communicated from at least one of wirelessly from a network, through the power lines, through a wired network connection, and the like. The energy storage device may be capable of supplying the source of power for the lighting facility to provide power management, where power management may be due to external power being interrupted, to improve energy efficiency, to provide cost savings, to reduce energy demand, and the like. The energy demand may be a peak energy demand, at predetermined times, at a time when new energy demand is required at an energy provider. The internal control facility may utilize a control input from an input device, internal timer, internal clock, internal program, and the like to manage the power usage. The management of power usage may be through selection of the power source, through control of when a power source is charging, through the amount of load shared by the power sources, and the like.","In embodiments containing the switch sense functionality, a method of calibration of the switch sense circuitry such that the one or more thresholds indicating one or more states of the controlling devices may be set manually or automatically through the method of calibration. In embodiments, the device containing the switch sense functionality may have a calibration mode that may be entered via a user interface that may consist of buttons, switches, dials, a wired programming interface such as a USB interface, a wireless programming interface such as an RF receiver, a predetermined sequence of actions after power is applied and the like. By way of an example, a device may contain a pushbutton for detecting the condition that would represent a closed switch and a pushbutton for detecting the condition that would represent an open switch. The user may turn the light switch to the closed position and push the on pushbutton on the device storing the \u201con\u201d state, then the user may turn the light switch to the open position and push the off pushbutton on the device storing the \u201coff\u201d state. A microcontroller inside the device would store both levels and automatically set the threshold that would allow the microcontroller to detect one state or the other state given the electrical characteristics of the circuit in which the switch sensing device is installed. In some embodiments, an external device may be connected to a circuit to assist the switch sensing device in determining the thresholds that pertain to one or more states. In some embodiments, the external device may be temporary and may be removed after the calibration is completed. In some embodiments, the external device may be permanently installed and may be used in conjunction with the switch sensing device to monitor and adjust the thresholds as required by the application.","In another embodiment, a version of a wireless lighting module containing the switch sensing functionality with a connection to an external power source and containing a backup power source may target emergency lighting applications. In such embodiments, the switch sensing wireless lighting module uses the switch sense function to detect the state of a controlling switch and determine whether to use the backup power source or not. This may allow the wireless lighting module that is normally powered by the external power source to be turned on and off with the controlling switch however when the controlling switch is in the on position and external power is not applied to the wireless lighting module, the wireless lighting module may be able to power the device from a backup power source such as an embedded battery. By way of an example, a bathroom light, ceiling light, sconce, utility light, step light etc. with an AC power input, an embedded battery backup, switch sensing functionality and a light source may be designed such that they may switch to battery backup only when a controlling switch is detected as closed and AC power is not present at the light. In examples in which the light is installed in an area with little or no ambient light such as a windowless room, a user may be in the room with the light on when a power outage occurs and the light would remain on powered by the battery backup (ie if the light was on, it stays on during the disruption of power). In embodiments, the light source may be an LED, fluorescent, incandescent, halogen lights source or the like. The switch sensing wireless lighting module may be a dedicated light or a retrofit battery module may be added to a lighting fixture or device to make it a wireless lighting module with this capability. In some embodiments, an adapter could be used in a fixture to add this functionality to the fixture. In some embodiments, the switch sensing wireless lighting module may have multiple light levels. By way of an example, the switch sensing wireless lighting module may have a bright light level then after some period of time transition to a low light level to extend battery life. In some embodiments, the switch sensing wireless lighting module may be detachable. In some embodiments, the switch sensing wireless lighting module may have alternate forms of control like wireless control, for example sensors such as motion sensors, light sensors, RF or IR control and the like. The switch sensing wireless lighting module may be capable of any functionality of wireless lighting modules described herein.","In one use scenario of the switch sensing wireless lighting module, an LED bathroom light may be designed to mount to the ceiling in a bathroom. The LED bathroom light may be connected to a lighting circuit controlled by a wall switch that supplies AC power to the light. The LED bathroom light may contain an embedded rechargeable battery to provide an off grid power source and may contain a switch sense circuit to detect the state of the wall switch from the LED bathroom light. The LED bathroom light may contain a driver circuit to drive the LEDs from the AC power input, may contain a driver circuit to drive the LEDs from the embedded rechargeable battery and may contain a circuit to select between the two power sources. The LED bathroom light may contain a battery charging circuit and the circuitry to convert the AC power input to provide an input to the battery charging circuit. The LED bathroom light may contain a processor to intelligently control the function of the LED bathroom light. The light source in the LED bathroom light may be dimmable or capable of multiple illumination levels. In the case of a windowless bathroom, when a user is in the bathroom and the wall switch is in the on position and AC power is present, the light source will illuminate. When the wall switch is in the off position, the light will not be illuminated. In the case where the wall switch is in the on position and no AC power is present, the light will illuminate and will be powered by the embedded battery. Thus, if the user is in the bathroom and power goes out, the light will stay on. If the light is off and a user wants to go into the bathroom, they may turn the light on with the wall switch because the light may detect the change in the state of the switch and turn the light on powered by the embedded battery. In another use scenario of the switch sensing wireless lighting module, a fluorescent step light may be designed for applications to illuminate stair ways. In such a scenario, the architecture is similar to the LED bathroom light except the housing may target mounting to a stairway and the light source is fluorescent and therefore would require a ballast or the like to illuminate the fluorescent light source. In another use scenario of the switch sensing wireless lighting module, an equipment room light may be designed for applications in commercial office settings to illuminate equipment rooms in the case of a disruption of power. In an alternate use scenario of the switch sensing wireless lighting module, a retrofit LED fixture or lighting fixture may be designed for applications to illuminate the light source based on the state of a controlling switch as detected by the switch sense function. In the case of a retrofit LED fixture, the LED light source is illuminated and in the case of a lighting fixture, the light source integrated with or plugged into the fixture is illuminated.","In embodiments containing the switch sense functionality, the switch sense function may be used to determine when not to power a device. By way of an example, an electrical circuit powered by a battery inverter or backup generator may have essential and non-essential devices on the same circuit. All non-essential devices may not get powered during an outage allowing emergency power to have priority to certain devices. Thus, the battery inverter or backup generator may not need to have as large of an energy storage device due to the ability of end devices to shut down or enter a low power mode during the emergency situation. This allows the selection of a physically smaller, lower capacity, less expensive energy storage device. In some embodiments, there may be an additional device in the battery inverter, backup generator or on the electrical circuit such that the switch sense function in the end device may be able to detect when power is being provided by the backup power source. Therefore the switch sense function may implement a method to determine when the power source may be a primary power source and when the power source may be a secondary or backup power source and as such allow an end device configured as an essential or non-essential device to determine whether to draw power from the power source. In some embodiments, the switch sense function may be used to detect an outage to attach grid tie inverter to electrical circuit such that stored power may be used or returned to the grid during an outage.","In another embodiment, a version of the switch sense function may be embedded into a battery backed fluorescent ballast targeting emergency lighting applications. In such an embodiment, the switch sense circuitry may detect the state of a controlling device and change state based on the detected state as described herein. By way of an example, an electronic ballast in a CFL bulb may contain an embedded rechargeable battery and a switch sense circuit such that it may detect the state of a controlling device and power the light source from the rechargeable battery based on the detected state of the controlling device. In another example, a battery backed fluorescent ballast powering a fluorescent fixture may contain an embedded rechargeable battery and a switch sense circuit or module that may be used to power the fluorescent light source based on the state of controlling or external devices as detected by an embedded switch sense circuit or module.","In an alternate embodiment, a switch sensing battery inverter or switch sensing uninterruptable power supply may contain a switch sense circuit and be connected to an electrical circuit. Upon detecting a disruption in power on the electrical circuit and detecting that one or more controlling devices intend to apply power to the circuit ie the controlling devices are \u201cturned on\u201d, the switch sense battery inverter may turn on and apply power to the electrical circuit until the disruption in power is over or until the one or more controlling devices are \u201cturned off\u201d. Thus, a device with a backup power source may be connected to an electrical circuit with one or more controlling devices, it may detect a disruption in power and the state of controlling devices and apply power to the electrical circuit based on the detected state. By way of an example, a switch sensing battery inverter may be plug into an AC outlet and monitor the state of the circuit. In a case where the detected state of the circuit requires the battery inverter to apply power to the circuit, it may apply power to the circuit to power electrical devices on the circuit. The electrical devices may include lighting devices, computers, servers, network equipment, storage devices, appliances, cordless phones, televisions, television peripherals, security cameras, security systems and equipment, alarm clocks, electric or hybrid vehicles, electric motors, portable generators and backup power sources, industrial and manufacturing machinery and the like.","In embodiments of the switch sense module, a module may be designed to mount at a junction box to provide backup power source and switch sense control of a lighting or electrical circuit. In one embodiment, a switch sense junction box module may contain a battery and a switch sense circuit. In an example, a switch sense junction box module may have a connection to AC power with wires after a controlling device (AC switched hot) and a return line (AC neutral). The switch sense junction box module may be able to detect the state of the controlling switch using the switch sense circuit and switch to the backup power source. In an alternate embodiment, a junction box module may provide a backup power source and has a connection to AC power with wires before a controlling device (AC unswitched hot), after a controlling device (AC switched hot) and a return line (AC neutral). When the junction box module detects that power is not present before the controlling device, the junction box module may power the devices on the electrical circuit from the backup power source. In some embodiments, the junction box module may contain a switch sense circuit such that it may detect whether the controlling device intends for the devices on the circuit to be powered and may not apply power to the circuit.","In embodiments containing the switch sense functionality controlling lighting devices, the controlling device may be a triac based. In such an embodiment, the triac may be used for dimming the light source from full intensity to no illumination. In the case where there is no illumination, the switch sensing device may still sense that the switch is closed some small amount of power may be applied to the circuit therefore the light may be seen as off to the user however the switch sensing device may still detect the switch as closed. In such an embodiment, the controlling device appears always on to the switch sensing device however no power is applied to the circuit. When there is a power outage, the switch sense device may continue to detect the switch as closed but power will no longer be applied to the circuit. A system constructed using triac based control allows the system to be placed in an \u201calways on\u201d state that the switch sense module may detect but the lighting devices on the circuit may not be illuminated so the light source would be off. It would also allow the end device to detect when the switch is on but no power is applied because there would no longer be any power applied to the circuit in the form of a chopped waveform that would be typical of triac control. Thus, the switch sense device may detect four states\u2014ON with illuminated, ON with no illumination, ON with no or a small amount of power and off without a need for a direct indication of the state of power prior to the one or more controlling devices.","In embodiments containing the switch sense functionality, a system may be created where a single switch sensing device including a wireless transmitter may detect the state of the controlling devices and wirelessly transmit to one or more end devices the state of the switch. In such embodiments, a switch sensing circuit may be required only in the one or more switch sensing devices and end devices would receive the information about the sensed switch state via a wireless receiver. By way of an example, one or more LED retrofit fixtures may contain an alternate power source and a wireless receiver. When an external switch sensing device detects that the controlling switch is closed and there is no power present, the switch sensing device may transmit a message to the one or more LED retrofit fixtures with a command for them to switch over to the alternate power source. The external switch sensing device may be programmable such that the change of state based on the state of the controlling circuit detected by the switch sensing device may be programmed by a user.","In embodiments containing the switch sense functionality, switch sense circuitry may detect when a device has been removed from an electrical connection to power for any purpose that such detection may be useful. In the case that a device has an internal power source, detection that the device has been removed from an outlet may cause an automatic switchover to an internal power source. By way of an example, a power outage detector with an embedded light source and a transmitter is plugged into an AC outlet to control remote wireless lighting modules when the power outage detector detects there is a disruption of power. During a disruption of power, the power outage detector may illuminate its light source and wirelessly transmit control to wireless lighting modules to illuminate also. The power outage detector may be removable from the outlet and in such a case embedded switch sense functionality may determine that it is not an outage but rather that the power outage device is no longer connected to the AC outlet. In such a case, the power outage device may not turn on or transmit to the remote wireless lighting modules because an outage has not been detected but rather the user intended to remove the power outage module perhaps to use the power outage detector as a light source like a flashlight or to remotely control the light sources. In alternate embodiments, the power outage detector may have a method to disable the transmitting mode that may indicate an emergency when the power outage detector is removed. By way of an example, a user may push the OFF button that controls the remote lights signaling to the power outage detector that it is in flashlight mode. The user may have five seconds to remove the power outage detector from the wall such that the removal will not be seen as a disruption in power (ie the power outage detector will be in flashlight mode and the remote lights will not be turned on). In an alternate embodiment, the switch sense circuitry is replaced on the power outage detector by a physical switch that is open or closed when the power outage detector is plugged into an outlet or is removed from the outlet. Intelligence built into the power outage detector to detect the state of the switch and determine whether the power outage detector is plugged in or not. In one embodiment, a device has retractable blades and the device may detect when the blades are retracted. By way of another example, the switch sense circuit is built into a wall transformer that contains an internal power source. When the wall transformer is removed from the wall, a decision may be made based on the state of the switch sense circuit to use the internal power source. It is to be appreciated that the switch sense functionality or other detection methods may be built into any electrical device that may need to determine whether the electrical device is physically connected to a power source. In electrical devices containing the switch sense functionality that also have an internal power source, the electrical devices may automatically switch over to the internal power source when the removed from its connection to an AC outlet, AC power source, DC power source or any other type of power connection.","In embodiments of the switch sense functionality, an external switch sensing light socket adapter may be designed with a light source, embedded batteries to power the light source, a pass through of power to power a light source plugged into the adapter and switch sense functionality to determine when to illuminate the light source of the adapter. The external switch sensing light socket adapter can be designed as an adapter for any type of socket to provide the described functionality for any of the plurality of bulb types mentioned herein. By way of an example, an adapter plugs into an Edison socket and also has an Edison socket that accepts an A19 type bulb or the like. An incandescent, compact fluorescent, LED type light bulb or the like may plug into the socket adapter. The adapter may contain on its housing an LED light source or the like that may be illuminated during a disruption in power and the detection by switch sense that the switch is closed (ie that the user intended the light to be on). The socket adapter may contain embedded rechargeable or non-rechargeable batteries, the circuitry to switch over to the embedded batteries, an AC\/DC and a DC\/AC inverter or DC\/DC converter, a charging circuit to charge the embedded batteries, and the intelligence to implement a switchover between external power and backup power to power the light source of the adapter. The switch sense function may work in any method mentioned herein to illuminate the light source of the adapter based on the sense of the switch or other external conditions as detected by the adapter.","In some embodiments, a Switch Sense Lighting Module may be designed to be integrated with or installed on the same circuit with other devices that may desire to have the switch sensing functionality implemented in parallel to them to detect the state of a controlling switch or device remotely and the Switch Sense Lighting Module may illuminate independent of the state of those devices based on the state of the switch and power on the circuit. The Switch Sense Lighting Module may be a module that contains a light source, a driver for the light source, a connection to the power circuit, an embedded power source and the ability to sense the state of one or more controlling devices. The module may be integrated into or connected to any device or electrical circuit and may be required to detect the state of one or more controlling switches or devices and illuminate during a disruption in power. In some embodiments, the Switch Sense Lighting Module may be designed to be integrated with lights, light bulbs, light fixtures, fixtures, troffers, lamp bases, ballasts, lighting power supplies, lighting control devices and the like that may desire to have a separate device detect a disruption of power and illuminate during the detected disruption of power. In some embodiments the Switch Sense Lighting Module may be designed as a standalone lighting fixture that may be connected to an electrical or lighting circuit. In some embodiments, the Switch Sense Lighting Module may include an enclosure and have a mounting mechanism to allow it to be physically integrated with another device. The housing may have a design that allows the light source of the Switch Sense Lighting Module to illuminate an area. In some embodiments the module may be removable and replaceable. In some embodiments, the module may contain an integrated power source such as a rechargeable battery. In some embodiments, the module may receive power from the external device or circuit. In some embodiments, the module may have a connection to input power that is controlled by the one or more switches or devices of which the Switch Sense Lighting Module may need to detect the state. In some embodiments the module may be an electrical circuit on a printed circuit board or the like that may be integrated into another device. By way of an example, a Switch Sense Lighting Module may be used to detect the state of an on\/off wall switch controlling power to an Edison socket with a light bulb plugged in. The light bulb that may be plugged in is an LED light bulb. The Switch Sense Lighting Module consists of a printed circuit board with four connections, an embedded power source and a light source. Two connections are made to the AC power input. Two connections are made to local rechargeable battery power. The light source of the Switch Sense Lighting Module is positioned to illuminate the desired area during a detected disruption of power. The Switch Sense Lighting Module may be integrated with the LED light bulb. If the switch is detected as closed as detected by the Switch Sense Lighting Module and provided at the control connection and AC power is not present at the input, the Switch Sense Lighting Module may illuminate its light source. It is to be appreciated that the control connection may be one or more lines and may use any method required to indicated the state of the controlling switches or devices that the Switch Sense Lighting Module is monitoring.","In systems containing devices with an embedded power source on an electrical circuit such as grid shifting systems or battery backup systems, an intelligent charging device may be designed to apply power to the electrical circuit for the purpose of charging the embedded power sources. In such a case, the grid shifting or battery backed up devices may be able to detect when the intelligent charging device is in charging mode and when the operation is based on the controlling devices passing power through onto the electrical circuit for normal operation. In some embodiments, switch sense functionality in end devices may be used to determine whether the applied power is for normal operation or for charging mode. By way of an example, a wall switch controlling an electrical circuit may contain a relay in parallel with the controlling device such that intelligence in the wall switch may apply power to the electrical circuit independent of the state of the controlling device (ie in parallel to the controlling device). In the example, the intelligence in the wall switch may use a timer or time of day clock to allow power to be applied to one or more electrical devices for the purposes of charging the battery based on time of day or some other timing mechanism when the user does not intend to power the electrical devices from the external power source for normal operation. In some embodiments, the intelligent charging device may use one or more sensors to determine whether to enter charge mode. By way of an example, a motion sensor may detect occupancy in a room. When no motion has been detected for a period of time, the intelligent charging device may enter charge mode. If motion is detected, the intelligent charging device may exit charge mode and the electrical devices may enter normal operation. In this example, if the electrical devices are lighting devices or lighting fixtures, there may be multiple levels of illumination such that when in charge mode, the illumination level is at a lower level where some of the power delivered may be diverted to charge the embedded power source however when the lights enter normal operation (for example, when motion is detected) the lights set the illumination level to a higher level. In embodiments, the intelligent charging device may close a switch automatically at certain times when the electrical devices may be charging. In some embodiments, the intelligent charging device may monitor current to the circuit to determine if the electrical devices are charging or the rate at which they are charging. In some embodiments, the intelligent charging device may use wired or wireless communication to the electrical devices to communicate whether it is in charging mode or normal operation mode. By way of an example, the intelligent charging device may use a power line communication method to communicate the mode of operation to end devices on an electrical circuit. In some embodiment, the intelligent charging device may provide a mechanism that may be detected by a switch sense circuit such that the switch sense circuit may know that the intelligent charging device is in charging mode and as such not enter its normal operating mode but rather enter a charging mode. By way of an example, the intelligent charging device may insert some impedance based on the charge mode approach that the switch sense circuit may detect as a third state that indicates charging mode. In alternate embodiments, the intelligent charging device may periodically switch to charging mode when it detects that the wall switch is turned to the off position. The intelligent charging device may learn over time typical times when the intelligent charging device may be in the off position and create a schedule of charging times. In alternate embodiments, the functionality may be implemented by a controlling device and integrated circuitry or a module into the controlling device to implement the same functionality as the intelligent charging device. In such embodiments, an existing controlling device may be retrofit with the integrated circuitry or module to allow it to provide the same or similar functionality as the intelligent charging device In one illustrative example, a grid shifting lighting system may be developed controlled by an intelligent charging device such that batteries embedded in the lights may be charged during times when the user intended the lights to be turned off. In this example, the intelligent charging device may charge the embedded batteries by applying power to the circuit but the lights may be placed in charging mode by wired communication, wireless communication or a switch sensing mechanism and remain off during charging mode.","In embodiments of grid shifting systems, an intelligent grid shifting controller may control charging of embedded power sources and control the use of external and embedded power sources. In embodiments, the intelligent grid shifting controller may contain all of the functionality of the intelligent charging device but may communicate to the end devices the use of the external and embedded power sources. The intelligent grid shifting controller may communicate to the grid shifting end devices when to use the external power source, when to use the embedded power source and when to use both power sources sharing the load. The method of communication may be by wired connection over a power distribution network, for example on the AC power lines (X10, INSTEON, Broadband over Power Lines, proprietary communication scheme etc), or wirelessly through a wireless interface (dedicated RF communication link, ZIGBEE, WIFI, ENOCEAN, BLUETOOTH etc).","In embodiments of battery backed ballasts for fluorescent lighting or battery backed LED driver modules, a ballast or driver module may contain a light source or be able to drive a separate light source in the event that a disruption in power is detected. In these embodiments, the light source may be embedded on the housing of the ballast or driver module or the light source may be in a separate housing that may mount in a location to illuminate an area during a disruption of power. In some embodiments, during a disruption of power the ballast or driver module may drive both the separate light source and the primary light source deriving power from the embedded battery. In some embodiments, during a disruption of power the ballast or driver module may drive only the separate light source deriving power from the embedded battery. By way of an example, a battery backed ballast for fluorescent lighting may mount above a drop ceiling and a separate light source may be mounted in a location nearby to illuminate an area during a disruption in power. The battery backed ballast may have a connection to the separate light source to power it from the embedded battery during a power disruption. In such a use case, a battery backed ballast may power both fluorescent lighting and a separate emergency light during an emergency. In an alternate use case, a battery backed ballast may power only the separate emergency light. In this use case, a separate emergency light may have lower power requirements and thus may require a smaller battery reducing the size and cost. In another use case a light source built into the housing for the ballast or driver module may allow the ballast or driver module to act as the emergency light source. By way of an example, the housing may have an LED light source and a method to mount the housing to a drop ceiling such that the housing and LED light source may be positioned to illuminate an area during a disruption of power.","In embodiments of grid shifting systems, the amount of power to shift to an internal power source may be communicated to an end device using a triac or similar device to create a chopped waveform such that the amount of power that comes from the external power source and the amount of power supplied by an internal power source may be provided in proportion to the chopped waveform. In such embodiments, a controlling device may contain a triac or similar device and may be configured to control the waveform such that an end device powered on the circuit may process the waveform and control the amount of power delivered to an end device based on the input power waveform. By way of an example, a triac based dimmer switch that is used to typically control the light intensity level of a light source may be used to control the amount of power shifted to the internal power source. In such an example, a variable resistor may be used to control how much power is drawn from the line. In some embodiments, the end device may need to be designed such that it may use the chopped waveform to manage the amount of power supplied by the external and internal power sources based on the external power waveform. In alternate embodiments, the controller device may use any known method to manipulate or modulate the waveform to communicate the amount of power to shift to the internal power supply. In some embodiments, an intelligent triac based grid shifting controller with the capability of chopping the waveform may be used to control the amount of power shifted to the internal power source. The intelligent triac based grid shifting controller may receive communication from an external device to configure or program the controller. The method of communication may be by wired connection over a power distribution network, for example on the AC power lines (X10, INSTEON, Broadband over Power Lines, proprietary communication scheme etc), or wirelessly through a wireless interface (dedicated RF communication link, ZIGBEE, WIFI, ENOCEAN, BLUETOOTH etc). In some embodiments, the intelligent triac based grid shifting controller may allow direct input through a keypad, LCD screen, computer connected through a USB interface etc and may be programmed to implement the communication to the end device to perform grid shifting. In embodiments, the functionality may be pre-programmed, factory set, designed in a custom electrical circuit or the like to respond to sensor inputs and a pre-programmed algorithm to implement the grid shifting function. The sensors may include a light sensor, motion sensor, an atomic clock or time receiver, temperature sensor or any other sensor mentioned herein that may allow the grid shifting function to meet the requirements of an application. In some embodiments, the grid shifting function is performed based on an intelligent program internally. The intelligent program may contain a real time clock that may be set by the user such that the intelligent program may use time of day or a calendar to perform the grid shifting functionality. The grid shifting function may be used for cost savings, energy efficiency, convenience, safety\/security and the like. The controller may have switches, dials, knobs etc to set time of day or sensor thresholds such that a user may be able to control how the intelligent program manages the grid shifting. Once set, the controller may act autonomously based on those settings and\/or the pre-programmed or designed function. The settings may be changed on occasion by the user. In alternate embodiments where the external power source is a DC power source, a controlling device may use pulse width modulation, amplitude modulation and the like to communicate to a DC powered end device the amount of power to shift to an embedded power source. In an example of a triac controlled grid shifting system, the end device may be a lighting device with an internal power source and the controller may be a wall switch with a triac as well as some intelligence built in. The controller may be programmed to shift some amount of power to the internal power source during daytime hours for cost savings. In another lighting example, the controller may receive a command from an external device to implement a demand response function where the controller may chop the waveform and shift an amount of power delivered to the end device to the internal power source such that the amount of power drawn from the external power source may be reduced however the light intensity may be maintained because the difference in power consumed from the external power source may be transferred to the internal power source.","In an alternate embodiment, a triac chopped waveform may indicate amount of power to transition to an internal power supply such as a rechargeable battery for grid shifting. A partial inverter grid shifting device may be designed that rebuilds an AC waveform from the triac chopped version such that a connected AC powered end device sees a clean AC waveform for its input power. Thus, the input to the partial inverter grid shifting device may be from no waveform to a full waveform with any chopped waveform in between however the partial inverter grid shifting device may use the internal rechargeable battery converted from DC to AC and combined with the input waveform to output a waveform similar to a full AC waveform. A partial inverter grid shifting system would allow a sharing of power between the external power supply and power stored in the rechargeable battery. In alternate embodiments, the input waveform is a full AC waveform and the partial inverter grid shifting device combine the input from the input power supply and the internal power supply to shift some amount of power to the external device to be provided by the internal power supply. The amount of power supplied by the internal power source may lower the amount of power required from the input power source. In some embodiments, a method may be included in an inverter design that phase aligns the DC to AC waveform generated from the internal power source with the waveform of the input power source. By way of an example, the design may include a phase locked loop to synchronize with the input waveform such that the internally generated waveform may be generated to have a similar cycle as the input waveform. The phase alignment may be used to combine the two power sources to create the output power using relays, solid state switches and the like such that intelligence in the device may control one or more relays or switches to select the source of power. In one embodiment, the opening and closing of the relays to select the power source may be done in proportion to the amount of power that may be needed to be supplied from the input source or the internal power source. By way of an example, a processor may be programmed to provide 40% of the power from the internal power source. In this example, the processor may control a relay (for example a change over relay) such that the input power source may be selected by closing the relay on its connection to the external power path for 60% of the cycle and the internal power source may be connected to the external power path for 40% of the cycle. In an alternate example, the power source may be time division multiplexing between the two power sources on larger timer intervals.

In one embodiment, the opening and closing of the relays to select the power source may be done to in proportion to the amount of power that may be needed to be supplied from the input source or the internal power source. By way of an example, a processor may be programmed to provide 25% of the power from the internal power source for the purpose of reducing the demand from the grid during peak times but to maintain the same intensity level of the lighting devices.
