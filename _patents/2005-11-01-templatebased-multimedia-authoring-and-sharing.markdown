title: Template-based multimedia authoring and sharing
abstract: Systems and methods for template-based multimedia authoring and sharing are described. In one aspect, media content is selectively applied to a content description template to author media in a content description. The content description template provides a temporal structure for the applied media content. A content representation template is selected and combined with the temporally structured media in the content description to specify rendering criteria and generate a content description and representation for one or more of rendering, sharing, and exporting the temporally structured authored media.

There is a huge demand for new tools and systems to enable an average user to efficiently and effectively process, manage, author and share digital media contents. Although video authoring tools exist, video authoring remains as a tedious and extremely time consuming task that often requires trained professional skills. Thus, a powerful multimedia authoring tool to substantially reduce a users' efforts in editing home video, images, etc. would be very useful.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the detailed description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","In view of the above, template-based multimedia authoring and sharing is described. In one aspect, media content is selectively applied to a content description template to author media in a content description. The content description template provides a temporal structure for the applied media content. A content representation template is selected and combined with the temporally structured media in the content description to specify rendering criteria and generate a content description and representation for one or more of rendering, sharing, and exporting the temporally structured authored media","The systems (e.g., systems, apparatus, computer-readable media, means, etc.) and methods for template-based multimedia authoring and sharing, as described below in reference to , implement media content analysis and allow for selective application of content-aware two-layer authoring templates (i.e., content description templates and content representation templates) to extracted media content. With two layers of authoring templates, the systems and methods separate video authoring operations from video representation. Once multimedia content such as video has been authored (i.e., generated), the authored content is simply and flexibly represented in one or more other forms, according to user preference. The systems and methods provide an open and extensible multimedia authoring and sharing framework that supports dynamic update of core components such as content analysis algorithms, editing methods, and the two-layer authoring templates. These aspects significantly reduce user efforts in video editing, as compared to conventional multimedia authoring systems and techniques, while preserving flexibility and personalization","These and other aspects of the systems and methods for template-based multimedia authoring and sharing are now described in greater detail.","An Exemplary System","Although not required, the systems and methods for template-based multimedia authoring and sharing are described in the general context of computer-executable instructions (program modules) being executed by a computing device such as a personal computer. Program modules generally include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, etc., that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. While the systems and methods are described in the foregoing context, acts and operations described hereinafter may also be implemented in hardware.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","102","106","108","106","110","112","114","116","118","110","120","122","120","120"]},"Media library building module  analyzes the input media  to extract metadata (i.e., extracted metadata ) to facilitate selective user application of corresponding media content to authoring templates: Content Description Templates (CDTs)  and Content Representation Templates (CRTs) . The media content analysis operations are configurable and extensible (e.g., via plug-ins) and include, for example, online and off-line media content filtering (parsing) operations. Examples of content filtering include shot detection, sub-shot detection, scene grouping, motion detection, key-frame extraction, histogram extraction, quality assessment, etc. The types of extracted metadata  are a function of the particular content filtering applied by media library building module . For purposes of exemplary description, input media  that has been parsed and\/or filtered via content filtering operations to generate extracted metadata  is hereinafter often referred to as \u201canalyzed input media\u201d. Exemplary media content analysis is described in greater detail below in the section titled \u201cMedia Content Analysis.\u201d","Media management and browsing module  provides a framework to allow a user to browse and visualize input media content. In one implementation, the framework provides a temporal structure and thumbnail based media browsing interface. This interface helps the user to find appropriate video segments and photo collections from analyzed input media , and thereby, facilitate media authoring operations.","Media authoring module  allows a user\/editor to select one or more video clips and\/or photos from analyzed input media  portion of the media library for placement onto a timeline to generate a storyline. Media authoring module  facilitates the placement operations in view of the information provided by extracted metadata . As described below, captions, credits, transitions and video effects may also be added to the selected media content. To facilitate these media content authoring operations, media authoring module  allows the user to select a CDT . The CDT  provides a temporal structure to the story line, along with composition methods, rules, and preferences within which the user can organize and edit select portions of analyzed input media  from media library , and thereby, generate authored content through a media authoring and sharing user interface (UI). (The media authoring and sharing UI is shown as a respective portion of \u201cother data\u201d ). More particularly, each temporal unit in a CDT  is associated with a configurable editing method (or tool) and corresponding editing parameters (e.g., style, duration, incidental music, etc.) providing the user with substantial flexibility to manually or programmatically assign select portions of the analyzed input media  to the temporal structure.","These media content authoring operations, which have associated select portions of the analyzed input media  with the temporal structure of the CDT  to describe the authored content, result in a CDF . Exemplary aspects of CDTs  and CDFs  are described in greater detail below in the section titled \u201cContent Description Template\u201d. The media authoring module  allows a user to select a CRT  to indicate how the authored content in the CDF  is to be rendered (a target rendering). More particularly, a CRT  specifies CDT authored content rendering criteria. Such criteria include, for example, information to render authored content to a DVD, a web site, as slides for presentation, has a file for playback and sharing, etc. Exemplary aspects of a CRT  are described in greater detail below in the section titled \u201cContent Representation Template.\u201d","Media authoring module  combines the resulting CDF  with the selected CRT  to generate a content description and representation file (CDRF)  rendering (e.g., to a player , to a DVD, to a web site, as slides for presentation, etc.), sharing, and exporting, as described by the selected CRT . Exemplary aspects of a CDRF  are described in greater detail below in the section titled \u201cCDRF and CDRF Player.\u201d",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["126","128","132","134","126","132","126","128","134","126","128","132","134","126","128"]},"In system  of , media content analysis algorithms are media content filters and\/or media content parsers. For example, a shot detection filter is used for shot detection, and a histogram extraction filter is applied for extracting color histogram. There are two types of content filters: one is online filters, and the other one is offline filters. Online filters require parsing the entire video or audio stream, or photo files, to extract the corresponding basic metadata from the stream. While offline filters extract higher level metadata directly from these basic metadata without parsing the original media data. Examples of online filters include shot detection, timestamp extraction, and histogram extraction filters. Offline filters include scene detection, quality assessment filters, etc.","In this implementation, Extensible Markup Language (XML) is used to represent extracted metadata . If a new metadata is to be extracted, a new filter based on a filter template (e.g., a base C++ class) can be written and then plugged into the extensible and configurable architecture of system . For example, in one implementation, advanced users utilize a predefined online or offline base class, and then implement the real metadata extraction functions.","In this implementation, media library building module  supports one or more of video, photo, and music content filters. Video content filters include, for example, shot detection, sub-shot detection, scene grouping, motion detection, key-frame extraction, color histogram, attention detection, quality assessment, correlegram, video signature, face detection, and\/or so on. Photo content filters include, for example, color histogram, static attention detection, quality assessment, correlegram, image signature, face detection, and\/or so on. Music content filters include, for example, onset detection, beat detection, tempo detection, and\/or so on.","In this implementation a CDT  () is described in XML. The basic unit of CDT is a \u201cMSeg\u201d, which represents \u201cMedia Segment\u201d (also called \u201cslot\u201d when it is rendered; please see ). MSeg could be a chapter, a scene or a shot, or whatever temporal segment of a video. For a specific template, MSegs may be arranged hierarchically. All MSegs share the same definition and structure. The default settings for a child MSeg are inherited from its parent MSeg, while a child MSeg can have its own settings which have higher priority. A typical hierarchical structure could be \u201cChapter\u2014Scene\u201d, which is similar to a general DVD content menu. In this paper, we will use this structure to present our idea.","In this implementation, a template contains the least one chapter (MSeg). A \u201cchapter\u201d may contain several \u201cscenes\u201d (also MSegs), while a \u201cscene\u201d can contain one or more smaller scenes, and so on.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"TABLE 1 shows an exemplary XML description of MSeg \u201cLeader\u201d in the above example of .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"EXEMPLARY XML DESCRIPTION OF AN MSeg"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"<MSeg level=\u201c1\u201d mtype=\u201cPhoto\u201d>"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<Title>Old Pictures<\/Title>"]},{"entry":[{},"<Duration fixed=\u201cfalse\u201d>60<\/Duration>"]},{"entry":[{},"<Method name=Photo2Video ver=1.0"]},{"entry":[{},"clsid=\u201c{BBBBBBBB-2dC1-4081-9BdB-20D7030234EF}\u201d>"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<param name=\u201cChannelNum\u201d value=\u201c1\u201d \/>"]},{"entry":[{},"<param name=\u201cStyle\u201d value=\u201cRomantic Sepia\u201d \/>"]},{"entry":[{},"<param name=\u201cSyncMusic\u201d value=\u201cTrue\u201d \/>"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<\/Method>"]},{"entry":[{},"<Music><clip src=\u201cabc.mp3\u201d start=\u201c0\u201d stop=\u201c120\u201d mstart=\u201c0\u201d"]},{"entry":[{},"\/><\/Music>"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"<\/MSeg>"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Referring to table 1, the source data of this MSeg is shown as a collection of photographs; the final duration of this segment is 60 seconds; the incidental music is \u201cabc.mp3\u201d; and the automatic editing method specifies a known \u201cPhoto2Video\u201d computer-program application (e.g., a respective portion of \u201cother program modules\u201d  of ).

In contrast to a CDF , a CRT  describes how the authored media content provided by the CDF  is to be represented or rendered. As described above, CRTs can be used to render authored contents in many forms, such as DVD, VCD, website, video file, slides, and so on. In this implementation, each type of CRT includes of three components: an XML template definition scheme, a template rendering engine, and a content composition (rendering) engine. The template rendering engine renders the look-and-feel of a CRT . The content composition (rendering) engine renders the authored content (CDRF ) into DVD, VCD, etc. Similar to a CDT , a CRT  is an independent component of system . Media authoring module  exposes a uniform application programming interface (API)  for a user to design and develop new types of CRTs . A user can also modify an existing CRT and design a new CRT based on an existing CRT type.","Unlike CDTs , which have a uniform definition, CRT  definition depends on the type of the CRT . That is, different types of CRTs will have different definition schemes, rendering engines, and composition engines. (Such CRT rendering and composition engines are shown as respective portions of \u201cother program modules\u201d  of ). For example, a DVD type CRT  includes an XML scheme to describe selected media content presentation look-and-feel, as well as parameters for the output DVD (e.g., a background image of the menu page, menu button styles, etc.). The CRT rendering engine displays the look-and-feel of a specific CRT , and the CRT content composition engine generates the corresponding CDRF file  and composes the authored content into DVD format (i.e., to render CDRF ). Thus a DVD burning program burns selected media content (i.e., as defined by the corresponding CDF ) directly to a DVD disc. Analogously, a simulated DVD software player plays selected media content.","In another example, a web site type CRT  includes, for example, an XML scheme to describe structure, layout, and format of the website. In this implementation, this description is similar to HTML language. Those CRT rendering engine of this example renders the look-and-feel of the web site type CRT. The corresponding composition engine generates the CDRF  as well as the actual website according to the specific CDF  and CRT . (For purposes of exemplary illustration, an exemplary networked environment for fully or partially implementing operations of computing device  is shown and described below in reference to ).","In another example, a video type CRT  includes, for example, an XML scheme that defines transitions, effects and caption format of associated output video, a corresponding CRT rendering engine to display the appearance of a specific video CRT, and a corresponding CRT composition engine to generate the CDRF  and the final output video (shown as a respective portion of \u201cother data\u201d ).","As shown in , a CDRF  of  is the combination of a CDF  and a CRT .
