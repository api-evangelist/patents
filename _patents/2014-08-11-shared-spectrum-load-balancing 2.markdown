title: Shared spectrum load balancing
abstract: A wireless telecommunications system may be configured to provide wireless service via licensed and/or shared frequency bands (e.g., frequency bands that are shared with other telecommunications systems, and for which access is regulated by an external entity). A load balancing technique, described herein, may provide load balancing between licensed and shared frequency bands based on traffic type (e.g., real-time or non-real-time traffic) and/or based on device type (e.g., whether a device is typically involved in real-time communications). Techniques described herein may also provide for the staggered or gradual reduction of the transmit power of a radio associated with a shared frequency band (e.g., in response to an instruction from the external entity), in order to minimize the abrupt increase in load on other frequency bands that may result from reducing coverage of the shared frequency band.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["User devices, such as wireless telephones may wirelessly connect, or \u201cattach,\u201d to a wireless network via a base station. The base station may provide multiple carriers, to which the user devices may attach. As used herein, a particular \u201ccarrier\u201d may refer to a particular radio access technology, a particular frequency band, and\/or a particular set of frequencies within a frequency band. The frequency bands, provided by the base station, may include licensed frequency bands. \u201cLicensed\u201d frequency bands may be frequency bands which have been licensed, by an authoritative entity, such as a government agency, for exclusive use by a particular wireless network service provider. In some situations, the base station may also provide service according to one or more shared frequency bands. \u201cShared\u201d frequency bands may be frequency bands that have been authorized (e.g., by an authoritative entity) for use by multiple wireless network service providers.","The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements.","Wireless network service providers may obtain licenses (e.g., exclusive or priority licenses) to operate wireless networks at certain frequency bands (\u201clicensed\u201d frequency bands). Wireless network service providers may also obtain licenses to operate wireless networks at shared frequency bands, which may be shared with other wireless network service providers. Access to a shared frequency band may be controlled by an owner or an incumbent associated with the shared frequency band, or an authoritative entity (such as a governmental agency). In some situations, a shared access system (\u201cSAS\u201d) manager may provide control messages to licensees of a shared frequency band, which may indicate permissions or other parameters by which licensees of the shared frequency band may operate (e.g., an amount of load permitted for a particular licensee to incur on the shared frequency band, a transmit strength permitted for a radio that operates at the shared frequency band, etc.).","Systems and methods, provided herein, may provide techniques for load balancing among licensed frequency bands and shared frequency bands. For example, as shown in , a base station may provide radio service according to two licensed frequency bands (\u201cL\u201d and \u201cL\u201d) and two shared frequency bands (\u201cS\u201d and \u201cS\u201d). As shown, two user devices (\u201cUD\u201d and \u201cUD\u201d) may be connected to the base station via S. In this example, L and S may be associated with a relatively high measure of load (e.g., a relatively large number of user devices may be connected to the base station via L and\/or S), and L and S may be associated with a relatively low measure of load. As further shown, UD may be on an active voice call, while UD may be involved in a web browsing session.","An SAS manager may provide an instruction to the base station and\/or to a shared\/licensed (\u201cSL\u201d) load balancer, which may instruct the base station to modify the utilization of S. For example, the instruction may instruct the base station to reduce the load, associated with S, to a threshold level (e.g., a maximum quantity of connections via S). The SL load balancer may determine whether the present load of S is above the specified threshold load, and may determine which band or bands to which UD and UD should be handed off, in order to satisfy the threshold. For example, as described below, the SL load balancer may make load balancing decisions based on, for example, a type of traffic associated with a user device (e.g., whether the traffic is \u201creal-time\u201d traffic, such as a voice call or a video call) and\/or a type of the user device (e.g., whether the user device is a type of device that is typically associated with \u201cnon-real-time\u201d communications, such as a tablet device or a machine to machine (\u201cM2M\u201d) device).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["1","2","1","2","2","2","1","2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","300","305","310","312","314","315","320","325","330","335","340","340","345","350"]},"Environment  may include an evolved packet system (\u201cEPS\u201d) that includes a long term evolution (\u201cLTE\u201d) network and\/or an evolved packet core (\u201cEPC\u201d) network that operate based on a third generation partnership project (\u201c3GPP\u201d) wireless communication standard. The LTE network may be, or may include, a radio access network (\u201cRAN\u201d) that includes one or more base stations , some or all of which may take the form of an evolved node B (\u201ceNB\u201d), via which user device  may communicate with the EPC network. The EPC network may include one or more SGWs , PGWs , and\/or MMEs , and may enable user device  to communicate with PDN  and\/or an Internet protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) multimedia subsystem (\u201cIMS\u201d) core network. The IMS core network may include HSS\/AAA server , and may manage authentication, session initiation, account information, a user profile, etc., associated with user device .","User device  may include any computation and communication device, such as a wireless mobile communication device that is capable of communicating with base station  and\/or PDN . For example, user device  may include a radiotelephone; a personal communications system (\u201cPCS\u201d) terminal (e.g., a device that combines a cellular radiotelephone with data processing and data communications capabilities); a personal digital assistant (\u201cPDA\u201d) (e.g., that can include a radiotelephone, a pager, Internet\/intranet access, etc.); a smart phone; a laptop computer; a tablet computer; a camera; a personal gaming system, or another type of mobile computation and communication device. User device  may send traffic to and\/or receive traffic from PDN  via base station , backhaul network , MLS , SGW , and\/or PGW .","Base station  may include one or more network devices that receive, process, and\/or transmit traffic, such as calls, audio, video, text, and\/or other data, destined for and\/or received from user device . In one example, base station  may be an eNB device and may be part of the LTE network. Additionally, or alternatively, one or more other base stations  may be associated with a RAN that is not associated with the LTE network (e.g., a wireless hot spot, a wireless access point, etc.). Base station  may receive traffic from and\/or send traffic to user device  via SGW , PGW , and\/or PDN . Base station  may send traffic to and\/or receive traffic from user device  via, for example, an air interface (e.g., a cellular air interface).","Base station  may be associated with one or more cells. A \u201ccell,\u201d as used to herein, may generally refer to a coverage area provided by base station . A particular cell may, for example, be associated with one or more radios pointed in the same general direction. The different radios may each be associated with a particular frequency band, and\/or more than one radio may be associated with a particular frequency band. For example, one or more radios may be associated with a licensed frequency band, while one or more other radios of the cell may be associated with a shared frequency band. Base station  may include processing logic and\/or hardware circuitry that may enable base station  to perform inter-frequency handovers. For example, base station  may hand over a particular user device  from one frequency band to another frequency band (e.g., from a licensed frequency band to another licensed frequency band, from a shared frequency band to another shared frequency band, from a shared frequency band to a licensed frequency band, or from a licensed frequency band to a shared frequency band). Base station  may also perform intra-frequency handovers (e.g., hand over a particular user device  from one sub-band to another sub-band of a particular frequency band), and\/or may perform inter-radio access technology (\u201cRAT\u201d) handovers (e.g., may hand over a particular user device  from one RAT to another RAT). Base station  may modify parameters, such as radio transmit strength, associated with shared frequency bands based on access permissions provided by SAS manager .","SL load balancer  may include one or more devices that perform load balancing of user devices , with respect to various carriers (where a \u201ccarrier\u201d may refer to a particular frequency band, a particular frequency sub-band, and\/or a particular RAT) associated with base station . For example, SL load balancer  may determine measures of load associated with particular carriers, associated with base station , and may make handover decisions based on the measures of load. For example, if a first carrier is relatively overloaded, while a second carrier is relatively underutilized, SL load balancer  may output an instruction to base station  to hand over one or more user devices , connected to the first carrier, to the second carrier. As described herein, the load balancing decisions, made by SL load balancer , may be based on one or more other factors. For instance, SL load balancer  may make load balancing decisions based on access permissions, to shared frequency bands, provided by SAS manager . Additionally, or alternatively, SL load balancer  may make load balancing decisions based on factors such as a device type of user device  and\/or a traffic type associated with user device .","While one base station  and one SL load balancer  are shown in  (e.g., a one-to-one arrangement), other arrangements are possible in practice. For example, in some implementations, one SL load balancer  may perform load balancing for multiple base stations . In some implementations, some portions of SL load balancer  (e.g., as discussed below with respect to ) may perform some functionality associated with multiple base stations , while other portions of SL load balancer  may be arranged on a one-to-one basis with base stations .","SAS manager  may include one or more devices that provide information, such as access permissions, to base station  and\/or SL load balancer . The access permissions may indicate, for example, a level of access permitted to a particular shared frequency band. For example, access permissions may indicate a maximum transmit strength associated with a particular shared frequency band, may specify a permissible coverage area or radius associated with a particular shared frequency band, and\/or may indicate a maximum measure of permissible load (e.g., a maximum quantity of permitted user devices , a maximum amount of permitted throughput, etc.) associated with a particular shared frequency band. SAS manager  may be owned by, operated by, managed by, and\/or receive information from an entity that owns a license to operate and\/or control access to a shared frequency band, such as an incumbent and\/or a governmental agency.","Backhaul network  may include one or more network devices (e.g., routers and\/or switches) and links (e.g., fiber or coaxial links), that connect base station  to a core network (e.g., a core network that includes and\/or is associated with MLS , SGW , and\/or PGW ).","MLS  may include one or more network devices that perform switching functionality on traffic received from SGW  and\/or backhaul network . MLS  may operate multiple layers of the Open Systems Interconnection (\u201cOSI\u201d) reference model, in contrast with other types of switches that traditionally operate only on the Data Link Layer (\u201cDLL\u201d). For example, MLS  may perform deep packet inspection to perform routing functions.","SGW  may include one or more network devices that gather, process, search, store, and\/or provide information in a manner described herein. SGW  may, for example, aggregate traffic received from one or more base stations  and may send the aggregated traffic to PDN  via PGW .","PGW  may include one or more network devices that gather, process, search, store, and\/or provide information in a manner described herein. PGW  may aggregate traffic received from one or more SGWs , etc. and may send the aggregated traffic to PDN . PGW  may also, or alternatively, receive traffic from PDN  and may send the traffic toward user device  via base station , and SGW .","MME  may include one or more computation and communication devices that perform operations to register user device  with the EPS, to establish bearer channels associated with a session with user device , to hand off user device  from the EPS to another network, to hand off user device  from the other network to the EPS, and\/or to perform other operations. MME  may perform policing operations on traffic destined for and\/or received from user device .","HSS\/AAA server  may include one or more devices that manage, update, and\/or store, in a memory associated with HSS\/AAA server , profile information associated with a subscriber. The profile information may identify applications and\/or services that are permitted for and\/or accessible by the subscriber; a mobile directory number (\u201cMDN\u201d) associated with the subscriber; bandwidth or data rate thresholds associated with the applications and\/or services; information associated with the subscriber (e.g., a username, a password, etc.); rate information; minutes allowed for a subscriber (e.g., a subscriber associated with user device ); information regarding services to which particular subscribers are subscribed (e.g., communication services, such as video conferencing services, voice chat services, etc.); and\/or other information. Additionally, or alternatively, HSS\/AAA server  may perform authentication, authorization, and\/or accounting operations associated with the subscriber and\/or a communication session with user device .","PCRF  may include one or more devices that aggregate information to and from the EPC network and\/or other sources. PCRF  may receive information regarding policies and\/or subscriptions from one or more sources, such as subscriber databases and\/or from one or more users (such as, for example, an administrator associated with PCRF ).","PDN  may include one or more wired and\/or wireless networks. For example, PDN  may include an Internet Protocol (\u201cIP\u201d)-based PDN, a wide area network (\u201cWAN\u201d) such as the Internet, a core network of a telecommunications provider, a private enterprise network, and\/or one or more other networks. User device  may connect, through PGW , to data servers, application servers, other user devices , content provider , and\/or to other servers or applications that are coupled to PDN . PDN  may be connected to one or more other networks, such as a public switched telephone network (\u201cPSTN\u201d), a public land mobile network (\u201cPLMN\u201d), and\/or another network. While \u201cdirect\u201d connections are shown in  between certain devices, some devices may communicate with each other via PDN . For example, SAS manager  may communicate with base station  and\/or SL load balancer  indirectly, such as via PDN  and\/or another network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["312","312","405","410","415","420","420","312"]},"SAS manager interface  may include an interface, which may be an implementation of a particular application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d), via which SL load balancer  may receive communications from SAS manager . The API may, in some implementations, be defined by an owner and\/or operator of SAS manager . Additionally, or alternatively, messaging and\/or security protocols, via which SL load balancer  and SAS manager  communicate, may be defined by an owner and\/or operator of SAS manager . The communications may include, for example, access permissions associated with one or more shared frequency bands associated with one or more base stations .","User device information module  may receive and\/or store information regarding user devices , connected to base station . For example, user device information module  may receive the information from base station  and\/or another device that obtains and\/or stores user device information. In some implementations, user device information module  may request user device information directly from user devices . The user device information may include, for example, information indicating a device type (e.g., whether the device is a mobile telephone, a tablet device, an M2M device, a desktop computer, etc.) and\/or a type of traffic presently being sent and\/or received by the device (e.g., voice call traffic, video call traffic, file transfer traffic, web browsing traffic, instant messaging traffic, etc.). User device information module  may additionally, or alternatively, receive other information, such as received signal strength indicator (\u201cRSSI\u201d) values associated with user devices . For example, a particular RSSI value may indicate a received signal strength, for a particular user device , of a signal via a particular carrier.","Cell analytics module  may receive and\/or store analytics information regarding one or more cells associated with base station . For example, the cell analytics information may indicate how loaded the cells are, and may be on a per-carrier basis. For a particular cell, the cell analytics information may indicate how loaded each carrier, associated with the particular cell, is. For instance, a particular carrier may be considered as being highly \u201cloaded\u201d when a relatively large quantity of user devices  are connected to base station  via the carrier. As another example, a measure of load may indicate how many resource blocks, associated with a particular carrier have been utilized, and\/or how many resource blocks are available. Cell analytics module  may receive analytics information regarding one cell (e.g., carriers associated with one cell) or more than one cell (e.g., carriers associated with two or more cells). Cell analytics module  may receive the analytics information from base station  and\/or from another device (e.g., a device that communicates with one or more base stations  in order to determine the analytics information). The cell analytics information may be real time, or near-real time information. For example, cell analytics module  may receive up-to-date analytics information, as the information is collected or generated.","Load balancing module  may perform load balancing operations based on shared access permissions (e.g., received from SAS manager interface ), user device information (e.g., received from user device information module ), and\/or analytics information (e.g., received from cell analytics module ). For example, load balancing module  may receive access permission information, for a particular shared frequency band, indicating a maximum level of load for the particular shared frequency band. Load balancing module  may determine, based on cell analytics information, whether the particular shared frequency band is overloaded. If the particular shared frequency band is overloaded, load balancing module  may determine which user device(s)  to hand over to a different frequency band, and may further determine to which frequency band(s) user device(s)  should be handed over. , described below, illustrates an example implementation of how load balancing module  may perform the load balancing. In some implementations, and\/or in some situations, load balancing module  may additionally perform \u201cconventional\u201d load balancing, in which load balancing decisions may be made without regard to whether a particular carrier is associated with a shared frequency band or a licensed frequency band. Additionally, or alternatively, load balancing module  may be used in conjunction with a \u201cconventional\u201d (or other) load balancer.","Base station interface  may include an interface, such as an implementation of an API and\/or another type of interface, via which SL load balancer  may communicate with one or more base stations . For example, SL load balancer  may receive information regarding user devices  (e.g., RSSI information, traffic type information, device type information) and\/or carriers associated with base station  (e.g., cell analytics information) via base station interface . SL load balancer  may output instructions, such as handover instructions, to base station  via base station interface .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"],"b":["500","312","405","425","500","312"]},"As shown, process  may include receiving (at ) an instruction to reduce the utilization of a shared frequency band to a threshold amount. For example, SL load balancer  may receive (e.g., via SAS manager interface ) an instruction from SAS manager , indicating a threshold measure of load for the shared frequency band. The threshold measure of load may indicate a permissible amount of load that a particular base station  may utilize via the shared frequency band. The threshold measure of load may correspond to, in some situations, a non-zero measure of load that is lower than an amount of load presently (e.g., at the time the instruction is received) being utilized, via the shared frequency band, by base station .","Process  may also include ranking (at ) active user devices connected via the shared frequency band according to RSSI values. For example, as described above, SL load balancer  may store and\/or receive (e.g., via base station interface  and\/or another interface) RSSI values associated with user devices  that are connected to base station  via the shared frequency band. SL load balancer  may rank active user devices  (e.g., user devices  that are involved in ongoing communication sessions) based on the RSSI values. The \u201chighest\u201d ranked user device , in accordance with some implementations, may be the particular user device  with the highest RSSI value.","Process  may include a looping set of blocks -, which may begin (at ) with the highest ranked user device (e.g., the particular user device  with the highest-ranked RSSI value). Blocks - may be performed iteratively for multiple user devices , and are described below in the context of a single iteration for a single particular user device .","Process  may include determining (at ) whether the particular user device is presently involved in a real-time communication session. For example, SL load balancer  may determine a type of the active communication session by, for example, receiving information from base station  or another device, that may indicate the type of the active communication session. For example, the type of communication session may be determined based on contents of traffic being sent to and\/or from user device  (e.g., using deep packet inspection), based on traffic header information (which may indicate, for instance one or more protocols via which the traffic is being sent and\/or an application associated with the traffic), and\/or based on other information (e.g., information generated by or provided from another source, such as from user device , a network device that routes the traffic, and\/or from a communication server with which user device  communicates). For example, the type of traffic (e.g., voice call traffic, video call traffic, file transfer traffic, etc.) may be determined based on protocols or codecs indicated the header information or the content of the traffic, and\/or may be explicitly identified in information provided from another source.","Certain types of traffic (such as voice call traffic or video call traffic) may be considered to be associated with \u201creal-time,\u201d or \u201ctime-sensitive,\u201d communication sessions, while other types of traffic may be considered to be associated with \u201cnon-real-time,\u201d or \u201cnon-time-sensitive,\u201d communication sessions (such as file transfer traffic, web browsing traffic, video streaming traffic, etc.). In some implementations, certain types of traffic may be specifically designated as being associated with real-time communications, and types of traffic that have not been so designated may be considered as not being associated with real-time communications.","If the user device is involved in a real-time communication session (at \u2014YES), then process  may include handing off (at ) the user device to the least loaded licensed band. For example, SL load balancer  may generate an instruction that causes base station  to hand user device  over from the shared frequency band to the least loaded licensed band associated with base station . For instance, as mentioned above, SL load balancer  may identify the least loaded licensed frequency band based on cell analytics information (e.g., as received by cell analytics module ). The term \u201chanding off,\u201d as used herein, may refer to the generating of an instruction that causes base station  to hand user device  from one carrier to another (or otherwise notifying base station  that user device  should be handed over from one carrier to another).","If the user device is not involved in a real-time communication session (at \u2014NO), then process  may include determining (at ) whether the user device is a type of device that is typically involved in real-time communications. For example, as described above with respect to user device information module , SL load balancer  may receive and\/or store information identifying a device type associated with user device . The device type information may indicate, for example, whether user device  is a mobile telephone, a tablet computer, an M2M device, a desktop computer, and\/or another type of device. Additionally, or alternatively, the user device information may include a hardware or a part number, based on which the device type may be determined (e.g., based on comparing the hardware or part number to data that correlates hardware or part numbers to device names and\/or device types).","Certain types of devices may be considered as devices that are \u201ctypically involved in real-time communications,\u201d such as mobile telephones, while other types of devices may be considered as devices that are \u201cnot typically involved in real-time communications,\u201d such as tablet computers, M2M devices, or desktop computers. In some implementations, certain types of devices may be specifically designated as being typically involved in real-time communications, and devices that have not been so designated may be considered as not typically involved in real-time communications.","If the user device is not of a type that is typically involved in real-time communications (at block \u2014NO), then process  may include handing off (at ) the user device to the least loaded shared frequency band available. For example, SL load balancer  may generate an instruction that causes base station  to hand user device  over from the shared frequency band to the least loaded available shared frequency band associated with base station  (i.e., a different band than the shared frequency band via which user device  is presently connected). For instance, as mentioned above, SL load balancer  may identify the least loaded shared frequency band based on cell analytics information (e.g., as received by cell analytics module ).","If no shared frequency bands are available (at ), then SL load balancer  may hand off user device  to a licensed frequency band. For instance, SL load balancer  may hand off user device  to the least loaded licensed frequency band. Additionally, or alternatively, SL load balancer  may identify a licensed frequency band, other than the least loaded licensed frequency band, using other load balancing techniques, and may hand off user device  to the identified licensed frequency band.","If the user device is not involved in a real-time communication session, and is of a type that is typically involved in real-time communications (at \u2014NO and \u2014YES), then process  may include handing off (at ) the user device to the least loaded available frequency band (e.g., without regard to whether the frequency band is a licensed frequency band or a shared frequency band). Additionally, or alternatively, SL load balancer  may identify a band, other than the least loaded frequency band, using other load balancing techniques, and may hand off user device  to the identified frequency band. In some implementations, in lieu of handing off (at ) user device  to another frequency band, SL load balancer  may forgo handing off user device , and user device  may remain on the same shared frequency band. Due to the iterative nature of process , user device  may be handed off at a later time (e.g., during another iteration of process  and\/or as part of a different process).","Once a handover decision has been made (e.g., at , , or ), process  may include determining (at ) whether the utilization of the shared frequency band is at or below the threshold amount. For example, SL load balancer  may receive cell analytics information (e.g., via cell analytics module ) regarding the shared frequency band. The cell analytics information may reflect an amount of load associated with the shared frequency band after user device  has been handed over (e.g., at , , or ).","If the utilization of the shared frequency band is not at or below the threshold amount (at \u2014NO), then blocks - may be iteratively repeated (\u201ccontinue for next user device\u201d at ) for the next most highly-ranked device in the ranking (generated at ). If blocks - have been performed for all user devices  connected to a particular base station , process  may cease. In some implementations, some or all of process  may be repeatedly in an iterative manner if blocks - have been performed for all user devices  connected to a particular base station . For example, after blocks - have been performed for the lowest-ranked user device , portions of process  (e.g., blocks -) may be repeated. That is, for example, a new ranking may be generated (at ), and blocks - may be iteratively performed based on the new ranking, and\/or blocks - may be iteratively performed based on the previous ranking. If, on the other hand, the utilization of the shared frequency band is at or below the threshold amount (at \u2014YES), then process  may end (at ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIGS. 6 and 7","b":["314","314","310","310"]},"As shown in , four user devices (\u201cUD,\u201d \u201cUD,\u201d \u201cUD,\u201d and \u201cUD\u201d) may be connected to a base station. UD, UD, and UD may be connected via a shared frequency band (\u201cSB\u201d), while UD may be connected via licensed frequency band (\u201cLB\u201d). In the example shown in , the relative coverage areas (e.g., the distance from the base station in which user devices can receive wireless service) of LB and SB are approximately equal. Thus, since UD-UD are within the respective coverage areas of LB and SB, UD-UD may receive wireless service (as indicated by the \u201cSB\u201d and \u201cLB\u201d markings, as well as the connection indicator in the figure).","As shown in , the base station may have modified the transmit power of a radio associated with SB (\u201cSB modification\u201d), thus reducing the coverage area of SB. For example, the transmit power may have been reduced based on an instruction from SAS manager . Based on modifying the transmit power of the SB radio, UD and UD, which are outside of the new SB coverage area, may not receive service via SB (as indicated by the \u201cX\u201d over UD and UD in the figure). In order to receive wireless service, UD and UD may search for the base station using other carriers, such as LB.","In situations where many user devices are utilizing a shared frequency band, abruptly reducing the radio transmit power may cause an overload at the base station, which may receive a large number of new connection requests over licensed carriers (or other carriers of which user devices are in range). Thus, it may be beneficial to reduce transmit power of a radio, associated with a shared band, in a staggered manner, so that the base station can handle multiple smaller groups of new connection requests as opposed to attempting to handle a large number of new connection requests at once.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 8","sub":["0","0 ","3 "]},"The base station may reduce the transmit power of the particular radio over a particular duration of time T, which may be the difference between times tand t. In some implementations, the time T may be specified by the instruction from SAS manager , and\/or may be derived from the instruction provided by SAS manager . For example, the instruction may specify an absolute time at which the transmit power should be reduced to the target transmit power, and\/or may specify an amount of time (from which the instruction was sent and\/or received) after which the transmit power should be reduced to the target transmit power.","At intermediate times tand tbetween times tand t, the transmit power of the particular radio may be progressively reduced to intermediate levels (e.g., power levels between the original and target transmit powers), such that the resulting coverage distances are, respectively, xand x(where xand xare intermediate distances between xand x). In some implementations, the transmit power may be reduced in a discrete manner (e.g., distinct reductions at times t, t, and t). In some implementations, the transmit power may be reduced in a continuous manner. When reduced in a continuous manner, the transmit power may be reduced linearly, exponentially, logarithmically, and\/or in another continuous manner.","The transmit powers, described with respect to the above example, may refer to maximum transmit powers. For example, at time t, the maximum transmit power for the radio may be a power at which coverage may be provided at a distance of x. However, for sub-carriers associated with certain user devices that are closer to the base station, the base station may provide the shared frequency band at a lower transmit power than the maximum transmit power at time t.","In other implementations, the transmit powers, described with respect to the above figure, may refer to the transmit power of the radio associated with the entire particular shared frequency band. That is, at time t(for example), the transmit power of the radio may be set at the level at which coverage is provided at the distance of x.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["900","900","310","900","310"]},"As shown, process  may include receiving (at ) an instruction to reduce the transmit power of a radio associated with a shared frequency band. For instance, base station  may receive the instruction from SAS manager . As mentioned above, the transmit power may be specified in the instruction (e.g., in terms of absolute power levels, such as a Decibel-milliwatt (\u201cdBm\u201d) value), and\/or may be derived from the instruction (e.g., in implementations where the instruction specifies a maximum coverage range, for the shared frequency band, for base station ).","Process  may also include determining (at ) a time by which the transmit power should be reduced to the specified transmit power. For example, the instruction may include an absolute time by which the transmit power should be reduced. As another example, the instruction may include a duration of time, from which the instruction was received by base station  and\/or from another reference point, after which the transmit power should be reduced. As yet another example, other factors (such as conventions set forth in one or more standards) may influence or dictate the time which the transmit power should be reduced.","Process  may further include reducing (at ) the transmit power in a discrete or continuous fashion to intermediate levels prior to the determined time. For example, as discussed above with respect to , base station  may reduce the transmit power to one or more levels that are between the original transmit power (e.g., before the instruction was received at ) and the transmit power specified in the instruction.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["1000","1000","1000","1010","1020","1030","1040","1050","1060","1000"]},"Bus  may include one or more communication paths that permit communication among the components of device .
