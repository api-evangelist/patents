{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND INFORMATION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["Wireless networking technologies offer users the convenience of mobility and ease of connection to a network. Mobile devices have inherent capabilities such as location detection, and messaging that are easy to use, secure and convenient to the user. Despite these inherent capabilities, traditional methods for printing documents from mobile devices can be burdensome and inconvenient to the user. For example, users printing from their mobile phones often must locate a printing facility, estimate cost, and wait at the printing facility for the file to print. Additionally, files may often be transferred from a mobile device via a physical connection by removing a memory card from the mobile device or by use of a USB cable. The use of these physical connections requires the user to transfer the file at the printing facility and add to the inconvenience and delay of printing. Therefore, there is a need for an approach that provides for convenient and secure printing using mobile devices.","A preferred apparatus, method and software for providing secure mobile printing for mobile devices are described. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the preferred embodiments of the invention. It is apparent, however, that the preferred embodiments may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the preferred embodiments of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","101","101","101","101","103","103","103","103","105","105","103","105","107","109","111","113","101","103","103","105","101","100"],"i":["a","b","n ","a","b","n "]},"It is observed that mobile device users who enjoy the ability to view and edit files on mobile devices typically use traditional means of locating a printer, determining price, and transferring files. Often these traditional means are facilitated via, for instance, a physical connection (e.g., media card or cable) when printing. Traditionally, when a user of a mobile device wished to print a file on the mobile device , the user manually determines printing locations and requests a price quote from each printing location; often times, many details for determining the printing quotes may not be readily available to the user (e.g., page number, number of color pages). Moreover, most attempts to transfer files remotely rely on e-mail or web based uploads unique to each printing location; however, once sent to the printing location, the documents may often have little or no means to ensure the confidentiality of the printed material. As a consequence, service providers are challenged to develop efficient techniques to remotely secure mobile printing, such as for the purpose of printing confidential material outside of a secured office.","Therefore, the approach of system , according to certain exemplary embodiments, stems from the recognition that consumers can benefit from a printing platform , whereby subscribers (or users) are given access to the printing platform  for locating one or more print stations , providing pricing, and enabling secure remote printing. For instance, users may access the printing platform  on a mobile device  for requesting the location of all print stations  in a target area. The printing platform  may determine the locations along with price data for all print stations  in the target area. Mobile devices  may also be given access to the printing platform  to securely transfer one or more files to a print station  in order to print documents and reduce unauthorized access to printed materials.","Accordingly, in some embodiments, system  facilitates locating print stations  using a target location set by, for instance, the printing platform , a value inputted into the mobile device , a location determined by location detection technology on the mobile device  or a wireless network  (e.g., cell sector, cell site triangulation). In a first embodiment, the target location is determined by the printing platform , by for example using a default value stored in a log. In a second embodiment, the target location is determined from reading an input into the mobile device , for example though a touch screen, or keyboard. It is noted that a mobile device  is described in more detail in accordance with . In a third embodiment, the target location is determined using location detection technology of the mobile device , for example GPS technology. The mobile device  may return spatial positioning information (e.g., an address, latitude, longitude, elevation, etc.) corresponding to a location of mobile device  as an input to the printing platform . In yet another embodiment, the location of mobile device  is determined using network information obtained from the service provider network , for example, cell sector identification.","Accordingly, mobile device  may be configured to determine corresponding spatial positioning information through conventional satellite positioning system (SPS) technology, such as GPS technology; however, any suitable navigational or location determination technology may be utilized, such as advanced forward link trilateration (A-FLT), assisted-GPS (A-GPS), enhanced cellular identification (CELL-ID), wireless area network (WLAN) positioning, etc. As is well known, SPS technology utilizes a constellation  of satellites that transmit signals to receivers (not shown) of, for example, one or more mobile devices , so that the receivers may determine corresponding spatial positions (or locations), speeds, directions, and\/or timing for mobile devices . Mobile devices  may report this information to printing platform  to facilitate the determination of target print stations . It is also noted that printing platform  may \u201cpoll\u201d or receive such spatial positioning information from mobile devices  in real-time, so as to provide presence service features related to mobile devices . As such, the location of, for instance, mobile device  may be detected without mobile device  having to initiate a phone call or other like communication session. Thus, printing platform  may be configured to present received and\/or retrieved spatial positioning information to subscribers, such as via one or more GUI(s). It is also noted that spatial positioning information may be stored on printing platform  or any other suitable storage location or memory of (or accessible to) system .","In other instances, system  facilitates providing pricing data by determining print file characteristics (e.g., number of pages, print ink color). For example, the printing platform  may determine the file characteristics by reading file properties, or by reading the print file to determine the relevant characteristics.","Additionally, in some embodiments, system  facilitates secured printing by enabling subscribers (or users) to access the printing platform  via mobile device  in order to limit access to the print file and\/or the printed material. For example, the mobile device  may send only print file characteristics to the printing platform . The printing platform  may generate, and send to the mobile device  authenticating information to enable access to printed material. By way of example, authenticating information may be transmitted to mobile devices  over one or more of networks -, such as transmitted over one or more of networks - as part of one or more API  directed messages (e.g., API  short messaging service (SMS) directed messages). It is noted that the printing platform  is described in more detail in accordance with . In another embodiment, authenticating information may be used before printing the confidential file for the purpose of protecting sensitive information. Alternatively, the printed material may be generated and access restricted until the print station  receives authenticating information from a mobile device . Still further, the printing platform  may enable delivery of the printed material using secured packaging. The authenticating information may then be used to enable access to the printed material.","Alternatively, in some embodiments, system  facilitates the sending and receiving of status updates related to the printing. In one embodiment, the printing platform  may generate, and send to the mobile device  status updates regarding a print request. Status updates may include, for example, receipt of request to print, order confirmation, status of having printed material, status of having the printed material stored, status of generating printed material prepared for delivery, delivery item tracking, status of having the printed material out for delivery, status of attempt to access the printed material, status of access to printed material granted, delivery of printed material and a delivery receipt. Status updates may be transmitted to mobile devices  over one or more of networks - as part of one or more API  directed messages (e.g., API  short messaging service (SMS) directed messages). In another embodiment, a mobile web portal may be used for status updates and service administration. Access to the web portal may be provided based, at least in part, on authenticating information provided to the mobile device  by the printing platform .","It is noted that signals generated by, for example, authenticating information from printing platform  may be transmitted to mobile devices  via one or more of communication networks -. To prevent unauthorized individuals from accessing printing platform , authenticating information may be required. Authenticating information may be any sequence of information transmitted in various forms including for example, audio, visual, or a combination thereof. In one example, authenticating information includes the detection of a code sequence input, such as a personal identification number (PIN), or user name password combination. In another example, authenticating information includes a visual indicator such as an optically machine-readable representation of data (e.g., barcode). In another example, authenticating information includes an audible indicator such as voice recognition. In another example, authenticating information includes a biometric indicator such as, fingerprint, face, DNA, palm print, hand geometry, hand vein geometry, iris, retina, voice print, odor, and scent recognition may be employed. In yet another example, authenticating information includes an electronic token transmitted (e.g., near field communication) by a security token such as hardware token, hardbad token, authentication token, USB token, cryptographic token, key fob, hardware dongle and software token. It is contemplated that mobile device  may be configured to enable use as a security token.","In some embodiments, any other means for preventing unauthorized access to print requests and related information may be used. Similarly, to prevent the implementation of unauthorized access, printing platform  may include an authentication identifier when transmitting signals to mobile devices . For instance, authenticating information may be encrypted, either symmetrically or asymmetrically, such that a hash value can be utilized to authenticate received control signals, as well as ensure that those signals have not been impermissibly alerted in transit. As such, communications between the mobile devices  and printing platform  may include various identifiers, keys, random numbers, random handshakes, digital signatures, and the like.","According to exemplary embodiments, mobile devices  may include one or more application protocol interfaces (API), such as a set of APIs included within, for example, a binary runtime environment for wireless (BREW) platform, for accepting input from the user. It is contemplated, however, that one or more other mobile client applications may be utilized, such as one or more applications written in one or more programming languages, such as C, C++, J2ME, Java, etc.","As seen in , service provider network  enables mobile devices  to access the features and functionality of printing platform  via one or more of networks , , and . Networks - may be any suitable wireline and\/or wireless network. For example, telephony network  may include a circuit-switched network, such as the public switched telephone network (PSTN), an integrated services digital network (ISDN), a private branch exchange (PBX), or other like network. Wireless network  may employ various technologies including, for example, code division multiple access (CDMA), enhanced data rates for global evolution (EDGE), general packet radio service (GPRS), mobile ad hoc network (MANET), global system for mobile communications (GSM), Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS), universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), etc., as well as any other suitable wireless medium, e.g., microwave access (WiMAX), wireless fidelity (WiFi), satellite, and the like. Meanwhile, data network  may be any local area network (LAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or any other suitable packet-switched network, such as a commercially owned, proprietary packet-switched network, such as a proprietary cable or fiber-optic network.","Although depicted as separate entities, networks - may be completely or partially contained within one another, or may embody one or more of the aforementioned infrastructures. For instance, service provider network  may embody circuit-switched and\/or packet-switched networks that include facilities to provide for transport of circuit-switched and\/or packet-based communications. It is further contemplated that networks - may include components and facilities to provide for signaling and\/or bearer communications between the various components or facilities of system . In this manner, networks - may embody or include portions of a signaling system 7 (SS7) network, or other suitable infrastructure to support control and signaling functions. As such, the conjunction of networks - may be adapted to facilitate features and functionality of printing platform .","According to exemplary embodiments, mobile devices  may include any customer premise equipment (CPE) capable of sending and\/or receiving information over one or more of networks -. For instance, voice station  may be any suitable plain old telephone service (POTS) device, facsimile machine, etc., whereas mobile device  may be any cellular phone, radiophone, satellite phone, smart phone, wireless phone, or any other suitable mobile device, such as a personal digital assistant (PDA), pocket personal computer, tablet, customized hardware, etc. Even though only a limited number of mobile devices -and print stations -are illustrated, it is contemplated that system  can support a plurality of mobile devices , print stations , and equivalent devices. In addition, one or more functions described with the printing platform  may be performed by the mobile devices , the print stations , or other components of system . For example, it is contemplated that functions described with the printing platform  may be performed by a cloud located within, for example, the Service Provider Network .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIGS. 10 and 11"],"b":["105","105","100","105","201","203","205","207","209","211","213","215","217","219","221","223","225","227","105","101","105","105","105","101","109","103"]},"According to one embodiment, printing platform  embodies one or more application servers accessible to mobile device  over one or more networks -. Users (or subscribers) can access printing platform  to determine a print location (e.g., a print station ) and price, to securely transfer a file, and\/or to ensure secure access to printed material.","As seen in , printing platform  may include a provisioning module  for delivering mobile content to the mobile device . The provisioning module  may also update, for example, the version, language settings, or type of installation for the printing platform .","According to exemplary embodiments, printing platform  may include a transaction communicator  for sending and receiving information to and from the mobile device . For example, in one embodiment, the transaction communicator may receive print requests, print files, target locations, and user preferences from mobile device . Additionally, the transaction communicator  may send to the mobile device  the locations of target print stations , price, and\/or status updates. The communication method may be, for instance, over the one or more networks - and may use a variety of communication methods in a single transaction. For example, CDMA or WiFi may be used to send the file to the print station ; a location detection technology, such as GPS technology may be used to identify a location for determining target print stations; and SMS or MMS texting may be utilized to send status updates to the mobile device . In addition or alternatively, a mobile web portal may be used for status updates, and service administration.","According to exemplary embodiments, printing platform  may also include a location module  that may be used to determine print station locations and\/or price information to print the request from the mobile device , and to update a print station location log  and a print station price log . It is contemplated that print station locations may be determined by various means. In one embodiment, the location module  may be configured to receive a target location from a mobile device . For instance, the target location may be a value inputted into the mobile device , a location determined by location detection technology on the mobile device  or a location detected by wireless network  (e.g., cell sector, cell site triangulation). The target location may be, for example, a zip code, address, and\/or location coordinates such as latitude and longitude.","The location module  may then determine the target print station locations by, for example, first calculating a boundary from each print request using the target location and a preset range, and second by looking up each print station  in the print station location log  to determine if the print station  is within the calculated boundary. The preset range may be inputted from a user or may be defined by the printing platform . Alternatively, the location module  may first calculate a distance between the target location and the location of each print station  in the print station location log , and second determine which print stations  are within a distance of the preset range.","In another example, the print station location log  contains distance information, for example, a log of all print stations  within each zip code, and the location module  may look up the target print stations  in the print station location log  using the received location. The print station location log  may have one or more preset ranges from which the user to select and\/or modify. In another embodiment, the mobile device  first determines and sends a calculated boundary to the location module , and second the location module  looks up the target print stations  in the print station location log  within the calculated boundary. It is contemplated that the mobile device  may be configured to contain a print station location log  and determine the target print station locations. The print station location log  may be updated by, for instance, the provisioning module .","Additionally, a print station price may be determined by a price module  by various means. In one embodiment, the price module  determines the price by receiving a print file, determining file printing factors used to calculate price, looking up cost factors in the print station price log  and calculating a price using the file printing characteristics and cost factors.","In one embodiment, file printing characteristics can affect the price of using the printing platform . For example, file printing characteristics include the number of pages, size of paper, packaging, time to perform job, the color of ink printed, and\/or the like. Cost factors are used to adjust the price of using the printing platform , for example, a per page rate. In this manner, the price module  may determine cost by multiplying cost factors with the associated file printing characteristics. For example, the number of pages multiplied by the per page rate would result in a price. It is contemplated that one or more file printing characteristics and corresponding cost factors may be used to determine price. For example, a cost for page size may be added to a cost for the number of pages.","In another embodiment, the price is determined by the price module  which receives file printing characteristics sent from the mobile device , looks up the cost factors in the print station price log , and calculates a price using the file printing characteristics and cost factors. In some embodiments, price is determined by the mobile device . For example, the mobile device  determines the file printing characteristics used to calculate price and then receives cost factors from the price module  (e.g., from a print station price log ). The mobile device  may calculate a price using the file printing characteristics and cost factors.","In yet another embodiment, price is determined by the mobile device  which determines the file printing characteristics used to calculate price, looks up the cost factors in a print station price log  and calculates a price using the file printing characteristics and cost factors. Additionally, a print station price log  on mobile device  may be updated, for example, by a provisioning module . The print station price log  may include pricing terms for various file printing factors, for example, the number of pages, size of paper, packaging, time to perform job, and the color of ink printed.","According to exemplary embodiments, printing platform  may also include a billing module  that may be used to bill the mobile device  for the printing service. The billing may be done by various means, for example, premium SMS based transactional payments, direct mobile billing, mobile web payments (WAP), contactless near field communication (NFC), credit card, online wallet and direct carrier\/bank co-operation. The billing may occur in any step of the secure mobile printing and may allow for partial billing. For example, in a first embodiment the billing module  adds a charge for the printing service before the printing platform  generates authenticating information. In another embodiment, the billing module  adds a charge for the printing service at the start of printing printed material. In yet another embodiment, the billing module  adds a charge for the printing service before the printing platform  generates authenticating information and a second charge when a user is given access to the printed material. It is contemplated that the billing module  may integrate charges for the printing service to the billing associated with the mobile device . Additionally, the integrated billing may be itemized such that charges are easily understood.","In order to provide secure printing, printing platform  may also include a code generation module . It is contemplated that the code generation module may operate in concert with the item tagging module . That is, the code generation module  creates authenticating information that is used by the item tagging module . The code generation module  may save in a log (not shown) authenticating information generated or the authenticating information may be saved elsewhere. By way of example, the code may be any sequence of information, for example, numeric, alpha-numeric, dimensional barcode, or industry standard barcode (e.g., bookland EAN, ISSN, OPC, UPC shipping container symbol). The code generation module  may use various schemes to generate the code, for example, a random number table, a true random number generator, pseudo-random number algorithm such as the linear congruential generator, or a number based on probability density functions.","In this manner, the authenticating information may be used by an item tagging module  to associate each set of authenticating information with a print file and printed material. That is, the item tagging module  in one embodiment receives authenticating information and a print file and associates, for example, the print file, authenticating information, printed material, and packaging information. It is contemplated that the association can be achieved through a data storage table, by physical tagging, or a combination thereof. For example, in one embodiment, a cross-reference table is created to link all the print request information (e.g., the print file, printed material, packaging and storage location).","In another embodiment, a cross-reference table is used to link some of the information (e.g., the print file and authenticating information), and physical tagging is used to link some of the information (e.g., the printed material, and packaging). Physical tagging may be based, at least in part, on the authenticating information, or any other information. For example, a cross-reference table may link the print file, authenticating information and information linking it to a physical code stored on packaging. It is contemplated that any physical tagging may be used to associate, for example, numeric, alpha-numeric, dimensional barcode (e.g., QR code), or industry standard barcode (e.g., bookland EAN, ISSN, OPC, UPC shipping container symbol). It is contemplated that packaging can be used for various purposes, for example, physical protection, barrier protection, information transmission, marketing, security, or convenience. Additionally, the packaging may be of various types and include a number of features, for example, tamper resistance, tamper-evident, and anti-theft devices such as RFID tags, or electronic article surveillance.","In order to verify valid authenticating information, an authentication module  may be used to determine whether or not the information created by the code generation module  is sufficiently similar to information presented for validating authenticating information. For example, the information created by the code generation module  may be stored in various places, for example, the code generation module , the item tagging module , the authentication module , or a device located on the one or more networks -. In one embodiment, the information presented for validating authenticating information may be sent from a print station , or from a mobile device . In another embodiment, the authenticating information presented for validating may be sent from a delivery device (e.g., a mobile device) used by a courier or mail service to confirm authorization to receive the printed material. It is contemplated that the method to obtain the authenticating information may be by any means, for example, optical\/visual and audible methods such as a photodiode and light source, CCD reader, two-dimensional imaging scanner, omni-directional barcode scanner, voice print, biometric identification (e.g., fingerprint, hand geometry, hand vein geometry, iris, face recognition) and data transfer methods such as near-field communications, USB, SMS, MMS, and WiFi. It is contemplated that the authenticating information may be use in combination with or in lieu of a signature to receive delivery.","Additionally, printing platform  may include a service management module  for an improved user experience. The service management module includes a privacy, permissions and preferences module , a print controller , and a workflow manager module .","Accordingly, the privacy, permissions and preferences module  retains each user's options for privacy, permission and preferences. For example, a user may prefer that all printing be performed with a maximum security setting, while another may prefer a minimum security setting. The privacy, permissions and preferences module  may also allow a group or family access to documents within the group or family. Finally, user preferences may be retained for the user's convenience, for example, page layout, print ink color, number of copies, and print location. In one embodiment, default settings may be assumed and the information may be stored in various places, including for example, the privacy, permissions and preferences module , the service management module , the printing platform , on a device connected over the one or more networks -, and\/or on the user's mobile device .","Additionally, a print controller  may be included to ensure authorized access and quality printing. For example, the print controller  may hold printing until the authentication module  has verified authenticating information. Additionally, the print controller  may select a proper printer for the task (e.g., oversized printer for large sheets, color print for print outs requiring color printing). It is contemplated, that the print controller  may be located on a device connected over the one or more networks -, for example, a print station , the mobile device , or the printing platform .","According to one embodiment, the service management module  includes a workflow manager module . The workflow manager module  may aid the mobile device  in selecting a print station  and provide status updates to the mobile device user. The workflow manager module  may coordinate with the price module , print station location log , and print station price log  to adjust the price, recommend a print station  for optimal workflow, and to notify the mobile device  of an expected availability time. For example, a workflow manager module  may adjust the price factors in the print station price log  to encourage equal use among multiple print stations , or may increase the price at a particular print station  that is near printing capacity. Alternatively, the workflow manager module  may monitor each print station's remaining printing capacity and recommend or offer an incentive to the user to select a print station with a relatively low printing use compared to the print station's maximum capacity.","In a another embodiment, the workflow manager module  may identify an expected time to prepare printed material and enable the user to consider alternative print stations  that can provide for a more expedited printing. The workflow manager module  may also send status updates to the mobile device  using the one or more networks -. Status updates may include any information regarding a requested print job including, for example, an order confirmation, a delivery receipt, notifications of printing (e.g., generating printed material, storing printed material), notifications of delivery (e.g., preparing printed material for delivery, expected delivery time, delivery of printed material), and notifications of access to printed material (e.g., attempt to access the printed material, granting access to printed material).","In yet another embodiment, the workflow manager module  may send a location message associated with a print station  location to a mobile device  to enable a user to initiate directions to a print station . The location message may be sent at various times, for example, when selecting a target location, and when receiving authenticating information. The location message may include, for example, a zip code, address, and\/or location coordinates such as latitude and longitude. The location message also may be configured to enable a user to initiate the display of directions on a mobile device  by, for example, selecting an icon or image.","In another embodiment, the workflow manager module  enables the deletion of print files after printed material has been generated. Whether or not to delete print files after printed material has been generated may be determined by, for example, a user's selection inputted into a mobile device , and a user preference stored in a privacy, permissions and preferences module .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 10"],"b":["300","101","100","300","301","303","305","307","300"]},"According to exemplary embodiments, user interface  may include one or more displays , keypads , microphones , and\/or speakers . Display  provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that permits a user of mobile device  to view dialed digits, call status, menu options, and other service information. Specifically, the display  may allow viewing of, for example, authenticating information, and status updates. The GUI may include icons and menus, as well as other text and symbols. Keypad  includes an alphanumeric keypad and may represent other input controls, such as one or more button controls, dials, joysticks, touch panels, etc. The user thus can construct user profiles, enter commands, initialize applications, input remote addresses, select options from menu systems, and the like. Specifically, the keypad  may allow inputting of target location information, selecting print files and print stations, and confirming print requests. Microphone  converts spoken utterances of a user (or other auditory sounds, e.g., environmental sounds) into electronic audio signals, whereas speaker  converts audio signals into audible sounds. Similar to the displays , the speaker  may allow listening to, for example, authenticating information, and status updates. Likewise, the Microphone  may allow inputting of target location information, selecting print files and print stations, confirming print requests and detecting sounds to capture a transcript.","A Camera  may be used as an input device to, for example, collect data for a print file, and facilitate the selection of a print station location. The camera  may be used to create data files of visual images that can be used as print files. Additionally, the camera  may be used to facilitate the selection of a print station location by, for example, overlaying map information on a live direct view, or using the camera  to generate an augmented reality that may be viewed on Display . The augmented reality may be facilitated by the use of additional hardware such as micro electro-mechanical (MEMS) sensors such as accelerometers, solid state compasses, etc.","Communications circuitry  may include audio processing circuitry , controller , location module  (such as a GPS receiver) coupled to antenna , memory , messaging module , transceiver  coupled to antenna , and wireless controller  coupled to antenna . Memory  may represent a hierarchy of memory, which may include both random access memory (RAM) and read-only memory (ROM). Computer program instructions and corresponding data for operation can be stored in non-volatile memory, such as erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM), electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), and\/or flash memory. Memory  may be implemented as one or more discrete devices, stacked devices, or integrated with controller . Memory  may store information, such as one or more user profiles, one or more user defined policies, one or more contact lists, personal information, sensitive information, work related information, etc.","Additionally, it is contemplated that mobile device  may also include one or more applications and, thereby, may store (via memory ) data associated with these applications for providing users with browsing functions, business functions, calendar functions, communication functions, contact managing functions, data editing (e.g., database, word processing, spreadsheets, etc.) functions, financial functions, gaming functions, imaging functions, messaging (e.g., electronic mail, IM, MMS, SMS, etc.) functions, multimedia functions, service functions, storage functions, synchronization functions, task managing functions, querying functions, and the like. As such, signals received by mobile device  from, for example, printing platform  may be utilized by API(s)  and\/or controller  to facilitate locating print stations, and pricing options for utilizing the printing platform . It is also contemplated that these (or other) signals may be utilized by controller  to facilitate the secure transfer of a print file, for example from the mobile device  to the printing platform , and the secure transfer of authenticating information, for example to the mobile device .","Accordingly, controller  controls the operation of mobile device , such as in response to commands received from API(s)  and\/or data stored to memory . Control functions may be implemented in a single controller or via multiple controllers. Suitable controllers  may include, for example, both general purpose and special purpose controllers and digital signal processors. Controller  may interface with audio processing circuitry , which provides basic analog output signals to speaker  and receives analog audio inputs from microphone .","It is noted that real time spatial positioning information may be obtained or determined via location module  using, for instance, satellite positioning system technology, such as GPS technology. In this way, location module  can behave as (or substantially similar to) a GPS receiver. Thus, mobile device  employs location module  to communicate with constellation  of satellites. These satellites transmit very low power interference and jamming resistant signals received by GPS receivers in the location module  via, for example, antennas . At any point on Earth, GPS receiver in location module  can receive signals from multiple satellites, such as six to eleven. Specifically, GPS receiver in location module  may determine three-dimensional geolocation (or spatial positioning information) from signals obtained from at least four satellites. Measurements from strategically positioned satellite tracking and monitoring stations are incorporated into orbital models for each satellite to compute precise orbital or clock data.","Accordingly, GPS signals may be transmitted over two spread spectrum microwave carrier signals that can be shared by GPS satellites, for example, satellites within constellation  of satellites. Thus, if mobile device  is able to identify signals from at least four satellite from, for example constellation , receivers may decode the ephemeris and clock data, determine the pseudo range for each satellite and, thereby, compute the spatial positioning of a receiving antenna .

An input device , such as a touch screen or a keyboard including alphanumeric and other keys, is coupled to the bus  for communicating information and command selections to the processor . Another type of user input device is a cursor control , such as a mouse, a trackball, or cursor direction keys, for communicating direction information and command selections to the processor  and for controlling cursor movement on the display .","According to an exemplary embodiment, the processes described herein are performed by the computer system , in response to the processor  executing an arrangement of instructions contained in main memory . Such instructions can be read into main memory  from another computer-readable medium, such as the storage device . Execution of the arrangement of instructions contained in main memory  causes the processor  to perform the process steps described herein. One or more processors in a multi-processing arrangement may also be employed to execute the instructions contained in main memory . In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement exemplary embodiments. Thus, exemplary embodiments are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.","The computer system  also includes a communication interface  coupled to bus . The communication interface  provides a two-way data communication coupling to a network link  connected to a local network . For example, the communication interface  may be a digital subscriber line (DSL) card or modem, an integrated services digital network (ISDN) card, a cable modem, a telephone modem, or any other communication interface to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of communication line. As another example, communication interface  may be a local area network (LAN) card (e.g., for Ethernet\u2122 or an Asynchronous Transfer Model (ATM) network) to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN. Wireless links can also be implemented. In any such implementation, communication interface  sends and receives electrical, electromagnetic, or optical signals that carry digital data streams representing various types of information. Further, the communication interface  can include peripheral interface devices, such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) interface, a PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card International Association) interface, etc. Although a single communication interface  is depicted in , multiple communication interfaces can also be employed.","The network link  typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other data devices. For example, the network link  may provide a connection through local network  to a host computer , which has connectivity to a network  (e.g., a wide area network (WAN) or the global packet data communication network now commonly referred to as the \u201cInternet\u201d) or to data equipment operated by a service provider. The local network  and the network  both use electrical, electromagnetic, or optical signals to convey information and instructions. The signals through the various networks and the signals on the network link  and through the communication interface , which communicate digital data with the computer system , are exemplary forms of carrier waves bearing the information and instructions.","The computer system  can send messages and receive data, including program code, through the network(s), the network link , and the communication interface . In the Internet example, a server (not shown) might transmit requested code belonging to an application program for implementing an exemplary embodiment through the network , the local network  and the communication interface . The processor  may execute the transmitted code while being received and\/or store the code in the storage device , or other non-volatile storage for later execution. In this manner, the computer system  may obtain application code in the form of a carrier wave.","The term \u201ccomputer-readable medium\u201d as used herein refers to any medium that participates in providing instructions to the processor  for execution. Such a medium may take many forms, including but not limited to non-volatile media, volatile media, and transmission media. Non-volatile media include, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as the storage device . Volatile media include dynamic memory, such as main memory . Transmission media include coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise the bus . Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic, optical, or electromagnetic waves, such as those generated during radio frequency (RF) and infrared (IR) data communications. Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, CDRW, DVD, any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, optical mark sheets, any other physical medium with patterns of holes or other optically recognizable indicia, a RAM, a PROM, and EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave, or any other medium from which a computer can read.","Various forms of computer-readable media may be involved in providing instructions to a processor for execution. For example, the instructions for carrying out at least part of the exemplary embodiments may initially be borne on a magnetic disk of a remote computer. In such a scenario, the remote computer loads the instructions into main memory and sends the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem of a local computer system receives the data on the telephone line and uses an infrared transmitter to convert the data to an infrared signal and transmit the infrared signal to a portable computing device, such as a personal digital assistant (PDA) or a laptop. An infrared detector on the portable computing device receives the information and instructions borne by the infrared signal and places the data on a bus. The bus conveys the data to main memory, from which a processor retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory can optionally be stored on storage device either before or after execution by processor.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0127","num":"0126"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 11"],"b":["1100","1100","105","1100","1100","1100","105"]},"In one embodiment, the chip set or chip  includes a communication mechanism such as a bus  for passing information among the components of the chip set . A processor  has connectivity to the bus  to execute instructions and process information stored in, for example, a memory . The processor  may include one or more processing cores with each core configured to perform independently. A multi-core processor enables multiprocessing within a single physical package. Examples of a multi-core processor include two, four, eight, or greater numbers of processing cores. Alternatively or in addition, the processor  may include one or more microprocessors configured in tandem via the bus  to enable independent execution of instructions, pipelining, and multithreading. The processor  may also be accompanied with one or more specialized components to perform certain processing functions and tasks such as one or more digital signal processors (DSP) , or one or more application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) . A DSP  typically is configured to process real-world signals (e.g., sound) in real time independently of the processor . Similarly, an ASIC  can be configured to performed specialized functions not easily performed by a more general purpose processor. Other specialized components to aid in performing the inventive functions described herein may include one or more field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) (not shown), one or more controllers (not shown), or one or more other special-purpose computer chips.","In one embodiment, the chip set or chip  includes merely one or more processors and some software and\/or firmware supporting and\/or relating to and\/or for the one or more processors.","The processor  and accompanying components have connectivity to the memory  via the bus .
