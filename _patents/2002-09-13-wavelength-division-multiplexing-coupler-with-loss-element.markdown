title: Wavelength division multiplexing coupler with loss element
abstract: A method and system for adjusting power at output ports of a wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) coupler. A loss element may be placed at one or more of the output ports of the WDM coupler. The loss element may have a filter characteristic that matches the temperature sensitivity coefficient of the WDM coupler. The filter characteristic may reject power at one of the two output ports as a function of temperature. As a result, the loss element may balance the power at the output ports of the WDM coupler despite temperature variations.

Field of the Invention","This invention relates to a wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) coupler and more particularly to a temperature sensitive loss element for the WDM coupler.","2. Description of the Related Art","A WDM coupler couples light from one or more light sources onto two or more wave guides. At its simplest form, the WDM coupler has one input port and two output ports. Light input into the one input port may be split so as to exit the two output ports.","The splitting of the light is typically measured by a splitting ratio. The splitting ratio defines a percentage power of the light output at each of the two output ports of the WDM coupler as compared to a total power of the light input into the WDM coupler. A 50\/50 splitting ratio, for example, means that the power exiting each of the two output ports is 50% of the power that inputs the one input port. The splitting ratio is a function of a wavelength of the light input into the WDM coupler. If the wavelength of the light input into the input port of the WDM coupler is \u03bb, then the WDM coupler splits the light so that the power output at the two output ports is balanced, i.e., 50% of the power that is input into the WDM coupler is output at each output port. If the wavelength of the light input into the WDM coupler varies from \u03bb, then the power output at the two output ports will not be balanced, e.g., the power at one output port is different from the power at the other output port.","The WDM coupler is temperature sensitive. The wavelength, \u03bb, at which the WDM coupler has the 50\/50 splitting ratio varies with the temperature of the WDM coupler. The temperature sensitivity of the WDM coupler is typically minimized by stabilizing the temperature of the WDM coupler. A temperature control device, for example, a temperature chamber or a heater, can maintain a constant temperature of the WDM coupler. By maintaining the constant temperature, the wavelength, \u03bb, at which the WDM coupler has a 50\/50 splitting ratio remains constant. As a result, light which is input into the WDM coupler and which has a wavelength equal to the wavelength \u03bbfor the constant temperature can be assuredly split at the splitting ratio, regardless of external temperature variations.","The present invention stems from a realization that it takes time for a temperature control device to stabilize the temperature of the WDM coupler. Depending on how rapidly the external temperature varies, the temperature control device might not be able to stabilize the temperature of the WDM coupler to the proper temperature. As a result, the wavelength \u03bbwill not be stabilized and the WDM coupler will not be able to achieve the splitting ratio for the light input into the WDM coupler. Therefore, it would be advantageous to have a more robust solution for minimizing the temperature sensitivity of the WDM coupler.","In accordance with a principal aspect of the present invention, a loss element may be added to one or more of the output ports of the WDM coupler. The loss element may adjust the power output at the output ports of the WDM coupler in accordance with the temperature of the WDM coupler. As a result, the loss element may compensate for the temperature sensitivity of the WDM coupler. The output ports may output power at the splitting ratio designed for the WDM coupler.","The WDM coupler may have a coupling section, one or more input ports, and two or more output ports. Light may be input at the one or more input ports, passed through the coupling section, and output at the two or more output ports. The WDM coupler may have a temperature sensitivity coefficient that defines the temperature sensitivity of the WDM coupler. The temperature sensitivity coefficient may indicate how the wavelength at which the splitting ratio of the WDM coupler is 50\/50, for example, changes as a function of temperature.","The temperature sensitivity coefficient of the WDM coupler may be determined by placing the WDM coupler in a temperature control device. The temperature control device may maintain a particular temperature of the WDM coupler. Light from a light source may be input into the WDM coupler. The wavelength of the light from the light source may be adjusted so as to balance the power output at the output ports for the particular temperature. Then, the temperature of the temperature control device may be changed. The wavelength of the light may be, again, adjusted so as to balance the power output at the output ports. The process of varying the temperature of the temperature control device and determining the wavelength at which power at the output ports is balanced allows for determining the relationship between temperature and the wavelength of light at which the power at the output ports of the WDM coupler is balanced. This relationship is the temperature sensitivity coefficient of the WDM coupler.","To compensate for the temperature sensitivity coefficient of the WDM coupler, a loss element may be placed at one or more of the output ports. The loss element may be a fiber grating, for example, with an index of refraction that changes as a function of temperature. The loss element may be designed with a filter characteristic that matches the temperature sensitivity coefficient of the WDM coupler. A pass band and a stop band of the filter characteristic may shift as a function of temperature thereby adjusting the power output at the output ports of the WDM coupler. Preferably, the filter characteristic may reject the power at one of the output ports to balance the power output at the output ports of the WDM coupler despite temperature variations.","These as well as other aspects and advantages of the exemplary embodiments will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art by reading the following detailed description, with appropriate reference to the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["12","14","12","20","20"]},"Generally, the WDM coupler  may have one or more input ports and two or more output ports.

Of course, the WDM coupler may be designed to achieve other splitting ratios.","The WDM coupler  may achieve the splitting ratio at a certain temperature. If the temperature of the WDM coupler  varies from the certain temperature, then the WDM coupler  may not achieve the 50\/50 splitting ratio. To compensate for the variation in the temperature, the loss element  may be formed at one or both of the two output ports ,  of the WDM coupler.","The loss element  may be a fiber grating with an index of refraction that varies as a function of temperature.

The +5 ppm\/\u00b0 C. temperature sensitivity coefficient means that the wavelength at which the WDM coupler may achieve the required splitting ratio (e.g., 50\/50) may vary by 5 ppm for every \u00b0 C. temperature change. To compensate for the +5 ppm\/\u00b0 C. temperature sensitivity coefficient, loss element  of the WDM coupler  may have a filter characteristic with a matching \u22125 ppm\/\u00b0 C. temperature sensitivity coefficient.
