title: System, method and article of manufacture for cryptoserver-based auction
abstract: A system, method, and article of manufacture are provided for pricing a cryptographic service on a network utilizing one or more cryptoservers. A request for a cryptographic service is received from a user utilizing a network. The request is received by a cryptographic service provider. A contract is generated based on a variable pricing scheme in response to the request. The contract is sent from the cryptographic service provider to the user utilizing the network. A method is also provided for auditing a security provision on a network utilizing a cryptoserver. A cryptographic key is obtained such as by obtaining it from a trusted source or generating the key. A plurality of users are allowed to request that a cryptoserver use the cryptographic key to sign a message in violation of a security provision. It is determined whether the cryptoserver signed the message in response to the request. An indication of failed security integrity is provided upon determining that the cryptographic server has signed the message.

The communications carried over each of these media are, however, subject to interception (commonly referred to as \u201ceavesdropping\u201d). In instances where a communication concerns sensitive or proprietary information, it is common for the parties to the communication to employ a security protocol (such as encryption or scrambling) in order to prevent the eavesdropper from being able to discover the communicated information.","In encryption, a plaintext message is encrypted by a sender into a ciphertext message using a key (cryptovariable) and then sent over a communications channel. A receiver then decrypts the communications channel transmitted ciphertext message using the same key. An eavesdropper, who presumably does not have access to the key, cannot decrypt the transmitted ciphertext message to recover the plaintext message. Any sensitive or proprietary information contained within the plaintext message is thus safely communicated.","It is not unusual for the sender and receiver to be located at a considerable distance from each other. In such cases, a number of problems arise in ensuring that the designated key necessary for decryption is securely communicated to the receiver. A secure channel, such as a courier service, may be used to communicate the key. However, such channels tend to be expensive, slow, and perhaps even unsecured in instances where the trustworthiness of the courier is compromised.","Key and Encryption Technology","In a public key encryption scheme, cryptographic keys occur in pairs: one of the pair is a private key that is kept confidential, and the other of the pair is a public key that can be made available to anyone. When data is encrypted using one of the keys (either the public key or the private key), the other key must be used to decrypt the data. For example, resource A encrypts data using a private asymmetric cryptographic key belonging to A. Resource A makes the corresponding public asymmetric cryptographic key available publicly. The only key that can properly decrypt the data is the public key corresponding to the private key with which the data was encrypted. When resource B receives the data, it uses resource A's public key to decrypt the data. If the data decrypts properly, resource B is certain that only resource A, the sole holder of the corresponding private key, could have encrypted the data. In this way, resource B knows that the data must have originated from resource A, i.e., that the data purportedly from resource A is authentic.","Due to the demand for secure data transfer, many commercial encryption service providers have emerged to provide encryption services. The level of service as well as the integrity can vary from provider to provider. Further, the costs of providing the encryption service can vary for each particular job. However, under current practices, service providers charge a standard fee for providing the service, regardless of difficulty of the job.","Accordingly, new methods are needed to allow selection of the lowest costing service provider as well as allow the service provider to charge the customer for providing such services.","To ensure that the cryptographic server of the service provider is maintaining an appropriate level of security, and therefore justifying the fees charged, auditing functions need to be provided. However, such service providers might attempt to \u201ccheat\u201d by manipulating auditing programs to provide a satisfactory report. While uncheatable protocols exist in the literature, they have not been applied to cryptographic network services.","There are several scenarios under which it is natural for a group of cryptoservers to compete. The present invention provides several mechanisms that help make competition among cryptoservers more effective, particularly, variable pricing, recommendation systems, and auditing. There are special advantages to implementing these mechanisms for cryptoservers as opposed to any other (generic) commoditized service.","Accordingly, a system, method, and article of manufacture are provided for pricing a cryptographic service on a network utilizing one or more cryptoservers. A request for a cryptographic service is received from a user utilizing a network. The request is received by a cryptographic service provider. The cryptographic service provider can be, for example, an entity in communication with the cryptoservers or can be a cryptoserver in communication with the cryptoservers. A contract is generated based on a variable pricing scheme in response to the request. The contract is sent from the cryptographic service provider to the user utilizing the network.","In one aspect of the present invention, the cryptographic service provider selects one of a plurality of cryptoservers to perform the cryptographic service. As one option, the plurality of cryptoservers are commercial services competing for customers. As another option, the plurality of cryptoservers are part of a single distributed service.","In another aspect of the present invention, the variable pricing scheme is based on of a data load of a cryptoserver during performance of the service, a distance between the cryptoserver and the user, a congestion of the network during performance of the service, and\/or a rating of the cryptoserver performing the service.","In yet another aspect of the present invention, the variable pricing scheme is auction-based. As one option, the cryptographic service provider receives bids for performing the cryptographic service from the user. As another option, a plurality of cryptoservers bid for providing the cryptographic service. The cryptographic service provider can provide a receipt upon performing the cryptographic service. Such receipt can include one or more of a one-way hash of the results of its computations, the time and duration of the computations, a description of the computations, and the identities of the cryptoserver and the customer.","A preferred embodiment of a system in accordance with the present invention is preferably practiced in the context of a computer such as an IBM compatible computer, Apple Macintosh computer or UNIX based system. One of ordinary skill in the art will readily comprehend that routers, switching hardware and digital telephony systems provide the necessary computing capacity for hosting a preferred embodiment. A representative hardware environment is depicted in , which illustrates a typical hardware configuration of a workstation in accordance with a preferred embodiment having a central processing unit , such as a microprocessor, and a number of other units interconnected via a system bus .","The workstation shown in  includes a Random Access Memory (RAM) , Read Only Memory (ROM) , an I\/O adapter  for connecting peripheral devices such as disk storage units  to the bus , a user interface adapter  for connecting a keyboard , and\/or other user interface devices such as a touch screen (not shown) to the bus , communication adapter  for connecting the workstation to a communication network  (e.g., a data processing network) and a display adapter  for connecting the bus  to a display device . The system also has crypto hardware incorporated into the architecture.","The workstation typically has resident thereon an operating system such as the Microsoft Windows NT or Windows\/95 Operating System (OS), the IBM OS\/2 operating system, the MAC OS, or UNIX operating system. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention may also be implemented on platforms and operating systems other than those mentioned. A preferred embodiment is written using the C and C++ languages and utilizes object oriented programming methodology.","With the concepts of composition-relationship, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism, an object can represent just about anything in the real world. In fact, one's logical perception of the reality is the only limit on determining the kinds of things that can become objects in object-oriented software. Some typical categories are as follows:\n\n","With this enormous capability of an object to represent just about any logically separable matters, OOP allows the software developer to design and implement a computer program that is a model of some aspects of reality, whether that reality is a physical entity, a process, a system, or a composition of matter. Since the object can represent anything, the software developer can create an object which can be used as a component in a larger software project in the future.","A cryptoserver in accordance with a preferred embodiment is implemented in C++. One of ordinary skill in the art will readily comprehend that Java could have been used as an enabler, however, there are some enhancements to Java that are required to provide appropriate infrastructure. These enhancements, provided in accordance with a preferred embodiment, address problems including: lack of suitable middleware, poor performance characteristics of present Java compilers, difficulty of efficient interfacing to vendor libraries written in the C programming language, and a lack of a complete Unix system call interface.","In order to simplify the cryptoserver, \u201cshim\u201d libraries are utilized to normalize the interface the server utilizes to interface to the heterogeneous cryptographic hardware accelerators utilized in accordance with a preferred embodiment. This architecture allows the removal from the server of any task-specific logic yet compensates for any differences in feature support between various accelerator drivers and a common interface presented to cryptoserver clients. For example, the shim libraries were necessary to normalize byte order, handle support for negative numbers, handle exponents greater than the modulus and similar tasks. Many hardware accelerators have intermittent or no support for such inputs since they do not occur when utilizing standard RSA. However, as technologies like the cryptoserver reduce the cost of modular exponentiations, cryptographic algorithms and protocols considered too costly and complex for practical use will be used, and these algorithms will require feature shims in accordance with the preferred embodiment. Each hardware \u201cshim\u201d is responsible for any initialization required by the hardware it manages, and can provide information to the server about the capabilities of that hardware. This information is utilized by the server for sophisticated scheduling of work items on particular accelerators.","In order to make effective use of the hardware and maximize scalability, the number of threads on the cryptoserver can be configured to manage each cryptographic accelerator. This is varied based on the inherent parallelism of each accelerator board, the architecture of the driver and any vendor libraries used to interface with the accelerator board. The server has a default allocation of one thread per cryptographic processing unit. The server also allocates a set number of threads for the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) subsystem. A number of work items are preallocated into an idle queue. Then, as cryptographic requests arrive, they are decrypted and placed in a work item which is moved onto the work queue. After the cryptographic accelerator has processed the request, the work item is moved onto the reply queue and the reply is encrypted before it is transmitted. Multiple threads are utilized to process requests and replies to prevent either stage from becoming a bottleneck.  is a block diagram of a cryptoserver architecture in accordance with a preferred embodiment. A client accesses the cryptoserver through the internet  or other communication device with a request  which is intercepted by one of the request handler threads  and placed on the idle queue  for processing by the work queue  and ultimate input to the cryptographic accelerator . Information accompanying the request is used to determine the number of worker threads  assigned to process the cryptographic request as discussed above. Moreover, the particular characteristics of the cryptographic accelerator are normalized utilizing one or more \u201cshim\u201d as discussed above. A reply  is generated by the worker threads  and one or more of the reply handler threads  are used to generate the reply  transmission which is returned via the internet  or other communication facility.","An additional optimization in accordance with a preferred embodiment allows the RPCs to receive array arguments that are broken down into multiple work items as they are placed on the work queue . This enables the separate operations to occur in parallel in accordance with a preferred embodiment. The RPC cannot return results until all of the parallel threads have completed, so one of the work items is canonical per RPC request and no canonical work item is moved onto the reply queue until all of the operations are completed.","In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the cryptoserver utilizes generally available hardware. The customization aspects in accordance with a preferred embodiment are performed in software. However, one of ordinary skill in the art will readily comprehend that hardware could be utilized to customize or optimize various aspects without departing from the spirit and scope of the claims. A Sun Ultra-10 workstation running Solaris 7 with an Atalla AXL200 accelerator is utilized in accordance with a preferred embodiment. The AXL200 has a maximum throughput of 267, 1024-bit private key RSA operations per second. As discussed above, the architecture of the software utilizes \u201cshims\u201d to normalize the differences in the accelerator hardware. The Sun workstation was selected because several cryptographic accelerator vendors support Solaris on SPARC hardware. The cryptoserver can be enhanced to utilize a multiprocessor to more efficiently handle independent cryptographic requests in parallel.  illustrates a cryptographic network architecture in accordance with a preferred embodiment. A cryptography server  attaches to the internet  or other communication medium to enable clients  &  to send and receive information to be encrypted or decrypted. Symmetric cryptographic acceleration hardware  is utilized to speed the encryption of client cryptoserver communication. This hardware is particularly useful for DES or triple-DES operations. Faster block ciphers are effectively accommodated in software utilized in conjunction with the hardware. In addition, multiple public key accelerators can be used in parallel to facilitate a dramatic throughput increase.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 1C","b":["180","182","184","184","186","188","190","191","184","192"]},"A software architecture in accordance with a preferred embodiment scales effectively based on the following variables, including the number of client requests, the amount of cryptographic hardware available and the number of individual clients (security associations) being managed and utilized. The architecture in accordance with a preferred embodiment is designed so that individual client requests must have low overhead, both in terms of network operations and security association management. Infrequent operations such as security association negotiation may be more expensive to compensate. Additional cryptographic acceleration capability can be added easily to take advantage of different types of cryptographic accelerators. Finally, the software is extensible to support different mechanisms for negotiating security associations and protecting requests on the wire.","A preferred embodiment was implemented utilizing Sun's Transport Independent Remote Procedure Call (TI-RPC) middleware. This software enables multithreaded applications for scalable service. TI-RPC also supports the Generic Security Service (GSS) Application Programming Interface (API) that provides multiple authentication and encryption technologies for negotiating long-term security associations, and it supports datagram transports such as UDP. A datagram is an independent, self-contained message sent over the network whose arrival, arrival time, and content are not guaranteed. Datagrams are used because they comply with the RPC paradigm better than connection-oriented transports such as TCP and because a datagram based solution obviated the requirement for complicated connection pool management logic. The connection pool management logic becomes very complex as the number of clients exceeds the number of socket descriptors available in a single Unix process. Datagrams also minimize transport-related overhead for clients who may make infrequent calls to the cryptoserver. One of ordinary skill in the art will readily comprehend that other middleware choices, most notably CORBA, could be used without departing from the scope and spirit of the claims.","A major attraction of this middleware is the availability of RPCSEC.GSS which provides an interface to the GSSAPI. GSSAPI is a pluggable security API which provides a consistent interface to a variety of different authentication and encryption technologies. It is one of the few security technologies to explicitly support negotiation of security associations over connectionless transport that is capable of securing communication over such transports. Most importantly, RPCSEC.GSS provides features essential to providing long-term security associations to secure RPC-based requests with a minimum of per-request overhead. Another substantial advantage of TI-RPC is that it is compatible on the wire with Sun's ONC RPC, a widely deployed RPC protocol that is at the heart of NFS. As such, ONC RPC implementations are available on a wide variety of platforms.","There are a variety of approaches to generating security associations between a client and a cryptoserver in accordance with a preferred embodiment. The simplest is a pure key agreement protocol (e.g. Diffie-Hellman) to produce a shared symmetric key used to encrypt further communication between a client and a server. In a production server in accordance with a preferred embodiment, session keys will be generated every one to twenty-four hours per client in actual use. If the keys expire uniformly across an hour, even with 10,000 clients and one hour session expirations, this implies three key agreements, with associated modular exponentiations, per second, or one percent of the capacity of a single AXL200. To produce the benchmark numbers discussed below, a 192-bit Diffie-Hellman key agreement mechanism was utilized which is distributed with TI-RPC. For a symmetric cipher in accordance with a preferred embodiment, triple DES is utilized. Using triple-DES is a very conservative choice, as almost all other ciphers will offer better performance.","Other approaches to negotiating security associations have also been explored. For a preferred embodiment, a client must have assurance that the machine is communicating with a trustworthy cryptoserver. Therefore, the server must be able to authenticate itself to the client. If the service is freely given, the client need not authenticate itself to the server. In order to provide this base level of functionality, a public key based GSS mechanism and a certification authority trusted by all clients is utilized to certify the cryptoserver. Alternative embodiments for authentication mechanisms utilize client authentication to control access to a cryptoserver. PKI-based or Kerberos-based authentication mechanisms can identify clients authorized to use the cryptoserver. Forms of digital cash can be used to allow clients to pay for cryptographic operations by both number of operations or quality of service (speed, latency, etc.) as described below. Thus, clients could set up an account as part of security association negotiation, or could include payment tokens on a per-request basis.","The client interface to the cryptoserver in accordance with a preferred embodiment is designed to allow sophisticated clients to utilize one or more servers while minimizing network-related overhead, and to make it easy to incorporate cryptoserver support into legacy client packages. The interface is also designed to allow requests to pass through to the cryptographic hardware with as few copy operations as possible, and to be broken up in various ways to interface efficiently to heterogeneous accelerator hardware incorporated into the cryptoserver.","The interface to the cryptoserver is written in Sun's rpcgen RPC specification language. Here is an example of the code with non-essential details about data types and benchmarking support removed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0055"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"Program

Also note that the exponent has a weight of 511 (i.e., there are 511 \u201c1\u201d bits in the exponent), and the time per operation depends on the weight of the exponent. The important point to note is that the penalty for using a cryptoserver is minimal to non-existent.","Viewing cryptography as a network service changes all the rules regarding the cost of cryptography. Then, since cryptography is not computationally prohibitive, it is much more convenient to incorporate into applications. Applications using abundant public key operations including secure communication services for dynamic coalitions, private database retrieval and other applications in which cryptographic services naturally fit are enabled since the cost is no longer prohibitive. Cryptoserver client support for standard cryptographic APIs are also supported utilizing this novel architecture. In accordance with a preferred embodiment, each request includes the client's private key. Alternatively, if the cryptoserver already knows the client's private key, then the request may include an authentication token that demonstrates who the request is coming from and that the request is fresh. This capability would require a more trustworthy cryptoserver, but it would reduce the bandwidth required for the network by nearly half.","Although we need to trust the cryptoserver with the private key, we do not need to trust the cryptoserver with the message or ciphertext to be processed. These can be protected by a method known as blinding, which is a pre-processing step (e.g., randomization) compatible with the cryptographic operation to be performed. After the results of the cryptographic operation on the blinded data are returned, the user can perform a corresponding post-processing step to unblind them. This is particularly efficient for RSA signatures with low exponent, but it is useful in many other cases as well.","Since the server supports a heterogeneous collection of hardware accelerators running concurrently, it would be a simple modification to use one accelerator to double check the results delivered by another accelerator. By using different accelerators, a single accelerator could not produce a doctored result along with a doctored inverse check result. The tradeoff between paranoia and throughput could be easily managed by checking a user-selectable fraction of results. By selecting hardware accelerators designed and manufactured in disjoint countries, no single government would be in a position to compromise an RSA operation. Such a system would be highly resistant to attacks, including fault injection. Similarly, clients could issue RPCs to more than one server. One could, for example, use servers operated by different organizations, or servers located in multiple countries.","A preferred embodiment has been discussed that enables public key cryptography as a service offered over untrusted networks. This architecture has been shown to offload work from clients, provide greater utilization of cryptographic accelerators by sharing them among many clients, and it has acceptably small performance overhead. In addition, it enables new security applications that were previously considered too costly.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0080"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","702","704","706"]},"In optional decision , the user can be allowed to specify the privacy level of a high level cryptographic service. Thus, the user has control of the tradeoffs that are inherent in many privacy protocols. This is particularly useful where a user wishes to utilize different levels of privacy for different data. This also allows different users to specify their preferred levels of privacy. If the user is allowed to specify the privacy level, the user's desired level of privacy is received in operation .","In optional decision , the user can be allowed to specify the speed of performing the cryptographic service. In this way, a user wishing to send large quantities of data can help specify how quickly the data can be encrypted and sent. If the user is allowed to specify the speed, the user's desired speed is received in operation . It should be kept in mind that any combination of the functions of operations , , and  can be performed for any user utilizing the process of the present invention.","With continued reference to , in operation , an identification is made of the computational burdens required to perform the cryptographic service, the privacy level of the cryptographic service, and\/or the speed of performing the cryptographic service. The encryption is performed in operation . A price of the cryptographic service is determined in operation  based on the computational burden, privacy level, and\/or speed. Payment for the cryptographic service can be requested and received from the user in operations  and , respectively. In one application of the present invention, the process of  can be used for pricing cryptographic services in networked business applications. There are a number of security protocols for which the degree of privacy scales nearly linearly with the computational burden. Following are three examples:","1. Private Information Retrieval",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0084"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","802"]},"The querier generates the special modulus N and the random base x in operation . The particular small prime is used to encode the secret query j. The database computes a modular exponentiation using n and x, where the exponent is the product of a number of small primes. Exactly which small prime is selected is a function of the bits in the database that are one's and zero's. The final result is a single value which is bigger no larger than N. The querier takes this final result and performs a test on it to determine the result of the query. The test is a modular exponentiation that uses the result of the query as the base. In operation , the querier's query is \u201chidden\u201d among the set of m possible queries (i.e., placed in a batch with the other queries).","Notice that the communication between the querier and the database is the size of a single 1024-bit number no matter how large the database is. Notice that this compression in communication is achieved at the expense of an increase in computation by both parties. Specifically, both parties must perform modular exponentiations of a specific type. These are not modular exponentiations to encrypt, decrypt, sign or verify a signature. Instead, they are modular exponentiations in the service of a complex protocol to perform a sophisticated cryptographic service (private information retrieval). The queries are sent to the database or other data source in operation , and responses to the queries are received in operation .","It is possible to reduce the computation for the database by restricting the database to 100,000 elements and performing the private information retrieval over that set of bits. This hides the true query in a smaller set of possible queries. The communication size remains the same, but the computation that the database must perform is reduced. The computation that the database must perform is dominated by the cost of performing a modular exponentiation where the exponent is a product of as many small primes as there are one's in that portion of the database. The smaller the portion of the database within which the query is hidden, the fewer small primes in the exponent product, and thus the simpler the calculation for the database, which is referred to as \u201cper-tree\u201d pricing. This is very different from having the database simply retrieve 100,000 answers for the querier. It is a complex protocol for private information retrieval which restricts the possible queries over which the protocol takes place in order to reduce the computational burden on the service provider. The response to the query is separated from the responses in operation .","One such solution requires a database to perform the query and the database to each perform about m modular exponentiations, and reduces the communication to one round of messages of size log m. This example has many practical applications, such as allowing a user to get a real-time stock quote without revealing which stock he or she is interested in, or query a patent database without leaking the query to a competitor.","2. Group Authentication","According to an embodiment of the present invention, a participant proves to be one of a plausible set of m possible participants without revealing which, where m is a tunable parameter. There is also a non-interactive version of this called a \u201cgroup signature\u201d. An illustrative cryptographic solution requires the participant and the verifier to each perform about m modular exponentiations, and exchange one round of communication of size m. This example has many practical applications, including to enhance the value of recommendation systems.","3. Mix Networks","According to one embodiment of the present invention, a participant can hide his or her message traffic among other participants' messages using a mechanism commonly known as a mix network. In an illustrative cryptographic solution the cost is about two hundred modular exponentiations per mix per ciphertext. This example has application whenever the fact that one user is communicating with another is revealing. Many other anonymity mechanisms (such as for anonymous payment, or group authentication) become worthless if there is no traffic confidentiality. The bulk of the computational burden for all participants in these examples can be offloaded to one or more independent cryptoservers, or to a service provider that has access to its own cryptoservers. It is natural to consider a pricing model where the participant pays by the degree of desired privacy.","In various embodiments of the present invention, the computations that are to be performed by the cryptoserver can be done generically (that is, data-independent pre-computation), or data-dependent but blindable (that is, in a way that sensitive information is concealed even from the cryptoservers), or data-dependent and information-leaking (that is, so that the cryptoserver must be trusted with sensitive information, although this information is still concealed from the other participants in the actual protocol). In all of these cases, a pricing model with offloaded computation to cryptoservers can be instituted, although the security assumptions for the participants will be different.","The private information retrieval schemes can be done generically. The group authentication schemes can be done in a way that is data-dependent but blindable. Some of the work for the mix networks can be done generically, while some must be data-dependent and information-leaking. However, note that the information being leaked to the cryptoservers in this case are ciphertexts, which threatens the confidentiality of the fact of the communication but not the contents.","For the example of a mix network, the participant's traffic might be hidden among dummy traffic, or among other participants' traffic. In the latter case, all participants in the mix gain traffic confidentiality. Therefore, a pricing mechanism can be crafted on a value-gained basis to extract more revenue. An appropriate (fair) pricing mechanism is the well known \u201cClarke Tax,\u201d which generalizes the second-price auction mechanism. The Clarke Tax is designed to encourage all participants to state their true evaluation rather than the strategic evaluation.  is a flow diagram of a process  for a Clarke Tax model according to one embodiment of the present invention. In operation , each potential participant quotes a value for being part of the mix. In operation , participants are chosen so that the sum of these values is maximized. In operation , each participant is charged the difference between what this sum is and what this sum would have been had this participant been ignored.","An embodiment of the present invention provides a business model where the user would pay on a steeply sliding scale according to the amount of compression that was desired. This is useful for bandwidth-critical applications such as transmission along a very expensive channel. Example applications include communication to spacecraft, or communication over low-power wireless devices. It is also useful for applications where signed data must be stored in a constrained location. Examples include signed authentication tokens or electronic cash to be stored on a smart card, or a signature to be stored as a small glyph on a page.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0095"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["1000","1002","1004","1006","1008"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0096"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["1100","1102","1104","1106","1108"]},"Variable Pricing",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0089","num":"0097"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["1200","1202","1204"]},"The cryptographic service is performed in operation . In operation , a contract is generated based on a variable pricing scheme in response to the request.","In operation , the contract is sent from the cryptographic service provider to the user utilizing the network.","Variable pricing is a mechanism that is effective for cases (a) and (b). The price that a cryptoserver sets can depend on how idle it is at the moment or at the future time of the contracted service, how far away it is in the network, the current congestion in the network, how reliable and confidential the cryptoserver has been in the past (based on recommendation systems as discussed elsewhere in the specification), and other factors.","Auctions are an alternative pricing mechanism that can be either demand-driven (bids by customers for cryptoservice) or supply-driven (bids by cryptoservers for jobs). More generally, markets are possible for generic cryptocommodities, including futures contracts. These pricing mechanisms have the effect of creating a more equitable market for the consumer in case (a). In case (b), the effect is to create incentives that will lead rational consumers to balance the load more effectively among the various cryptoservers of the distributed service.","Note that the auctions (or markets) can be conducted securely as a cryptographic protocol by one or more of the cryptoservers. This would allow the participants a high degree of assurance and privacy, while offloading most of the computational burden. Of course, this would be advantageous when bidding for jobs that were significantly larger than the cost of executing the secure auction protocol itself (e.g., following one common approach from the literature about k n log n modular multiplications, where k is the number of auction participants, and n is the number of bits in the bidding range).","Recommendation System","Recommendation systems can be helpful for keeping track of the past reliability, speed and confidentiality of cryptoservers. Any number of generic recommendation systems for generic services can be adapted to this scenario. Of special interest are approaches that exploit the nature of the cryptoservice. For example, a cryptoserver can give every customer a receipt for every job, digitally signed at a tiny extra cost (i.e., a fraction of the computational burden of the job itself). The receipt can include such information as a one-way hash of the results of its computations, the time and duration of the computations, a description of the computations, the identities or pseudonyms of the cryptoserver and the customer. These signed receipts are useful to back up claims or complaints by customers in a non-repudiable manner.","Auditing","Auditing can help establish the past reliability, speed and confidentiality of cryptoservers. Here too, any generic method for auditing any on-line service could be used, but there are special opportunities for auditing a cryptoservice. One embodiment of the present invention has two or more auditors use a secure distributed protocol to generate a signing key, and which give that key to a cryptoservice in a way that no single auditor knows what it is. The auditors could then try to have the cryptoservice sign a known set of messages using that key. Any other signed message using that key would be a strong indication that the cryptoserver failed, because the only alternative explanations would be that the key was cracked (e.g., the RSA modulus was factored) or that some threshold number of auditors colluded.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0097","num":"0105"},"figref":"FIG. 13","b":["1300","1302","1304","1306","1308","1310"]},"Another embodiment of the present invention makes use of Lipton's notion of \u201cuncheatable benchmarks\u201d that are moderately hard to compute but easy to verify, as known to those skilled in the art. In one of Lipton's constructions, the cryptoserver must perform m modular exponentiations where m is a tunable parameter, while the entire computation can be verified with only two modular exponentiations. This is based on RSA computations, where the verifier knows the factorization of the modulus. Here again, the use of distributed key generation by two or more auditors makes these benchmark tests even more credible.","Another embodiment of the present invention that benefits from distributed key generation checks for the presence of unintentional emmission channels in the cryptoservers.  is a flowchart illustrating a process  for auditing a security provision of a cryptographic service on a network utilizing a cryptoserver. Again, the security provision can relate to access control and\/or integrity of the cryptoserver, for example. In operation , a cryptographic key that is generated by two or more users is received by a cryptoserver and, in operation , is utilized to sign a message. Again, the users can be system operators or administrators, other cryptoservers, and\/or programs executed by the cryptoserver, for example. In operation , the cryptoserver is monitored and one or more attempts are made to determine the cryptographic key from behavior of the cryptoserver while the cryptoserver signs the message. Preferably, the cryptoserver is monitored by another, independent user. If the cryptographic key is determined, a notification of failed integrity is sent to the cryptoserver in operation . The notification can be generated by the user monitoring the cryptoserver. A kill command can be executed by the cryptoserver in operation  upon receiving the indication of failed security integrity, as described below.","Particularly for scenario (c), in which cryptoservers are autonomous or semi-autonomous and trying to self-govern, it is desirable to design a loosely coupled distributed network of cryptoservers that monitor each other's performance. The monitoring can be done by having the cryptoservers themselves act as recommenders or auditors as described elsewhere in this specification. It is possible to have cryptoservers designed to respond to a suitably formatted kill command, which would cause them to delete some or all of their stored keys, for example, and\/or shut down some or all of their functionality. For example, a suitable kill command might need to be signed by a threshold number of other cryptoservers. This protects against routine discovery of a poorly functioning cryptoserver in a decentralized environment. A variation of this scenario can have the cryptoserver audit itself, and issue a kill command if its computations did not pass its verification tests.","While various embodiments have been described above, it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only, and not limitation.
