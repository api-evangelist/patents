The computations may include, but are not limited to, computations of dynamics, statics, equilibrium, mass, inertia, collision detection, collision response, and\/or force fields associated with the system.","Model  may be, for example, a time-based graphical block diagram model, a state transition diagram, a discrete event model, an activity diagram, a Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram, a sequence diagram, a data flow model, or some other type of model or diagram. Model  may represent a system, such as a physical system. Model  may be graphical, textual, or some combination of graphical and textual. The system represented by model  may be dynamic, linear, non-linear, or some other type of system.","A dynamic system (either natural or man-made) may be a system whose response at any given time may be a function of its input stimuli, its current state, and a current time. Such systems may range from simple to highly complex systems. Natural dynamic systems may include, for example, a falling body, the rotation of the earth, bio-mechanical systems (muscles, joints, etc.), bio-chemical systems (gene expression, protein pathways), weather, and climate pattern systems. Examples of man-made or engineered dynamic systems may include, for example, a bouncing ball, a spring with a mass tied on an end, automobiles, airplanes, control systems in major appliances, communication networks, audio signal processing systems, and a stock market.","The system represented by model  may have various execution semantics that may be represented in model  as a collection of modeling elements, often referred to as blocks. A block may generally refer to a portion of functionality that may be used in model . The block may be graphically represented, however, it can be appreciated that the block does not necessarily need to be represented graphically. For example, the block may be represented textually or stored in some form of internal representation. Also, a particular visual depiction used to represent the block, for example in a graphical block diagram, may be an arbitrary design choice.","A block may be hierarchical in that the block itself may comprise one or more blocks that make up the block. A block comprising one or more blocks (sub-blocks) may be referred to as a subsystem block. A subsystem block may represent a subsystem of the overall system represented by the model.","Model  may contain provisions for outputting a plot of data. For example, model  may contain a block (e.g., a scope block) that may output a graph that includes data that is input into the block. The data may be input into the block as one or more data series and the graph may include a plot (e.g., a trend density plot) of some or all of the data contained in the one or more data series.","Interface  may enable, for example, commands, data, code, or other information, to be entered into TCE . Interface  may allow the information to be entered textually and or graphically (e.g., via menus). For example, interface  may be a command line interface that may enable one or more data series to be entered by a user. Interface  may also enable the user to input one or more commands and\/or code that when executed may cause a plot (e.g., a trend density plot) to be generated from the one or more data series and rendered on an output device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIGS. 3A-B","b":["300","300","260","200","136","300","170"]},"Referring now to , data in a first data series include data points -and . The data points -and  are connected in the graph  using a first line. Data in a second data series includes data points -and . These data points are connected in the graph using a second line.","Graph  includes a number of regions, such as regions -. A region may be bounded by one or more boundaries. For example, region is bounded by boundaries and . Likewise, for example, region is bounded by boundaries and . Note that while boundaries are indicated in graph  using lines, boundaries may be indicated in graph  in other ways. For example, boundaries may be indicated using arcs, dots, symbols, and\/or colors. In addition, boundaries may be associated with boundary identifiers, which may be used to uniquely identify the boundaries. Examples of boundary identifiers include lines, colors, shading, universal identifiers (UIDs), and\/or other forms of identifiers that may be used to identify the boundaries.","A location where a boundary meets another boundary may be called a crossover. If a crossover occurs at a data point that is common to the data series, that data point may be called a crossover data point. For example, data point  is common to both the first data series and the second data series and occurs at a crossover. Thus, data point  is an example of a crossover data point.","A region may represent a normalization with respect to one or more boundaries. The normalization may be used as a scale for the region and may be expressed as a percentage. For example, a region may represent a normalization of a number of boundaries that are above or below a certain boundary. The normalization may be expressed as a percentage that may indicate, for example, a percentage of boundaries that are above the boundary or below the boundary.","In , region may represent a normalization with respect to boundaries and . This normalization may be expressed as a percentage of boundaries that are below boundary . Note that boundaries and are between time intervals two through five. The total number of boundaries included within these time intervals is two. Since region includes the area above boundary but below boundary , region may be said to represent fifty percent of the total boundaries that are below boundary ","A percentage associated with a region in a graph may be identified as follows. A point on the x-axis of the graph (x-axis point) may be identified. A total number of boundaries associated with the identified x-axis point may be identified by counting the number of boundaries at an x-axis point. This total may be used as a denominator for identifying the percentage. A numerator may be identified by counting the number of boundaries crossed when following a straight perpendicular line from the x-axis point to a point in the region. The percentage associated with the region may be identified by dividing the numerator by the denominator.","For example, referring again to , suppose the x-axis point is three and the desired region is region . The total number of boundaries at the x-axis point is two. A straight perpendicular line from the x-axis point to region crosses only one boundary, i.e., boundary . Thus, the number of boundaries crossed to reach region from the x-axis is one. The percentage associated with region may be identified by dividing one by two, which yields fifty percent. Thus, it may be said that region represents fifty percent of the total boundaries at x-axis point three.","Note that in , the two data series include data points at x-axis points two through eight. Thus, if the x-axis represented time, it may be said that between x-axis points two through eight, the first data series and the second data series share time intervals.","Also, note that the beginning endpoints of the two data series are not coterminous (non-coterminous). In other words, the beginning endpoints of the two data series begin at different x-axis points. Thus, it may be said that the beginning endpoints are non-coterminous. Likewise, note that the ending endpoints are non-coterminous in that the ending endpoints of the two data series end at the different x-axis points.","If endpoints of data series are non-coterminous, certain accommodations may have to be made to account for this situation. For example, in , the beginning endpoint for the first data series is at x-axis point one and the beginning endpoint for the second data series is at x-axis point two. The total number of boundaries between x-axis point one and x-axis point two is one. On the other hand, between x-axis points two through four, the total number of boundaries is two. If the beginning endpoints for the first data series and the second data series were coterminous, the number of boundaries and number of regions would be the same between x-axis points one through four. However, since the beginning endpoints for the two data series are not coterminous, this situation may be handled, for example, by identifying the total number of boundaries for each x-axis point.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 3A"],"b":"350"},"Referring now to , various patterns are used to indicate the various regions -.

For example, regions -may be identified using sampling intervals -. Specifically, suppose line segment , which stretches between sampling intervals -, represents a boundary. The total number of boundaries between sampling intervals -is one. A straight perpendicular line from the x-axis, between sampling intervals -, to a point in region does not cross any boundaries. Thus, region may be said to represent a region of zero percent of the total boundaries are below region . It may also be said that region represents a region where one-hundred percent of the total boundaries are above region . Likewise, a straight perpendicular line from the x-axis, between sample intervals -, to a point in region crosses the boundary represented by line segment . Since there is only one boundary and that boundary has been crossed to reach the point in region , region may be said to represent a region where one-hundred percent of the total boundaries are below the region . It may also be said that region represents a region where zero percent of the total boundaries are above the region ","This technique may be repeated for other sampling intervals  in order to identify other regions . For example, suppose line segment represents a first boundary and line segment  represents a second (topmost) boundary between sampling intervals -. The total number of boundaries between the sampling intervals -is two. A straight perpendicular line from the x-axis between sample intervals -to a point in region does not cross any boundaries, since the perpendicular line does not cross either line segment or line segment  to reach the point in region . Thus, region may be said to represent a region where zero percent of the total boundaries are below the region and 100 percent of the total boundaries are above the region ","Likewise, for example, a straight perpendicular line from the x-axis, between sample intervals -, to a point in region crosses a single boundary (i.e., boundary represented by line segment ). As noted above, a percentage represented by a region may be identified by dividing the number of boundaries crossed by the total number of boundaries. In this example, the total number of boundaries is two and the number of lines crossed is one, thus, the percentage represented by region may be identified by dividing one by two. In this example, the percentage is fifty percent. Thus, it may be said that region represents a region where fifty percent of the total boundaries are below the region and fifty percent of the total boundaries are above the region ","Further, a straight perpendicular line from the x-axis between sample intervals -to a point in region crosses two boundaries represented by line segments and . The percentage represented by region may be identified by dividing the number of boundaries crossed (i.e., two) by the total number of boundaries (i.e., two).

As can be seen in graph , it may be difficult to spot trends from the data depicted in graph . For example, utilizing graph  it may be difficult to readily discern how often a particular sunspot number for a particular year occurs in the 14-year cycle. Moreover, utilizing graph  it may be difficult to readily discern a trend of average sunspots for a range of years within the 14-year cycle. For example, using graph , it may be difficult to identify the average number of sunspots between years two and eight within the 14-year cycle.","Graph  includes a trend density plot of the data series illustrated in graph . As can be seen in the trend density plot, three distinct regions -may emerge from the data. Region may indicate a density of sunspots that occur above a median number of sunspots reflected in the data. Region may indicate a density of sunspots that occur at a median number of sunspots reflected in the data. Region may indicate a density of sunspots that occur below a median number of sunspots reflected in the data. Also, in the trend density plot, it may be easier to discern an average number of sunspots that may occur, for example, between the years two and eight within the 14-year cycle.","The trend density plot in graph  may be generated using techniques described above. For example, the sunspot data illustrated in graph  may be acquired (e.g., read, received). The acquired sunspot data may be processed to reflect individual 14-year cycles (such as illustrated in graph ). Boundaries may be established based on data contained in the 14-year cycles.
