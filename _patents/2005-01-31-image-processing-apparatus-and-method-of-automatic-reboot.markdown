title: Image processing apparatus and method of automatic reboot
abstract: An image processing apparatus is disclosed that, when falling in failures possibly being fixable by switching off/on electric power, is able to be automatically and appropriately rebooted and does not involve disagreement in counts of different counters used for management actions in the course of rebooting process. The image processing apparatus, which has hardware resources used for image formation and programs used for controlling the image formation, includes a failure detection unit to detect a rebooting failure from type A or D failures which are possibly fixable by switching off/on electric power of the image processing apparatus, and a reboot unit to reboot the hardware resources and the programs. The image processing apparatus may further include an operation halting unit to halt operations of the hardware resources and the programs when the rebooting failure is detected.
