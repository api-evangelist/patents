{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to computerized publication of documents, and more particularly to a method for quickly publishing and censoring information to be incorporated in the documents.","2. Description of the Related Art","In many situations in electronic publishing, it is desirable to quickly publish some news to the outside world while applying a more rigorous censoring and filtering process to other news. A specific example includes Web sites for sporting events. At these Web sites, the latest results from sporting events should be made public to the outside world, immediately. By contrast, background stories written about the event or its participants do not have to be as current. However, such stories must be examined by a censor to make sure that they are correct and appropriate. This may result in considerable delay in publication.","This delay in publication problem has been dealt with by dividing publishable entities into two categories. Entities belonging to the fast category are published immediately. Entities belonging to the slow category are placed on a queue to be examined by one or more censors before publication. This prior art solution may not be acceptable for use with all systems.","Therefore, a need exists for a system and method for generating complex Web pages which result in more flexibility in Web page design and better performance than conventional approaches of treating entire Web pages as single logical entities. A further need exists for a method for permitting a single Web page to include multiple fragments wherein some of the included fragments belong to the fast category and others belong to the slow category.","A method for constructing and publishing a plurality of objects, in accordance with the present invention, includes the steps of providing a plurality of fragments, constructing objects from the plurality of fragments, delaying publication of at least one of the objects, where the at least one of the objects includes at least one fragment belonging to a first class, to examine content, and publishing at least one of the objects including at least one of the fragments belonging to a second class without examining content.","Another method for constructing and publishing a plurality of objects, in accordance with the present invention, includes the steps of providing a plurality of fragments, the fragments including one of immediately publishable information and censorable information, constructing objects from the plurality of fragments, delaying publication until contents of the objects are approved where the objects include at least one fragment including censorable information and immediately publishing the objects including only fragments including immediately publishable information.","In alternate methods, the step of dividing the plurality of fragments into at least two classes may be included. The fragments in the first class may include censorable material, and the fragments in the second class may include immediately publishable material. A compound object may be included with an immediately publishable fragment. The step of delaying publication may further include the steps of, in response to an update to the immediately publishable fragment, updating the compound object after initial construction of the compound object and before the compound object is examined for content to determine whether the compound object is immediately publishable. The methods may further include the step of examining the compound object for content when the compound object is other than immediately publishable. The step of delaying publication may include the step of preventing publication of objects in accordance with the examined content. The step of examining content may be performed in multiple stages. The step of notifying an author of the prevented publication to permit the author to fix inappropriate content of the objects prevented from publication may be included.","A program storage device readable by machine, tangibly embodying a program of instructions executable by the machine to perform method steps for constructing and publishing a plurality of objects, the method steps include receiving a plurality of fragments, constructing objects from the plurality of fragments, delaying publication of the objects where the objects include at least one fragment belonging to a first class, to examine content and publishing the objects including only fragments belonging to a second class without examining content.","In alternate embodiments, the program storage device may implement the step of dividing the plurality of fragments into at least two classes. The fragments in the first class may include censorable material, and the fragments in the second class may include immediately publishable material. The program storage device may receive a compound object including an immediately publishable fragment, and the step of delaying publication may include the step of in response to an update to the immediately publishable fragment, updating the compound object after initial construction of the compound object and before the compound object is examined for content to determine whether the compound object is immediately publishable. The program storage device may include the step of examining the compound object for content when the compound object is other than immediately publishable. The step of delaying publication may include the step of preventing publication of objects in accordance with the examined content. The step of examining content may be performed in multiple stages.","These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of illustrative embodiments thereof, which is to be read in connection with the accompanying drawings.","The present invention includes a system and method for rapid publishing and censoring information, particularly on the World Wide Web. The present invention generates complex Web pages from fragments. This results in more flexibility in Web page design and improved performance over conventional approaches which treat entire Web pages as single logical entities. In accordance with the present invention, a single Web page may include multiple fragments wherein some of the included fragments belong to a fast category and other fragments belong to the slow category.","In the context of Web pages, the present invention updates pages from two or more classes of sources which may include authors and results feeds. A servable is a complete entity which may be published. For example, a Web page could be a servable at a Web site. Authors also create news stories or the like which may be censored and hence may be created as slow fragments. Results feeds deliver up to date results for events and the like, for example sporting events, which should be reported immediately and hence may be created as fast fragments. A fragment is an object which is used to construct a compound object. An object is an entity which can either be published or is used to create something which is publishable. Objects include both fragments and compound objects. A compound object is an object constructed from one or more fragments.","Authors create new versions of Web pages in an area of a system known as a staging area. This is performed by specifying inclusions relationships among compound objects and fragments via a markup language which is then parsed to obtain an object dependence graph. An object dependence graph (ODG) is a directed graph in which nodes\/vertices correspond to objects. ODG's may have one or more types of edges. For example, a dependence edge from a node corresponding to an object \u201ca\u201d terminating in a node corresponding to an object \u201cb\u201d indicates that a change to \u201ca\u201d also affects \u201cb\u201d. The present invention automatically renders pages which the author has specified using the markup language so that the author can view the pages. The present invention does this by applying graph traversal techniques on the ODG to determine an optimal order for constructing the objects. ODG are also described in a commonly assigned disclosure, U.S. Ser. No. 08\/905,114 incorporated herein by reference.","Results feeds are connected to staging. While the author is creating new pages, the author may see new results due to the presence of results feeds.","After the author is satisfied with the content of the pages, the pages are sent to a new area of the system of the present invention known as pre-production. A set of servable Web pages which the author sends is known as a bundle. A bundle is a set of servables. In the system of the present invention, servables belonging to the same bundle may be published together. In pre-production, the bundle is examined by a censor. After the censor approves of all the pages in a bundles the pages are published. Publishing an object (or page) means making it visible to a specific group of people (e.g. the public, one or more editors, one or more censors). Publishing is decoupled from creating or updating an object and generally takes place after the object has been created or updated. If the censor rejects any page in the bundle, the entire bundle may be rejected and may need to be fixed by an author before it can be published.","In a preferred embodiment, a censor should not publish some pages of a bundle and not others because this may violate consistency constraints. It is possible to combine two or more bundles within pre-production. If combining bundles results in multiple versions of the same servable Web page, the latest version replaces all prior versions. The latest results may constantly be fed asynchronously by the results feeds. Fast fragments from results feeds are directly incorporated into servable Web pages which have been published, are awaiting approval from a censor in pre-production and are being rendered by authors in staging. Graph traversal algorithms on the ODG are used to determine objects affected by new results and an optimal order for constructing them.","It should be understood that the elements shown in  may be implemented in various forms of hardware, software or combinations thereof unless otherwise specified. Preferably, these elements are implemented in software on one or more appropriately programmed general purpose digital computers having a processor and memory and input\/output interfaces. Referring now to the drawings in which like numerals represent the same or similar elements and initially to , a block\/flow diagram of a system\/method in accordance with the present invention is shown. Updates to objects occur from at least two types of sources. One type may be immediate object feeds  and another may be censorable object feeds . There may be one or more immediate object feeds . Similarly, there may be one or more censorable object feeds . Immediate object feeds  may include but are not limited to humans, machines, or some combination of humans and machines. Similarly, censorable object feeds  may comprise but are not limited to humans, machines, or some combination of humans and machines.","Censorable object feeds  generally make changes (possibly including object creation or deletion) to objects which are to be proofread by editor(s)  and censor(s)  before the changes can be made public. Immediate object feeds  generally make changes (possibly including object creation or deletion) to objects which should be made public quickly with as few delays as possible. For example, at a sporting event Web site, up-to-date information on who is winning, the latest scores, etc. might be provided by an immediate object feed . Background stories on athletes might be provided by a censorable object feed . Objects coming out of an immediate object feed  are known as immediate objects. Objects coming out of a censorable object feed  are known as censorable objects. More than two types of feeds may also be used. One or more authors  may optionally exist. Authors  may include but are not limited to humans, machines, or some combination of humans and machines. A particular author  may have the ability to create, delete, and modify at least some but not necessarily all objects.","Modifications to objects by authors  are fed through the censorable object feed  or the immediate object feed . The immediate object feed  publishes objects to all stages: staging , pre-production  and production . The censorable object feed  publishes objects only to staging .","While there are several methods for publishing compound objects, a preferred method is described in \u201cMETHOD AND SYSTEM FOR PUBLISHING DYNAMIC WEB DOCUMENTS\u201d, Ser. No. 09\/283,542, filed concurrently herewith, commonly assigned and incorporated herein by reference.","Referring to , a block diagram of a method for rapid publishing and censoring information is shown. In step , one or more authors edit an object or set of objects. Each object which is an immediate object is published using the immediate feed  () to staging , pre-production  and production . Each object which is a censorable object is published through the censorable object feed  () to only staging . In step , censorable objects are bundled by an automated system which identifies dependencies between objects and creates a bundle of objects that must be approved together. It is possible that two or more bundles will need to be combined. If combining bundles results in multiple versions of the same servable, the latest version replaces all prior versions.","In step , one or more editors  () are presented with a list of bundled objects and asked to approve the bundle. The editor(s)  examine the bundle in order to determine if it can be published. The editor(s)  attempts to catch mistakes and prevent objectionable material from being published. If the editor(s)  approves of the bundle, all servables in the bundle are published together in pre-production , in step . If the editor(s)  finds any servables which should not be published, the entire bundle is rejected and the author(s)  is notified in step . The author(s)  can then modify content as needed to fix the problems identified by editor(s) . If this course of action is followed, processing returns to step . The editor  will usually not reject some pages in a bundle but publish the remainder because this could result in the publication of inconsistent information. The cycle just described may be replicated as many times as needed.","Also, depicted in  is a second stage, which moves objects from pre-production  to production . After the object(s) are bundled in step , one or more censors determine whether the objects meet guidelines and approves the bundles for publishing to production in step . If the censor does not approve, the author(s) and\/or editor(s) are notified in step .","One or more immediate object feeds  may cause updates to objects in staging , pre-production , and\/or production  (as depicted in FIG. ). When updates are communicated by an immediate object feed , the system may attempt to propagate the update(s) to objects in staging , objects waiting for censor approval in pre-production , and published objects in production . While there are several methods for updating objects in response to new information from one or more object feeds, the preferred method is to maintain different ODG's corresponding to sets of objects in staging , pre-production , and production . Graph traversal algorithms such as those described in commonly assigned, \u201cMETHOD AND SYSTEM FOR EFFICIENTLY CONSTRUCTING AND CONSISTENTLY PUBLISHING WEB DOCUMENTS\u201d, Ser. No. 09\/283,561, filed concurrently herewith, commonly assigned and incorporated herein by reference, can then be used to identify and update objects affected by new data from object feeds.","Referring to , an alternative embodiment of the present invention is shown.  is similar to FIG. . However, editor  is eliminated in FIG.  and author  supplies input directly to staging . In this embodiment, the author does not provide direct input to the immediate object feed or censorable object feed. Instead, these object feeds come from an external source.","Referring to , a block\/flow diagram of a system\/method for quickly publishing and censoring information is shown. In block , one or more authors edit content. Authors  have the ability to create, delete, and modify at least some but not necessarily all objects. In particular, authors , have the ability to create, delete, and modify some but not necessarily all compound objects which include one or more fragments. Authors  make modifications to objects in an area of the system known as staging . While there are several methods for editing and constructing compound objects, the preferred method is the one described in \u201cMETHOD AND SYSTEM FOR PUBLISHING DYNAMIC WEB DOCUMENTS\u201d, previously incorporated by reference. Any change an author  makes to an object with the exception of merely changing which immediate objects are included and\/or their positions results in a censorable object. If an author  changes which immediate objects are included and\/or their positions within an immediate object \u201co\u201d, \u201co\u201d remains immediate. If an author  changes which immediate objects are included and\/or their positions within a censorable object \u201cp\u201d, \u201cp\u201d remains censorable.","Objects in staging  have the potential to be updated by:\n\n","One or more immediate object feeds  may cause updates to objects in staging , pre-production , and\/or production  (as depicted by the arrows in FIG. ). When updates are communicated by an immediate object feed , the system may attempt to propagate the update(s) to objects in staging , objects waiting for censor approval in pre-production , and published objects in production . While there are several methods for updating objects in response to new information from one or more object feeds, a preferred method is to maintain different ODG's corresponding to sets of objects in staging , pre-production , and production . Graph traversal algorithms such as those described in \u201cMETHOD AND SYSTEM FOR EFFICIENTLY CONSTRUCTING AND CONSISTENTLY PUBLISHING WEB DOCUMENTS\u201d, previously incorporated by reference, can then be used to identify and update objects affected by new data from object feeds.","In accordance with the invention, many advantages are realized by utilizing fragments. Fast and slow fragments may advantageously be combined together on a single Web page, for example. The present invention may be used for publishing and censoring information on the Web as well as outside the Web.","Having described preferred embodiments of a system and method for rapid publishing and censoring information (which are intended to be illustrative and not limiting), it is noted that modifications and variations can be made by persons skilled in the art in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that changes may be made in the particular embodiments of the invention disclosed which are within the scope and spirit of the invention as outlined by the appended claims. Having thus described the invention with the details and particularity required by the patent laws, what is claimed and desired protected by Letters Patent is set forth in the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":["The invention will be described in detail in the following description of preferred embodiments with reference to the following figures wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
