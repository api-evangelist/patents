No. 13\/013,371 filed Jan. 25, 2011, entitled SPARK ARRESTOR FOR PROCESSING RAILROAD RAILS.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a spark arrestor and, more specifically, it relates to a spark arrestor which may be employed in combination with a torch used to process portions of a metal workpiece in the process of cutting, heating or welding the metal workpiece while focusing upon resisting undesired spreading of flames or sparks to adjacent people or material in order to minimize or eliminate the risk of employee burns and fires.","2. Description of the Prior Art","In connection with conventional railroad operations, it is periodically necessary to remove railroad rails which have become worn or otherwise deteriorated and are not serviceable with the degree of safety required. It is conventional to use a cutting torch to cut portions of the upper rail underlying the upper flange approximately every forty feet along the length of the rail.","When cutting rail, the rail is first measured with a measuring wheel 40 feet in length and marked with paint stick, and making a mark thereafter every 40 feet. Then the cutting torch is used to make the cuts. With the tip of the torch pointing straight down on top of the rail head, a cut is started and made directly across the shortest exit out of the other side of the rail head. The cut is made only through the head of the rail and starting into the web of the rail (directly under center of the head) approximately \u00bc of an inch. Total length of this cut is less than 3 inches. It takes less than 15 seconds for an experienced torch man to make the cut.","If the rail is laying on its side, the person operating the cutting torch may choose to cut through \u00bd of the rail head side pointing up about an inch long and \u00bd through the base side pointing up (about 3 inches long) or may cut all the way across the base (about 6 inches long) or all the way across the head, whatever is allowed by the terrain. A cut will be made every 40 feet until the end is reached. All work is performed while using on track transportation, a high rail truck is used to haul the tools needed, and this truck may also be used to travel on railroad access roads to drive along side of the work when conditions are permitting.","The removal of the rail involves a high rail boom truck. This is a straight truck or a tractor trailer (semi) which hauls the rail and has a knuckle boom loader mounted on it to pick up the rail. The boom truck is a straight truck and cannot haul 40 foot rail. It, therefore, must be accompanied by a high rail cart. This cart has a 16-18 foot tow bar which allows it to be far enough from the truck for an overhang of approximately 8-10 feet. The overall picture would be that the cart is about 16 feet in length and an even length will hang over the front as what will hang over the rear of the cart (centered). This truck has remote control operation from the loader seat and can be driven from this seat while on the rail and working. The operator reaches down close to the cut on the rail and lifts approximately 10 to 18 inches until the rail snaps the rest of the way through from the torch cut, then sets it back on the ground and lets loose of it to reposition to load the rail on the cart.","Railroad ties are not replaced in this process. The ties are not fire resistant and are not treated to be fire resistant. They sometimes do catch fire. Sparks and flames may fly up into the tracks.","There is also a need for such a spark arrestor in connection with additional operations wherein a torch emitting flames is employed cut a metal workpiece, as by severing a portion from an elongated piece of the same or to cut openings or make other cuts of the same, or to preheat the workpiece which will be subjected to subsequent processing such as welding, for example.","While prior efforts have been made to deal with this serious problem of flames and sparks, to-date none have provided a successful, economically feasible, technically effective solution.","U.S. Pat. No. 2,911,038 discloses a flexible, self-supporting welding shield which is structured to be placed around the area of activity and resist sparks, flashes and hot particles. The structure includes an inner mesh 5, a pair of fabric elements 2,3 and support elements 10. Fastening rings 7 are provided to secure the elements in the desired position. The structure is not suitable for use in the present invention's environment, as there is no way of providing seals underlying the lower edge of the shield. As a result, sparks and flames could emerge therefrom. Also, there is no way of providing continuity of protection, as there is no position in which a rail could pass through the structure.","Japanese Abstract JP2001239269 discloses a spark shield sheet which is said to be freely bendable and consists of wire gauze 3 in combination with a flame resistant sheet 2 along with metal fittings 4. In the brief English language translation, it is stated that the flame resistant sheet may be folded into a box shape. While this might provide an enclosure of sorts, for reasons stated hereinbefore, it would not be suitable to solve the problem which the present invention has solved in respect of use of a flame torch to cut portions of a railroad rail which are to be removed.","U.S. Pat. No. 2,491,957 discloses a type of shield which is said to be transparent or translucent and is to be positioned over industrial equipment and secured in place by permanent magnets. While it does disclose the concept of shielding of sparks, it is in an industrial environment and provides a shield which would not be suitable for the problem solved by the present invention.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,854,461 discloses a welding shield adapted to reduce the amount of heat to which a welder's hand is exposed.","U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,622,781, 4,178,724 and 5,191,841 relate merely to mobile rail grinding equipment.","In spite of the foregoing disclosures, there remains a very real and substantial need for a spark arrestor capable of effectively resisting flames and sparks emerging from the shield during torch operations on a metal workpiece.","The above described problems have been solved by the present invention which provides a spark arrestor for salvaging railroad rails. An annular body has an upper end wall provided with a first opening and a lower end wall provided with a second opening. The annular body has a pair of generally aligned, circumferentially offset, downwardly open recesses which are structured to receive a portion of a railroad rail. Each of the recesses is operatively associated with a plurality of downwardly extending shield elements which extend downwardly beyond the upper surface of the rail. An opening is provided in the annular body for introduction of a cutting torch into the interior of the spark arrestor. Lateral portions of the annular body disposed between the downwardly open recesses have a second plurality of downwardly depending shield elements which serve to resist passage of flames and sparks thereunder. This results in substantially complete circumferential protection against undesired flame and spark escape from the interior of the spark arrestor during rail cutting operations.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a spark arrestor for use in processing metal workpieces while minimizing undesired escape of flames and sparks.","The spark arrestor structure described in the next proceeding paragraph may also be employed for a wide variety of uses other than railroad rails, in order to resist potential injury or damage to property resulting from sparks or flames created by the torch during the operation on a metal workpiece. For example, an elongated workpiece or plurality of workpieces, such as metal extrusions, said steel rods or any similar articles may be cut by the torch into a plurality of pieces of a desired length by cutting the elongated metal workpiece through the use of the torch. In another embodiment, the torch may be used to cut portions out of a workpiece, such as creating an opening in the workpiece without severing it from the parent stock. It may also be employed advantageously when workpieces are to be preheated.","If desired for certain activities, the spark arrestor may be employed without one or more of the shield elements. While such an embodiment will not provide the extent of protection as occurs with the use of such shield elements, in certain instances such as where the process will be practiced in an area where there is no significant amount of flammable material nearby and there is no great exposure for workers.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide such apparatus which is readily portable and may be moved easily from one rail processing operation to another.","It is yet another object of the present invention to permit direct viewing of the torch through a safety grid in the upper surface of the apparatus during the entry, cutting and removal of the torch.","It is another object of the present invention to substantially reduce or eliminate burn hazards to workmen in the immediate area, and the risk of fire due to vegetation, railroad ties and other materials which could be damaged by exposure to flames or sparks.","It is yet another object of the present invention to provide such a system which is economical to create and employ and does not require extensive training of individuals who will be using the same.","These and other objects of the invention will be more fully understood from the following description of the invention on reference to the illustrations appended hereto.","As employed herein, the term \u201cspark arrestor\u201d means a shield which resists passage of flames or sparks therethrough or thereunder.","As employed herein, the term \u201cprocessing railroad rails\u201d shall include cutting of rails, welding of rails and preheating of rails.","As employed herein, the term \u201cmetal workpiece(s)\u201d means a workpiece which is to be subjected to cutting or welding or preheating action of a torch and shall expressly include, but not be limited to, elongated metal articles which are to be cut into pieces, metal articles which are to have portions removed, metal articles which are to be subjected to further processing.","Referring to , there is shown the apparatus of the present invention  positioned over a railroad rail  which is in its operating position spaced from a parallel railroad rail  by a plurality of railroad ties, such as ,,, for example.","The spark arrestor has a generally annular body with an upper end wall  () and a lower end wall  (). The upper end wall  has a grill  which, in the form shown, has a generally circular exposed portion secured to the upper end wall  which has a generally circular outer configuration, by any suitable means, such as screw fasteners ,,,, for example. The grill  in a preferred form may comprise at least one stainless steel grid. Grill  in the upper end wall  permits one employing the torch in a manner to be described hereinafter, to view the position of the torch with respect to the rail, without exposing himself or herself to the risk of flames or sparks emerging from the upper end wall.","As shown in , a generally vertically oriented, elongated opening  is provided in one of the portions of the annular body , which overlies the rail. This opening  is structured to permit the cutting torch to enter the apparatus overlying the rail  and to be viewed from above through grill  during the cutting operation, In general, the cutting of the rail when it is in a vertical position, as in , will take place through the upper flange which is the head of the rail and through the underlying rail web. If the rail is on its side, the cut will be made at the highest portion of the rail. Cuts will generally be made along the rail about every 40 feet.","As shown generally, the annular body  is substantially hollow. The portion which overlies the rail  has downwardly open recesses for receipt of the rail. This recess has an upper edge  and a pair of depending lateral edges ,, in a portion shown in  and an upper edge  and lateral edges , in the portion shown in . Secured from a portion of the annular body generally overlying the downwardly open recesses , are two shield sections , which have, respectively, a first plurality of shield elements ,. These may be a plurality of individual elements individually secured to the annular body , or to a plate which is secured to the body as in the present case, with reference to plates , as shown in ,  and , or these may be prepared as a curtain which is secured as a unit to the annular body . It is preferred that the shielding elements be metal chains which provide adequate surface areas and contour to effectively resist passage of flame or sparks out of either of the two downwardly open recesses ,. As shown in , the torch entry window  is provided.","The chains may, for example, have twisted links or conventional straight links. In the form shown, the first plurality of shield elements  has a series of generally parallel downwardly extending chain elements which have lengths such that they extend to the underlying rail, uneven earth or ties. They also form an intimate barrier surrounding the rail  to resist passage of sparks or flames between the shield elements and the rail  or between the shield elements and the earth and the ties.","Referring to , consideration will be given to the two lateral sections disposed circumferentially between recesses  and . These have a second plurality of shield members ,, which in the form shown, are the preferably metal chains. These have been secured, respectively, to plates ,, which have been secured by a plurality of screw fasteners, for example, ,, for plate  () with similar securement being employed for plate . The shield members , have a length such that they will contact the underlying rail portions, soil or ties so as to resist passage or sparks or flames thereunder, as well as therethrough. Both the first plurality of shield elements , and the second plurality of shield elements , have the advantage of being flexible so as to assume a custom contour with respect to the underlying adjacent surfaces.","It will be appreciated that in this manner, that substantially continuous circumferential protection is provided in order to resist undesired passage of sparks or flames out of the apparatus during cutting by the cutting torch is achieved. The combination of the two first plurality of shield elements , and the second series of a plurality of shield elements , effectively achieves this objective, even though each pair of pluralities has to deal with two different heights of recess in the annular body .","It will be noted that, for convenience of transport and positioning, the apparatus has a handle  which is secured to body  and is structured to be manually engaged by the individual transporting, positioning and moving the apparatus.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 1","FIG. 6","FIG. 7"],"b":["110","24","110","24","110","113","114","116","118"]},"Referring to , there is seen a type of plate  which is securable to the device  and has a plurality of shield elements ,,, up through n, secured thereto. The total \u201cn\u201d is any desired number of shield elements in a given installation.","It is preferred that the spark arrestor of the present invention be made of a metal selected from the group consisting of steel and stainless steel.","It will be appreciated, therefore, that the present invention has provided an effective, meaningful solution, which in a simple manner greatly reduces or eliminates the safety risk and fire risk involved in processing of railroad rails for purposes of cutting rails for replacement, preheating rails and welding rails.","While for convenience of disclosure, the illustrations and descriptions have focused on spiked rails which are secured in position for cooperating with the railroad ties to provide for the path of movement of a train, the invention is not so limited. It may also be used with unspiked rails which are not spiked to the railroad ties and may be positioned off to the side of the railroad right-of-way.","It will be appreciated that the design of the present invention provides a spark arrestor which is sufficiently light so as to be readily transportable by a workman from operating position to operating position. It is also preferably so designed in terms of weight distribution and contour so as to resist undesired movement due to windy conditions or uneven surfaces underlying the spark arrestor.","It will be appreciated that the present invention may be employed with new construction, as well as salvaging and other operations performed on the rails.","A non-limiting example of a currently preferred dimensional range for the shield is as follows. The overall axial height of the shield will be about 15 to 21 inches and the transverse diameter measured on the exterior will be about 9 to 13 inches. The openings for the rails will each be about 6 to 10 inches wide and will have a height of about 6 to 10 inches. The opening at the upper end will be about 6 to 8 inches across. Preferably, two stainless steel mesh grills, such as , will be provided in the top opening spaced from each other about \u00bd inch and having the patterns slightly offset from each other. The torch window  () will preferably be an opening of about 2 to 4 inches wide and 6 to 8 inches high.","In connection with the use of the spark arrestor for metal workpieces other than railroad rails, essentially the same construction as disclosed and illustrated in  may be employed for a wide variety of metal workpieces. The dimensioning of the spark arrestor may be altered to accommodate the specific environment, the nature and size of the metal workpiece, the process to be performed on the same and the nature of the environment in which it would be employed. For example,  illustrates by way of example, an extruded inverted elongated metal channel  which is to be severed into individual channel elements \u2032 of a predetermined length by a torch which may be introduced through opening , which in this embodiment is positioned on the side of spark arrestor . This embodiment is essentially the same as other embodiments except for the use of a smaller opening  and the absence of the shielding elements. The supporting floor, table or other work surface on which spark arrestor rests will cooperate with the spark arrestor to resist undesired spark or flame escape underneath the spark arrestor.","As shown in , a grill member  is provided on the top of the spark arrestor  to permit safe receipt of the metal workpiece and torch. A first portion \u2032 has been severed from the workpiece. A second portion  of the metal workpiece will emerge from opening . The lower portion of the spark arrestor  is shown resting on a suitable support  which could be a table, a floor or other suitable supporting structure. In this embodiment, the shield elements have not been employed as they were not deemed essential to the safety aspects of the process. In general, however, it will be preferred to employ the shield elements shown in  or a lesser number as desired. For example, the shield elements , () may be used without the lateral shield members , () and vice versa. It will be appreciated that the downwardly open recesses, such as  and the corresponding recess diametrically opposed (not shown in this view) have been sized to accommodate the size workpiece with which the spark arrestor will be employed. If desired, however, a variety of metal workpiece dimensions may be employed with the spark arrestor with the use of the shields serving to resist passage of flames and sparks out of the spark arrestor between the workpiece and the vertical edges defining the downwardly open recess .","It will be appreciated that the present invention is not limited to railroad rails, but may be employed for a wide variety of operations where a torch presenting a potential flame or spark injury to persons and\/or damage to property risk is present. As in , the torch may be employed to severe individual units from an elongaged workpiece or a group of workpieces, such as for example, a plurality of elongated solid steel rods. Also, the torch may be used for cutting openings or recesses in a workpiece, as well as other cutting operations. The torch may be used to preheat a workpiece which will be subejct to subsequent processing.","Whereas particular embodiments of the invention have been described herein for purposes of illustration, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that numerous variations of the details may be made without departing from the invention as described in the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 8"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
