title: Modulation scheme determination through use of multiple sensors
abstract: Various embodiments associated with multiple signal editions is described. A plurality of sensors can be deployed in an environment. These sensors can be used to capture a signal of interest (SOI). However, when the signal is weak or difficult to sense, what an individual sensor captures may be of little value. Therefore, multiple sensors can be used together to capture the signal (e.g., different editions of the SOI). Further, it is possible that the demodulation scheme of the signal is not known, such as when the signal is from an unknown network (e.g., a network of an enemy). A mathematical operation can be performed upon signal editions such that a result does not include noise. This result can be used in determining the demodulation scheme of the signal.

In a singular environment, enemy combatants can each broadcast different signals. It may be possible for one combatant to intercept the signal of another combatant. The intercepting combatant may not know the modulation scheme of an intercepted signal. Without the modulation scheme, it may be difficult to put the intercepted signal to use.","A system comprising a processor and a non-transitory computer-readable medium is described. The non-transitory computer-readable medium is communicatively coupled to the processor and stores computer executable components to facilitate operation of components. The components comprise a calculation component configured to perform a mathematical operation upon a first signal edition and a second signal edition to produce a mathematical result, where performance of the mathematical operation eliminates uncorrelated noise of the first signal edition and the second signal edition through correlation of the first signal edition and the second signal edition, where the first signal edition and the second signal edition are different editions of a signal, where the first signal edition is collected by a first sensor, where the second signal edition is collected by a second sensor, and where the first sensor and second sensor are different sensors. The components also comprise a determination component configured to make a determination on a modulation scheme for the signal based, at least in part, on the mathematical result, where the modulation scheme is employed to demodulate the signal.","In addition, a system comprising a determination component, a demodulation component, and a processor is described. The determination component makes a determination on a modulation scheme of a signal based, at least in part, on a mathematical result derived from performance of a mathematical operation upon the signal, where the signal is obtained from a first receiver and a second receiver and where performance of the mathematical operation produces the mathematical result such that the mathematical result is void of noise. The demodulation component demodulates the signal through use of the modulation scheme, where the signal after demodulation is outputted. The processor executes at least one instruction associated with the determination component or the demodulation component.","Further, a non-transitory computer-readable medium configured to store computer-executable instructions that when executed by a processor cause the processor to perform a method is described. The method comprises calculating a moment for a first signal edition and a second signal edition, where the moment is calculated through use of a product from multiplying at least a first edition of a signal with a second edition of the signal, where the first edition of the signal is collected by a first sensor, where the second edition of the signal is collected by a second sensor, where the first sensor and the second sensor are different sensors, and where the first edition of the signal and the second edition of the signal are non-identical when collected. The method also comprises identifying a constellation of the signal through use of the moment, matching the constellation of the signal with a constellation of a known signal, establishing a modulation scheme associated with the known signal, and using the modulation scheme associated with the known signal to demodulate the signal.","Various sensors (e.g., low-cost sensors) can be used in distributed locations for sensing and classifying weak signals. Automatic modulation classification (AMC) of communication signals is applicable for military applications, cognitive radio applications, etc. The concept of AMC is to classify an unknown modulation scheme by comparing it to hypothetical schemes. Use of higher-order statistics (HOS) is a technique that can be employed in AMC. However, the conventional HOS AMC uses knowledge of the noise power. Thus, it can be beneficial to generate HOS using distributed signal copies so that the noises at distributed sensors are eliminated in HOS calculation to obtain robust features for reliable signal exploitation.","Dynamic spectrum access, adaptive modulation, and low-power transmission can be desired capabilities of cognitive radios which can freely hop through available spectrum and nodes, modify transmission characteristics and waveforms, and exploit opportunities of using the spectrum and power effectively. Sensing the agile signal of interest (SOI) in a dynamic environment with unpredictable adaptations and low transmitting power can occur.","In a non-cooperative communication environment (e.g., no handshaking between transmitters and receivers), a transmitting signal and communication channels are usually not favorable to an ad-hoc receiver or sensing unit and the received signal at the sensor could be weak and distorted so that signal sensing and classification becomes extremely difficult and unreliable. This can be less than ideal in a military, police, or other environment where the communication channels are for an enemy force (e.g., hostage takers) while the ad-hoc receiver is of a friendly force (e.g., police force).","To address the sensing and classification bottleneck, a sensor network can be evaluated. A network centric framework should build interfaces for connecting distributed devices as well as search for unknown dimensions for new capabilities. Two approaches that can be used are the fusion of local signal decisions and the central decision of the fused signals. The former can use expensive distributed processors to make decisions locally and the latter combines multiple signal copies from less-expensive sensors to make a central decision. A central decision modulation classification method can be used based on HOS of distributed signal copies which gives more robust and accurate estimation and classification of SOI comparing with the performance using an individual signal copy alone.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100"]},"The fusion center may be located at the same location as a sensor. The fusion center can send periodic requests to L distributed sensors, R, R, . . . , and Rto acquire a weak SOI. Upon the reception of the request, the distributed sensors take short time duration snapshots of the SOI. The distributed sensors can provide very limited signal processing capabilities such as RF reception and transmission, frequency tuning, filtering, and digitization. Thus, sensors may be asynchronous and non-cooperative to one another and are used for communicating with, or relaying distributed snapshots to, the fusion center. Snapshots are very short and are taken periodically and therefore there can be ample time between any two snapshots for signal processing and analysis. This operation can be conducted in real-time.","Approaches for central decision signal sensing and classification can use and\/or be based on multiple-antenna based modulation classification and use synchronous sensors for coherent signal combining. However, practically, the distributed signal copies will likely not be perfectly synchronous due to the unknown channels and Doppler effect between the SOI and the distributed sensors. In an asynchronous sensor scenario, magnitudes, phases, frequencies, and clocks among sensors can be different. Consequently, there exist the relative phase offset (RPO) induced by different Local Oscillators (LOs), channels and filters, relative time offset (RTO) induced by different propagation paths and sampling clocks, and the relative frequency offset (RFO) induced by different LOs and the Doppler effect before combining the signal copies coherently. The fusion center can be designed to have adequate signal processing power and time to estimate, analyze, and process data delivered by various sensors to generate an enhanced signal for detection, classification and blind demodulation.","If the sensors are dumb sensors, then the sensors can be configured to not make local decisions but store short snapshots, r(t), i=2, 3, . . . , L, as time-stamped data packets and forward them to the fusion center for processing. The packets can be transmitted to the fusion center using a communication method. Without loss of generality, Ris assumed to be the reference sensor, R, R, . . . , and Rare compared to Rfor the relative magnitude, time, frequency, and phase offsets. It can be assumed in this dumb sensor example that the channels have no noticeable change within a very short observation time period T. The signal packets received at the fusion center can be described as\n\n()=\u0394\u03b1()+()\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwhere i=1, 2, . . . , L; \u0394\u03c9and \u0394\u03c4are RFO and RTO, respectively, \u0394\u03b1and \u0394\u03b2, \u0394\u03b1=1 and \u0394\u03b2=0, are the relative magnitude offset (RMO) and RPO which aspects disclosed herein can be practiced without knowing, and n\u02dcN(0,\u03c3), i=1, 2, . . . , L is i.i.d. circularly symmetric complex additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN).

A constellation of a known signal with a highest match to the constellation of the signal can be designated as the matching signal. In the example with cross QAM32, the database can include a known signal that has a constellation of cross QAM32. The classification component  identifies a classification of the matching signal and applies that classification to the signal (e.g., the classification corresponds to a modulation scheme\u2014a signal classified as cross QAM32 has a modulation scheme of \u00d732). The determination component  can determine a demodulation scheme associated with signals of that classification and in turn select the demodulation scheme for the signal. The demodulation component  can then demodulate the signal and output the signal after demodulation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["900","530","910","910","530","910","530","530"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["1000","1010","510","1010","510"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["1100","1010","510","710","710"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["1200","1010","510","710","810","820","810","820"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 13","b":["1300","1010","510","1310","1310"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIG. 14","b":["1400","1010","510","1410","1410","1010"]},"In one embodiment, the synchronization component  comprises a find component configured to find an alignment point between the first signal edition and the second signal edition.
