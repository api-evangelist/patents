{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This application is the national stage application (under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7371) of PCT\/EP2013\/060222 filed May 17, 2013, which claims benefit of German application 102012208530.0 filed May 22, 2012.","The present application relates to novel substituted 2-(piperidin-1-yl)acetamide derivatives, to processes for preparation thereof, to the use thereof for treatment and\/or prevention of diseases, and to the use thereof for production of medicaments for treatment and\/or prevention of diseases, especially for treatment and\/or prevention of cardiovascular diseases.","One of the most important cellular transmission systems in mammalian cells is cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Together with nitrogen monoxide (NO), which is released from the endothelium and transmits hormonal and mechanical signals, it forms the NO\/cGMP system. Guanylate cyclases catalyse the biosynthesis of cGMP from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The representatives of this family known to date can be classified into two groups either by structural features or by the type of ligands: the particulate guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by natriuretic peptides, and the soluble guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by NO. The soluble guanylate cyclases consist of two subunits and contain one haem per heterodimer, which is part of the regulatory centre. This is of central importance for the activation mechanism. NO is able to bind to the iron atom of haem and thus markedly increase the activity of the enzyme. Haem-free preparations cannot, by contrast, be stimulated by NO. Carbon monoxide (CO) is also able to attack at the central iron atom of haem, but the stimulation by CO is much less than that by NO.","By forming cGMP, and owing to the resulting regulation of phosphodiesterases, ion channels and protein kinases, guanylate cyclase plays an important role in various physiological processes, in particular in the relaxation and proliferation of smooth muscle cells, in platelet aggregation and platelet adhesion and in neuronal signal transmission, and also in disorders which are based on a disruption of the aforementioned processes. Under pathophysiological conditions, the NO\/cGMP system can be suppressed, which may lead, for example, to hypertension, platelet activation, increased cell proliferation, endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis, angina pectoris, heart failure, thromboses, stroke and myocardial infarct.","Owing to the expected high efficiency and low level of side effects, a possible NO-independent treatment for such disorders by targeting the influence of the cGMP signal pathway in organisms is a promising approach.","Hitherto, for the therapeutic stimulation of the soluble guanylate cyclase, use has exclusively been made of compounds such as organic nitrates whose effect is based on NO. The latter is formed by bioconversion and activates soluble guanylate cyclase by attacks at the central iron atom of haem. In addition to the side effects, the development of tolerance is one of the crucial disadvantages of this mode of treatment [O. V. Evgenov et al., 5 (2006), 755].","Substances which directly stimulate soluble guanylate cyclase, i.e. without previous release of NO, have been identified in recent years. The indazole derivative YC-1 was the first NO-independent but haem-dependent sGC stimulator described [Evgenov et al., ibid.]. Based on YC-1, further substances were discovered which are more potent than YC-1 and show no relevant inhibition of phosphodiesterases (PDE). This led to the identification of the pyrazolopyridine derivatives BAY 41-2272, BAY 41-8543 and BAY 63-2521. Together with the recently published structurally different substances CMF-1571 and A-350619, these compounds form the new class of the sGC stimulators [Evgenov et al., ibid.]. A common characteristic of this substance class is an NO-independent and selective activation of the haem-containing sGC. In addition, the sGC stimulators in combination with NO have a synergistic effect on sGC activation based on a stabilization of the nitrosyl-haem complex. The exact binding site of the sGC stimulators at the sGC is still being debated. If the haem group is removed from the soluble guanylate cyclase, the enzyme still has a detectable catalytic basal activity, i.e., as before, cGMP is formed. The remaining catalytic basal activity of the haem-free enzyme cannot be stimulated by any of the stimulators mentioned above [Evgenov et al., ibid.].","In addition, NO- and haem-independent sGC activators were identified, with BAY 58-2667 being a prototype of this class. Common characteristics of these substances are that, in combination with NO, they have only an additive effect on enzyme activation, and that the activation of the oxidized or haem-free enzyme is markedly stronger than that of the haem-containing enzyme [Evgenov et al., ibid.; J. P. Stasch et al., 136 (2002), 773; J. P. Stasch et al., 116 (2006), 2552]. It is evident from spectroscopic investigations that BAY 58-2667 displaces the oxidized haem group which, as a result of the weakened iron-histidine bond, is attached only weakly to the sGC. It has also been shown that the characteristic sGC haem-binding motive Tyr-x-Ser-x-Arg is imperative both for interaction of the negatively charged propionic acids of the haem group and for the activity of BAY 58-2667. Against this background, it is assumed that the binding site of BAY 58-2667 to sGC is identical to the binding site of the haem group [J. P. Stasch et al., 116 (2006), 2552].","The compounds described in the present invention are likewise capable of activating the haem-free form of soluble guanylate cyclase. This is also confirmed by the fact that firstly these novel activators display no synergistic effect with NO at the haem-containing enzyme and secondly their action cannot be blocked by the haem-dependent inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase, 1H-1,2,4-oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), but is even potentiated by this inhibitor [cf. O. V. Evgenov et al., 5 (2006), 755; J. P. Stasch et al., 116 (2006), 2552].","Accordingly, it was an object of the present invention to provide novel compounds which act as activators of soluble guanylate cyclase in the manner described above and can be used as such in particular for the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disorders.","WO 94\/12181-A1 discloses substituted aryl compounds as fibrinogen receptor antagonists for the prevention of thromboses and embolisms, and EP 0 638 553-A1 describes carboxamides having a terminal carboxyl group as antithrombotically active compounds. WO 02\/36553-A2 discloses substituted phenylalkanecarboxylic acids as inhibitors of cell adhesion. WO 2006\/066948-A1 describes piperidine derivatives having anti-inflammatory action. EP 1 939 189-A1 claims multicyclic compounds having PPAR-agonistic activity for the treatment of disorders of lipid metabolism. WO 2011\/051165-A1 discloses phenylacetamido-substituted 3-phenylpropionic acids acting as activators of soluble guanylate cyclase.","The present invention provides compounds of the general formula (I)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"44.20mm","wi":"58.67mm","file":"US09309198-20160412-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["Rand Rindependently of one another represent hydrogen, methyl, ethyl or n-propyl\n    \n    ","Rrepresents hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, cyclopropyl, methoxy, ethoxy or cyclopropyloxy,","Rrepresents hydrogen or methyl,","or","Rand Rare attached to one another and together with the carbon atom to which they are attached form a cyclopropyl or cyclobutyl ring,","Rrepresents hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, methyl, trifluoromethyl or ethyl,","Rand Rindependently of one another represent methyl, trifluoromethyl or ethyl\n    \n    ","and","A represents an optionally substituted or fused piperidine ring of the formula"]}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0027"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"15.07mm","wi":"60.79mm","file":"US09309198-20160412-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0005","list-style":"none"},"li":["* denotes the point of attachment to the remainder of the molecule,","Rrepresents hydrogen, (C-C)-alkyl, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, methoxy, ethoxy or phenyl, where (C-C)-alkyl for its part may be substituted up to three times by fluorine,","Rrepresents hydrogen or methyl,","or","Rand Rare attached to one another and together with the carbon atom to which they are attached form a cyclopropyl or cyclobutyl ring,","and","Rrepresents hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, methyl or trifluoromethyl,\n\nand their salts, solvates and solvates of the salts.\n"]}}}},"Compounds according to the invention are the compounds of the formula (I) and their salts, solvates and solvates of the salts, the compounds encompassed by formula (I) of the formulae mentioned below and their salts, solvates and solvates of the salts and the compounds encompassed by formula (I) and mentioned below as working examples, and their salts, solvates and solvates of the salts, if the compounds encompassed by formula (I) and mentioned below are not already salts, solvates and solvates of the salts.","Preferred salts in the context of the present invention are physiologically acceptable salts of the compounds according to the invention.

Particular isotopic variants of a compound according to the invention, especially those in which one or more radioactive isotopes have been incorporated, may be beneficial, for example, for the examination of the mechanism of action or of the active compound distribution in the body; due to comparatively easy preparability and detectability, especially compounds labelled with H or C isotopes are suitable for this purpose. In addition, the incorporation of isotopes, for example of deuterium, can lead to particular therapeutic benefits as a consequence of greater metabolic stability of the compound, for example to an extension of the half-life in the body or to a reduction in the active dose required; such modifications of the compounds according to the invention may therefore in some cases also constitute a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Isotopic variants of the compounds according to the invention can be prepared by generally customary processes known to those skilled in the art, for example by the methods described below and the procedures reported in the working examples, by using corresponding isotopic modifications of the particular reagents and\/or starting compounds therein.","In addition, the present invention also encompasses prodrugs of the compounds according to the invention.

This transformation can optionally be carried out after prior separation of the two cyclization products (VII) and (VIII), or it can advantageously be carried out using excess triethylsilane, directly with the purified product mixture obtained from the cyclization reaction.","Removal of the ester group Tin the process step (VII)\u2192(I-A) is carried out by customary methods by treating the ester in an inert solvent with an acid or a base, where in the latter variant the salt initially formed is converted by subsequent treatment with an acid into the free carboxylic acid. In the case of the tert-butyl esters, ester cleavage is preferably carried out using acids. Benzyl esters are preferably cleaved by hydrogenation (hydrogenolysis) in the presence of a suitable catalyst such as, for example, palladium on activated carbon.","Suitable inert solvents for these reactions are water or the organic solvents customary for ester cleavage. These preferably include alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol or tert-butanol, ethers such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxane or 1,2-dimethoxyethane, or other solvents such as acetone, acetic acid, dichloromethane, N,N-dimethylformamide or dimethyl sulphoxide. It is equally possible to use mixtures of these solvents. In the case of a basic ester hydrolysis, preference is given to using mixtures of water with dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, methanol and\/or ethanol. In the case of the reaction with trifluoroacetic acid, preference is given to using dichloromethane, and in the case of the reaction with hydrogen chloride tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, dioxane, acetic acid and\/or water.","Suitable bases are the customary inorganic bases. These include in particular alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxides, for example lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide or barium hydroxide, or alkali metal or alkaline earth metal carbonates, such as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate or calcium carbonate. Preference is given to lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide.","Suitable acids for the ester cleavage are generally sulphuric acid, hydrogen chloride\/hydrochloric acid, hydrogen bromide\/hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, toluenesulphonic acid, methanesulphonic acid or trifluoromethanesulphonic acid, or mixtures thereof, optionally with addition of water. Preference is given to hydrogen chloride or trifluoroacetic acid in the case of the tert-butyl esters and to hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid in the case of the methyl or ethyl esters.","The ester cleavage is generally carried out in a temperature range of from \u221220\u00b0 C. to +100\u00b0 C., preferably at from 0\u00b0 C. to +60\u00b0 C.","If the ester group Tin (VII) or (VIII) represents tert-butyl, under the conditions of the above-described treatment of (VIII) or the mixture of (VII) and (VIII) with triethylsilane and trifluoroacetic acid there is a simultaneous removal of this ester group so that the compound of the formula (I-A) according to the invention is obtained directly.","If appropriate, compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention can also be prepared by alkylating an \u03b1-aminocarboxylic acid of the formula (IX)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0141"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00013","num":"00013"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00013","he":"21.59mm","wi":"50.29mm","file":"US09309198-20160412-C00013.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":[{},{}],"sup":["4A ","4B "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0142"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00014","num":"00014"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00014","he":"15.92mm","wi":"50.38mm","file":"US09309198-20160412-C00014.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":[{},{}],"sup":["5A ","5B "],"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0021","list-style":"none"},"li":"X represents a suitable leaving group such as, for example, chlorine, bromine, iodine, mesylate, tosylate or triflate,\n\nto give a compound of the formula (XI)\n"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0144"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00015","num":"00015"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00015","he":"26.42mm","wi":"57.57mm","file":"US09309198-20160412-C00015.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":[{},{}],"sup":["4A","4B","5A","5B "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0145"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00016","num":"00016"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00016","he":"27.86mm","wi":"61.55mm","file":"US09309198-20160412-C00016.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":[{},{},{},{}],"sup":["1A","1B","2A","2B ","3 ","1 "],"sub":["1","4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0146"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00017","num":"00017"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00017","he":"49.02mm","wi":"70.27mm","file":"US09309198-20160412-C00017.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":[{},{}],"sup":["1A","1B","2A","2B","3","4A","4B","5A","5B ","1 ","1 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0147"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00018","num":"00018"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00018","he":"49.11mm","wi":"68.24mm","file":"US09309198-20160412-C00018.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["1A","1B","2A","2B","3","4A","4B","5A ","5B "]},"The alkylation reaction (IX)+(X)\u2192(XI) is preferably carried out in water or in mixtures of water with water-miscible organic solvents such as methanol, ethanol, tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxane, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, acetonitrile, N,N-dimethylformamide or dimethyl sulphoxide.
