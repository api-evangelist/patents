{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["PRIORITY","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority to Chinese Patent Application No. 201010515944.4, filed 15 Oct. 2010, and all the benefits accruing therefrom under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119, the contents of which in its entirety are herein incorporated by reference.","The present invention relates to the field of information technology, and more particularly, to a processing method for a device having a bi-stable display and an apparatus.","Recently, bi-stable display technology such as E-ink and E-paper has been employed increasingly. In general, bi-stable display technology is a proprietary material mainly composed of microcapsules and formed in a film so as to be integrated with an electronic display. A current bi-stable display usually supports two colors, namely black and white. Each microcapsule contains positively charged white particles and negatively charged black particles suspended in a clear fluid. When a negative electronic field is applied on the top of the microcapsule, the positive white particles move to the top of the microcapsule where they become visible to the user. At the same time, a positive electronic field is applied at the bottom of the microcapsule such that the black particles move to the bottom of the microcapsule to become invisible. In this way, the screen spots corresponding to this microcapsule appear white. On the contrary, the corresponding screen spots will be black by reversing the electronic field.","Unlike a conventional display which uses backlight to illuminate its pixels, according to the bi-stable display technology, the electronic field is no longer applied when the display is in a stable state and therefore no power is consumed. In other words, the microcapsule in a bi-stable display only consumes power when the display state is updated (from black to white, or from white to black). Therefore, one of the prominent advantages of a bi-stable display lies in maintaining the displayed content continuously without consuming power if the displayed content does not change. In addition, bi-stable display technology such as E-ink mimics the appearance of ink tracks and read effect on ordinary paper, reflects light like ordinary paper, which has less irritation to eyes, and may read directly even in direct sunlight. Due to these advantages, its application on, for example, a mobile device has attracted much attention from both consumers and manufacturers. For example, many E-ink-based portable read devices have been unveiled in the market (e.g., Amazon Kindle, among others).","Considering that a mobile portable device is generally powered by a battery with limited duration, further reducing the power consumption of a bi-stable display is a valuable concern. For a portable device having a bi-stable display, most of the power is consumed by the display screen. As above mentioned, a bi-stable display only consumes power when the screen is updated. Therefore, prior art solutions of power saving for bi-stable displays share a common idea of comparing the overlapped portion between contents on two pages when displaying page shift, and the electronic field is not applied to the microcapsules corresponding to the screen spots with no need to be updated. However, prior art solutions are completely passive in that the power saving is entirely dependent on the overlap degree between contents of two successive pages. When two successive pages are significantly different from one another, the effect of power saving will be poor.","In one embodiment, a processing method for a device having a bi-stable display includes transforming a target page to be turned to; calculating overlap between the transformed target page and a current page; and determining whether the overlap of the transformed page complies with a predetermined criterion.","In another embodiment, a processing apparatus for a device having a bi-stable display includes a transforming module configured to transform a target page to be turned to; a calculating module configured to calculate overlap between the transformed target page and a current page; and a determining module configured to determine whether the overlap of the transformed page complies with a predetermined criterion.","Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described only by way of example, with reference to in the accompanying figures. It shall be understood that the shown and described embodiments are merely exemplary, intended to explain the principle and sprit of the present invention, rather than limiting the scope of the invention.","Referring to , a basic principle of the present invention is briefly shown. As shown, it is assumed that the first page is the current page whose content is an English letter \u201cO\u201d, and the second page is target page to be shown whose content is an English letter \u201cQ\u201d. It is further assumed that the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the centers of these two letters differ from each other by one coordinate unit, respectively. According to prior art solutions, several screen spots need to be updated when turning from the first page to the second, even though these two letters are very similar. This is because the overlap between these two letters is relatively small.","On the contrary, according to embodiments of the present invention, when turning pages, contents on the second page will be subjected to a series of transformations (as described in detail below), and calculating an overlap between the first and second pages after each transformation. Continuing to consider the scenario as shown in , it can be determined from calculation that the overlap between the two pages is maximized when the content of the second page is moved to origins of coordinates in both X and Y directions by one unit, respectively. At this point, the number of screen spots required to be updated is the least (highlighted ones as shown in the figure). In particular, taking each coordinate square in  as unit, there are 43 units required to be updated without utilizing the solution according to the present invention, while there are merely 5 units to be updated when utilizing the solution of the invention (highlighted in the figure). That is, in this case, the screen spots required to be updated is reduced by about 88% by using embodiments of the present invention. By displaying to the user the transformed second page, the number of screen sports to be updated is significantly decreased. Thereby, the power is saved efficiently.","Of course, it can be understood that in this scenario, the content of the second page will change in appearance. However, the crucial bottleneck of bi-stable display is how to reduce the amount of update, and therefore saving power. To this end, it is acceptable to sacrifice display effects (e.g., level of beauty) somewhat, as long as the user reading experience is not affected significantly. In addition, embodiments of the present invention enable automatic or interactive tradeoff between the power saving and display effects, as described below.","Now referring to , a flowchart of a processing method  for a device having bi-stable display according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described.","After the method  starts, at block S, a target page to be turned to is transformed. In various embodiments of the present invention, the transformation may be performed either to the entire target page, or to a portion of content items contained in the target page. In addition, various kinds of transformations may be performed, including but not limited to affine transformation like shift, rotation, and scaling, and the transformations specific to content items contained in the target page, which will be described below with reference to .","It is noted that there may be more than one target page in block S. For example, for an electronic reading like an E-book, a common reading habit is to read from page to page sequentially. In this case, the target page is usually the next one to the currently displayed page. At this point, not only the successive target page may be considered, but also method  may be performed with respect to a plurality of consecutive pages. As such, response time of interaction may be further reduced, thereby improving user experience. This will be further discussed below.","Moreover, based upon the habit of sequential reading, in some embodiments, the page next to the current page may be predetermined as the target page in default. In such embodiments, block S and subsequent operations of the method  may be performed during the display of the current page. The results may be stored in a cache for future use. In this way, the processed and cached target page may be displayed immediately after the user initiates a page turning, such that the time amount required to turn pages may be reduced while improving the effect of power saving. In addition, block S and subsequent operations of the method  may also be performed before a user starts to read the current page, and the processed results may be cached for future use.","In some embodiments, user is also allowed to indicate the specific target page interactively, which may be any page in the electronic reading. In this case, block S may be performed in response to the indication of turning to a target page.","Next, at block S, the overlap between the transformed page and the current page is calculated. In some embodiments, a page may be treated as an image to process, and the overlap between two pages may be calculated using any existing or future developed algorithm for image comparison. In an exemplary embodiment, the overlap between the current page and the target page may be determined by performing an exclusive or (XOR) operation on the display value of the corresponding screen spots. Since an XOR operation is supported by most processors, such embodiment may be practiced either in software or in hardware. Experiments show that when an XOR operation is utilized to calculate the overlap between pages, the consumed resources and time will not affect user reading experience significantly. Other methods for calculating overlap are possible as well.","At block S, it is determined whether the overlap of the transformed page complies with a predetermined criterion. As described above, during a series of transformations on the target page, the overlap between the transformed page and the current page will be calculated after each transformation. After all of the predetermined transformations are completed, for the plurality of resulting overlaps, it can be determined whether each overlap complies with a predetermined criterion. Then, a transformed target page corresponding to the overlap complying with the predetermined criterion may be determined. This transformed target page may be presented to the user thereafter. It shall be noted that the term \u201ctransformed target page\u201d should be interpreted in a broad sense, i.e., also including the original target page (which may be interpreted as being performed a zero transformation). In other words, if it is determined from comparison that the non-transformed page complies with the predetermined criterion most, then the non-transformed page may be determined and presented to the user.","In some embodiments, the predetermined criterion in block S is related to the amount of the overlap. Apparently, the number of screen spots to be updated will decrease with the increase of overlap amount between two pages. Therefore, when the overlap amount between two pages is maximized, the number of screen spots to be updated is minimized, with the best power saving effect.","On the other hand, while increasing the overlap between two pages, it might be required to transform the target page greatly. However, too great transformation may overwhelmingly affect the display effect (e.g., beauty, read-friendly, or even legibility), which in turn dampens user experience. Therefore, in some embodiments, the above described predetermined criterion is also related to the page display effect. For example, in order to guarantee a certain display effect, transformation on the target page may be constrained (for example, the type of transformation, allowable maximum amount, etc), so as to avoid excessive transformation of the page display effect. In some embodiments, the transformations on the target page may be constrained based upon rules, which rules are used to ensure the page display effect. For example, the rules may specify the allowable types of transformations, and the upper limit of transformation amounts (e.g., the maximum number of pixels for shift, the maximum angle for rotation, the maximum displacement or deformation of a content item, etc). The rules may be predetermined by the device or in default, or set and modified by the user.","In addition, the predetermined criterion in block S may be related to the status of the device, for example, whether the device is connected to an external power source, the remaining battery power, etc. For example, when the device is powered by an external power source, or the battery power is sufficient, it may be reputed that the power consumption is not a crucial problem for the device. At this point, the predetermined criterion may be inclined to maintaining a better presentation effect, rather than simply maximizing the overlap amount. For example, in some embodiments, by setting the predetermined criterion appropriately, it is possible to decrease the allowable maximum values of transformations or even forbid transformation of the target page, so as to keep the original appearance to the utmost.","On the other hand, when the device is powered by a battery, with the decrease of battery power, power consumption becomes increasingly remarkable. In this event, the predetermined criterion may be adjusted dynamically so as to gradually sacrifice the display effect to improve power saving. For example, with the decrease of power, it is possible to gradually increase the allowed maximum values of transformations by setting the predetermined criterion appropriately, thereby reducing the number of screen spots to be updated. In some embodiments, when power saving is very crucial (for example, when the battery power is very low), the predetermined criterion may be selected such that the overlap amount between pages is maximized and thus the power is saved to the utmost.","It can be understood that the above description merely presents several exemplary factors related to the predetermined criterion. According to specific requirements and application environments, a skilled in the art is able to determine other factors affecting the predetermined criterion. In addition, the setting and modification of the predetermined criterion may be performed automatically by the device, or interactively by the user. For example, the device may provide the user with several options regarding the predetermined criterion via a user interface. For example, the device may allow the user to select whether to enable or disable the method . The user is also enabled to handle the tradeoff between the power saving and display effects by, for example, providing the user with options like \u201cdisplay effect preferred\u201d, \u201cpower saving preferred\u201d, etc. Moreover, interactive controls like a sliding bar or a slider may be provided to allow the user to gradually control the power saving, with keeping original page appearance and maximizing the overlap as two extreme endpoints. For another example, the user is allowed to control the maximum allowable values of the transformations.","Moreover, as described above in conjunction with block S, there may be more than one target page. In this case, \u201ccomplying with the predetermined criterion\u201d in block S may comprise a total overlap for a plurality of pages complying with the predetermined criterion. For example, if the target pages include N consecutive pages, then for each target page n, page n\u22121 is treated as the current page. The total overlap complying with the predetermined criterion may comprise: the total power consumption of these N consecutive pages being minimized in page turning (globally best). This embodiment is especially advantageous for an e-book whose contents are relatively fixed. As described above, the user usually reads the e-book sequentially, and the contents on each page may be known in advance. Therefore, according to embodiments of the present invention, the optimized display mode for turning a plurality of pages sequentially may be determined.","The method  ends after block S. By processing the target page according to the exemplary method  of the present invention, the overlap between the target page and the current page may be increased in an active manner, so as to achieve better performance of power saving while preserving the display effect.","Now exemplary embodiments of transforming the target page will be further explained with reference to . The method  shown in  may be performed as part of block S of the method  shown in .","After the method starts, at block S, affine transformation may be performed on the entire target page. As known in the art, the affine transformation comprises shift, rotation, and scaling. As an example, Table 1 as follows shows codes written in MATLAB\u00ae for shifting the target page and calculating the overlap. In this example, the entire target page is moved upwards, downwards, left, and right directions in pixel. The maximum of shift is defined by MaxShift (for example, in pixel).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"y=xor(x1,x2);\u2003\u2003% determining overlap between two pages, x1 and x2"},{"entry":"which represent two pages"},{"entry":"z=sum(y(:));\u2003\u2003% summarizing the number of pixels to be changed"},{"entry":"n=MaxShift;\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003% shifting along four directions by MaxShift pixels"},{"entry":"ratio = zeros(n*2+1,n*2+1);"},{"entry":"for i=\u2212n:n"},{"entry":"for j=\u2212n:n"},{"entry":"x3=circshift(x2,[i j]);\u2003\u2003% generating page x3 by shifting"},{"entry":"the page along four directions"},{"entry":"y=xor(x1,x3);"},{"entry":"z1=sum(y(:));\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003% summarizing number of pixels to"},{"entry":"be updated after shifting"},{"entry":"ratio(i+n+1, j+n+1) = z1\/z;\u2003% ratio of numbers of pixels to"},{"entry":"be updated before and after shifting"},{"entry":"end"},{"entry":"end"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"As described above in conjunction with , after shifting the page each time, the overlap between the current and target pages may be calculated and recorded. Thereafter, the shift that most complies with the predetermined criterion (e.g., maximizing the overlap) can be determined by comparing the calculated overlaps. In experiments, the MaxShift as shown in Table 1 is set to 10 (in pixels). Experiments on the pages extracted randomly show that the overlap amount of two pages will increase about 18% in average by merely globally shifting the target page.","Rotation and scaling may be performed similarly. By block S, global transformation is applied on the target page.","At block S, affine transformation may be performed on content items contained in the target page. Content items for example may include one or more of texts, lines, paragraphs, images, or pre-defined portions. It can be understood that these are merely examples of content items. In fact, at step S, affine transformations may be performed on any content item and element to be displayed as contained in the target page.","Specifically, information on the content items like texts, lines, paragraphs, and images contained in the target page may be obtained in various ways. For example, most of E-ink readers' devices provide Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for acquiring information on display contents. Such APIs may be used to access the information related to display contents, including positional information on the screen, presentation information, editing information, etc. By block S, fine tuning like shifting, rotation and\/or scaling may be carried out to partial regions of the target page, thereby further increasing the possibility of the overlap complying with the predetermined criterion.","At block S, the typesetting of the target page is transformed. Typesetting includes, but not limited to, alignment of texts and pictures, font, surrounding pattern of texts and pictures, line spacing, word spacing, etc. Other typesetting transformations are possible as well.","Specifically, transforming font may include changing the font family, for example, from \u201cArial\u201d to \u201cTimes New Roman\u201d. In some embodiments, transforming font may also include customized transformations to a certain font family. Referring to -for example, and show two English letters \u201cN\u201d and \u201cM\u201d in normal Arial, respectively. shows an English letter \u201cM\u201d in transformed Arial. Assume that the letter \u201cN\u201d is displayed on the current page, and the letter \u201cM\u201d is displayed on the target page. Experiments using an ordinary bi-stable display show that through such customized font transformation, the number of screen spots to be updated is reduced from 4178 to 2571, approximately 40%. Such customized font transformations may be performed for example based upon predetermined rules or by dynamic programming (the calculation complexity in dynamic programming is relatively great).","It can be understood by a skilled in the art that -are merely intended to be illustrative, rather than limiting the scope of the invention. For example, the above described font family changes and customized font transformations are applicable to any language other than English as well.","The method  ends after block S. According to the method , the target page is firstly transformed as a whole (block S); then local transformations are performed on content items (block S); and finally fine tunings are implemented by changing the typesetting (block S). However, it can be understood that the method  is merely illustrative in that various steps may be performed in different order or omitted, or additional steps may be added. For example, some transformations may be enabled, while others may be disabled. As an example, based upon user's preference or instruction, the device may only allow performing global transformation on the target page while disabling transformations on content items. Alternatively, some types of transformations may be allowed, while the other types are disabled. In addition, the maximum allowable value for each transformation may be set or modified based upon various factors as described above.","Further, the method  involves different transformations on the target page, and the transformed results may be combined in various ways. For example, in some embodiments, the method  may be performed in a \u201cgreedy\u201d manner (localized optimization). That is, in each operation, the transformation is selected such that the overlap complies with the predetermined criterion most. Alternatively, the method  may be performed based upon \u201cdynamic programming\u201d (global optimization). That is, the transformations are selected such that the total overlap complies with the predetermined criterion most. Other ways for combing transformation results are possible as well.","It should be particularly emphasized that though a certain amount of system resources and calculation time will be consumed by the operations such as transformation, calculation, and determination in the methods shown in , Experiments show that such consumption will not cause a new system bottleneck or significantly dampen user experience.","In addition, though the above calculations consume a certain amount of power, the power consumption required for numerical calculation is relatively small since most power consumption comes from screen updates for a display based upon the bi-stable technology, as described above or known in the art. Therefore, compared with the additional power consumption, the power saving effect capable of being provided by this invention is dominant.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIGS. 5","FIGS. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIGS. 5"],"i":["a","d ","a ","b ","c ","d ","a","d"],"b":["5","5","5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","610","620","630"]},"The transforming module  is for transforming a target page to be turned to.
