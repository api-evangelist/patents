Salts","Salts of compounds described above can be used in the disclosed methods. If a compound has, for example, at least one basic center, it can form an acid addition salt. These are formed, for example, with strong inorganic acids, such as mineral acids, for example sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid or a hydrohalic acid, with strong organic carboxylic acids, such as alkanecarboxylic acids of 1 to 4 carbon atoms which are unsubstituted or substituted, for example, by halogen, for example acetic acid, such as saturated or unsaturated dicarboxylic acids, for example oxalic, malonic, succinic, maleic, fumaric, phthalic or terephthalic acid, such as hydroxycarboxylic acids, for example ascorbic, glycolic, lactic, malic, tartaric or citric acid, such as amino acids, (for example aspartic or glutamic acid or lysine or arginine), or benzoic acid, or with organic sulfonic acids, such as (C1-C4) alkyl or arylsulfonic acids which are unsubstituted or substituted, for example by halogen, for example methyl- or p-toluene-sulfonic acid. Corresponding acid addition salts can also be formed having, if desired, an additionally present basic center. Compounds having at least one acid group (for example COOH) can also form salts with bases. Suitable salts with bases are, for example, metal salts, such as alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts, for example sodium, potassium or magnesium salts, or salts with ammonia or an organic amine, such as morpholine, thiomorpholine, piperidine, pyrrolidine, a mono, di or tri-lower alkylamine, for example ethyl, tert-butyl, diethyl, diisopropyl, triethyl, tributyl or dimethyl-propylamine, or a mono, di or trihydroxy lower alkylamine, for example mono, di or triethanolamine. Corresponding internal salts can furthermore be formed. Salts which are unsuitable for pharmaceutical uses but which can be employed, for example, for the isolation or purification of free compounds or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, are also included. In some embodiments salts of compounds which contain a basic group include monohydrochloride, hydrogensulfate, methanesulfonate, phosphate or nitrate. In some embodiments salts of compounds which contain an acid group include sodium, potassium and magnesium salts and pharmaceutically acceptable organic amines.","In some embodiments the salts are pharmaceutically acceptable (e.g., non-toxic, physiologically acceptable) salts. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts retain at least some of the biological activity of the free (non-salt) compound and which can be administered as drugs or pharmaceuticals to an individual. Such salts, for example, include: (1) acid addition salts, formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like; or formed with organic acids such as acetic acid, oxalic acid, propionic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid and the like; (2) salts formed when an acidic proton present in the parent compound either is replaced by a metal ion, e.g., an alkali metal ion, an alkaline earth ion, or an aluminum ion; or coordinates with an organic base. Acceptable organic bases include ethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine and the like. Acceptable inorganic bases include aluminum hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, and the like. Further examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those listed in Berge et al., Pharmaceutical Salts, 1977 January; 66(1):1-19. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be prepared in situ in the manufacturing process, or by separately reacting a purified compound in its free acid or base form with a suitable organic or inorganic base or acid, respectively, and isolating the salt thus formed during subsequent purification. It should be understood that a reference to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt includes the solvent addition forms or crystal forms thereof, particularly solvates or polymorphs. Solvates contain either stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts of a solvent, and are often formed during the process of crystallization. Hydrates are formed when the solvent is water, or alcoholates are formed when the solvent is alcohol. Polymorphs include the different crystal packing arrangements of the same elemental composition of a compound. Polymorphs usually have different X-ray diffraction patterns, infrared spectra, melting points, density, hardness, crystal shape, optical and electrical properties, stability, and solubility. Various factors such as the recrystallization solvent, rate of crystallization, and storage temperature may cause a single crystal form to dominate.","Therapeutic Methods","In addition to the breast cancer indications discussed below and the therapeutic indications disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,709,517; US 2011\/0003839; WO 2010\/118354; WO 2011\/044327; and WO 2010\/099238, compounds of Formulae (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), and (VI) can be used to treat androgen receptor related diseases or conditions such as benign prostate hyperplasia, hair loss, and acne. These and related compounds may also be useful as modulators of other nuclear receptors, such as glucocorticoid receptor, estrogen receptor, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, and as therapeutic agents for diseases in which nuclear receptors play a role, such as breast cancer, ovarian cancer, diabetes, cardiac diseases, and metabolism related diseases.","\u201cTreating\u201d or \u201ctreatment\u201d as used herein is an approach for obtaining a beneficial or desired result, including, but not limited to, relief from a symptom, lessening of a symptom, and preventing a worsening of a symptom associated with the disease being treated. Treatment also includes, but is not limited to, any one or more of enhancing survival time, enhancing progression-free survival time, and reducing tumor size.","1. Breast Cancers","Compounds can be used to treat various forms of breast cancer, whether or not the breast cancers express androgen receptors or estrogen receptors. Breast cancers that can be treated include, but are not limited to, basal-like breast cancer, BRCA1-related breast cancer, medullary breast cancer, metaplastic breast cancer, special histologic type of breast cancer, triple negative breast cancer, and breast cancer resistant to endocrine therapy.","In some embodiment, patients to be treated are post-menopausal. In other embodiments patients to be treated are pre-menopausal. In other embodiments patients to be treated are peri-menopausal. In some embodiments patients to be treated are men.","In some embodiments breast cancers are ER+ (i.e., 1% or more of the cells tested express ER detectable by immunocytochemistry). In some embodiments, breast cancers contain cells that demonstrate estradiol-mediated growth. In some embodiments patients to be treated have no detectable circulating levels of estradiol. In some embodiments patients to be treated have circulating levels of estradiol greater than 10 pmol\/L. In some embodiments patients to be treated have circulating levels of estradiol less than 10 pmol\/L. In some embodiments estradiol levels are measured by a double-antibody procedure as described in Cummings et al., 287, 216-20, 2002.","i. Triple Negative Breast Cancer","In some of embodiments the breast cancer is a triple negative breast cancer including, but not limited to, subtypes of triple negative breast cancer such as of basal-like type 1 (BL1), basal-like type 2 (BL2), immunomodulatory (IM), mesenchymal (M), mesenchymal stem-like (MSL), and luminal androgen receptor (LAR) subtypes. \u201cTriple negative breast cancer\u201d as used herein is characterized by lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and lack of overexpression or amplification of Her2neu. A tumor is negative for expression of ER or PR if fewer than 1% of the cells tested are positive for ER or PR, as measured by immunohistochemistry, and if the Her2 gene is not expressed (for example, amplification is not detected by FISH). Triple negative breast cancer is clinically characterized as more aggressive and less responsive to standard treatment and is associated with poorer overall patient prognosis. It is diagnosed more frequently in younger women and in women with BRCA1 mutations.","In some embodiments a triple negative breast cancer is AR+; i.e., it contains cells that express detectable androgen receptors as detected by immunohistochemistry, ligand binding, or other methods known in the art. In other embodiments a triple negative breast cancer is AR\u2212.","ii. ER+ Breast Cancer Resistant to Endocrine Therapy","Approximately 75% of breast cancers express the estrogen receptor (ER) and are candidates for endocrine therapy. The selective ER modulator tamoxifen is the most commonly prescribed endocrine therapy; however, approximately 30 percent of tumors that retain estrogen (ER) do not respond to estrogen\/ER directed therapies such as tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors (AI) and nearly all patients with metastatic disease develop resistance. In such patients, a compound can provide a therapeutic intervention.","In some embodiments the breast cancer is ER+, i.e., it contains detectable levels of estrogen receptor, measured as described above, but is resistant to endocrine therapy. \u201cEndocrine therapy\u201d as used herein includes administration of one or more aromatase inhibitors (e.g., anastrozole, exemestane, letrozole) and\/or administration of one or more estrogen receptor modulators (e.g., tamoxifen, raloxifen, fulvestrant). \u201cResistant to endocrine therapy\u201d as used herein means that the tumors (primary or metastases) do not respond to one or more of the above treatments by shrinking, but rather remains the same size or increases in size, or that recur in response to such treatment at any time in the patient's livespan.","In some embodiments the breast cancer is ER+\/AR+. In some embodiments the breast cancer is ER+\/AR\u2212. In some embodiments the breast cancer contains cells that are progesterone receptor positive (PR+) as detected by immunohistochemistry or ligand binding assays or any other method of detection. In some embodiments the breast cancer contains no detectable cells with progesterone receptors; e.g., the breast cancer is progesterone receptor negative (PR\u2212). In some embodiments a breast cancer contains cells that are Her2 positive (Her2+) as detected by observable Her2 gene amplification after in situ hybridization. In some embodiments a breast cancer contains no detectable cells with amplification or expression or overexpression of Her2; e.g., the breast cancer is Her2 negative (Her2\u2212). The progesterone receptors and Her2 can be present on the same or different populations of cells, which may be the same or different as the populations of cells expressing ER and\/or AR.","In some embodiments a breast cancer is identified as AR+, ER+, and Her2+. In some embodiments a breast cancer is identified as AR+, ER+, and PR+. In some embodiments a breast cancer is identified as AR+, ER+, Her2+, and PR+. In some embodiments a breast cancer is identified as AR\u2212, ER+, and Her2+. In some embodiments a breast cancer is identified as AR\u2212, ER+, and PR+. In some embodiments a breast cancer is identified as AR\u2212, ER+, Her2+, and PR+. In some embodiments, a breast cancer is identified as AR+, ER\u2212, HER2+, PR\u2212.","2. Pharmaceutical Compositions","Compounds can be formulated in any type of pharmaceutical composition known in the art, including, but not limited to, tablets, troches, pills, capsules, syrups, elixirs, injectable solutions, and the like.","A pharmaceutical composition typically includes a pharmaceutically or pharmacologically acceptable excipient or carrier. As used herein, by \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable\u201d or \u201cpharmacologically acceptable\u201d is meant a material that is not biologically or otherwise undesirable, e.g., the material may be incorporated into a pharmaceutical composition administered to a patient without causing any significant undesirable biological effects or interacting in a deleterious manner with any of the other components of the composition in which it is contained. In some embodiments pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients have met the required standards of toxicological and manufacturing testing and\/or are included on the Inactive Ingredient Guide prepared by the U.S. Food and Drug administration.","The term \u201cexcipient\u201d as used herein means an inert or inactive substance that may be used in the production of a drug or pharmaceutical, such as a tablet containing a compound as an active ingredient. Various substances may be embraced by the term excipient, including without limitation any substance used as a binder, disintegrant, coating, compression\/encapsulation aid, cream or lotion, lubricant, solutions for parenteral administration, materials for chewable tablets, sweetener or flavoring, suspending\/gelling agent, or wet granulation agent. Binders include, e.g., carbomers, povidone, xanthan gum, etc.; coatings include, e.g., cellulose acetate phthalate, ethylcellulose, gellan gum, maltodextrin, enteric coatings, etc.; compression\/encapsulation aids include, e.g., calcium carbonate, dextrose, fructose dc (dc=\u201cdirectly compressible\u201d), honey dc, lactose (anhydrate or monohydrate; optionally in combination with aspartame, cellulose, or microcrystalline cellulose), starch dc, sucrose, etc.; disintegrants include, e.g., croscarmellose sodium, gellan gum, sodium starch glycolate, etc.; creams or lotions include, e.g., maltodextrin, carrageenans, etc.; lubricants include, e.g., magnesium stearate, stearic acid, sodium stearyl fumarate, etc.; materials for chewable tablets include, e.g., dextrose, fructose dc, lactose (monohydrate, optionally in combination with aspartame or cellulose), etc.; suspending\/gelling agents include, e.g., carrageenan, sodium starch glycolate, xanthan gum, etc.; sweeteners include, e.g., aspartame, dextrose, fructose dc, sorbitol, sucrose dc, etc.; and wet granulation agents include, e.g., calcium carbonate, maltodextrin, microcrystalline cellulose, etc.","Tablets, troches, pills, capsules, and the like can also contain the following: binders such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid and the like; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, fructose, lactose or aspartame or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry flavoring can be added. When the unit dosage form is a capsule, it can contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier, such as a vegetable oil or a polyethylene glycol. Various other materials can be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the solid unit dosage form. For instance, tablets, pills, or capsules can be coated with gelatin, wax, shellac or sugar and the like. A syrup or elixir can contain the active compound, sucrose or fructose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. Of course, any material used in preparing any unit dosage form should be pharmaceutically acceptable and substantially non-toxic in the amounts employed. In addition, a diarylhydantoin compound can be incorporated into sustained-release preparations and devices. For example, a compound can be incorporated into time release capsules, time release tablets, and time release pills.","Pharmaceutical dosage forms suitable for injection or infusion can include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions or sterile powders comprising a compound which are adapted for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable or infusible solutions or dispersions, optionally encapsulated in liposomes. The ultimate dosage form typically is sterile, fluid, and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The liquid carrier or vehicle can be a solvent or liquid dispersion medium comprising, for example, water, ethanol, a polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and the like), vegetable oils, nontoxic glyceryl esters, and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the formation of liposomes, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions or by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, isotonic agents are included, for example, sugars, buffers or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.","Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating a compound in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filter sterilization. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, methods of preparation include vacuum drying and freeze drying techniques, which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient present in the previously sterile-filtered solutions.","Useful solid carriers include finely divided solids such as talc, clay, microcrystalline cellulose, silica, alumina and the like. Other solid carriers include nontoxic polymeric nanoparticles or microparticles. Useful liquid carriers include water, alcohols or glycols or water\/alcohol\/glycol blends, in which a compound can be dissolved or dispersed at effective levels, optionally with the aid of non-toxic surfactants. Adjuvants such as fragrances and additional antimicrobial agents can be added to optimize the properties for a given use. The resultant liquid compositions can be applied from absorbent pads, used to impregnate bandages and other dressings, or sprayed onto the affected area using pump-type or aerosol sprayers.","Thickeners such as synthetic polymers, fatty acids, fatty acid salts and esters, fatty alcohols, modified celluloses or modified mineral materials can also be employed with liquid carriers to form spreadable pastes, gels, ointments, soaps, and the like, for application directly to the skin of the user.","Examples of useful dermatological compositions which can be used to deliver a compound to the skin are known to the art; for example, see Jacquet et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,608,392), Geria (U.S. Pat. No. 4,992,478), Smith et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,559,157) and Wortzman (U.S. Pat. No. 4,820,508).","In some embodiments the pharmaceutical composition is a unit dosage form. As used herein, \u201cunit dosage form\u201d is a physically discrete unit containing a predetermined quantity of active.","3. Dosages","As used herein, the term \u201ceffective amount\u201d intends such amount of a compound which in combination with its parameters of efficacy and toxicity, as well as based on the knowledge of the practicing specialist should be effective in a given therapeutic form. As is understood in the art, an effective amount may be in one or more doses, i.e., a single dose or multiple doses may be required to achieve the desired treatment endpoint. An effective amount may be considered in the context of administering one or more therapeutic agents, and a single agent may be considered to be given in an effective amount if, in conjunction with one or more other agents, a desirable or beneficial result may be or is achieved. Suitable doses of any of the co-administered compounds may optionally be lowered due to the combined action (e.g., additive or synergistic effects) of the compounds.","Useful dosages of compounds can be determined by comparing their in vitro activity and\/or in vivo activity in animal models. Methods for the extrapolation of effective dosages in mice, and other animals, to humans are known to the art; for example, see U.S. Pat. No. 4,938,949. For example, the concentration of a compound in a liquid composition, such as a lotion, can be from about 0.1-25% by weight, or from about 0.5-10% by weight. The concentration in a semi-solid or solid composition such as a gel or a powder can be about 0.1-5% by weight, or about 0.5-2.5% by weight.","The amount of a compound required for use in treatment will vary not only with the particular salt selected but also with the route of administration, the nature of the condition being treated and the age and condition of the patient and will be ultimately at the discretion of the attendant physician or clinician.","Effective dosages and routes of administration of compounds are conventional. The exact amount (effective dose) of the agent will vary from subject to subject, depending on, for example, the species, age, weight and general or clinical condition of the subject, the severity or mechanism of any disorder being treated, the particular agent or vehicle used, the method and scheduling of administration, and the like. A therapeutically effective dose can be determined empirically, by conventional procedures known to those of skill in the art. See, e.g., The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, Goodman and Gilman, eds., Macmillan Publishing Co., New York. For example, an effective dose can be estimated initially either in cell culture assays or in suitable animal models. The animal model can also be used to determine the appropriate concentration ranges and routes of administration. Such information can then be used to determine useful doses and routes for administration in humans. A therapeutic dose can also be selected by analogy to dosages for comparable therapeutic agents.","The particular mode of administration and the dosage regimen will be selected by the attending clinician, taking into account the particulars of the case (e.g., the subject, the disease, the disease state involved, and whether the treatment is prophylactic). Treatment can involve daily or multi-daily doses of compound(s) over a period of a few days to months, or even years.","In general, however, a suitable dose will be in the range of from about 0.001 to about 100 mg\/kg, e.g., from about 0.01 to about 100 mg\/kg of body weight per day, such as above about 0.1 mg per kilogram, or in a range of from about 1 to about 10 mg per kilogram body weight of the recipient per day. For example, a suitable dose can be about 1 mg\/kg, 10 mg\/kg, or 50 mg\/kg of body weight per day.","A compound is conveniently administered in unit dosage form; for example, containing 0.05 to 10000 mg, 0.5 to 10000 mg, 5 to 1000 mg, or about 100 mg of active ingredient per unit dosage form.","A compound can be administered to achieve peak plasma concentrations of, for example, from about 0.5 to about 75 \u03bcM, about 1 to 50 \u03bcM, about 2 to about 30 \u03bcM, or about 5 to about 25 \u03bcM. Exemplary desirable plasma concentrations include at least or no more than 0.25, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100 or 200 \u03bcM. For example, plasma levels can be from about 1 to 100 micromolar or from about 10 to about 25 micromolar. This can be achieved, for example, by the intravenous injection of a 0.05 to 5% solution of a diarylhydantoin or hydantoin compound, optionally in saline, or orally administered as a bolus containing about 1-100 mg of a diarylhydantoin or hydantoin compound. Desirable blood levels can be maintained by continuous infusion to provide about 0.00005-5 mg per kg body weight per hour, for example at least or no more than 0.00005, 0.0005, 0.005, 0.05, 0.5, or 5 mg\/kg\/hr. Alternatively, such levels can be obtained by intermittent infusions containing about 0.0002-20 mg per kg body weight, for example, at least or no more than 0.0002, 0.002, 0.02, 0.2, 2, 20, or 50 mg of a compound per kg of body weight.","A compound can conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered at appropriate intervals, for example, as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day. The sub-dose itself can be further divided, e.g., into a number of discrete loosely spaced administrations; such as multiple inhalations from an insufflator.","4. Methods of Administration","A compound can be administered using pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount of the compound and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent, in a variety of forms adapted to the chosen route of administration, for example, orally, nasally, intraperitoneally, or parenterally, by intravenous, intramuscular, topical or subcutaneous routes, or by injection into tissue.","A compound can be systemically administered, e.g., orally, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle such as an inert diluent or an assimilable edible carrier; or by inhalation or insufflation. It can be enclosed in hard or soft shell gelatin capsule, can be compressed into a tablet, or can be incorporated directly with the food of a patient's diet. For oral therapeutic administration, a compound can be combined with one or more excipients and used in the form of an ingestible tablet, a buccal tablet, troche, capsule, elixir, suspension, syrup, wafer, and the like. A compound can be combined with a fine inert powdered carrier and inhaled by the subject or insufflated. In some embodiments such compositions and preparations contain at least 0.1% diarylhydantoin or hydantoin compound. The percentage of the compositions and preparations can, of course, be varied and can conveniently be between about 2% to about 60% of the weight of a given unit dosage form. The amount of diarylhydantoin or hydantoin compound in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage level will be obtained.","A compound can also be administered intravenously or intraperitoneally by infusion or injection. Solutions of a compound can be prepared in water, optionally mixed with a nontoxic surfactant. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, triacetin, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations can contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.","5. Combination Therapies","In some embodiments combinations of one or more compounds are used. A \u201ccombination\u201d compounds includes one or more compounds administered substantially simultaneously, whether or not in the same pharmaceutical composition, or sequentially. compounds can, but need not be, chemically similar (e.g., two diarylhydantoin compounds; a diarylhydantoin compound and a diarylthiohydantoin, etc.).","In some embodiments one or more compounds is combined other therapies, such as internal or external radiation, surgery, and chemotherapies, including:\n\n","One or more compounds also can be used in conjunction with combinations of chemical therapies, such as:\n\n","Other therapeutic agents which can be combined with compounds disclosed herein include:\n\n","Nothing in this specification should be considered as limiting the scope of this disclosure.
