title: Side spring micro-mirror
abstract: A micro-electrical mechanical system (MEMS) mirror assembly including an array of micro-mirrors formed on a substrate and having springs on one side and which angularly tilt between ON and OFF states in response to an electrostatic force generated by a voltage applied to an electrode located on the substrate. At least one, but preferably two springs in the form of two thin strips of metal attach to post(s) at the side edge of the mirror and act as springs which provide a restoring force when the mirror is tilted between an OFF state which occurs when the mirror is flat relative to the substrate with no voltage applied, and in the ON state when the mirror is tilted when a voltage is applied.

No. 10\/879,041 (Northrop Grumman Ref. No. 000258-078), entitled \u201cPocket Pen Ultra-High Resolution MEMS Projection Display In Combination With On Axis CCD Image Capture System\u201d, filed on Jun. 30, 2004, in the names of Harvey C. Nathanson et al. and which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention.","This invention relates generally to a micro-mirror for a micro-mirror array, and more particularly to a micro-mirror which can be angularly tilted in conjunction with a light source so as to project an image onto a screen.","In the related application referenced above, a portable pen-sized projector\/image grabber system is disclosed that utilizes a high resolution MEMS mirror array in conjunction with a light source so as to project an image on a screen. The MEMS mirror array is comprised of micro-mirrors in the order of 5 \u03bcm\u00d75 \u03bcm on a side so as to form a target small enough to be used in a pen-sized, hand-held portable housing.","This invention is directed to a micro-mirror having a side spring geometry, and more particularly to a micro-electrical mechanical system (MEMS) mirror having springs on one side of the mirror and which angularly tilts between ON and OFF states through electrostatic actuation. At least one, but preferably two springs in the form of two thin strips of metal attach to post(s) at the side edge of the mirror and act as springs which provide a restoring force when the mirror is tilted between an OFF state which occurs when the mirror is flat with no voltage applied, and in the ON state when the mirror is tilted in response to an applied voltage.","In one aspect of the invention, a micro-mirror for use in a MEMS mirror array is disclosed comprising: a generally flat mirror body member having a plurality of side edges, said body member being suspended above the substrate only on a single side edge by at least one spring member and which provides a restoring force to the mirror body member back to a flat OFF state when pulled downwardly by an actuating force to a tilted ON state.","Further scope of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be understood, however, that the detailed description and the specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, they are provided by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications coming within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art.","Referring now to the drawings, attention is first directed to  where there is shown a pocket-pen sized projector-image grabber device  in accordance with the invention shown and described in the related application, Ser. No. 10\/879,041 entitled \u201cPocket Pen Ultra-High Resolution MEMS Projection Display . . . \u201d.  is broadly illustrative of the components which, in addition to an elongated cylindrical pocket pen type housing , include an image projection and image grabber system  shown in detail in , and which resides behind an objective lens . Behind the system components , is a display driver section  for controlling the image projector and image grabber system . In order to power the various electrical components, a power supply  consisting of one or more DC batteries is located in the housing . Also associated with the image projector and image grabber system , is a memory section  which is adapted to interface with a two dimensional CCD imaging array . The housing  also includes an external interface section  which includes an RF transmitter\/receiver section, not shown, for transmitting images to an external location as well as receiving images therefrom for projection by the device .","Referring now to , the apparatus  shown in  includes, in addition to the CCD imaging array , a high resolution 1024\u00d7768 MEMS mirror array  and a light source  which projects a beam of light  to the face  of the array  by means of a condensing lens  and a folding mirror . The MEMS mirror array  is composed of a plurality of micro-mirrors which will be described hereinafter and which are tiltable along an edge so as to either reflect the light beam  to a projection lens , or off to the side as shown by reference numeral \u2032, where it is absorbed without being directed to the lens . As shown in , the mirror array  is tilted away from an axis  such that a tilt of the various mirrors from a 0\u00b0 (flat) OFF state to a 20\u00b0 (tilt) ON state as provided, for example, through electrostatic actuation, will project light towards the lens .","The impact of the above can be described by comparing the side spring mirror array  to a design that operates between, for example, \u221210\u00b0 for its OFF and ON states. There is a certain amount of diffraction \u2032 centered at 0\u00b0 caused by the fixed pattern noise of the array and substrate itself. When the mirror has an OFF state at 0\u00b0, this diffraction \u2032 is thrown out of the optical system, but when the OFF state is at \u221210\u00b0, a portion of this diffracted light energy at 0\u00b0 will be captured by the projection lens  and thus reduce the resulting contrast between the ON and OFF state. This is demonstrated in , which shows an implementation of the micro-mirrors into the pen sized projector\/image grabber optical system, and shows the diffraction spread from mirror's tilting between 0\u00b0 and 20\u00b0 and \u221210\u00b0 and 10\u00b0.","The MEMS mirror, array  is comprised of a plurality of identical micro-mirrors which are only about 5 \u03bcm\u00d75 \u03bcm along a side dimension, which forms an imaging target of about 0.5 cm.\u00d70.4 cm. so that it is small enough to be inserted in the pen-sized hand-held device  shown in .","In order that the MEMS mirror array  and the CCD imaging array  have access to the same external port  including the objective lens  shown in , the apparatus  also includes an optical component  which may be, for example, a beam splitter, which permits light to be projected from the MEMS mirror array  to a projection screen, not shown, and so that an external scene or object can be conveyed to the CCD imaging array  by means of the reflecting face  in the beam splitter , a secondary objective lens , and a folding mirror .","Up to this point, what has been shown and described is a portable pen-sized image projector\/image grabber system including a high density MEMS micro-mirror array, the details of which will now be explained.","Each micro-mirror  in accordance with this invention comprises a MEMS mirror design with at least one, but preferably two, spring elements on one side of the mirror, as will be shown in . The side spring mirror in its various embodiments, is adapted to toggle OFF and ON between 0\u00b0 (flat) and 20\u00b0 (tilted) through electrostatic action. The method of switching between ON and OFF states can either use two electrodes beneath the mirror to actively actuate the mirror between ON and OFF states, or use a single electrode in conjunction with a spring constant of the springs as a restoring force to actuate between ON and OFF states. However, even where two electrodes are used to activate a mirror, the spring(s) also operate to provide a restoring force back to the 0\u00b0 state.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["45","50","51","52","55","54","58","60","62","54","56","58","50","62","45","60"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A and 4B","FIG. 4B","FIG. 4A","FIGS. 4A and 4B"],"b":["45","64","66","68","70","72","68","70","74","60","76","60","68","70","78","64"]},"As shown in , the mirror body member  of the micro-mirror  is actuated from an OFF position where the body member  is parallel to the substrate  to a tilted ON position at an angle of 20\u00b0 which for the dimensions shown, is approximately 0.85 mm. A 20\u00b0 tiltable micro-mirror  as shown in , allows an array of mirror elements  to be fabricated having a 8500 \u212b spacing between their elements for low voltage operation.","A side spring mirror, as shown for examples in , with its OFF state at 0\u00b0 and its ON state at 20\u00b0, provides a particularly useful angle officially separated from the OFF state for optical systems and has a number of advantages when used in an optical system.","With reference to ,  discloses a two spring embodiment such as shown in  in conjunction with the mirror body , while  shows a single spring embodiment for a mirror body .","It should be noted that either configuration may be utilized, however, the preferred embodiment comprises a two spring design shown in .","Referring now to , shown thereat is a side view of two side spring micro-mirrors  as shown, for example, in  tilted at 20\u00b0. The mirrors  are shown in the ON orientation, being that they are tilted so as to reflect collimated light, shown by reference numeral , incident on the MEMS mirror surfaces  into a projection lens, such as shown by reference numeral  in . The diffraction resulting from the MEMS micro-mirrors  is a result of two sources: (1) the mirror surfaces themselves with features and patterns such as springs  and  shown, for example in ; and (2) the array of mirror elements which in themselves form pixel surfaces having regular spacing therebetween and forming a pattern. The light diffracted from a single micro-mirror  has its central maximum in the specular reflection direction. The situation is more complex when considering interference between mirror elements , but this is less critical for the side spring mirror design as shown for the following reasons. First, in the OFF condition, all of the mirror elements or pixels remain untilted and the side spring micro-mirrors closely resemble a plain mirror. This minimizes diffraction cone angle. Further any angular mismatch is unimportant, since the light is OFF light. In the ON condition, during imaging the mirror elements are randomly tilted, thus significantly reducing interference effects. Most significant is the fact that the projector end lens, for example the lens  shown in , images each pixel into its conjugate, which completely eliminates interference effects in a final image plane.","Another advantageous feature specific to the subject micro-mirror architecture that employs side spring mirrors , is that because these side spring actuated pixels tilt only in one direction and otherwise lie flat, they have less unwanted reflection from the edges of the mirrors. In the OFF condition, the five \u03bcm square pixels as shown in , for example, have gaps of 8500 \u212b between their edges. When turned ON, the pixels tilt toward the incident light beams so that no spurious edges intercept the incident light  as shown in . This architecture significantly reduces scattering in the ON and OFF conditions and is of significant advantage for a side spring MEMS mirror design as shown and described herein.","Referring now to , shown thereat is an E-beam defined array \u2032 of side spring MEMS mirror element  in accordance with another embodiment of the invention having 5000\u212b vias and 1500\u212b spacing, and are similar to the two spring embodiments shown in , with the exception that the pair of springs  and  shown in  are now shown in  as being generally rectangular elongated finger members  and  having a length which is less than one half of the length dimension  of the mirror body  and which are attached to posts  and  formed on the substrate  located between three unattached outer and inner finger members ,  and  which tilt along with the main portion of the mirror body .","Referring now to , shown thereat are a series of steps for fabricating a side spring micro-mirror  in accordance with the subject invention.  shows a trench  first being etched into a layer of oxide  which has been formed on a silicon substrate , with the trench being defined by a layer of photoresist . Next, as shown in , electrode metal  is deposited on top of the photoresist layer as well as the trench . Following this, the photoresist layer , with the metallization removed, leaving only the metal electrode . Next, as shown in , a layer of polysilicon  is deposited, which is followed by the step shown in  of the formation of posts  and  () by applying a layer of photoresist  and forming vertical openings or vias  down to metallization regions . This is followed by mirror  and post  metal deposition step as shown in  by applying a layer of metallization  on top of the polysilicon layer  and through the vias  of . Next, as shown in , a field etch step is next carried out by applying a layer of photoresist  on top of the layer of metallization , which is followed by defining the micro-mirror reflecting surface of the micro-mirror body . This is then followed up by removing the polysilicon layer  as shown in  so as to provide a micro-mirror body  which is attached to a pair of posts  and  for the springs  and  shown in .","Thus what has been shown and described is a side spring micro-mirror design that can achieve XGA (1024\u00d7768) resolution in a 0.5 cm.\u00d70.4 cm. footprint while also being designed for low voltage (<10V) voltage operation and capable of full color television refresh rates, with each of these features being adapted for location in the body  of a small hand-held projection system  as shown in ."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DRAWINGS","p":["The present invention will become more fully understood from the detailed description provided hereinafter in the accompanying drawings which are provided by way of illustration only, and thus are not limitative of the present invention, and wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIGS. 4A and 4B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIGS. 5A and 5B","FIGS. 4A and 4B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIGS. 9A\u20139I"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
