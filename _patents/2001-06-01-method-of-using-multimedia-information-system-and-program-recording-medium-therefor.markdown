In particular, the present invention relates to a method of using multimedia information for transferring, storing and searching multimedia information, which is excellent in usability, a recording medium storing a program of using a multimedia information and a multimedia information system.","Recently, the usability of multimedia information has gathered attentions for handing a plurality of media information such as moving pictures, sound, and text.","A first conventional technology may be a television telephone system. The television (TV) telephone system is a system for connecting voice information through a telephone and image information through a TV bidirectionally. The TV telephone system cannot send a large amount of information since the transfer speed of the line is limited. Therefore, multimedia (MM) information in high quality cannot be exchanged. In addition, the communication information is lost on the spot, and the information generally cannot be stored and\/or be reused.","A second conventional technology may be a digital video disk (DVD) system in addition to a conventional technology example for providing reusable MM information in high quality.  is a diagram for explaining the digital video disk system.","In the DVD system, an original image (moving image) is structured hierarchically and is compressed by an encoder. Voice is also encoded by the encoder. Synchronous signals of the image and the voice are written in an optical disk along with the respective data. A user reconstructs the encoded data stored in the optical disk by using a decoder so that high level MM information can be reconstruct, which is close to the original image and\/or the original voice. The methods of encoding and decoding are standardized as MPEG-2, for example. Thus, the user can reuse the provided MM information by using a terminal apparatus including MPEG-2 decoder repeatedly whenever the user desires.","The DVD uses the optical disk as a storage medium for MM information. Therefore, a large amount of information can be distributed easily. However, a fast transmission circuit is required for handling such a large amount of information in a distribution system. Thus, a private line such as satellite broadcasting is required. In other words, when a shared distribution system is used which is generally available presently, the reusable MM information in high quality is difficult to use.","A third conventional technology may be a video letter, which is a system for transferring similar MM information as the sharable distribution system. The video letter packaged transmits compressed image\/voice information by using a shared line and decodes the information in the receiver side for use. However, the video letter system is responsible for information communication in one direction from the sender side to the receiver side. Therefore, even when the incoming information can be transferred to another party directly, the information content cannot be reprocessed, which lacks convenience in using MM information.","In order to establish MM information, which can reuse MM information and can transfer it by using a shared transmission line and which is excellence in convenience for use, the data structure of transferred\/stored MM information is important. The data structures in conventional technologies are as follows.","A fourth conventional technology may be an object-based MM data structure. The data structure divides MM information into small units (objects), which are hierarchically structured and is stored for being used by a user. The user uses the MM information by expanding it from the high level in the hierarchy information and obtaining a required amount of information toward the low level. For example, the object-based MM data structure includes a background, a foreground human character, a desk and a chair in computer graphics.","A fifth conventional technology has been proposed for constructing MM information by content information and behavior information and transferring the MM information as package information including them according to Multimedia and Hypermedia information coding Expert Group (MHEG). The MHEG data structure can conveniently provide a function for reconstructing received data automatically in the receiver side by writing an automatically reconstructing function in the behavior information.","However, information is divided into small units in the object-based data structure of the fourth conventional technology. Therefore, the outline of the entire MM information is difficult to grasp externally. In addition, the outline of the entire information is difficult to grasp in a speed desired by the user. In other words, even when the data structure can be reused partially, each of the objects is provided for each component. Therefore, the user must determine whether or not each of the small components is reused. Thus, this is a problem for the user's convenience in that a large amount of entire MM information is difficult to view briefly.","The data structure of the fifth conventional technology is limited in automatic reconstruction, which limits handling of MM information in accordance with an intention of the user. In other words, MM information is uniquely reconstructed by the behavior information. Therefore, flexible usage is difficult such as changing a form of representing MM information in accordance with the determination by the received user. In addition, an intention of a sending user for reconstruction is not given when transferring MM information (that is, the reconstruction requirement cannot be controlled).","In view of these problems, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method of using multimedia information, a recording medium storing a program of using multimedia information and a multimedia information system. In this case, MM information in high quality can be transferred by using a shared transfer system and can be reconstructed, edited, processed and\/or re-transferred flexibly in accordance with the convenience of a user.","With respect to (1) multimedia and (2) the data structure, for example, the present invention can have feature as follows:\n\n","The present invention is a multimedia (abbreviated as MM hereinafter) information system in which a plurality of media information (such as an image, voice and a document) can be transferred, stored and\/or used by using a common digital medium between at least one sending terminal and at least one receiving terminal.\n\n","MM information is divided into a plurality of unit information having a meaning in uses as a bundle of information, which is stored and is transferred.\n\n","MM information may be compressed, stored, transferred and expanded for use.\n\n","MM information may include an information group having:\n\n","The MM structure is further characterized in:\n\n","Operationally in the present invention:\n\n","(1) System Configuration",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"The shown system includes a sending terminal , receiving terminals  and , a management terminal , a transfer device , and a transfer system .","In this embodiment, multiple pieces of MM information are stored in a database  of the sending terminal . A user can extract desired MM information from the receiving terminal  or  for use. Here, the MM information desired by the user is sent\/received through the transfer device  and the transfer system . The transfer system  may be a network such as a publicly switched network, a satellite network, a mobile apparatus network, the Internet, an optical fiber network, a radio network and a infrared ray network. The management terminal  manages information transfer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"The system includes a sending terminal , a receiving terminals  and , a management terminal , a transfer device , a transfer system , a transmitter , a receiver  and a communication satellite . This embodiment is an asymmetrical network in which MM information transfer is divided into two systems including a shared transfer system specifically for transmission through the communication satellite  and a shared transfer system for mainly receiving control signals and so on through the transfer system . In other words, MM information from the sending terminal  is transferred from the transmitter  to the receiving terminal  and\/or  including the receiver  through the communication satellite  by using the shared satellite communication line specifically for transmission. The receiving terminals  and  can receive the same MM information at the same time or can receive MM information from the sending terminal  separately. the receiving terminals  and , the sending terminal  and the management terminal  are connected through the transfer system  for the asynchronous communication like the first embodiment, which allows mutual communication (sending and receiving). The transfer system  in this case mainly transfers a control signal for controlling MM information. Thus, even the light load on the communication line is not problematic. Therefore, the transfer system  may be a shared communication network such as an ISDN line.","Next, an initial state of each of the terminals will be described. In the initial state, there are cases where MM information exists in the receiving terminal \/ or not. In other words, there are cases where:\n\n","Then, the management terminal  is responsible for access authorization management for MM information. The sending terminal  sends data to the receiving terminal \/ in accordance with an instruction from the management terminal . The sending terminal  includes a database  for MM information basically.","There are two implementing methods (A-1) and (A-2) for the access authorization, including:\n\n","The access authorization (A-1) is implemented under application software control not under data control. For example, the access authorization (A-1) includes data access authorization given to MM data viewing software and access authorization for MM information based on MM information use registration.","The access authorization (A-2) further includes access authorizations (A-2-1) and (A-2-2), for example.","The access authorization (A-2-1) inhibits intent information to be read and\/or displayed (expanded) if the viewing action is not written as behavior information (reading block for operating viewing software); and","The access authorization (A-2-2) inhibits information to view until the encrypted data is decrypted.","Therefore, the access authorization (A-1) is given by exchanging authorization control information. The access authorization (A-2) is given by rewriting and operating authorization information (existing in container information, behavior information and container information, respectively) within MM information or by following opening steps between the authorization information and the management terminal. For example, this is the case when control data is given to information data A, and when the data cannot read at \u201c000+A\u201d but can be read at \u201c001+A\u201d, where \u201c000\u201d and \u201c001\u201d do not have any special meanings.","A user without access authorization may not open MM information. In this case, MM information can be used to implement partial reading and\/or operational control such as allowing to read up to container information in general but inhibiting content information to be read without user registration and\/or inhibiting MM information to operation if the behavior information cannot be read.","Next, an explanatory diagram of a data processing hierarchy model is shown in . This is an example of a hierarchy model for implementing a data processing function for processing MM information according to the present invention in the sending terminal , the receiving terminals  and  and the management terminal . The hierarchy model includes, application software  for an MM information package (called MMP hereinafter), an MMP application interface , an MMP controller , an MMP processor  and an MM information package .","The application software  is created for each function of using MM information and controls processing for sending or receiving MMP data through the application interface . The application interface  performs processing for inputting user's determination and processing for outputting information to a user. In this case, the input\/output device and an MM information display device for a user are provided but are omitted in the drawing. The MMP controller  transfers a signal between each terminal and a transfer device and controls MM information transferred to the MMP processor. The MMP processor  includes an MMP decoder for decoding transferred MM information and an MMP encoder for encoding MMP information when sending and\/or using. The MMP package  is MMP information itself stored in the sending side or is MMP information itself transferred to the receiving side and includes container information, content information and behavior information.","As an example of MM information, in order to search a book in the library, the title, the author, the publisher, the abstract, the simple keyword of the book and so on are used for obtaining the target book. These kinds of brief content information are included in the container information. Therefore, the container information is searched. On the other hand, in order to search a book by using the content, the body information, a more specific keyword, the genre of the book and so on or in order to perform a image search or voice search, these kinds of information are included in content information. Thus, the content information is searched.","The \u201ccontainer information\u201d includes outline information describing outlines of content information and behavior information. The outline information may include, for example:\n\n","Here, the scalability means a measure for obtaining the variable quality of resolution and\/or error tolerance and gives a hierarchy concept to an encoded structure. In addition, because of the scalability, a part of encoded data and\/or encoded bit stream is extracted so as to reconstruct and\/or decode meaningful image and information. For the scalability encoding, one of decoders having various complexities decodes an original moving image from a single encoded bit stream so as to reconstruct and display the image properly. Mainly, four kinds of method are provided for providing the basic variable characteristics, including space scalability, SNR scalability, time scalability and data partitioning.","For the space scalability, encoding is performed for providing multiple resolutions. In this case, images having different resolutions can be extracted from one bit stream. In addition, a transmission-error-proofed signal can be given to a lower layer so as to obtain a kind of error tolerance. The space scalability is characterized in using two special resolutions such as moving image application including communication, mutual conversion between moving image standards, overview of a moving image database, and mutual conversion between HDTV and SDTV. For the spatial scalability, in order to create a moving image layer for two spatial resolutions from one original moving image and to provide a basic spatial resolution, the lower layer encodes itself. Then, the upper layer uses the lower layer internally provided spatially to represent a complete spatial resolution of the original moving image signal. For example, the lower layer and the upper layer may be encoded in accordance with MPEG-2 Standard. The lower layer may be encoded in accordance with MPEG-1 Standard while the upper layer may be encoded in accordance with MPEG-2 Standard.","The SNR scalability can be applied when at least two layers are required for quality such as moving image application including communication, a moving image service in multiquality, SDTV and HDTV. The SNR scalability means to create two quality layers having the same resolution but different qualities from one moving image. The lower layer encodes itself so as to provide basic moving image quality. The upper layer encodes itself to improve the quality of the lower layer.","For the time scalability, the lower layer encodes itself so as to provide a basic time speed. The upper layer encodes by using a time estimate from the lower layer. These layers are multiplexed in time so as to provide a complete time resolution of the original moving image signal when decoding.","The data partitioning assumes a case where two channels can be used for transmitting and storing bit streams, such as an ATM network, terrestrial broadcasting and a magnetic medium. The bit stream is divided into channels. The important parts (such as a header, a motion vector and a low frequency DCT coefficient) are transferred through channels having fewer errors than the channel for transmitting unimportant data (such as high frequency DCT coefficient).","The basic kinds of scalability may be combined to obtain a hybrid scalability. The basic kinds of scalability can handle two layers for a moving image, including a lower layer and an upper layer. On the other hand, the hybrid scalability can handle three layers.","The \u201ccontent information\u201d is functionally divided into independent information, which is created by using a part of at least one piece of media information and has a meaning in use independently, and at least one piece of additional information to be added to the independent information to become closer to the original media information. The content information can be provided with multiple pieces of container information (which can include container information and\/or behavior information typified thereby).","A hierarchy encoding method for spatial resolution, which may refer to special scalability proposed to the MPEG 2, can be used for dividing content information as an example preferable for moving image information. In an example of two-layer (maximum of four layers) in MPEG-2, an high resolution image as an original image is and a low resolution image, in which the original image is reduced to horizontally and vertically half by filtering, are created first. An image in each layer is divided into micro-blocks, which is encoded by an encoder. Here, motion estimation is performed for each layer, between layers and for each frame. Therefore, the image information is compressed. As content information, the encoded data is stored in a memory device within sending terminal once. The number of layers (two layers) is recorded in the scalability profile of the container information as the type name (MPEG-2) and the level of the special scalability.","In general, the low-resolution image (data) has the deteriorated special resolution. As a result, detail motion of the subject cannot be captured. However, brief motion can be stored by using a small amount of data capacity. On the other hand, while the high-resolution image (data) can only capture the motion of the subject locally but can be encoded in a detail area by increasing the special resolution of the detected amount of motion. When data having low and high resolutions are combined in motion estimation for each micro-block, a moving image in high quality, which is close to the original image, can be reconstructed.","The \u201cbehavior information\u201d includes information of manipulating (such as reconstructing, searching, editing and processing) content information, which is set by a user. In addition, the behavior information can include history information of manipulations performed by the user in past information relating to a behavior in the receiving side, which is set by a sender. The behavior information does not have to be always included. When the moving image information in two layers is stored in the above-described example, the behavior information is not included therein.","(2) Service of Using a Multimedia Information",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0099"},"figref":"FIG. 4","ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0013","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0013-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0014","list-style":"none"},"li":["Electronic library: storing many pieces of multimedia information and being selected and used by a used;","Article service: automatically processing searched\/transferred MM information in accordance with the number of days having passed since the transferred data;","Communication: exchanging MM information among multiple users;","Edit: creating and editing new MM information;","Presentation: reporting\/presenting in a conference, for example, by using MM information; and","Information supply: introducing one piece of MM information to another MM system.\n\nFeatures of an example of a configuration of an MM information system according to the present invention and examples of several kinds of usage in which the MM information system according to the present invention can function properly will be described below in order shown in .\n"]}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0106"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0107"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 1"],"b":["2","1"]},"The receiving terminal  launches an application (MM information browser) and specifies or automatically inquires the start of use by a user of the management terminal  ().

The painter and\/or the historical background can be found from a picture in an art museum. Alternatively, a video scene may be taken from one still image. Today's baseball scene of all of batters may be taken from a photograph in which one baseball player is standing at a batter box. Thus, the search engine extracts detail information from partial information.","General advantages of this embodiment are:\n\n","In addition, the advantages inherent to this embodiment are as follows, for example:","Since a receiving capacity of each user is registered with the management terminal , one user may have a higher receiving capacity, for example. When the user needs to obtain MM information in high quality, all of the MM information can transferred. Then, MM information in high quality can be used. On the other hand, a user only having a lower receiving capacity or a user having a higher receiving capacity but requesting to obtain a content fast can receive the transfer of a part of MM information by requesting that. Thus, wasteful loads are not imposed on the transfer system and the storage capacity in the receiving side is not used wastefully. MM information can be transferred in a manner suitable for the convenience of the user.","This embodiment has been described by assuming that the sending terminal  has one MM information file. When another embodiment has many sending terminals, content information can be exchanged between mutual sending terminals. The user A can search not only MM information in the sending terminal  but also MM information in another sending terminal. The target range of the search can be increased. Thus, if required information is held in the other sending terminal than the sending terminal , the fact can be recognized. Thus, the receiving user can recognize the presence of the MM information in multiple sending terminals fast, which improves the usability. The transferring user (the provider of MM information( can improve the quality of the service by showing MM information other than the MM information held by the transferring user itself, which can improve the usability for increasing the number of users.","The application software  determines that the container information is the highest layer including content information and behavior information.

If the MM information meeting with the search conditions is found, the MM information is transferred to each of the user entirely.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0129"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},"In accordance with the flowchart, the processing steps by the application software in the receiving terminal for each user will be described. The flowchart shows information processing steps (for example, information deletion) performed when information is automatically transferred, for example. When retrieved and transferred MM information exists in the receiving terminal, a processing portion is provided for monitoring a lapse of the MM information. The processing portion is automatically launched and deletes proper information after a predetermined storage period of time (one hour, one day, one month and the like).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0131"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},"Here, as shown in ), the MM information has container information (media profile) including heading information(text information), content information including text information for article sentences and compressed still image information, and behavior information recording a behavior condition after the receipt from the registered user, for example. A type of manipulation performed on the package information by a user is recorded in the behavior information of each package. The type of manipulation is written in a header of the media profile (type profile, description profile) content information, and the function information is written in the behavior information.","Settings may be specified for a case where the application software is not launched on the day of the transfer because the user is traveling, for example, and a case where transferred MM information exists in the receiving terminal. Here, when MM information based on a search result is transferred, or after a predetermined period of time, the application software is launched automatically and detects an MM package, which has not been manipulated by a user yet (S). Next, behavior information in the MM packet is extracted (S) and analyzes stored days, time and so on of each content information based on an instruction written in the behavior information (S). Based on the analyzed stored days and time, image information transferred previously and passed three or more days, for example, is deleted (S and S) (See )). Furthermore, an article sentence information is deleted after the stored days, time and so on, for example, after 10 days (S and S). Finally, only the heading information and text based on the container information are left (see )). This processing may be repeated or ended in accordance with an instruction by the user (S).","Generally, the image information needs larger capacity than text information even when both of them are compressed. Through the data processing by the application software as above, when a large amount of search result is transferred but the receiving terminal of the user has limited capacity for storing the MM information, the container information, which is not used immediately, is deleted. Therefore, a case can be avoided where MM information cannot be received because the memory capacity of the user's terminal reaches to the use limit. The storage capacity of the receiver can be used effectively. Furthermore, processing for deleting other information such as voice information can be added in accordance with predetermined storage days, time and so on.","Next,  shows a flowchart for processing performed when a user needs more information while viewing information.","For example, a user returned from a travel can check unchecked heading information based on manipulation information stored in the behavior information in each MM package. Furthermore, in order to view the article sentences or the image content, the user can request it to the transfer center again. The steps in the flowchart will be described below.","When a user starts the application software (for example, every day), the application software detects the transferred MM package (S). Then, the application software displays to the user heading information included in the container information (S). The user refers to the heading information, and when it is important information, the user can further determine whether the user views the content (article sentences) and the image (still image) or not. Here, N indicates a difference between a date when the MM package is transferred and a date when the application software is started by the user. When the user determines that the content information is needed (S), the content information of the MM information is displayed (S) if the information is not deleted by the above-described deletion processing before passing 10 days or more, for example (S). On the other hand, after 10 days or more, the content information of the MM information is deleted. Thus, the user needs to request the content information again (S), and the content information is then displayed (S).","Similarly, content information of the MM information for the image information is displayed (S) if it is determined as necessary (S) and if three or more days are not passed, for example (S). On the other hand, if three or more days are passed, the content information of the MM information is deleted. Therefore, the content information is requested again (S) and then the content is displayed (S). In this way, the processing is performed repeatedly on all packages (S).","The general advantages of this embodiment are:\n\n","The advantage unique to this embodiment is to use the storage capacity of the receiving terminal effectively even when the storage capacity is limited.","The above-described embodiment describes the example where image and text information is deleted in order after a predetermined days from the delivery date. Furthermore, as a preferable example in a certain type of receiving terminal, a maximum amount of storable capacity for a predetermined article service may be set and the days until the deletion may be changed in accordance with the occupied condition. Here, a terminal having a smaller amount of storable capacity can retrieve at least heading information in container information fast, which improves the convenience for users.","(Usage for Transferring Information to Mobile Terminal in Accordance with Priority: Secretary Function)","A priority can be given to one retrieved from article information as described in the second embodiment. MM information of the present invention has behavior information. When management terminal defines the searched information as especially important, the sending terminal  writes the priority of the information in the behavior information as an behavior by the receiver. The behavior information retrieves document information from content information by using the scalability structure.","When MM information having important data behavior information is delivered, the application software of the receiving terminal displays the heading information as soon as the information arrives. When a user A of the receiving terminal  does not exist near the terminal, the place to transfer may be preset. When the user has a mobile terminal separately from the receiving terminal, and when the user can transfer the content information including the heading and the document from the receiving terminal to the mobile terminal, the information is sent to the mobile terminal. An advantage unique to this embodiment is that important information can be used in time.","Next, another embodiment of the present invention will be described where users can communicate by using MM information mutually with scalability.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0098","num":"0148"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},"This embodiment includes a receiving terminal  used by a user A, a receiving terminal  used by a user B, and a transfer system (network) . Here, the receiving terminals  and  are the information sender and receiver.","First of all, at a step S, the user A creates image information to send. Then, based on the spatial scalability, the image is encoded as content information having low-resolution information TB and high-resolution information TE. At a step S, the user A transfers MM information from the receiving terminal  to the receiving terminal  through the transfer system . At a step S, the user B reconstructs the transferred MM information by using both of the low resolution and high-resolution information TB and TE. At a step S, the user B creates new image information to return. In this example, a frame is divided into four. The transferred low resolution information TB and the created low resolution screen are independently used as information for \u00bc screen (one frame) and divided three frames, respectively. The behavior information of the created MM information includes name information of the low-resolution information TB and the high-resolution information TE, on which the editing is based. At a step S, the user B returns created image information to the user A. At a step S, the user A selects any one of the divided three frames with low resolution in the returned image information for reconstruction and\/or reuse (all of them have similar contents). The user A has the original image information sent by the user A. Thus, the image can be displayed by using the high-resolution information TE with higher resolution than the returned low-resolution information TB. Furthermore, the user A creates information to which new low resolution image divided into four (\u00bc image) added (S) and returns the information to the user B (S). The user B reconstructs the image (S).","In this way, the image information sent from one user to the other can be reused so as to exchange MM information. While the users A and B are communicating to each other, the sending terminal  and the management terminal  in  do not operate. However, when one of the users A and B desires to disclose the MM information created in both of them and sets the disclosure conditions (regarding copyright and so on), the intention is notified to the management terminal , with which the disclosure conditions are registered. After predetermined processing, the MM information is sent to the sending terminal  and can be stored to be available to the others.","Advantages of this embodiment are:\n\n","Next, a fourth embodiment will be described in which the present invention is applied to remote education.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0104","num":"0156"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 11"]},"In order to create a teaching material including MM information for remote education. A teacher who is a user of MM information in the first row in  uses the electronic library function described in the first embodiment to retrieve many pieces of MM information stored in the sending terminal  in . Then, required pieces of MM information (such as image, voice, text and graphics) can be gathered. The teacher can use the editing function according to the third embodiment to edit the MM information and to create one packaged remote education material. The created remote education material includes outline information in the container information and is registered with the sending terminal  as one of the teaching material menu. The management terminal manages terms and conditions of the teaching material.","A student who is another user of the MM information in the second row of  uses the receiving terminals  and  in  to inquire the teaching material of the sending terminal . The student can search many remote education teaching materials registered with the sending terminal  and can send a teaching material needed to him\/her from the menu. When a teaching material to use is determined, the student applies to the management terminal  in  for receiving the delivery of the teaching material selected by him\/her at one of the receiving terminals  and . The student can use the scalability of content information to select his\/her preferred display format of the MM information. For example, a student interested in an image can study with a high quality image by using all image information. A student who can understand a content only from a document can check the main point quickly by using a low quality image only.","When the construction of MM information of the remote teaching material is arranged in chapter and section, a student can skip chapters and\/or sections in accordance with his\/her knowledge by using the application software function of the receiving terminals  and . As a result, the usability can be improved. Each of the receiving terminals used by a student and\/or a teacher preferably has a sending function to be used when the teacher can answer to a question from the student.","A manager who is a user of the MM information in the last row in  can fined a state of using the remote education teaching material for each student based on the behavior information. The manager can find a state of using each of teaching materials in the menu, contents viewed by students with interests and skipped contents. This is effective for improving the remote education teaching material in the future and for grasping the degree of use. Furthermore, grasping a condition relating to questions and answers exchanged between students and teachers can effectively improve the quality of remote education teaching materials.","General advantage of this embodiment are as follows:\n\n","An advantage unique to this embodiment is that a student can easily select a remote education teaching material because MM information is packaged. In addition, content information is packaged in chapter or in section. Thus, a skip manipulation fitting to the degree of understanding and knowledge of a student can be performed in the receiving terminal, which can further improve the usability.","Most parts of the application function to the remote education in  can be applied to presentation performed in a lecture, for example.","A speaker who corresponds to the teacher in the remote education case in  edits a presentation content as MM information in advance and transfers it to a terminal (receiving terminal ) in a presentation place. The speaker can combine moving image, still image, voice, text, and graphic information freely for effective presentation. When the presentation time is changed, the presentation content can be extended or reduced by combining a level selection within a course and a skip manipulation.","When MM information, which is not planed in advance, is needed in questions and answers in presentation, the speaker can request the sending terminal  to retrieve and transfer the needed information. Alternatively, the speaker can use the information for explaining his\/her answer while receiving.","A method of using multimedia information according to the present invention can be implemented by a computer readable recording medium storing a multimedia information using program, a program product, which can include a multimedia information using program and can be loaded to an internal memory of a computer, and a program product, which includes a multimedia information using program and is stored in a computer usable recording medium.","(1) Common-Usability, Compliance and Reusability of Information","Information can be used among media commonly. Compliance with existing media: received package information can be used for transmission again. Thus, a user can process information and return processed information easily.","(2) Editing Function and Processable Information Construction","A user can construct new media information by editing, combining and processing each media information freely. Thus, the MM information can be edited and be reused easily.","(3) Copyright Protection Function","Authorization information relating to copyright of an expression and\/or usage of information can be handled. Security protection can be provided as personal information. Therefore, managers and users can manage information easily.","(4) Browsing Function","A user can check an expression content easily. Therefore, the user can determine the meaningfulness of information. A billing system for meaningful information can be established.","(5) Information Search Function","An information search function corresponding to a table of contents or an index can be provided. Therefore, even when large and\/or complex information received by a user easily can be searched.","Since content information and container information are written, a type of search can be performed by going to library A to retrieve content information B having mark C.","(6) Bookmark Function","A person who obtains information can paste or remove a bookmark. Thus, the user can organize even large and\/or complex information easily.","(7) Related Description Between Different Pieces of Media Information","For example, a desk is selected from an electronic catalog, information including the perspective diagram, size table, serial number and price of the desk can be listed and viewed easily.","(8) Recording Manipulation Information","Information can be reconstructed automatically. Thus, a user can handle information easily.","(9) Securing Independent Reconstruction of Information in Package","A user does not always have to receive information in real time.","A user can identify necessary information, and data can be stored easily.","A large amount of data can be transmitted and be stored in advance. Thus, information supposed to use can be transmitted and be stored in a used terminal. Then, a transmission delay in use (such as reconstruction) can be absorbed.","By using a common package format, information can be used uniformly among various services.","(10) Reduction of Decoding Processing and Display Processing by Terminal\n\n"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 12"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
