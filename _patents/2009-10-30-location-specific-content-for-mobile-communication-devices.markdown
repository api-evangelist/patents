{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL BACKGROUND","OVERVIEW","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Mobile devices such as laptops, cellular phones, and e-book readers are becoming increasingly popular with users. Mobile devices allow users to communicate and perform other functions from any location. Some mobile devices combine many of these functions into one device while others perform a more limited function set.","Mobile devices may communicate over wireless networks such as a cellular network or a Wi-Fi network, with media service providers to access media that can be received over the wireless network. The media can then be presented on the mobile device. Some typical examples of media are music, video, pictures, and electronic books, as well as many other types of media that can be received and presented on a mobile device.","Many services available using a mobile device can be enhanced based on the location of the device. For example, both emergency service calls and commercial calls may be routed based on location. In another example, location dependent advertisements may be delivered to a user based on location.","Embodiments disclosed herein allow a mobile communication device to incorporate location specific content into media for presentation to a user based on the location of the mobile communication device.

The location of mobile device  could vary in specificity. An example of a more specific location is the latitude and longitude coordinates of mobile device , while less specific examples include the city, state, or geographic region where mobile device  is located.","Mobile device  may determine its location in various ways. Mobile device  may use the Global Positioning System (GPS) or a positioning determining computer system in communication network . Additionally, the location of mobile device  may correspond to the location of base station  or to the location of the access provider that supplied mobile device  with an IP address. Alternatively, a user could input the location of mobile device . Mobile device  may also use other methods for determining its location.","In step , mobile device  receives a user selection indicating a selection of the media to be presented. For example, mobile device  may include a user interface with the capability of displaying a list or some other representation of all of the media that is stored on mobile device . A user can select the media that contains the content that the user wants to view or hear. The selection could be received as a touch of a touch screen, a press of a button, a toggle of a switch, a voice command, or some other way that a user may indicate the media for presentation.","In response to the user selection, mobile device determines location specific content based on the location of mobile device . The location specific content is content such as text, illustrations, photographs, audio, video, animations, or other content that corresponds to the selected media and the particular location where mobile device  is located. For example, if the media comprises an e-book, then the location specific content may include text of street names, sports teams, landmarks, products, services, or other content that corresponds to the particular location where mobile device  is located. The location could be defined as geographic coordinates, a city, a state, a country, or some other geographic area where mobile device  may be located.","In step , mobile device  incorporates the location specific content into the media selection for presentation to a user. When incorporated into the selected media the location specific content is inserted into designated places in the selected media with the appropriate text, illustration, photograph, audio, video, animation, or other content corresponding to the location of mobile device .","If mobile device  were to move from one location to another, such as is shown by dotted arrow , then the location specific content may also change based on new location of mobile device . For example, location specific content could be tailored to a specific city. Therefore, mobile device  moving from wireless access node  located in one city to wireless access node  located in another city would change the location specific content that is selected and inserted into the selected media. Likewise, if wireless access node  and wireless access node  are located in the same city, then moving from wireless access node  to wireless access node  may not change the location specific content determination. Alternatively, the location specific content incorporated into the selected media may remain constant throughout the presentation of the selected media no matter where mobile device  moves in relation to its original determined location. Additionally, if no location specific content can be selected for the location of mobile device , then a default content selection may be inserted into the selected media.","Referring back to , mobile device  comprises a telephone, transceiver, computer, digital assistant, mobile Internet access device, personal media player, e-book reader, or some other wireless communication apparatus\u2014including combinations thereof. Mobile device  comprises an antenna and RF communication circuitry for wireless communication. The RF communication circuitry typically includes an amplifier, filter, RF modulator, and signal processing circuitry. Mobile device  also comprises processing circuitry, memory, software, and a user interface.","Wireless link  uses air or space as the transport media. Wireless link  could use various protocols, such as wireless fidelity, Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM), Evolution Data Only (EVDO), Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WIMAX), Long Term Evolution (LTE), Internet, telephony, or some other communication format\u2014including combinations thereof.","Communication links - uses metal, air, space, optical fiber such as glass or plastic, or some other material as the transport media\u2014including combinations thereof.

Content server  comprises a computer system and other components for providing location specific content. Content server  may also be a separate system from media system .","Before communication system  can perform as described herein, media and location specific content for that media must be created. The media and location specific content may be created using an application programming interface (API). The API provides the content creator with the conventions allowing the creator to author media with the ability to insert location specific content, which is also created using the API. The conventions may allow the content creator to author media in a traditional manner while including the necessary indicators for location specific content. Alternatively, the API may be a set of software instructions that, when executed by computer hardware, provide the content creator with an interface for authoring media and associated location specific content. Likewise, the API may take the form of a programming language with an accompanying compiler.","No matter what form the API takes, the content creator uses the API to indicate where individual items of the location specific content should be placed in the media selection. The API may also allow the creator to define the locations that correspond to each set of location specific content. The API will also allow the creator to update or change the location specific content on the content server.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["401","410","401","402","404","410"]},"A content creator authors media content into API template . The square bracketed indicators will be dispersed throughout the authored content. The creator assigns each location specific content set to a location that may contain a mobile device. The creator also provides location specific items corresponding to the assigned locations. Mobile device  presenting the created media will determine which of location specific content sets - should be placed into the created media. If media device , for example, selects location specific content set , then the content provided in set  will be incorporated into the media created from media template . After incorporation, any indicator referring to label  is replaced with M, any indicator referring to label  is replaced with N, and any indicator referring to label  is replaced with O. Additionally, the indicator referring to the insertion of picture is replaced in the created media with Picture S.","Accordingly, the location specific content becomes a part of, and directly relates to, the content of the media and is not merely unrelated location specific information, such as advertisements, presented on the side. The media, therefore, will not be a complete work until after the location specific content is incorporated.","After the media is created, the media is placed in media server  for distribution.
