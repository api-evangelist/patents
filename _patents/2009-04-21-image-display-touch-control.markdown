{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/046,647 filed Apr. 21, 2008, and entitled \u201cDigital Picture Frame,\u201d the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.","This invention generally relates to image display devices, and more particularly relates to touch control of an image display device.","The increased popularity of digital cameras has corresponded to an increased demand for image display devices, such as digital picture frames. Digital picture frames display one or more electronic images, such as photographs, paintings, and other artistic creations. Digital pictures frames typically include a display and a support structure that allows the digital picture frame to be free-standing or hung on a wall. A bezel or border is provided around the display for ornamental purposes and to protect the display. An operator can control the functions of a typical digital picture frame using buttons located on the bezel or on the support structure of the frame.","An operator of an image display device can control operation of an application and\/or functionality of the image display device using a touch sensitive area located around the display of the image display device. The touch sensitive area, such as a matte, can be divided into one or more regions.","In some implementations, the image display device comprises a display configured to render an image and an identifier of a functionality, a matte having two or more regions that are touch sensitive surrounding the display, and a processor. The processor can be configured to enable presentation of the image on the display and receive a first indication that at least one of the two or more regions of the matte have been touched. In response to reception of the first indication that the at least one of the two or more regions of the matte have been touched, the processor can be configured to associate one of the two or more regions of the matte with a first functionality associated with subsequent interaction with the matte, and enable presentation of an identifier of the first functionality associated with subsequent interaction with the matte overlaid on the image on the display. In addition, the processor can be enabled to receive a second indication that the one region of the matte associated with the first functionality has been touched. In response to reception of the second indication that the one region of the matte associated with the first functionality has been touched, the processor can be configured to perform a function associated with the first functionality, associate the one region of the matte with a second functionality associated with subsequent interaction with the matte that is different from the first functionality, and enable presentation of an identifier of the second functionality associated with subsequent interaction with the matte overlaid on the image on the display.","In some implementations, the image display device comprises comprises a display configured to render an image and an identifier of a functionality, a matte having two or more regions that are touch sensitive surrounding the display, and a processor. The processor can be configured enable presentation of the image on the display, and receive an indication that at least one of the two or more regions of the matte have been touched. In response to reception of the indication that the at least one of the two or more regions of the matte have been touched, the processor can be enable presentation of an identifier of a functionality associated with subsequent interaction with the matte overlaid on the image on the display.","In some implementations, the image display device can be controlled by an operator. Presentation of an image on a display is enabled. A first indication that an operator has touched at least one of two or more regions of a touch sensitive area surrounding the display is received at a first time. In response to reception of the first indication that the at least one of the two or more regions of the touch sensitive area have been touched, presentation of an identifier of a first functionality overlaid on the image on the display is enabled. A second indication that the operator has touched at least one of the two or more regions of the touch sensitive area is received at a second time that is after the first time. In response to reception of the second indication that the at least one of the two or more regions of the touch sensitive area have been touched, presentation of an identifier of a second functionality overlaid on the image on the display is enabled, where the second functionality is different than the first functionality.","Details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other aspects can be implemented in systems will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.","Like reference symbols indicate like elements throughout the specification and drawings.","Techniques, methods, apparatus, and computer program products for touch control of an image display device, such as a digital picture frame, are described. An operator of a digital picture frame can control operation of an application and\/or functionality of the digital picture frame using a touch sensitive area located around the display of the digital picture frame. The touch sensitive area, such as a matte, can completely surround the display of the digital picture frame and can be divided into one or more regions, as described in greater detail below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 17"],"b":["100","150","150","102","150","150"]},"The images can be rendered in several different orders, such as, by image file name, by folder, by date an image was created, by date an image was loaded into an internal memory of the digital picture frame, and\/or by a date range assigned by an operator of the digital picture frame. In some implementations, all of the images received by the digital picture frame can be rendered, while in other implementations only a subset of the images can be rendered. For example, the subset of images can be selected according to a specified date range, as described in greater detail below. In another example, the individual images to be rendered can be selected by the operator, as also described in greater detail below.","A touch sensitive area  surrounds the display . The touch sensitive area  can completely surround the display , as illustrated in , or can partially surround the display . For example, a matte can completely surround the display  and a portion, such as only two sides, of the matte can be touch sensitive. The touch sensitive area  can be divided into one or more regions. For example, as illustrated in , each side of the touch sensitive area  is a separate region, such that the touch sensitive area  includes four regions: top region , right region , bottom region , and left region .","In some implementations, each side of the touch sensitive area  can include multiple equally or differently sized regions. In some implementations, the corners of the touch sensitive area  can be separate regions, such that the top-right corner, bottom-right corner , bottom-left corner , and top-left corner are each separate regions. In other implementations, the corners of the touch sensitive area  can include portions of two different regions. For example, the bottom-right corner  can include portions of the right region  and the bottom region , such that if an operator touches the bottom-right corner , the operator has touched both the right region  and the bottom region . Similarly, the bottom-left corner  can include portions of the bottom region  and the left region , such that if an operator touches the bottom-left corner , the operator has touched both the bottom region  and the left region .","An operator of the digital picture frame can touch any portion of the touch sensitive area  to initiate control of the digital picture frame. For example, as illustrated by the initial functionality GUI , touching any portion of the touch sensitive area  can cause presentation of identifiers (i.e., icons) of various functions and an application of the digital picture frame over an image being displayed on the display . For example, the rotation icon  represents the function of rotating the image over which the icons are being displayed. The deletion icon  represents the function of deleting the image over which the icons are being displayed.","The top region  of the touch sensitive area  is associated with the functions of rotating and deleting an image, such that an operator of the digital picture frame can choose to rotate and\/or delete an image by touching the top region . For example, if an operator briefly touches (e.g., taps) the top region , the image being displayed can be rotated 90-degrees counter clockwise, as illustrated in rotation GUI  in . In some implementations, the image can be rotated 90-degrees clockwise or 180-degrees in response to the operator tapping the top region . In addition, the rotated version of the image can be stored in memory, such that the next time the image is rendered, it will be automatically rotated.","If the operator uninterruptedly touches the top region  for greater than a predetermined amount of time, such as, for example, two seconds, the image being displayed can be deleted. In some implementations, an image deletion GUI  is presented to the operator to confirm deletion of the image before the image is deleted, as illustrated in . The image deletion GUI  includes deletion icon , cancel icon , and text area . The deletion icon  can be the same as or different from the deletion icon . In some implementations, instead of deletion icon  and cancel icon , the GUI can present the text \u201cYes\u201d and \u201cNo,\u201d respectively. The operator can toggle between icons  and  by touching the left region  and\/or the right region . The selected icon can be visually distinguished from the other icon by, for example, changing the size and\/or color of the selected icon. In addition, a description of the function corresponding to the selected icon can be displayed in text area . For example, image deletion GUI  shows that the operator has selected the deletion icon  and \u201cDELETE\u201d is shown in the text area . By touching the top region , the operator can confirm deletion of the image being displayed and, in response, the image is deleted from memory. In other implementations, the image can be deleted without confirmation of the deletion and, therefore, GUI  will not be presented to the operator.","Returning to the initial functionality GUI , the next image icon  represents the function of rendering another image stored in memory. The previous image icon  represents the function of rendering an image that was rendered immediately before the image currently being rendered on the display . The right region  of the touch sensitive area  is associated with the function of rendering the next image, such that the operator can choose to view the next image by touching the right region . The left region  is associated with the function of rendering the previous image, such that the operator can choose to view the previous image by touching the left region .","If the operator briefly touches the right region  or the left region , the image immediately following or immediately preceding the image being displayed is rendered. In addition, if the operator uninterruptedly touches the right region  or the left region  for greater than a predetermined amount of time, such as, for example, two seconds, multiple next or previous images can be consecutively rendered according to a predetermined time interval, such as, for example, 250 milliseconds, until the operator stops touching the touch sensitive area . The identifiers of the various functions and application of the digital picture frame are not changed as the operator touches the right region  or the left region  to view different images.","The pause icon  represents the function of pausing the consecutive display of images (i.e., pausing an image slideshow) on the display . The play icon  represents a function of resuming the consecutive display of images on the display . The lock icon  represents the function of securing the image against alteration and\/or deletion. The bottom region  of the touch sensitive area  is associated with the functions of pausing and resuming the rending of images, and locking an image. For example, if the operator briefly touches the bottom region  while the display  is consecutively rendering images, the consecutive rendering of images will be paused. In another example, if the operator briefly touches the bottom region  while the rendering of images is paused, the consecutive rendering of images will be resumed.","In addition, if the operator uninterruptedly touches the bottom region  for greater than a predetermined amount of time, such as, for example, two seconds, the image will be locked and alteration and\/or deletion of the image will be restricted. An indication that the image has been locked can be saved in memory. The consecutive rendering of images will be paused while the operator is uninterruptedly touching the bottom region  to lock the image.","Although the pause icon , play icon , and lock icon  are all displayed in the initial functionality GUI , in some implementations, only one or two of the three icons , , and  can be displayed at the same time. For example, while the display  is consecutively rendering images, only the pause icon  can be displayed. In this example, the bottom region  of the touch sensitive area  is associated only with the function of pausing the consecutive rendering of image. Then, after the operator chooses to pause the consecutive rendering of images, only the play icon  can be displayed, and the bottom region  of the touch sensitive area  is associated only with the function of resuming the consecutive rendering of image. In some implementations, the lock icon  can also be displayed when the pause icon  is displayed and\/or when the play icon  is displayed.","The power off icon  represents the function of turning off the digital picture frame. In some implementations where the bottom-left corner  includes portions of the bottom region  and the left region , the bottom region  and the left region  are both associated with the function of turning off the digital picture frame. The digital picture frame is turned off in response to the operator simultaneously touching portions of both the bottom region  and the left region , such as by touching the ends of the bottom region  and the left region  that make up the bottom-left corner . In other implementations where the bottom-left corner  is a separate touch sensitive region, the bottom-left corner region is associated with turning off the digital picture frame.","In some implementations, the operator may be required to uninterruptedly touch the bottom-left corner  for greater than a predetermined amount of time, such as, for example, two seconds, to turn the digital picture frame off. In addition, the operator may be presented with a power down confirmation GUI to confirm that the digital picture frame should be turned off.","The settings icon  represents the function of accessing an application to select images and\/or adjust the settings of the digital picture frame. In some implementations where the bottom-right corner  includes portions of the right region  and the bottom region , both the right region  and the bottom region  are associated with the function of accessing the settings application. The settings application is accessed in response to the operator simultaneously touching portions of both the right region  and the bottom region , such as by touching the ends of the right region  and the bottom region  that make up the bottom-right corner . In other implementations where the bottom-right corner  is a separate touch sensitive region, the bottom-right corner region is associated with accessing the setting application. In some implementations, the operator may be required to uninterruptedly touch the bottom-right corner  for greater than a predetermined amount of time, such as, for example, two seconds, to access the settings application.","In response to the operator selecting the settings icon  by touching the bottom-right corner , the initial settings GUI  is presented to the operator on the display , as illustrated in . The image selection icon  represents the function of enabling the operator to select images to be rendered on the display . The frame preferences icon  represents the function of enabling the operator to access and modify the settings of the digital picture frame.","The operator can toggle between icons  and  by touching the left region  and\/or the right region . The selected icon can be visually distinguished from the other icon by, for example, changing the size and\/or color of the selected icon, and\/or drawing a border  around the selected icon. In addition, a description of the function corresponding to the selected icon can be displayed in text area . For example, the initial settings GUI  shows that the operator has selected the image selection icon  and \u201cSELECT IMAGES\u201d is shown in the text area . By touching the top region , the operator can select that the function associated with the selected icon be performed.","The play icon  displayed in GUI  represents the function of resuming the consecutive display of images on the display  and is associated with the bottom region . By touching the bottom region , the operator can exit the initial settings GUI  and the display  will resume the consecutive rendering of images. The power off icon  represents the function of turning off the digital picture frame.","In response to the operator selecting the image selection icon , image selection GUI  is presented to the operator on display , as illustrated in . The image selection GUI  includes the option  to select all images that have a horizontal orientation, option  to select all images that have a vertical orientation, option  to select all images, option  to enable the operator to select images by viewing thumbnails of the images, and option  to enable the operator to select images by date. The operator can toggle between options - by touching the left region  and\/or the right region . The selected option can be visually distinguished from the other options by, for example, changing the font, size, and\/or color of the selected option. In addition, a description of the function corresponding to the selected option can be displayed in text area . For example, image selection GUI  shows that the operator has selected the option  and \u201cSELECT ALL HORIZONTAL\u201d is shown in the text area . By touching the top region , the operator can select that the function associated with the selected option be performed.","The play icon , power off icon , and settings icon  are also included in the image selection GUI . By selecting the settings icon , the operator is returned to the initial settings GUI .","In response to the operator selecting the option  to select images by viewing thumbnails, thumbnail GUI  is presented to the operator on display , as illustrated in . The thumbnail GUI  includes thumbnails, such as thumbnail , of all or some of the images received by the digital picture frame. The operator can toggle between thumbnails by touching the left region  and\/or the right region . The thumbnail currently being considered by the operator can be visually distinguished from the other thumbnails by, for example, changing the size and\/or background color of the thumbnail. By touching the top region , the operator can select the thumbnail being considered and, in response, the image corresponding to that thumbnail will be rendered by the display  when the display resumes consecutive display of the images. The selected thumbnails, such as thumbnail , can be visually distinguished from the unselected thumbnails by, for example, adding a border around the selected thumbnails, and\/or changing the size and\/or background color of the selected thumbnails.","In response to the operator selecting the option  to select images by date, date GUI  is presented to the operator on display , as illustrated in . The date GUI  includes a calendar of the current month and\/or year, or any other month and\/or year. The operator can toggle between the month indicator  and the day indicators, such as day indicator , by touching the left region  and\/or the right region . The month and\/or day indicator currently being considered by the operator can be visually distinguished from the other indicators by, for example, changing the size and\/or background color of the indicator. By touching the top region , the operator can choose that images associated with the selected day, month, and\/or year be rendered by the display  when the display resumes consecutive display of the images. In some implementations, the date associated with an image may be the date the image was created (e.g., the date a picture was taken), the date the image was received by the digital picture frame, the date of an event depicted by the image, and\/or the date the image was last modified.","For example, if the month indicator  is selected by the operator, all images that were created in May 2005 can be selected to be rendered by the display . In another example, if the day indicator  is selected by the operator, all images that were created on May 1, 2005 can be selected to be rendered by the display . The selected month and day indicators can be visually distinguished from the other month and\/or day indicators by, for example, adding a border around the selected indicators, and\/or changing the size and\/or background color of the selected indicators.","In some implementations, only dates having associated images are enabled to be considered and, therefore, selected by the operator. For example, at least one image received by the digital picture frame may have been created on May 1, 2005 and, therefore, May 1, 2005 is enabled to be considered by the operator. Enabled month and\/or day indicators can be visually distinguished from the other indicators by, for example, changing the size and\/or background color of the enabled indicators. In some implementations, when the operator is toggling between the month and\/or day indicators, the non-enabled date indicators (i.e., those dates not associated with any received images) are skipped.","In response to the operator selecting the preferences icon  of GUI , frame preference GUI  is presented to the operator on display , as illustrated in . The frame preference GUI  includes the option  for selecting the delay and order of images on the display , the option  for selecting the transition type between images, the option  for selecting display effects of the images, the option  for selecting the display image size, the option  for selecting the displayed text associated with the images, the option  for selecting adjustments to the display , the option  for setting the current date and time, the option  for selecting whether and when the digital picture frame should be automatically turned on and off, and the option  for restoring the default preferences of the digital picture frame.","The operator can toggle between options - by touching the left region  and\/or the right region . The selected option can be visually distinguished from the other options by, for example, changing the font, size, and\/or color of the selected option. In addition, a description of the function corresponding to the selected option can be displayed in text area . For example, frame preference GUI  shows that the operator has selected the option  and \u201cCLICK TO SUBMIT DELAY\u201d is shown in the text area . By touching the top region , the operator can select that the function associated with the selected option be performed.","In response to the operator selecting the option , frame preference GUI  enables the operator to select the time period between a transition from one image to another on display . The operator can also select to randomly display (i.e., shuffle) the images. The operator can toggle between time periods and the option to shuffle by touching the left region  and\/or the right region . The selected time period and shuffle option can be visually distinguished from the others by, for example, changing the font, size, and\/or color of the selected time period and shuffle option. By touching the top region , the operator can select that the time period and the shuffle option of interest.","In response to the operator selecting the option , transition preference GUI  enables the operator to select a transition type between one image to another on display , as illustrated in . The transition types can include fading, fading through black, fading through white, vertical swiping, horizontal swiping, image flipping, page flipping, a random transition type, or no transition type. The operator can toggle between the transition type options by touching the left region  and\/or the right region . The selected transition type option can be visually distinguished from the other transition type options by, for example, changing the font, size, and\/or color of the selected transition type option. By touching the top region , the operator can select that the transition type option of interest.","In response to the operator selecting the option , display effects GUI  enables the operator to select a display effect for display of the images, as illustrated in . The display effects can include displaying the images in black and white, in sepia tone, or in color. The operator can toggle between the display effects by touching the left region  and\/or the right region . The selected display effect can be visually distinguished from the other transition types by, for example, changing the font, size, and\/or color of the selected display effect. By touching the top region , the operator can select that the display effect of interest.","In response to the operator selecting the option , image size GUI  enables the operator to select a display size or effect for the display of the images, as illustrated in . The display sizes and effects can include dynamic panning and zooming, smart cropping, scaling to fit the display , and displaying the entire image. The operator can toggle between the display image sizes and effects by touching the left region  and\/or the right region . The selected display image size or effect option can be visually distinguished from the other options by, for example, changing the font, size, and\/or color of the selected option. By touching the top region , the operator can select that the display image size or effect of interest.","The dynamic panning and zooming function can, for example, initially cause display of a particular region and\/or object of an image and then pan to the other regions of the image. For example, if an image includes a face, facial recognition software included in the digital picture frame can recognize the region of the image including the face. When the image is displayed using the dynamic panning and zooming function, that region including the face is initially rendered and then other regions of the images are displayed in, for example, a zigzag pattern. In another example, the dynamic panning and zooming can always initially display a predefined region of the image, such as a corner of the image, and pan to other regions of the image in a random and\/or predefined pattern.","The smart cropping function can, for example, identify an object of interest included in picture and choose to crop the image so that the object of interest is centered in the displayed image. For example, if an image includes a face, the facial recognition software can identify the face as the object of interest. A predetermined area, based on the size and resolution of the display , around the object of interest can be selected and the other portions of the image can be cropped.","The scaling to fit the display function can, for example, use the size of the display  and the size of the image to be rendered to determine a scaling factor to be applied to the image so that the entire image is rendered on the display . For example, if the display  is eight inches by eight inches and the image is twelve inches by twelve inches, the image can be scaled down 25 percent to fit the display .","In response to the operator selecting the option , text option GUI  enables the operator to select the text to be displayed with the images, as illustrated in . The text can be stored in a header and\/or tag of the image, and\/or in a text file associated with the image. The text options can include displaying the image titles, one or more dates associated with the images, the titles and one or more dates associated with the images, and no text. The operator can toggle between the text options by touching the left region  and\/or the right region . The selected text option can be visually distinguished from the other text options by, for example, changing the font, size, and\/or color of the selected text option. By touching the top region , the operator can select that the text option of interest.","In response to the operator selecting the option , display adjustment GUI  enables the operator to set the characteristics of the display , as illustrated in . The display characteristics can include contrast, brightness, and temperature of the display . The operator can toggle between the display characteristics by touching the left region  and\/or the right region . The selected display characteristic can be visually distinguished from the other display characteristics by, for example, changing the font, size, and\/or color of the selected display characteristic. The value of the selected display characteristic can be adjusted by touching the left region  and\/or the right region . By touching the top region , the operator can select that the value of the selected display characteristic.","In response to the operator selecting the option , date and time setting GUI  enables the operator to set the current date and time, as illustrated in . The date and time display format, the month, the day, the year, the hour, and the minutes can be set by the operator. In response to the operator selecting the option , auto setting GUI  enables the operator to enable or disable the automatic turning on and off of the digital picture frame, as illustrated in . The time that the frame is to be turned on and the time that the frame is to be turned off can be specified by the operator. In response to the operator selecting the option , default setting confirmation GUI  enables the operator to confirm that the default settings of the digital picture frame should be restored, as illustrated in .","In some implementations, as described above, once the operator places a memory card in the memory card reader of the digital picture frame, the digital picture frame will automatically (i.e., without human interaction) start to consecutively render the images stored on the memory card on the display . In other implementations, once the operator places a memory card in the memory card reader of the digital picture frame, the transfer GUI  illustrated in  enables the operator to select that the images be rendered directly from the memory card or select that the images stored on the memory card be transferred to an internal memory of the digital picture frame.","In one example, if the internal memory of the digital picture frame does not have enough storage capacity to store all of the images on the memory card, the operator can select the specific images to be transferred and\/or the images matching a particular criteria, such as being associated with a particular date range, can be transferred. The unlocked images stored in the internal memory of the digital picture frame can be deleted to create additional space for the images to be transferred from the memory card. For example, the operator can specify that particular unlocked images to be deleted. In another example, the digital picture frame can delete unlocked images based on the date that the images were stored on the internal memory, such that older images are deleted before newer images, or vice-versa. In yet another example, the digital picture frame can delete unlocked images based on the frequency with which the images were rendered, such that the images rendered a higher number of times are deleted before images rendered a lower number of times, or vice-versa. In still another example, the operator can select to delete unlocked images being associated with a particular folder, date, and\/or date range.","In some implementations, rather than the images being transferred from a memory card to the internal memory of the digital picture frame, the images to be transferred can be received from, for example, a network, a web service, an image capturing device, and\/or a computer. In addition, rather than the images from the memory card being transferred to the internal memory of the digital picture frame, the images can be transferred to a network storage device, a web service, an image capturing device, and\/or a computer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIG. 18","b":["1800","1800","105","150","1801","1803","1805","1813","1819","1821","1823","1825"]},"The touch sensor  can be an type of touch sensor, such as, for example, an electrostatic sensor. In some implementations, the touch sensor  can include one or more buttons that can detect when the operator presses down on the matte.","The processor  is capable of processing instructions for execution within the device . For example, the processor can receive images from the internal memory , media reader , network module , image capture device , detachable mass storage device , and\/or TV\/video out\/input module  for display on the display . The processor can also receive indications that a particular region or location of the touch sensor  has been touched from the touch sensor . In one implementation, the processor  is a single-threaded processor. In another implementation, the processor  is a multi-threaded processor. The processor  is capable of processing instructions stored in, for example, the internal memory  to display images and graphical information for a GUI on the display .","The display  is configured to render an image. In various different implementations, for example, display  can include a liquid crystal display (LCD), a plasma display, a digital light processing (DLP) display, an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display, or any other type of display device configured to render an image. In some implementations, some or all of the display  can be touch sensitive. For example, a region along the perimeter of the display  may be touch sensitive.","The internal memory  stores information, such as images, computer instruction, and\/or device settings, within the device . In one implementation, the internal memory  is a random access memory. In one implementation, the internal memory  is a volatile memory unit. In another implementation, the internal memory  is a non-volatile memory unit.","The media reader  receives various media, such as compact flash cards , secure digital cards , and smart media cards . The media reader  reads data, such as images, from the various media and can provide that data to the processor .","The network module  is a communication device configured to exchange communications with a local area network  and\/or the Internet . The network module  may be a wireless communication module configured to exchange wireless communications. For example, the network module  may be a wireless communication device configured to exchange communications over a wireless data channel and a wireless voice channel. The wireless communication device may include one or more of a Bluetooth module, a GSM module, a radio modem, cellular transmission module, or any type of module configured to exchange communications in one of the following formats: GSM or GPRS, CDMA, EDGE or EGPRS, EV-DO or EVDO, UMTS, or IP.","In some implementations, the network module  can communicate with a web service, such as, for example, a photo-storing, photo-sharing service, and\/or social networking service, over the Internet  to receive images to be displayed on the device . The network module  can communicate with another device, such as, for example, a personal computer and\/or media center, over the local area network  to receive images to be displayed on the device .","In some implementations, the image capture device  can be an image capture device that is integral to the image display device , such as a digital camera that is incorporated in the image display device . In other implementations, the image capture device  can be detachably connected to the image display device  though a connection module, such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) and\/or IEEE 1394 interface module. In various different implementations, the image capture device  can, for example, include a digital camera, a scanner, and a digital camcorder. The image capture device  can forward images to the internal memory , detachable mass storage device , memory cards , , and , and\/or network module .","The detachable mass storage device  is capable of providing mass storage for the device . In one implementation, the detachable mass storage device  is a computer-readable medium. In various different implementations, the detachable mass storage device  can, for example, include a hard disk device, an optical disk device, or some other large capacity storage device.","The TV\/video output\/input module  provides input\/output operations for the device . In one implementation, the TV\/video output\/input module  includes a module, such as, for example, a digital video connector, configured to output or input image and video information.","The power supply  can be, for example, a plug that connects to an AC power supply that connects to a standard wall power outlet. In other examples, power supply  can receive power through a USB cable that is connected to the device . In other implementations, the power supply  may be local to the device , such as a battery. In yet other examples, the power supply  can be a module configured to receive wireless power signals to power the device .","A module can be a piece of hardware that encapsulates a function. A module can perform one or more functions, and one piece of hardware can perform the functions of more than one of the modules described herein. Similarly, more than one piece of hardware can be used to perform the function of a single module described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":"FIG. 19","b":["1900","1800","1900","1801"]},"Initially, at least one image is received (step ). The at least one image can be received by the processor  from the internal memory , media reader , network module , image capture device , detachable mass storage device , and\/or TV\/video output\/input module . After the at least one image is received, it is processed by the processor  for presentation on the display (step ). For example, if the at least one images is stored in a compressed file format, such as the JPG format, the processor can uncompress the image before the image is rendered. In another example, if the operator of the device  has selected a display characteristic, such as displaying images in black and white, as described above in connection with , the processor can process the at least one image according to the selected characteristic.","Next, the processor  receives a first indication that at least one region of the touch sensitive area  has been touched (step ). In some implementations, the first indication can identify the region of the touch sensitive area  that has been touched. If more than one region of the touch sensitive area  has been touched, the indication can identify both regions to indicate, for example, that a corner has been touched. In other implementations, the indication can identify the coordinates of the region where the touch sensitive area  has been touched. The processor  can distinguish between brief touches and touches that are greater than a predetermined time period.","In response to receiving the first indication, the processor  enables presentation of an identifier of a first functionality overlaid on the image being rendered by the display (step ). For example, if the display  is consecutively rendering images when the first indication is received, the initial functionality GUI , including icons , , , , , , , , and , can be presented on the display . The first functionality can be any one of the functionalities described above, such as, for example, the pausing functionality associated with icon .","Then, the processor associates a region of the touch sensitive area  with the first functionality (step ). For example, if the first functionality is the pausing functionality associated with icon , the bottom region  is associated with the pausing functionality, as described above in connection with . In some implementations, only those regions associated with one or more functionalities are enabled and those regions not associated with any functionality are disabled.","Next, the processor  receives a second indication that the region of the touch sensitive area  associated with the first functionality has been touched (step ). By selecting the region of the touch sensitive area  associated with the first functionality, the operator requests that the device  perform the function associated with the first functionality. For example, as described above in connection with , the operator touches the bottom region  associated with the pausing functionality to effect pausing of the consecutive display of images.","In response to receiving the second indication, the processor  performs the function associated with the first functionality (step ). For example, continuing the example above, in response to receiving a second indication that the operator has touched the bottom region  associated with the pausing functionality, the processor  will pause the consecutive display of images.","The processor  will then enable presentation of an identifier of a second functionality overlaid on the image being rendered by the display  (step ). In some implementations, the second functionality can be different from the first functionality. For example, after the consecutive display of images has been paused, the play icon  can be presented instead of the pause icon  to resume the consecutive display of images on the display . The resuming functionality will be associated with the bottom region  of the touch sensitive area  (step ).","A number of implementations have been described. Nevertheless, it will be understood that various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the claims. For example, if the image display device  is rotated 90 degrees, the image being displayed by the display  can automatically (i.e., without human interaction) be rotated 90 degrees, as illustrated by rotation GUI  in . In addition, the previous the top region  becomes the left region , the previous the right region  becomes the top region , the previous the bottom region  becomes the right region , and the previous the left region  becomes the bottom region .","At least some of the display  can be touch sensitive, replacing the touch sensor  of the image display device . For example, a region extending a predetermined distance (e.g., outer periphery) from the perimeter of the display  can be touch sensitive. The top portion of the outer periphery can correspond to the top region , the right portion of the outer periphery can correspond to the right region , the bottom portion of the outer periphery can correspond to the bottom region , and the left portion of the outer periphery can correspond to the left region .","The touch sensitive area  can determine the coordinate being touched by the operator. The processor  can associate predefined coordinates with various functions. For example, the coordinates of the top region  of the touch sensitive area  can be associated with the rotating and deleting functions. If multiple regions are defined on each side of the display, the coordinates of the subregions can each be associated with a different function. For example, a top quarter of the right side of the touch sensitive area  can be associated with a first functionality and a second quarter of the right side of the touch sensitive area  can be associated with a second functionality.","Visual indicators of the regions can be displayed on the display . For example, a bar can be displayed along the periphery of the display  corresponding to length of each region. When the four regions - are associated with functionalities, bars can extend along the entire periphery of the display  to indicate to the operator that the four regions are selectable. When only a single region, such as top region , is selectable, a bar can extend only along the top side of the display . In some implementations, the visual indicators can be displayed during the entire period the region is selectable. In other implementations, the visual indicators can be displayed during a predetermined time period, such as, for example, three seconds, after the region is activated.","The identifiers of the functions, options, and applications of the image display device  will cease to be rendered over the image if operator does not again touch the touch sensitive area  within a predetermined period of time, such as, for example, five seconds, after previously the touching the touch sensitive area . For example, if GUI  is displayed on the display  in response to receiving the first indication that the operator has touched the touch sensitive area , icons , , , , , , , , and , will cease to be presented on the display  if the operator does not touch the touch sensitive area  again within five seconds.","In some implementations, to power on the image display device , the operator can touch any region or a particular region of the touch sensitive area . In other implementations, the image display device  can include a power on switch or button.","The processor  can be configured to play videos, and the image display device  can include one or more speakers to play sound, such as a sound associated with an image and\/or with a video.","Multiple image display devices can be interconnected to share images. In some implementations, the multiple image display devices can be synchronized to have the same preferences and display the same images simultaneously.","Portions of the display  that are not used to display an image can be filled in with a particular color, such as black.","The images can be associated with geographic locations, such as, for example, the geographic location that the image was created (e.g., the geographic location that a picture was taken). For example, the operator can choose to select images being associated with one or more particular geographic regions to be rendered on the display . In another example, the operator can choose to display text of the geographic location associated with the image. In yet another example, the operator can choose to delete or lock images in the internal memory  being associated with one or more particular geographic regions.","The processor instructions for touch controlling the image display device can be packaged as an operating system that can be ported to various image display devices. The operating system can include an application programming interface (API) to support the building of applications for the operating system. The applications can control new GUIs for setting image display preferences, and include additional indicators of functions associated with the image display device. In addition, the applications can specify the regions of the touch sensitive area to be associated with the various functions. Developers can write applications that can be transferred to the image display device via, for example, the media reader , network module , and\/or detachable mass storage device .","It is to be understood the implementations are not limited to particular devices or processes described which may, of course, vary.
