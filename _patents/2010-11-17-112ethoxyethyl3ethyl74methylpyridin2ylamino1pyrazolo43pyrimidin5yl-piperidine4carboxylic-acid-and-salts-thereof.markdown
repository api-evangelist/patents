{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 11\/558,306 filed Nov. 09, 2006 now abandoned, which claims the benefit of priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60\/735,320, filed Nov. 10, 2005, each of which are herein incorporated by reference for any reason.","The present invention relates generally to 1-(1-(2-ethoxyethyl)-3-ethyl-7-(4-methylpyridin-2-ylamino)-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)piperidine-4-carboxylic acid and its salts. The present invention further relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising this compound or its salts, methods of treatment employing this compound or its salts, and methods of preparing this compound or its salts. In general, the compound and its salts inhibit the cyclic guanylate monophosphate-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (\u201cPDE5\u201d) enzyme.","Hypertension is a condition associated with, among other physiological problems, an increased risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease and renal impairment. Despite the numerous drugs available in various pharmacological categories to treat hypertension and related physiological problems, not all patients respond to such drugs as effectively or as safely as desired. Additional therapeutic agents for the treatment of hypertension and\/or related conditions are still needed.","One class of therapeutic agents reported in the literature as useful for the treatment of hypertension are inhibitors of the PDE5 enzyme (\u201cPDE5 inhibitors\u201d). In general, vascular endothelial cells secrete nitric oxide which acts on vascular smooth muscle cells and leads to the activation of guanylate cyclase and the accumulation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (\u201ccGMP\u201d). The accumulation of cGMP causes the muscles to relax and the blood vessels to dilate, leading to a reduction in blood pressure. The cGMP is inactivated by hydrolysis to guanosine 5\u2032-monophosphate (\u201cGMP\u201d) by cGMP-specific phosphodiesterases. One cGMP-phosphodiesterase involved in the inactivation of cGMP is the PDE5 enzyme. Inhibitors of the PDE5 enzyme decrease the rate of cGMP hydrolysis. This reduction in cGMP hydrolysis potentiates the actions of nitric oxide leading to a lowering of blood pressure.","Compounds that are PDE5 inhibitors have been reported in the literature. For example, WO2005049616 reports one class of pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidinyl compounds. WO2005049617 reports another class of pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidinyl compounds. WO2004096810 reports another class of pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidinyl compounds. EP 1348707 reports another class of pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidinyl compounds.","The identification of additional compounds that are PDE5 inhibitors is desirable. Such compounds can be used to treat subjects suffering from or susceptible to hypertension and\/or related physiological problems and further expand the range of treatment options available for such subjects.","In one embodiment, the invention comprises 1-(1-(2-ethoxyethyl)-3-ethyl-7-(4-methylpyridin-2-ylamino)-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)piperidine-4-carboxylic acid and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts.","In another embodiment, the invention comprises a pharmaceutical composition comprising 1-(1-(2-ethoxyethyl)-3-ethyl-7-(4-methylpyridin-2-ylamino)-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)piperidine-4-carboxylic acid, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier.","In another embodiment, the invention comprises a pharmaceutical composition comprising 1-(1-(2-ethoxyethyl)-3-ethyl-7-(4-methylpyridin-2-ylamino)-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)piperidine-4-carboxylic acid, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, one or more additional therapeutic agents, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.","In another embodiment, the invention comprises methods for treating a condition in a subject by administering to a subject a therapeutically effective amount of 1-(1-(2-ethoxyethyl)-3-ethyl-7-(4-methylpyridin-2-ylamino)-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)piperidine-4-carboxylic acid, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.

Administration and Dosing","The Carboxypiperidine Compound is generally administered in a therapeutically effective amount. In one embodiment, the Carboxypiperidine Compound is administered in a PDE5 enzyme inhibiting amount. The Carboxypiperidine Compound can be administered by any suitable route in the form of a pharmaceutical composition adapted to such a route, and in a dose effective for the treatment intended. Therapeutically effective doses of the Carboxypiperidine Compound required to prevent or arrest the progress of, or to treat the medical condition, are readily ascertained by one of ordinary skill in the art using preclinical and clinical approaches familiar to the medicinal arts.","The dosage regimen for the compounds and\/or compositions containing the compounds is based on a variety of factors, including the type, age, weight, sex and medical condition of the patient; the severity of the condition; the route of administration; and the activity of the particular compound employed. Thus the dosage regimen may vary based on the specific situation. Dosage levels from about 0.001 mg to about 100 mg of Carboxypiperidine Compound per kilogram of body weight per day are useful in the treatment of the above-indicated conditions. In one embodiment, the total daily dose of the Carboxypiperidine Compound (administered in single or divided doses) is typically from about 0.001 mg\/kg to about 20 mg\/kg (i.e., mg compound\/kg body weight). In another embodiment, the total daily dose of the Carboxypiperidine Compound is from about 0.005 mg\/kg to about 10 mg\/kg. In another embodiment, the total daily dose is from about 0.005 mg\/kg to about 5 mg\/kg. In another embodiment, the total daily dose is from about 0.01 mg\/kg to about 1 mg\/kg. These dosages are based on an average human subject having a weight of about 65 kg to about 75 kg. A physician will readily be able to determine doses for subjects whose weight falls outside of this range, such as infants. The administration of the Carboxypiperidine Compound can be repeated a plurality of times in a day (typically no greater than 4 times) to achieve the desired daily dose.","For convenience the Carboxypiperidine Compound can be administered in a unit dosage form. If desired, multiple doses per day of the unit dosage form can be used to increase the total daily dose. The unit dosage form, for example, may be a tablet or capsule containing about 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 250 or 500 mg of the Carboxypiperidine Compound.

Urology 159(6), 2164-2171, 1998. The PDE5 enzyme isolated from human platelets can be used to catalyze the hydrolysis of [H]cGMP (Amersham Biosciences) to 5\u2032 nucleotide [H]GMP. The [H]GMP binds to yttrium silicate SPA beads (Amersham Biosciences) and is detected by scintillation counting. More specifically, the effect of the test compound at different concentrations can be evaluated in the assay by contacting the compound with a fixed amount of PDE5 enzyme in the presence of substrate (cGMP or cAMP in a 3:1 ratio unlabelled to [H]-labeled). Scintillation counting can be used as described above to determine relative PDE5 enzyme activity. The inhibition of PDE5 enzyme activity is then calculated relative to total PDE5 enzyme activity of uninhibited controls.","PDE5 ICAssay: 96-well microtiter plate format","Reagents",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0182","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["Buffer A: 20 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM MgCl, pH 7.4","Buffer B: 2 mg\/ml BSA in Buffer A (enzyme buffer)","cGMP substrate: Final concentration of 500 nM in assay\n\nThe amount of H-labeled substrate added depends upon the specific activity of [H]cGMP, and the cGMP substrate is diluted with a 10 mM stock of cold cGMP in Buffer A for a final substrate concentration of 500 nM in the assay.\n","PDE enzyme: Prepared in Buffer B.

As more specifically described below, a test compound that inhibits PDE5 activity elicits a relaxation of the aortic ring by enhancing the cGMP signal (i.e., by inhibiting PDE5 enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of cGMP to GMP) evoked when the aortic ring is exposed to a stable exogenous nitric oxide donor, such as diethyltriamine NONOate (diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate, also known as \u201cDETA-NO\u201d). The assay measures the ECvalue for the test compound (i.e., the concentration of the test compound which produces 50% of the maximum possible effective response for the test compound).","Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-350 g) are asphyxiated using COgas and their thoracic aortas carefully excised and placed in Krebs buffer. The aortas are then carefully dissected free of connective tissue and divided into 8 sections, each 3-4 mm in length.","Aortic rings are suspended between parallel stainless steel wires in a water jacketed (37\u00b0 C.), 15 mL tissue bath under a resting tension of 1 gram. Tension is measured using isometric tension transducers and recorded using Ponemah tissue platform system. Each preparation is allowed to equilibrate for at least 60 minutes prior to compound testing. During this time, the tissues are also incubated with 200 uM NG-monomethyl L-arginine (\u201cL-NMMA\u201d), and the incubation media changed every 15 to 20 minutes (L-NMMA is added after each wash to maintain the final concentration at 200 uM in each tissue bath).","Following the equilibration period, baseline tensions are recorded for each tissue. The vasoconstrictor response to phenylepherine (1 uM) is assessed and when the response to phenylepherine reaches a maximum, vascular reactivity is subsequently assessed by a challenge of acetylcholine (1 uM). Following another washout period, a second baseline value is recorded after adding the vasoconstrictor noradrenaline (25 nM) to each bath and incubating the tissues for a time period (about 15 minutes) sufficient for the tissues to achieve a stable tone. An exogenous nitric oxide drive is supplied using the stable nitric oxide donor, DETA-NO. The concentration of DETA-NO is titrated (cumulatively in half-log increments) to achieve approximately 5 to 15% relaxation of the noradrenaline-evoked preconstriction. Cumulative concentration-response curves are constructed in a single ring, typically using 5 doses\/ring and allowing 15 minutes between each addition.","Method 4A: Alternative Aortic Ring Assay","Method 4 can be modified to provide an alternative protocol for measuring the direct relaxation of rat aortic rings exposed to a test compound. This alternative method varies from Method 4 as described below:","For the alternative method, the endothelium is first removed by gently rubbing the lumen of the vessel together between the fingers prior to preparing the rings (denuded rings). The resting tension is set at 2 grams and the vasoconstrictor response to a maximal concentration of phenylepherine (1 \u03bcM) is assessed, followed (after a washout period) by two further exposures to 300 nM of pheylephrine. The concentration-response relationship to noradrenaline is constructed in each tissue over concentration range 0.1 to 300 nM. After another washout period, the tissues are constricted with an ECconcentration of noradrenaline for compound testing.","Method 5: Culex\u2122 Assay","The effect of a test compound on systemic arterial blood pressure can be evaluated in a conscious pre-cannulated spontaneously hypertensive rat (\u201cSHR\u201d) model. This assay is conducted using an automated blood sampler (\u201cABS\u201d) system. The Culex\u2122 ABS system (Bioanalytical System, Inc., West Lafayette, Ind.) comprises a laptop computer, four control units and metabolic cages. This ABS system allows for the collection of multiple blood samples from a single rat without causing undue stress to the animal. In addition, the ABS system allows for the collection of urine samples that can be potentially used for biomarker identifications. Through this approach, efficacy and standard pharmacokinetic studies are conducted in the conscious unrestrained SHR rats simultaneously to define the relationship between plasma free drug concentration or potential biomarker(s) and pharmacological effect (reduction of mean arterial blood pressure).","SHR rats at 12 to 16 weeks of age, weighing about 300 g, undergo surgerical cannulation of both jugular veins and the right carotid artery. After surgical recovery, animals are placed in the Culex\u2122 cages and tethered to a movement-responsive arm with a sensor that controls cage movement when the animal moves to prevent the catheters from being twisted. Connections are made between the right jugular catheter and the Culex\u2122 sterile tubing set for blood sampling, and the left jugular catheter for compound administration, and the catheter in the right carotid artery is connected to a pressure transducer for monitoring blood pressure. To keep the patency of the catheters, the right jugular cannula is maintained by the \u201ctend\u201d function of the Culex\u2122 that flushes the catheter with 20 \u03bcL heparin saline (10 units\/mL) every 12 minutes or between sampling events, and the left jugular cannula is filled with heparin saline (20 units\/mL). The patency of the right carotid cannula is maintained by slow infusion of heparin saline either directly into the extend tubing when blood pressure is not recorded or through the pressure transducer during the blood pressure monitoring. Animals are allowed to acclimate for at least two hours before compound evaluation. The test compound may be administered intravenously or by oral gavage. Blood sampling protocols (sampling time and volume) are programmed using the Culex\u2122 software. The total amount of blood withdrawn from each animal will not exceed 750 pU24 hrs and 10 mUkg within two weeks. Heart rate, blood pressure, and drug concentration are monitored. Systemic arterial blood pressure and heart rate are recorded by PONEMAH (Gould Instrument System, Valley View, Ohio), a pressure transducer through a data acquisition system for recording blood pressure and heart rate, for 6 to 24 hours based on experimental protocol. Mean arterial blood pressure (primary endpoint) is analyzed for assessing the efficacy of the compound.","Blood samples are analyzed for measuring plasma drug concentration, using the LC\/MS\/MS method described below, and for evaluating potential biomarkers.","LC\/MS\/MS Method","Sample Preparation: Plasma samples (50 \u03bcL unknown, control or blank) are mixed with 10 \u03bcL acetonitrile:water or a standard solution of the test compound and 150 \u03bcL of internal standard solution (100 ng\/mL of the test compound in acetonitrile). The mixture is centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min, and 125 \u03bcL of the supernatant transferred to a 96 well plate. The solvent is evaporated under a stream of nitrogen and the residue is reconstituted with 80 \u03bcL acetonitrile\/0.1% aqueous formic acid (20:80 v\/v).","A 20 \u03bcL volume of each prepared sample is injected onto a Phenomenex Synergi 4 \u03bcm MAX-RP 2.0\u00d775 mm column and eluted at 0.4 mL\/min using gradient elution from 0.1% aqueous formic acid (mobile phase A) to acetonitrile (mobile phase B). The gradient program consists of initial application of 90% mobile phase A, followed by a linear gradient to 75% mobile phase B from 0.2 to 1.15 min after injection and held at 75% mobile phase B until 2.0 min. The mobile phase was linearly changed back to 90% mobile phase A from 2.00 to 2.10 minutes, and the next injection took place at 3.00 min. Detection was performed by mass spectrometry using positive ion electrospray (ESI) with multiple reaction monitoring of the transitions m\/z 454.00 (MH+the test compound)\u2192m\/z 408.00, m\/z 466.24 (MH+the test compound)\u2192409.33. The ion spray voltagea is set at 5000. A calibration curve is constructed by using peak area ratios of the analyte relative to the internal standard. Subject concentrations are determined by inverse prediction from their peak area ratios against the calibration curve.","Method 6: Implantation of Radio Transmitters and Subsequent Blood Pressure Screening by Telemetry in Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats","The effect of a test compound on systemic arterial blood pressure can be evaluated in a spontaneously hypertensive rat (\u201cSHR\u201d) model using telemetry. SHR Rats are anesthetized with isoflurane gas via an isoflurane anesthesia machine that is calibrated to deliver isoflurane over a range of percentages as oxygen passes through the machine's inner chambers. The animals are placed in an induction chamber and administered isoflurane at 4-5% to reach a surgical plane of anesthesia. They are then maintained at 1-2% during the surgical procedure via a nose cone, with isoflurane delivered via a smaller isoflurane anesthesia device on the surgical table.","Following administration of anesthesia, the rats are implanted with transmitters using aseptic procedures with commercially available sterile radio-telemetry units (Data Sciences, International, Roseville, Minn. 55113-1136). Prior to surgery the surgical field is shaved, scrubbed with Dial\u2122 brand antimicrobial solution (containing 4% chlorhexidine gluconate and 4% isopropyl alcohol) followed by an application of iodine (10%) spray solution. A 2.5 to 3.0 cm laparotomy is preformed and the radio-telemetry units implanted into the abdomen, with the catheter tip inserted into the abdominal aorta. Baby Weitlaner retractors are used to retain soft tissue. A 1 cm section of the abdominal aorta is partially dissected and that section cross-clamped briefly, punctured with a 21-gauge needle and the transmitter catheter tip introduced into the vessel and secured by a single 4.0 silk suture anchored to the adjacent psoas muscle. The transmitter body is then inserted into the abdominal cavity and simultaneously secured to the abdominal muscle wall while closing with running 4.0 silk suture. The skin layer is closed with subdermal continuous 4.0 absorbable suture. A subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of marcaine followed by a topical application of iodine is administered into and around the suture line, respectively, upon closing. All rats receive a postoperative injection of buprenorphine @ 0.05 mg\/kg, s.c. before regaining consciousness. A typical dose volume for a 0.300 kg rat will be 0.050 ml. The rats must be fully recovered from their operative anesthesia before the administration of buprenorphine. They then receive the same dose once daily for 2 consecutive days, unless the animal demonstrates that it is in compromising postoperative pain.","Following surgery, the rats are returned to their cages and housed individually on solid bottom caging with paper bedding. A period of no less than 7 days is allowed for recovery before experimental procedures are initiated. It has been observed that the rats are typically hypertensive for several days following surgery and return to \u201cnormotensive\u201d levels by approximately the 7day post-surgery. They are fed standard rat chow and water ad libitum throughout the experimental time line.","Test compounds are administered intragastrically (i.g.) via gavage, using of a stainless steel, 2\u00bd inch, 18 gauge gavage needle with a balled end. For single daily dosing, the target volume is 3.33 ml\/kg, i.g. The dose volume for the test compound is approximately 1 mV rat. The vehicles in which the test compound is administered is methylcellulose (0.5%)+Tween 80 (0.1%) in 50 mM citrate buffer pH=5.0.","Blood pressure data will be obtained using Data Sciences International's data acquisition program (Version 3.0). Blood pressure samples are recorded at 1.5-3 minute intervals for a 5 second duration 24 hours per day for the entire study. This data is processed by Data Science's data analysis software into averages of a desired time inervals. All other data reduction is performed in Microsoft Excel\u2122 spreadsheets.","O. Toxicity Assays","Method 7: Micronucleus Assay","An in vitro micronucleus assay can be used to determine the mutagenic potential of a test compound. This assay detects chromosome abnormalities resulting from exposure to a test compound by measuring the formation of small membrane-bound DNA fragments such as micronuclei in the cytoplasm of interphase cells.","The assay is conducted using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells under different test conditions in the absence and presence of metabolic activation. Concordance in outcomes between this screening assay and in vitro cytogenetics is around 85%. Direct (\u2212S9) testing is conducted using 24 hour or 3 hour continuous treatments, whereas testing with metabolic activation (+S9) involves a 3 hour treatment. Clastogenicity is indicated by an increase in numbers of micronucleated cells in the first interphase after exposure (in cytokinesis-blocked binucleated cells). The results are compared to the level of cytotoxicity (measured by the proportion of binucleated cells) a test compound produces. To demonstrate validity of the test, negative (vehicle-treated) and positive (a known responder) controls are required to respond within established historical ranges.\n\n","The Carboxypiperidine Compound was tested in accordance with Method 7 and yielded an equivocal result.","Compounds previously disclosed in examples from WO2004096810 that were tested in accordance with Method 7.

A control group (n=5) receives vehicle (0.5% Methylcellulose (w\/v) and 0.1% Polysorbate 80 (v\/v) in 50 mM phosphate buffer). The oral route is used because it is the intended route of exposure in humans. The appropriate amount of test compound is suspended in 0.5% methylcellulose (w\/v) and 0.1% polysorbate 80 (v\/v) in 50 mM citrate buffer. The dosing suspension pH is maintained between 3 and 9.","Every animal is serially bled at 1, 3, 8, and 24 hours post dose on Day 1. Urine is collected approximately 24 hours for metabolic analysis. Survival and moribundity observations are conducted once daily during the pre treatment period. Clinical signs are observed daily, 1-3 hours post dose. Animals are euthanized via exsanguination after 7 days. Animals found dead are refrigerated and necropsied at the earliest possible time (within working hours). Terminal body weights, blood samples and organ weights are not taken from animals found dead. Moribund\/unscheduled\/scheduled animals that are sacrificed are taken immediately to necropsy, and body weights, blood samples, and all clinical clinical pathology samples except for urine samples are taken.","Various tissues (adrenal, femur bone, brain, cecum, colon, duodenum, epididymis, heart, ileum, jejunum, kidney, liver, pancreas, biceps femoris skeletal muscle, spleen, stomach, testis, thymus, thyroid, lumbar spinal cord, and mesenteric lymph node) will be weighed, flash freezed stained and fixed. After macroscopic examination, tissues collected with gross abnormalities are retained in formalin. All tissues collected with gross abnormalities are processed and examined microscopically by the pathologist. Tissues are trimmed, embedded, sectioned, and stained with hem atoxylin and eosin and examined microscopically by the pathologist at the pathologist's discretion. Bone marrow smears are prepared and stained with Wright's stain. To elucidate the nature of an individual animal's tissue change, additional tissue collection, sectioning, staining, and microscopic examination is conducted as requested by the pathologist.","Clinical observations, body weights, gross necropsy observations, and histopathologic findings are directly entered into the Xybion Path\/Tax System.","Method 10: BioLum Ames Gene Mutation Assay","A mutagenicity test (also known as the Ames test) can be used to determine the mutagenic potential of a test compound. This assay measures the mutation rate of bacteria that are exposed to a test compound. See, for example, Ames, B. N., Durston, W. E., Yamasaki, E. and Lee, F. D. (1973) Carcinogens are mutagens: a simple test system combining liver homogenates for activation and bacteria for detection. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA, 70, 2281-2285). Some carcinogens become activated when they are enzymatically transformed to an electrophilic species capable of covalently binding to DNA. In the Ames assay, S9 (9000 g supernatant) fractions are prepared from the livers of rats pretreated with phenobarbital (PB)\/5,6-benzoflavone (BF) or Aroclor 1254 to induce such drug metabolizing enzyme activity.","The BioLum Ames assay is a higher throughput screening version of the standard bacterial (Ames) gene mutation assay. To demonstrate validity of the test, negative (vehicle-treated) and positive (a known responder) controls are required to respond within established historical ranges.\n\n","An in vivo model can be used to evaluate the single dose pharmacokinetic properties and absolute oral bioavailability of a test compound. As described more specifically below, a test compound is administered to Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats either intravenously or orally in a crossover study design and the resulting pharmacokinetic properties and oral bioavailability are measured.","Male rats are administered a 2.0 mg\/kg dose orally (n=2) by gavage as a suspension (0.5% methylcellulose\/0.1% Tween 80 in distilled water). After a 72 hour wash-out periond, the same rats were administered 2.0 mg\/kg dose bolus intravenously (n=2) as a solution (70% PEG 400\/20% 0.05 M Citrate Buffer pH 3\/10% Ethanol). Serial blood samples (for plasma) are collected from each rat over a 24 hour post dose for each route. Plasma concentrations of test compound are determined using a LC\/MS\/MS method with a lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of 1.2 (for \u2212534) ng\/mL. Pharmacokinetic parameters of a test compound are determined from the plasma concentration-time data using non-compartmental methods.\n\n","Watson (Version 6.4.0.04) is used to calculate mean test compound concentrations, corresponding standard deviations (SD), and percent coefficient of variation (% CV), and to estimate pharmacokinetic parameters (derived by noncompartmental methods) and associated statistics (mean, SD & CV %) if applicable. (Since n=2, no SD or CV calculated ?). Concentrations below the limit of quantitation (BLQ) are reported as zero (0) and are used in the evaluation of mean concentrations and the estimation of AUC. The peak plasma concentration (C) and the time to reach peak concentration (tmax) are recorded directly from individual plasma concentration-time profiles. The terminal log-linear phase of the plasma concentration-time curve is identified by linear regression of data points. The terminal half-life (t) is calculated as ln(2) divided by absolute value of the slope of the terminal log-linear phase. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to time of the last quantifiable concentration (t) [AUC] is determined using the linear trapezoidal method. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity [AUC] is determined as AUCplus the extrapolated area. The extrapolated area is determined by dividing the last observed plasma concentration by the slope of the terminal log-linear phase. Systemic plasma clearance (CL) is calculated as dose\/AUCwhile the volume of distribution at steady state (V) is calculated as CL\u00d7MRT, where MRT (mean residence time) is defined as AUMC\/AUC. The absolute PO bioavailability (F) is calculated as a ratio of the dose-normalized AUCof individual animal after PO administration to the dose-normalized AUCof individual animal after IV administration given the crossover study design. The peak plasma concentration (C), the time to reach peak concentration (t), the terminal half-life (t), the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity [AUC], the volume of distribution at steady state (V), the systemic plasma clearance (CL), and the absolute PO bioavailability (F) are shown in Table C.","The Carboxypiperidine Compound was tested in accordance with Method 11 and the results are reported in Table H.
