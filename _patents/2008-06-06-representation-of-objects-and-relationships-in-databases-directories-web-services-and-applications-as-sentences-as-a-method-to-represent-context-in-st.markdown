title: Representation of objects and relationships in databases, directories, web services, and applications as sentences as a method to represent context in structured data
abstract: Systems and methods are disclosed for tagging and translating database objects and relationships into sentences. The successive composition of these sentences form hierarchies which encode contextual information about the objects. A virtual directory/context server functions using a common abstraction layer to access data from databases, applications, directories, Web Services, and other data sources within the enterprise. The virtual directory/context server includes a sentence/context builder module that enables the translation or relationships between data and from the plurality of data sources into a human-readable form, for example, an English language sentence. Thus, applications can view, access, and/or modify the data from the data sources of the enterprise through the virtual directory/context server, for example, using the sentences representative of the relationships between the data. The sentences are indexed, which allows for searches that bring information not only about objects, but also about the context in which those objects appear.

No. 6,985,905, issued Jan. 10, 2006, entitled \u201cSystem And Method For Providing Access To Databases Via Directories And Other Hierarchical Structures and Interfaces,\u201d and U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 11\/180,318, filed Jul. 12, 2005 and 11\/328,664, filed Jan. 9, 2006, both entitled \u201cSystem And Method For Providing Access To Databases Via Directories And Other Hierarchical Structures and Interfaces.\u201d The subject matter of all of the foregoing is incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates to systems and methods of accessing diverse databases, directories, Web Services and applications with a published API (application programming interface) via a common access layer.","2. Description of the Related Art","It is well known in computer science that tables and their relationships in a relational database have an equivalent representation as a subset of formal mathematic logic referred to as predicate logic or first order logic. This observation extends to any system of objects and relationships such as Web Services, applications with a published API, or directories. In fact, much of the information contained in data sources across an enterprise infrastructure only makes sense in the context of the relationships between data objects. However, efforts to grasp the context of the data are hindered by the heterogeneity of diverse data sources, access protocols (SQL, LDAP, Web Services, APIs) with different data models and different implicit or explicit metadata buried inside different applications domains throughout the enterprise.","One attempt to bridge between diverse data sources relies on virtual directory technology. Virtual directory technology can abstract existing data sources such as databases, directories, and applications, and can integrate them into a common access layer. Any existing system of data sources can be represented by a model, i.e., a set of relationships between the core objects. By exploiting virtualization to build a common abstraction layer\n\n","What are needed are improved systems and methods for representing the context of data derived from diverse data sources.","The present invention provides systems and methods for tagging and translating database objects and relationships into sentences. The successive composition of these sentences form hierarchies which in turn encode contextual information about the objects.","In one embodiment, a virtual directory\/context server functions using a common abstraction layer to access data from databases, applications, directories, Web Services, and other data sources within the enterprise. In one embodiment, the virtual directory\/context server includes a sentence\/context builder module. The sentence\/context builder module enables the translation of relationships between data from the plurality of data sources into a human-readable form, for example, an English language sentence. Thus, applications can view, access, and\/or modify the data from the data sources of the enterprise through the virtual directory\/context server, for example, using the sentences representative of the relationships between the data. The sentences are indexed, which allows for searches that bring information not only about objects, but also about the context in which those objects appear. Finally, the sentences and contexts can be externalized, or \u201cserialized\u201d in computer parlance, using different formats, for example XML Schema and Semantic web Resource Description Framework (RDF) sentence format.","Other aspects of the invention include a user interface that allows the creation of sentence templates by the user and methods corresponding to the systems described above.","The figures depict embodiments of the present invention for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles of the invention described herein.","The present invention provides systems and methods for tagging and translating database objects and relationships into sentences. By exploiting virtualization to build a common abstraction layer, a general global data model can be created. Out of this global data model, a navigation in the graph of relationships can generate sentences that can in turn be regrouped in context. By providing the support for a semantic tagging of links in a hierarchical tree structure, one can represent sentences and regroup them by relevant theme to extract contextual information out of what once were separate applications.","In one embodiment, the general form of a sentence is \u201csubject verb object\u201d, but in other embodiments the verb could be replaced by another arbitrary grammatical construct assigned by the user of the system. In still other embodiments, other orders of the parts of the sentence are also possible. In most cases, the sentences are formed by choosing in the global model of all data sources all of the following:\n\n","Creating a context means mounting the sentences under a user defined arbitrary label to describe a specific situation, background, context, etc. A set of increasingly specific sentences about any subject can be built if relationships exist between those respective subjects and objects in the following manner (i.e., if the subjects and objects form any connected oriented graph):\n\n","Navigating a context means choosing an object and reading the sentences formed by the relationships that exist within a data source and between data sources. Thus, each data source can contribute many specific contexts to a global enterprise\/organization context tree.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","111","110","101","101","101","101","105","105","103","104","103","104","103","104"]},"The virtual directory\/context server  functions using a common abstraction layer to access data from the databases A, applications B, directories C, Web Services D, and other data sources within the enterprise . The operation of a suitable virtual directory server is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,985,905, issued Jan. 10, 2006, entitled \u201cSystem And Method For Providing Access To Databases Via Directories And Other Hierarchical Structures and Interfaces,\u201d which has been incorporated by reference.","In one embodiment, the virtual directory\/context server  includes a plurality of modules, including a sentence\/context builder module . The sentence\/context builder module , which is described in further detail below, enables the translation of relationships between data from a plurality of data sources A-D into a human-readable form, for example, an English language sentence or a sentence in another language. Thus, applications can view, access, and\/or modify the data from the data sources A-D of the enterprise  through the virtual directory\/context server , for example, using the sentences representative of the relationships between the data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A"],"b":["101","202","222","101"]},"Once the local models A-C have been formed, a global model  can be created by linking a data object, for example object A across local models by recognizing that a data object as represented in two or more local models actually refer to the same entity or identity. As shown in , sometimes the same objects\/entities can be differently represented in different data sources. Within the enterprise, there is often more than one definition of an entity, and while they share some common attributes, they can differ considerably and are not interchangeable. In one embodiment, the translation of the local models A-C into the global model  is facilitated by the presence of a common unique identifier of the object A within the local models A-C. In other implementations, the translation of the local models A-C into the global model  relies on the operation of ICS  programmed to correlate objects despite the lack of a common unique identifier across local models A-C. For example, in , the icons representing a person A could be instances of the same person with a different set of identifiers which are specific to each application domain. In this case, before a set of links between different representations of an entity can be made, it is sometimes needed to establish a correlation between these different identities and create a \u201cunion\u201d of those identities. This operation is performed by the identity correlation module  in cooperation with the virtual identity hub  as described above. Once those identities are linked into a table by the ICS , this table is virtualized and added to the global model. In turn, the new table acts as a bridge (as a union of identities) between objects in the different segregated application domains. As a result, a new path exists between each previously segregated application domain, and sentences can then be created across these application domains.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2B"],"b":["203","203","111","204","204"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 2C","FIG. 2C"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 2D","FIG. 2D"]},"From the foundation of the global model that shows a map of data objects and relationships between those objects that can be organized hierarchically, it is possible to derive sentences that are both simplistic enough to be computerized and comprehensible enough to be readable by a user as English (or another human-readable language). Thus, the sentences become an efficient mechanism to pull meaning from complicated inter-relationships among data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"300"},"In step , a selection of a domain is received. The initial selection of the domain indicates the starting point for the exploration of the relationships between data objects captured in the global model. In other words, the selection of the domain indicates what map will be used to create sentences.  is an illustration of a user interface including a schema manager, in accordance with an embodiment.  shows by the highlighting of adworks demo  that the user has made a selection of a domain within the schema definition window . Displayed under the domain name are a plurality of objects , including the tables within the domain, and the relations  between the objects that occur in the schema.","Referring back to , in step , the sentence template is defined. In one embodiment, the sentence template is defined by following steps - as described below. In this example, the sentence requires a subject of the sentence, an object of the sentence, and a verb that describes the relationship between subject and object of the sentence.","In step , the selection of a subject is received.  is an illustration of a user interface including a directory view designer  and a path selection window , in accordance with an embodiment. The path selection window  allows the user to select a path from one data object to another. In this example, a new untitled view definition  is being created in the view definition window . The path begins at the root  and ends at the customers table , as indicated in the source identification box  and the destination identification box . As shown in the path selection window , the root  defines the top level of a hierarchical tree of data within the selected domain. The remainder of the tables in the second level of the hierarchical tree can be seen by scrolling down using scroll bar . In this example, from the displayed entities, the user has selected the customers table  as the subject to be used in the sentence template. The \u201cCustomers\u201d subject  will then appear in the view definition , as shown in . The user is able to rename the subject  at will, for example to \u201cCustomer\u201d to improve the grammar.","Optionally, the selection of the subject in step  may also include a selection of an identifier for the subject. This is illustrated in the user interface of , which includes a Relative Distinguished Name (\u201cRDN\u201d) Columns window  for selecting attributes , ,  from a selected table, in accordance with an embodiment. The window  includes a listing of all the columns and the mappings of those columns to attributes. A user can select one or more attributes in the list to identify the subject of the sentence by selecting the check boxes next to the appropriate item(s) in the list and selecting the OK button .  is an illustration of a user interface for the mapping of the selected attributes , ,  from  in a RunTime View window  of the directory view designer . As selected by the user in this example, the customers are identified by customerID, ContactFirstName, and ContactLastName . Any other combination of attributes could also be used to identify the customers from the customer table for the purposes of building the sentence template.  shows the implications of the user's selection of attributes , ,  as the RDN . If the user wants to select different attributes, the RDN Columns window can be accessed by selecting the RDN button .","Referring to , in step , a selection of an object with a link to the selected subject is received.  is an illustration of a user interface of the directory view designer  including a menu  for selecting a new label, container, content, or link. In this example, a new container is selected.  is another illustration of a user interface for path selection , this time illustrating the objects that are linked to the customers table  through underlying relationships in the schemas of the data sources that were extracted to create the global model. As shown, the recommendation table  and the orders table  are both linked to the customers table . This time, the path begins at the customers table  as indicated in the source identification box . The user can drill down through the hierarchical paths between data objects, as illustrated by the expanded tree of . The tree structure represents the relationships extracted from the original data sources. As shown in , the recommendation table  is linked to the packages table , and the orders table  is related to the order_details table , the payments table , the employees table , and the shipping_methods table . When the user makes selection as to the object that is linked to the selected customers subject, it appears in the destination identification box . The user is free to make a selection of an object one or more levels deep in the path hierarchy from the customers table  across many intermediate relationships because of the transitivity of links. For example, the user may select recommendation  as the object or packages  as the object. As another example, if customers is linked to orders, which is linked to order details, which is linked to products, the navigation system enables the code for linking customers to the products directly.","Optionally, the selection of the object with a link to the selected subject in step  may also include a selection of an identifier for the object. The process is similar to the selection of an identifier for the subject described above with reference to . A user can select one or more attributes to identify the object of the sentence by selecting the check boxes next to the appropriate item(s) in the list. Any combination of attributes can be used to identify the subject for the purposes of building the sentence template.","Referring to , in step , a selection of a verb that relates the selected subject and the selected object is received.  is an illustration of a user interface for selecting a verb  descriptive of the relationship between the data represented in the view definition , in accordance with an embodiment. In the example shown herein, first a new label is created, for example by a user's selection of \u201cNew Label\u201d from menu . A label is the mechanism used to tag the relationship (the verb) between two objects. The new label can then be relabeled by selecting the properties tab  shown in . The properties tab  of the interface is an editable form for editing the properties associated with a selected item in the view definition . As shown in the properties, the type  is \u201cLabel\u201d which signifies that the item is a label, and the object class  is \u201cvdlabel\u201d which signifies that the new item is a view definition label. The user can type in the RDN name  \u201cverb\u201d to indicate that the new label is a verb. The user can also type in the verb chosen to relate two of the items in the view definition . In this example, the user typed in \u201cplaced\u201d to describe the relationship between the item \u201cCustomer\u201d and the item \u201cOrder\u201d in the view definition. In other embodiments, a user may select a verb from a drop down menu or via any other selection mechanism known to those of skill in the art. Once the new label has been created, the items in the view definition  can be organized and displayed according to the hierarchy presented in . Thus, according to the created sentence template, the subject customer  placed  the object order .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 5"],"b":["557","991","558","559","557","1212","557","991"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0063"},"figref":["FIG. 13A","FIG. 13A","FIG. 13A"],"b":["1313","667","1391","554","1391","1313","667","1391","554","667","1313","1391"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 13B","b":["554","770","554","770"]},"Referring to , in step , the data from the domain is instantiated into the sentence template that has been defined by the selection of a subject, object, and verb in steps - above. Thus, the sentences are created. Examples of instantiated sentences according to various sample sentence templates are provided in  described below.","Referring to , in step , the sentences are output. The output sentences are human-readable, and easily interpreted as English language sentences by the user. The sentences can be output for display to the user, or output to a storage device, or output for encoding into another format, for example RDF.

These sentences are one mechanism to describe the associations between a subject, which can be any object\/entity of a given virtualized schema, and an object, which can be another object\/entity of the same virtualized schema or another schema, by using a word that acts generally as a verb. The verb is defined by an annotated label or tag. In other embodiments of the invention, in addition to these types of relationships, other types of sentence templates, specifically those that describe the properties or attributes that are specific to an object or entity can also be created. These sentences link a subject, which can be any object\/entity of a virtualized schema to an attribute of this object using an annotated label or tag which can be a verb, a qualifier, or as possessive form.
