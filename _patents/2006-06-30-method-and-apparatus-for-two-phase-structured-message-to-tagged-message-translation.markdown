{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["PRIORITY INFORMATION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/847,937, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,072,985, entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Two Phase Structured Message to Tagged Message Translation\u201d filed on 2 May 2001 by Uzi Lev-Ami, Tal Lev-Ami, Ezra Shabi and Yoav Sherf.","The protocols used by tools and other automated or semi-automated equipment in semi conductor fabs, metal cutting shops, healthcare and other domains developed over the years, when communication and processor speeds were relatively limited. Message protocols for foundry, shop floor and healthcare applications were designed to utilize low-speed, serial communications. These message protocols included structured messages, which could be transmitted quickly even with low-speed communications. Structured messages were and remain difficult to translate and understand. The difficulty is exacerbated when a first message sets a context for a response and a second, responsive message does not repeat the context; that is, the context-sensitive response is only meaningful when paired with the corresponding context-setting message. Matching context-setting and context-sensitive messages can be a very tedious task, especially when the context-setting-messages precede the context-setting messages by hours, days or weeks, instead of immediately preceding the responsive messages.","Therefore, it is desirable to introduce methods and devices for translating structured messages into tagged messages, such as XML messages, and particularly into context-insensitive tagged messages. It is also desirable to match context-setting and context-sensitive messages and generate context-insensitive messages.","An aspect of the present invention includes a method and device for translating a structured message into a context tagged, XML message. A two step translation is described, first including translation from structured message to structure tagged message, and then from structure tagged message to context tagged message. Standard tools may be used in the second step to apply validations or business logic. Particular aspects of the present invention are described in the claims, specification and drawings.","The following detailed description is made with reference to the figures. Preferred embodiments are described to illustrate the present invention, not to limit its scope, which is defined by the claims. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize a variety of equivalent variations on the description that follows.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","106","108","112","110","106","102"]},"Some arrangements for practicing the present invention are illustrated in . At least one machine  communicates with a host . The host may be a controller or a management system for one or more machines. Software implementing aspects of the present invention may run  on the host (), on other equipment that listens to communications between the host and the machine (), or on other equipment that has host-like capabilities (). The equipment with host-like capabilities may translate messages from a serial protocol to a network protocol or among other types of communication or transport protocols. The communications between the host and machine include a series of structured messages, for instance untagged messages constructed according to a standard or protocol. These messages may include both context-setting and context-sensitive messages, which sometimes are inquiries and responses. Context-sensitive response messages may omit the inquiries to which they respond. For instance, a context-setting message may ask for read-outs of four variables that the machine monitors. The context-sensitive message may respond with read-out values for the four variables, without identifying the variables being reported. Alternatively, one or more context-setting messages may define at least one report and at least one report triggering event. When the machine senses occurrence of the triggering event or when the report is specifically requested, it may issue the report. The report may take the form of read-out values for a plurality of variables, without identifying the variables being reported.","The machines may be semiconductor manufacturing equipment in a clean room, numerically controlled equipment in a machine shop, or any other automated or semi-automated equipment. The machines may be standalones, machines connected by robot work piece handlers, or fully integrated multi-station work cells. Each machine may have its own controller or a plurality of machines may share a controller. Similarly, devices used for or in the business of healthcare may benefit from the present invention. These devices may be connected to patients or may store information regarding patients.","Communications may involve RS-232 serial communications, Ethernet connections or any other suitable communications or message transport layer. This invention may most benefit structured message protocols that were designed for slower, RS-232 serial communications, as such legacy protocols may often employ context-setting and context-sensitive messages. This invention also may apply to protocols that utilize context-insensitive messages.","One communications protocol utilizing structured messages, including context-setting and context-sensitive messages, is a SEMI Equipment Communications Standard (SECS). Two aspects of this standard, SECS-I or HSMS for message transfer and SECS-II for message content are detailed in SEMI documents E4-0699, E37-0298, and E5-0600. The SECS-I standard defines a communication interface suitable for the exchange of messages between semiconductor processing equipment and a host. Semiconductor processing equipment includes equipment intended for wafer manufacturing, wafer processing, process measuring, assembly and packaging. A host is a computer or network of computers, which exchange information with the equipment to accomplish manufacturing. The SECS-I standard includes the description of the physical connector, signal levels, data rate and logical protocols required to exchange messages between the host and equipment over a serial point-to-point data path. This standard does not define the data contained within a message. The meaning of messages must be determined through some message content standard such as SEMI Equipment Communications Standard E5 (SECS-II). These standards provide a means for independent manufacturers to produce equipment and\/or hosts, which can be connected without requiring specific knowledge of each other.","HSMS is intended as an alternative to SEMI E4 (SECS-I) for applications where higher speed communication is needed or when a simple point-to-point topology is insufficient. SEMI E4 (SECS-I) can still be used in applications where these and other attributes of HSMS are not required. HSMS is also intended as an alternative to SEMI E13 (SECS Message Services) for applications where TCP\/IP is preferred over OSI. It is intended that HSMS be supplemented by subsidiary standards that further specify details of its use or impose restrictions on its use in particular application domains. High-Speed SECS Message Services (HSMS) defines a communication interface suitable for the exchange of messages between computers in a semiconductor factory.","The SEMI Equipment Communications Standard Part 2 (SECS-II) defines the details of the interpretation of messages exchanged between intelligent equipment and a host. This specification was developed in cooperation with the Japan Electronic Industry Development Association Committee 12 on Equipment Communications. It was indeed to be fully compatible with SEMI Equipment Communications Standard E4 (SECS-I). It is was intended to allow for compatibility with alternative message transfer protocols. This standard defines messages to such a level of detail that some consistent host software may be constructed with only minimal knowledge of individual equipment. The equipment, in turn, may be constructed with only minimal knowledge of the host. The messages defined in the standard support the most typical activities required for integrated circuit manufacturing. The standard also provides for the definition of equipment-specific messages to support those activities not covered by the standard messages. While certain activities can be handled by common software in the host, it is expected that equipment-specific host software may be required to support the full capabilities of the equipment. SECS-II gives form and meaning to messages exchanged between equipment and host using a message transfer protocol, such as SECS-I or HSMS. SECS-II defines the method of conveying information between equipment and host in the form of messages. These messages are organized into categories of activities, called streams, which contain specific messages, called functions. A request for information and the corresponding data transmission is an example of such an activity. SECS-II defines the structure of messages into entities called items and lists of items. This structure allows for a self-describing data format to guarantee proper interpretation of the message. The interchange of messages is governed by a set of rules for handling messages called the transaction protocol. The transaction protocol places some minimum requirements on any SECS-II implementation. SECS-II applies to equipment and hosts used in the manufacturing of semiconductor devices. Examples of the activities supported by the standard are: transfer of control programs, material movement information, measurement data, summarized test data, and alarms. A given piece of equipment will require only a subset of the functions described in this standard. The number of functions and the selection of functions will depend upon the equipment capabilities and requirements. The equipment typically will define the messages used in a particular implementation of SECS-II.","The structure of the SECS messages is detailed in standards documents sometimes referred to as E4-0699 and E5-0600. The following example illustrates at least part of the structure. The header structure is adapted from E4-0699 and the data structure from E5-0600. Additional structure may be provided, for instance by a transport layer. The processing of this structured message from binary through structure-tagged format to context-insensitive tagged format follows. Consider a so-called S1, F4 (or S1F4) message. This is the Selected Equipment Status Data (SSD) message. In this message, the equipment reports the status variable value (SV) corresponding to each status variable ID (SVID) requested in the order requested, for instance, requested by sending a S1, F3 Selected Equipment Status Request (SSR). An SVID may include any parameter that can be sampled in time such as temperature or quantity of a consumable. The host needs to remember the SVIDs requested, because they are not identified in the S1F4 response message. The SECS I\/II structure specified in the standards resembles the binary portion of the following:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["10000000","\u201cReverse bit\u201d = 1 (equipment to host)"]},{"entry":["00000000","Device ID, e.g. ID = 0"]},{"entry":["00000001","Wait bit = 0 (no response required), Stream = 1"]},{"entry":["00000100","Function 4"]},{"entry":["10000000","End bit = 1 (no blocks to follow)"]},{"entry":["00000000","Block 0 (only one block this message)"]},{"entry":["00000000","Four System Bytes, including source and transaction IDs"]},{"entry":["00000010","E.g., Source ID = 2"]},{"entry":"00000000"},{"entry":["10000001","Transaction ID = 129"]},{"entry":["00000001","List format"]},{"entry":["00000011","3 Elements"]},{"entry":["10110001","Unsigned 4-byte integer next"]},{"entry":["00000100","Length 4 bytes"]},{"entry":["00000000","Most significant byte first"]},{"entry":"00000000"},{"entry":["00000001","Value = 500"]},{"entry":"11110100"},{"entry":["01110001","Signed 4-byte integer next"]},{"entry":["00000100","Length 4 bytes"]},{"entry":["11111111","Twos complement format"]},{"entry":"11111111"},{"entry":["11111111","Value = \u22127"]},{"entry":"11111001"},{"entry":["00100001","Binary unspecified value 1-byte next"]},{"entry":["00000001","Length 1 byte"]},{"entry":["00000010","Value = 02"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"The entire message includes 17 bytes of data, 1-byte length (not shown), 10 bytes of header and 2 bytes checksum (not shown) for a total of 30 bytes.

Logic may be included to flag, on a time-out or other basis, when a report has been defined but not enabled. The S2F37 message also illustrates reporting the message exactly, without eliminating unused fields. The S2F37 message structure specifies a list of two second level lists. One of the second level lists has no elements. This detail of the original S2F37 message is represented without modification. For some structured messages, the translation from structured to structure tagged message could include simplification of messages such as this S2F37 message.","One aspect of the present invention includes a desired format for structure tagged messages. This embodiment uses XML rules for tagging messages to represent their structure. Structure tagged messages compliant with XML can be processed using XML tools, which are available in variety.

Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that many other ways of manipulating data structures are substantially equivalent: for instance, SAX (Simple API for XML) has a different origin than DOM, but is substantially equivalent to DOM. DOM is a platform- and language-neutral interface that permits script to access and update the content, structure, and style of a document. It includes an application programming interface (API) for well-formed XML documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and ways that a document can be accessed and manipulated. In the DOM specification, the term \u201cdocument\u201d is used in a broad sense. Increasingly, XML is being used as a way of representing many different kinds of information that may be stored in diverse systems, and much of this would traditionally be seen as data rather than as documents. Nevertheless, XML presents this data as documents, and the DOM may be used to manage this data. The DOM interface enables those practicing aspects of the present invention to build documents, navigate their structure, and add, modify, or delete elements and content. Tools for practicing DOM are provided by Microsoft and others.","The Standard Template Library, or STL, is a C++ library of container classes, algorithms, and iterators; it provides many of the basic algorithms and data structures of computer science. The STL is a generic library, having components that are heavily parameterized: almost every component in the STL is a template. Other data manipulation libraries will be equivalent to STL; many of them are extensions of STL provided by various vendors. DOM and STL can be mixed and matched. For instance, the dictionary and message format table could be implemented using DOM, leaving the name cross reference table and the dynamic mapper to be implemented using STL.","The second phase translation steps may be traced from when an input buffer is filled with a structure tagged message . (Not all of these steps will be needed to practice the present invention.) Some steps are followed regardless of the so-called \u201cform\u201d of the structure tagged message . The incoming message is identified as a primary or secondary message, using the primary\/secondary table or some other data structure. A primary message is given a timestamp and unique identifier, both of which are useful if the context tagged messages are stored in a database. A secondary message is associated with a previously received primary message. A transaction ID or similar matching field can be used to match the secondary message with its primary message. The incoming structure tagged message is translated from XML into a DOM tree. The SECS-II message name is retrieved from the tree. This message name and the source of the message are used to access the name cross-reference table, to find a differentiated message name. The differentiated message name is used to locate the appropriate message format entry in the message format table. The appropriate message format entry includes a form type, such as data form or definition form, which can be used to control processing in addition to the steps common to all form types. Again for a secondary message, a primary message structure is stored for the session closing secondary message. The message format entry is used to parse the incoming structure tagged message. The structures of these two data structures can be matched. At this stage, the incoming message may be classified as a publishable context tagged message. For instance, a primary message with no wait bit (requesting an acknowledgement) or a primary message with a meaningless acknowledgement (e.g., S6F11) or with a secondary message may be a candidate for publication.","Processing beyond the common steps  proceeds according to the form type of the incoming message. Separate modules or segments of logic may process data forms , definition forms , log only forms  and time forms , before publishing a context tagged message .","The data structures and program steps described above can be combined into a variety of useful embodiments. In one embodiment, a data stream is translated into semantically tagged messages. The incoming data stream includes structured messages. Structured messages have a clearly defined format. Structured message protocols typically include a variety of message formats. The format of the message typically depends on a message type identifier, such as a value in a field in the first part of the message. In this particular embodiment, the data stream includes both context-setting and context-sensitive messages. Context-setting messages may ask the question or define a report to be generated in response to an event or a request. The context-sensitive message in this embodiment is only meaningful when matched with the corresponding context-setting message. One reason for a context-sensitive message to be only meaningful is that the question is not repeated with the answer. Alternatively, the user may define a special, custom report format that is not hard coded into a translation program. The data stream is received and structured messages are tagged with XML tags corresponding to the structure of the messages. This tagging step does not require matching of context-setting and context-sensitive messages. These XML structure tagged messages can then be processed the standard tools for processing XML formatted messages. XML tagged context-setting messages can be matched with the corresponding XML tagged context-sensitive messages. The one or more matching fields are useful in this matching process. In this embodiment, matched messages can be utilized to generate context-insensitive XML messages. Questions asked or report formats defined in the context-setting messages can be used to create corresponding XML tags. Alternatively, a dictionary or other external reference can be consulted to create context-sensitive XML tags. A dictionary may be a cross-reference table or other data structure, which may be in RAM or on disk. To create context tagged messages, the intermediate, structure tagged messages can be modified or new messages can be created. Messages created in either way can be referred to as retagged messages. The retagged messages are output. Standard tagging schemes other than XML can be used, either standards in effect at the time of this invention or later developed standards.","The structured messages of this embodiment may be SECS-compliant. Alternatively, they may be HL7-compliant or DIACOM-compliant. Structured messages in integrated circuit manufacturing fabs, metal cutting shops, health-care facilities and many other environments can be processed in accordance with the present invention.","One adaptation of this embodiment involves context-setting messages that include variable identifiers for variables to be reported and context-setting messages that report variable values for those variables, without repeating the identifiers. The variable identifiers in the context-setting messages can be used to create corresponding XML labels. This may be a simple as copying the identifiers from the context-setting messages into context-in sensitive messages. Alternatively, the identifiers from the context-setting messages can be used to look up names of variables from a dictionary or other external reference. Names, instead of identifiers, can be used as XML labels. A further alternative would be to use the identifiers to look up XML labels and names for variables and to nest the names of the variables within the context of the XML labels. Both short labels and full names or descriptions of variables could be provided in the context-insensitive messages.","Another adaptation of this embodiment involves one or more context-setting messages that include report definitions and triggering events. The report definitions and triggering events may be included in the same message or in different messages. The report definition messages include identifiers of variables to be reported. The definition of the triggering events and identifiers of the reports triggered may be included the same or in different messages. Triggering events may be defined by a complex expression set forth in more than one message. The triggering event can be associated with one or more reports. When the triggering event takes place, one or more messages can be used report both the current to the triggering event and values of variables belonging to the triggered reports. The identifiers of the triggered reports can be included in the context-sensitive messages or can be omitted from the context-sensitive messages. If the identifiers of the triggered reports are included, they can be copied as XML labels are into a context-insensitive message. Alternatively, report identifiers can be used to access a dictionary or other external reference to obtain XML labels or report names to be used as XML labels. When identifiers of the triggered reports are omitted from the context-sensitive messages, the identifier of the triggering event can be used to access a dictionary or other external reference and recall the reports triggered and the variables included in those reports. The identifier of the report triggered or an XML label or name associated with the report can be used for generating XML tags for the context-insensitive message.","While the preceding examples are cast in terms of a method, devices and systems employing this method are easily understood.
