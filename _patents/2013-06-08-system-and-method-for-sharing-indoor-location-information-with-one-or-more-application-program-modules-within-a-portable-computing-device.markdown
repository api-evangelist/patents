title: System and method for sharing indoor location information with one or more application program modules within a portable computing device
abstract: A method and system for sharing indoor location information with one or more application program modules within a portable computing device (“PCD”) includes receiving an indoor location data request and determining if a location service is currently being executed by the PCD. If the location service is not being executed, it is determined if a location engine of the PCD has been installed. If the location engine of the portable computing device has not been installed, then the code for the location engine is downloaded from a communications network. Next, the location service may be executed once the location engine has been installed. It is determined if the indoor location data being requested is present in a memory element of the PCD. If the indoor location data being requested is not present in the memory element of the PCD, then the indoor location data is downloaded from the communications network.

These devices may include cellular telephones, portable digital assistants (\u201cPDAs\u201d), portable game consoles, palmtop computers, and other portable electronic devices.","Often PCDs may help people navigate within indoor locations. Currently, PCDs may download individual application programs that may provide indoor location and navigation information. However, one problem with conventional application programs is that they typically require separate and distinct instances of indoor location data such as indoor maps and received signal strength indicator (\u201cRSSI\u201d) data. That is, each individual application program usually downloads or has part of its internal infrastructure, separate indoor location data which is not shared with any other application program.","Such a design becomes problematic since separate indoor location data, in the aggregate across multiple application programs, may consume significant amounts of limited memory space within a PCD. Accordingly, there is a need in the art to solve this problem of multiple instances of separate indoor location data for each individual application program running on a PCD.","A method and system for sharing indoor location information with one or more application program modules within a portable computing device (\u201cPCD\u201d) includes receiving an indoor location data request and determining if a location service is currently being executed by the PCD. If the location service is not being executed, it is determined if a location engine of the PCD has been installed. If the location engine of the portable computing device has not been installed, then the code for the location engine is downloaded from a communications network. Next, the location service may be executed once the location engine has been installed. It is determined if the indoor location data being requested is present in a memory element of the PCD. If the indoor location data being requested is not present in the memory element of the PCD, then the indoor location data is downloaded from the communications network.","If the indoor location data being requested is present in the memory element of the portable computing device, then the indoor location data request may be directed to the location service and to the memory element containing the indoor location data.","The memory element within the PCD may have a venue specific region and a general resource region.

The application programs  may include a navigational application A, in indoor gaming application B, a check-in application C, and a casino guest application D. The inventive system  is not limited to these application program modules  and may include others not specifically mentioned in this disclosure but are understood as within the scope of this disclosure by one of ordinary skill in the art.","The shim layer module  may also communicate and coordinate information gathering by a location engine .

The location engine  may work with the LPS module . The location engine  may be downloadable from the server . The shim layer  may relay information between the application programs  and the location resource cache  which includes the venue specific cache A and the general cache B as will be described in more detail below.","The location engine  may support a location service . The location service  may utilize various particle filtering libraries  which may need access to the assistance data . The location service  may be responsible for providing the latest location. The location service  may comprise a daemon. As understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, a daemon is a computer program that runs as a background process, rather than being under the direct control of an interactive user.","Meanwhile, the location engine  is usually located on a lower level of code relative to the daemon or location service . The location engine  is periodically run and\/or called periodically by a scheduler (not illustrated) to perform the computations for updating location information of the PCD . In contrast to the location engine , the location service  or daemon is usually running once it is called and it does not usually perform any computations and relies on the latest data provided by the location engine .","The shim layer  may facilitate exchange of information among the venue specific cache A, the general cache B, and the location engine  as understood by one of ordinary skill the art. The location resource cache  may comprise a venue specific cache A and a general cache B.","The venue specific cache A may comprise a table of data, such as, but not limited to, a table that has at least the following columns: a venue identifier column ; an assistance data column ; an indoor map column ; a points of interest column ; and a crowd-sourced and self-sourced parameter column .

In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in , the exemplary venue identifiers  comprise a shopping mall I, shopping mall II, medical office I, in an airport I. The venue identifiers  may comprise alphanumeric text. The alphanumeric text may or may not comprise human readable or human decipherable identifiers. Other types of venues besides shopping malls, medical offices, and airports are included within the scope of this disclosure. Any type of indoor location which has corresponding indoor location data may be identified in the venue identifier .","Meanwhile, the assistance data column  in the venue-specific cache A may comprise a set of weights for different locations. Additionally, or in an alternate exemplary embodiments, the assistance data  may comprise expected received signal strength indicator (\u201cRSSI\u201d) data associated with wireless fidelity (\u201cWiFi\u201d) or wireless local area networks (\u201cWLANs\u201d). The assistance data  may have high-resolution data settings as well as low resolution data settings.","This means that for high resolution data settings a grid map may have a dense set of coordinates for RSSI data. For low resolution data settings, a grid map used for determining an location of the portable computing device  may have a dispersed or less dense set of coordinates for RSSI data relative to the high-resolution data settings.","The assistance data  may comprise unique grid maps for each indoor location associated with a venue identifier . For example, if the venue identifier  is associated with a building having multiple floors or stories, then the assistance data  associated with that identifier  may have unique grid maps for each floor of the building.","The shim layer  may be responsible for downloading and updating the data within the venue specific cache  and the general cache . For example, the shim layer  may update the assistance data  as application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) calls are received from each respective application program  running on the portable computing device .","The indoor maps  may comprise graphical files used to display maps on a display device. The graphical files may comprise JPEG type files as well as PNG files as understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. The points of interest  may comprise text names of locations as well as indoor coordinates, such as RSSI data, that may be searched by a user of the portable computing device .","The crowd-sourced and self-sourced parameters  may comprise various types of data. For example, self-sourced parameters  may include location context identification (\u201cLCI\u201d) disambiguation data which allows floor detection to be executed by the portable computing device  as understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. The self-sourced parameters  also comprise the number of particles used in a particle filter as well as the amount of noise used in such a particle filter.","As understood by one of ordinary skill the art, a particle filter is a mathematical algorithm used by the portable computing device  in order to process the assistance data  and any crowd-sourced and self-sourced parameters . A particle filter assumes that a portable computing device  as it traverses two-dimensional map behaves like a random variable. The particle filter may compare received RSSI data with expected values for the RSSI data which are stored in one or more tables contained within the memory of the portable computing device . Such particle filtering techniques are known to one of ordinary skill in the art and will not be discussed further in this disclosure.","The crowd-sourced parameters  may comprise configuration data which is typically relayed from the portable computing device  back to the remote server . Such configuration data may include, but is not limited to, media access control (\u201cMAC\u201d) addresses and\/or threshold values for the RSSI data.","The shim layer  may monitor the amount of memory storage available in each respective cache A, B. If memory storage of a respective cache A, B is running low, then the shim layer  may jettison or erase data from a respective cache A, B as needed when the shim layer  needs to download certain data which was requested by a particular application .","The general cache B may comprise icons and graphics  as well as filtering libraries , and check-in libraries . The icons and graphics stored  in the general cache B may be accessed in retrieved from the indoor maps  and points of interest data  of the venue-specific cache A.","Similarly, the filtering libraries  stored in the general cache A may access the assistance data  and crowd-sourced and self-sourced parameters  which are assigned to specific venue identifiers . The check-in libraries  of the general cache B may be responsible for managing the check-in operations for the different individual application programs .","For example, the check in libraries  may be responsible for specific check-in applications C that relate to merchant specific or building specific check-ins. Each check-in library  may comprise geo-fencing data and or MAC address look-up data which are part of various types of checking algorithms as understood by one of ordinary skill the art. Other types of data which may be stored in the general cache  may include, but is not limited to, math libraries, machine learning libraries, statistics libraries, communication and serialization libraries, serialization schemas, database access libraries, compression and decompression data, and algorithm parameters.","The data stored in each cache A, B may be referenced by the shim layer  as shared objects. The shim layer  may be responsible for determining if a shared object has been downloaded and if a shared object should remain within a specific cache A, B because of the likelihood that another application program  may need it for its operations.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 1F","FIG. 1F","FIG. 1F"],"b":["101","120","102","101","142","103","103","142"]},"The communications network  may be established by broadcast RF transceiver towers (not illustrated).
