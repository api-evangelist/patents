{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present disclosure relates generally to presence systems and more particularly to a method, devices and system having out of office based presence.","Presence refers to a user's ability and\/or willingness to participate in communications. Presence information, referred to as presence status or presence state, provides an indication of presence. Some types of messaging applications integrate presence status within the messaging environment. For example, instant messaging (IM) applications typically provide the presence status of the user's contacts or \u201cbuddies\u201d. However, presence status is not integrated in other types of messaging applications, or is not integrated effectively. For example, email messaging applications typically do not integrate presence status.","While some messaging applications have made presence status accessible to messaging servers, the presence information available to messaging servers and mobile communication devices communicating with such messaging servers has been limited in terms of integration and accessibility. For instance, a device user is typically not provided with the presence status of the recipient of the new electronic message during the composition of that message. Thus, there remains a need for presence systems which integrate presence status to a greater extent and in a more seamlessly manner.","Like reference numerals are used in the drawings to denote like elements and features.","The present disclosure provides a mechanism for obtaining presence status concerning users before those users are contacted. In particular, the present disclosure provides a mechanism for obtaining presence status regarding whether a user is out of office before a message is sent to the user. This allows a sender to send the message to a different user, to forego sending the message, or to select a different type of communication with which to contact the user. The basis for presence used in the present disclosure is the status of a user's out of office utility.","The teachings of the present disclosure, in at least some embodiments, can be used to integrate the functionality of the out of office utility with the global address book of an enterprise messaging server. The status of a user's out of office utility is used as a basis for presence and is sent to other users. The out of office presence status can be pushed or sent on demand to contacts of the device user and stored in the (local) personal address books of enterprise computers and mobile communication devices in a manner similar to instance message (IM) presence. In some embodiments, when a user's out of office utility is enabled, the out of office presence status is pushed to other users in the organization who have that user in their personal address book (i.e., pushed to the users' respective mobile communication devices and computers). Some or all of the contact of an out of office message used by the out of office utility could be sent with the out of office presence status to provide enhanced presence information if desired. When a user's out of office utility is disabled, the out of office presence status is again pushed to other users in their organization who have that user in their personal address book. Typically, the out of office presence status stored by the contacts is cleared (emptied).","In other embodiments, the out of office presence status is only sent on demand (i.e., when requested by one or more other users in the organization or applications or their respective mobile devices and\/or computers) rather than being pushed. That, is the out of office presence status is pulled by respective mobile devices and\/or computers. The request for out of office presence status may be sent manually by one more other users in response to corresponding input on their respective mobile devices and\/or computers, or the request may be sent automatically by the respective mobile devices and\/or computers in response to one of a number of trigger conditions. The trigger conditions for automatically request the out of office presence status may include input in a contact input field which matches the device user (i.e., input selecting the device user as an addressee or recipient of an electronic communication such as an email message, or a lookup which returns the device user), the display or selection of the device user's contact record in a personal address book of a mobile device and\/or computer, or both.","In some embodiments, the out of office presence status could be pushed to all devices directly connected to the enterprise network, e.g. all computers connected to the network and all mobile devices connected to computers in the enterprise network by a wired or wireless link regardless of whether a user-initiated or automatic trigger is otherwise required. In such cases, the out of office presence status is not pushed to devices which are not directly connected to the enterprise network (e.g., mobile devices which are not connected to an enterprise computer).","After out of office presence status is received, regardless of the manner in which out of office presence status is sent, a visual indication of out of office presence status is displayed in a corresponding user interface screen on the display screen of the computer or mobile device. In some embodiments, an affirmative visual indication is displayed only when the presence status is \u201cout of office\u201d. When the presence status is \u201cin the office\u201d, the default user interface elements are used. When provided with the out of office presence status in the connect of a message composition user interface screen, the user may continue to send the message (possibly rewording the message in view of the out of office presence status), select another user to send the message to, or contact the device user via a different type of communication.","In accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure, there is provided a method of sharing presence information performed by an electronic device and a messaging server, comprising: receiving input to enable an out of office utility for a first email account; notifying a messaging server managing the first email account that the out of office utility has been enabled; and providing to one or more recipients a presence status data packet indicating a presence status of \u201cout of office\u201d for a user associated with the first email account in response the enabling of the out of office utility.","In accordance with another embodiment of the present disclosure, there is provided a method of sharing presence information performed by a communication device, comprising: receiving input on the device to change the status of an out of office utility for a first email account; and notifying a messaging server managing the first email account when the status of the out of office utility has been changed including the changed status of the out of office utility. In at least some embodiments, the changed out of office status is stored in memory of the device. In at least some embodiments, the method further comprises receiving from the messaging server presence status data packets for contacts associated with the first email account when the status of the out of office utility of the contacts has changed, each presence status data packets including an presence status for a respective contact, the out of office presence status corresponding to the status of the out of office utility for the respective contact; storing the presence status contained in the presence status data packets in memory of the device; displaying a user interface screen on a display screen of the communication device configured for receiving input identifying one or more users; receiving input identifying one or more users via the user interface screen; and displaying in response to the received input a visual indication of presence status in the user interface screen for one or more users matching the input in accordance with the stored presence status.","In accordance with a further embodiment of the present disclosure, there is provided a method of sharing presence information performed by an electronic device, comprising: receiving a data packet having presence status associated with a first email account; and storing the presence status in association with a contact record which matches the first email account. In some embodiments, the method may further comprise: displaying a user interface screen of a personal address book on a display screen of the receiving electronic device, the user interface screen including a menu of contact entries corresponding to contact records of the personal address book; receiving selection input of one of the contact entries via the user interface screen; and displaying a visual indication of presence status in the user interface screen displayed on a display screen of the receiving electronic device in accordance with the stored presence status in response to the selection input. In other embodiments, the method may further comprise: displaying a user interface screen of a communication application on a display screen of the receiving electronic device; receiving input via the contact input field; and displaying a visual indication of presence status in the user interface screen displayed on a display screen of the receiving electronic device in accordance with the stored presence status in response to the input in the contact input field of the user interface screen.","In accordance with a further embodiment of the present disclosure, there is provided a communication device, comprising: a controller for controlling the operation of the device; a display screen connected to the controller; a communication subsystem connected to the controller configured for data communication with a communication network; the controller being configured to perform the above-described methods. The communication device may be a computer or a mobile communication device.","In accordance with a further embodiment of the present disclosure, there is provided a method of sharing presence information performed by a messaging server, comprising: receiving notifications when the status of the out of office utility of email accounts managed by the messaging server have changed; and providing presence status data packet to contacts associated with the email accounts when the status of the out of office utility of the contacts has changed. In at least some embodiments, the contacts are also managed by the messaging server.","In accordance with a further embodiment of the present disclosure, there is provided a method of sharing presence information performed by a messaging server, comprising: receiving notifications when the status of the out of office utility of email accounts managed by the messaging server have changed; identifying contacts stored in personal address books stored by the messaging server associated with the email accounts; and sending presence status data packets to the identified contacts when the status of the out of office utility of the contacts has changed.","In accordance with a further embodiment of the present disclosure, there is provided a messaging server, comprising: a controller; a communication subsystem connected to the controller configured for data communication with a communication network; the controller being configured to perform the above-described methods.","In accordance with yet further embodiments, there are provided computer program products comprising a computer readable medium having stored thereon executable program code for controlling the above-mentioned electronic devices, the executable program code causing the electronic devices to perform the methods described herein.","Communication System","Reference is first made to  which shows in block diagram form a communication system  in which example embodiments of the present disclosure can be applied. The communication system  comprises a number of mobile communication devices (mobile devices)  which may be connected to the remainder of system  in any of several different ways. Accordingly, several instances of mobile communication devices  are depicted in  employing different example ways of connecting to system . Mobile communication devices  are connected to a wireless communication network  which may comprise one or more of a Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN)  and a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)  or other suitable network arrangements. In some embodiments, the mobile communication devices  are configured to communicate over both the WWAN  and WLAN , and to roam between these networks. In some embodiments, the wireless network  may comprise multiple WWANs  and WLANs .","The WWAN  may be implemented as any suitable wireless access network technology. By way of example, but not limitation, the WWAN  may be implemented as a wireless network that includes a number of transceiver base stations  (one of which is shown in ) where each of the base stations  provides wireless Radio Frequency (RF) coverage to a corresponding area or cell. The WWAN  is typically operated by a mobile network service provider that provides subscription packages to users of the mobile communication devices . In some embodiments, the WWAN  conforms to one or more of the following wireless network types: Mobitex Radio Network, DataTAC, GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication), GPRS (General Packet Radio System), TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access), CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access), CDPD (Cellular Digital Packet Data), IDEN (integrated Digital Enhanced Network), EvDO (Evolution-Data Optimized) CDMA2000, EDGE (Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution), UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication Systems), HSDPA (High-Speed Downlink Packet Access), IEEE 802.16e (also referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or \u201cWiMAX), or various other networks. Although WWAN  is described as a \u201cWide-Area\u201d network, that term is intended herein also to incorporate wireless Metropolitan Area Networks (WMAN) and other similar technologies for providing coordinated service wirelessly over an area larger than that covered by typical WLANs.","The WWAN  may further comprise a wireless network gateway  which connects the mobile communication devices  to transport facilities , and through the transport facilities  to a wireless connector system . Transport facilities may include one or more private networks or lines, the public internet, a virtual private network, or any other suitable network. The wireless connector system  may be operated, for example, by an organization or enterprise such as a corporation, university, or governmental department, which allows access to a network  such as an internal or enterprise network and its resources, or the wireless connector system  may be operated by a mobile network provider. In some embodiments, the network  may be realised using the internet rather than an internal or enterprise network.","The wireless network gateway  provides an interface between the wireless connector system  and the WWAN , which facilitates communication between the mobile communication devices  and other devices (not shown) connected, directly or indirectly, to the WWAN . Accordingly, communications sent via the mobile communication devices  are transported via the WWAN  and the wireless network gateway  through transport facilities  to the wireless connector system . Communications sent from the wireless connector system  are received by the wireless network gateway  and transported via the WWAN  to the mobile communication devices .","The WLAN  comprises a wireless network which, in some embodiments, conforms to IEEE 802.11x standards (sometimes referred to as Wi-Fi) such as, for example, the IEEE 802.11a, 802.11b and\/or 802.11g standard. Other communication protocols may be used for the WLAN  in other embodiments such as, for example, IEEE 802.11n, IEEE 802.16e (also referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or \u201cWiMAX\u201d), or IEEE 802.20 (also referred to as Mobile Wireless Broadband Access). The WLAN  includes one or more wireless RF Access Points (AP)  (one of which is shown in ) that collectively provide a WLAN coverage area.","The WLAN  may be a personal network of the user, an enterprise network, or a hotspot offered by an internet service provider (ISP), a mobile network provider, or a property owner in a public or semi-public area, for example. The access points  are connected to an access point (AP) interface  which may connect to the wireless connector system  directly (for example, if the access point  is part of an enterprise WLAN  in which the wireless connector system  resides), or indirectly via the transport facilities  if the access point  is a personal Wi-Fi network or Wi-Fi hotspot (in which case a mechanism for securely connecting to the wireless connector system , such as a virtual private network (VPN), may be required). The AP interface  provides translation and routing services between the access points  and the wireless connector system  to facilitate communication, directly or indirectly, with the wireless connector system .","The wireless connector system  may be implemented as one or more servers, and is typically located behind a firewall . The wireless connector system  manages communications, including email messages, to and from a set of managed mobile communication devices . The wireless connector system  also provides administrative control and management capabilities over users and mobile communication devices  which may connect to the wireless connector system .","The wireless connector system  allows the mobile communication devices  to access the network  and connected resources and services such as a messaging server  (for example, a Microsoft Exchange\u2122, IBM Lotus Domino\u2122, or Novell GroupWise\u2122 email messaging server) having a global address book , and optionally other servers . The other servers  may comprise a content server for providing content such as internet content or content from an organization's internal servers to the mobile communication devices  in the wireless network , and an application server for implementing server-based applications such as instant messaging (IM) applications.","The global address book  comprises electronic contact records created and maintained by an IT (information technology) administrator of the network . Typically, the global address book is maintained exclusively by the messaging server  and there is no local copy on the mobile device . In addition, the global address book typically comprises contact records for all users of the respective network  (e.g., enterprise). The contact records in the global address book  may be one or more of individual contact records (or user records) or a group address or distribution list which lists multiple individual (users).","The wireless connector system  typically provides a secure exchange of data (e.g., email messages, personal information manager (PIM) data, and IM data) with the mobile communication devices . In some embodiments, communications between the wireless connector system  and the mobile communication devices  are encrypted. In some embodiments, communications are encrypted using a symmetric encryption key implemented using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) or Triple Data Encryption Standard (Triple DES) encryption. Private encryption keys are generated in a secure, two-way authenticated environment and are used for both encryption and decryption of data.","The wireless network gateway  is adapted to send data packets received from the mobile device  over the WWAN  to the wireless connector system . The wireless connector system  then sends the data packets to the appropriate connection point such as the messaging server , content server  or application servers . Conversely, the wireless connector system  sends data packets received, for example, from the messaging server  or other server  to the wireless network gateway  which then transmit the data packets to the destination mobile device . The AP interfaces  of the WLAN  provide similar sending functions between the mobile device , the wireless connector system  and network connection point such as the messaging server , content server  and application server .","The network  may comprise a private local area network, metropolitan area network, wide area network, the public internet or combinations thereof and may include virtual networks constructed using any of these, alone, or in combination. Computers  may be connected to the network  directly or indirectly via an intermediate communication network such as the Internet . When computers  connect to the network indirectly, e.g. via the Internet , a VPN or other mechanism for securely connecting to the network  may be required. Computers  may be of any suitable construction and include at least a processor, and a display screen, one or more user input devices, and a memory each connected to the processor as is known in the art. The computers  could be desktop computers, laptop\/notebook\/netbook computers, or combinations thereof, and may have wired or wireless communication subsystems for connecting to the network .","A mobile device  may alternatively connect to the wireless connector system  using a computer  via the network . In at least some embodiments, for security purposes the computers  with which the mobile devices  can connect to the wireless connector system  are limited to computers  which are directly connected to the network . A link  may be provided for exchanging information between the mobile device  and computer  connected to the wireless connector system . The link  may comprise one or both of a physical interface and short-range wireless communication interface. The physical interface may comprise one or combinations of an Ethernet connection, Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection, Firewire\u2122 (also known as an IEEE 1394 interface) connection, or other serial data connection, via respective ports or interfaces of the mobile device  and computer . The short-range wireless communication interface may be a personal area network (PAN) interface. A personal area network is a wireless point-to-point connection meaning no physical cables are required to connect the two end points. The short-range wireless communication interface may comprise one or a combination of an infrared (IR) connection such as an Infrared Data Association (IrDA) connection, a short-range radio frequency (RF) connection such as one specified by IEEE 802.15.1 or the Bluetooth\u2122 special interest group, or IEEE 802.15.3a, also referred to as UltraWideband (UWB), or other PAN connection.","It will be appreciated that the above-described communication system is provided for the purpose of illustration only, and that the above-described communication system comprises one possible communication network configuration of a multitude of possible configurations for use with the mobile communication devices . The teachings of the present disclosure may be employed in connection with any other type of network and associated devices that are effective in implementing or facilitating wireless communication. Suitable variations of the communication system will be understood to a person of skill in the art and are intended to fall within the scope of the present disclosure.","Mobile Communication Device","Reference is now made to  which illustrates a mobile device  in which example embodiments described in the present disclosure can be applied. The mobile device  is a two-way communication device having data and voice communication capabilities, and the capability to communicate with other computer systems, for example, via the Internet. Depending on the functionality provided by the mobile device , in various embodiments the device  may be a multiple-mode communication device configured for both data and voice communication, a smartphone, a mobile telephone or a PDA (personal digital assistant) enabled for wireless communication, or a computer system with a wireless modem.","The mobile device  includes a rigid case (not shown) housing the components of the device . The internal components of the device  are constructed on a printed circuit board (PCB). The mobile device  includes a controller comprising at least one processor  (such as a microprocessor) which controls the overall operation of the device . The processor  interacts with device subsystems such as a wireless communication subsystem  for exchanging radio frequency signals with the wireless network  to perform communication functions. The processor  interacts with additional device subsystems including a display screen  such as a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen, input devices  such as a keyboard and control buttons, flash memory , random access memory (RAM) , read only memory (ROM) , auxiliary input\/output (I\/O) subsystems , data port  such as serial data port, such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) data port, speaker , microphone , short-range communication subsystem , and other device subsystems generally designated as . Some of the subsystems shown in  perform communication-related functions, whereas other subsystems may provide \u201cresident\u201d or on-device functions.","The device  may comprise a touchscreen display in some embodiments. The touchscreen display may be constructed using a touch-sensitive input surface connected to an electronic controller and which overlays the display screen . The touch-sensitive overlay and the electronic controller provide a touch-sensitive input device and the processor  interacts with the touch-sensitive overlay via the electronic controller.","The communication subsystem  includes a receiver , a transmitter , and associated components, such as one or more antenna elements  and , local oscillators (LOs) , and a processing module such as a digital signal processor (DSP) . The antenna elements  and  may be embedded or internal to the mobile device  and a single antenna may be shared by both receiver and transmitter, as is known in the art. As will be apparent to those skilled in the field of communication, the particular design of the wireless communication subsystem  depends on the wireless network  in which mobile device  is intended to operate.","The mobile device  may communicate with any one of a plurality of fixed transceiver base stations  of the wireless network  within its geographic coverage area. The mobile device  may send and receive communication signals over the wireless network  after the required network registration or activation procedures have been completed. Signals received by the antenna  through the wireless network  are input to the receiver , which may perform such common receiver functions as signal amplification, frequency down conversion, filtering, channel selection, etc., as well as analog-to-digital (A\/D) conversion. A\/D conversion of a received signal allows more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding to be performed in the DSP . In a similar manner, signals to be transmitted are processed, including modulation and encoding, for example, by the DSP . These DSP-processed signals are input to the transmitter  for digital-to-analog (D\/A) conversion, frequency up conversion, filtering, amplification, and transmission to the wireless network  via the antenna . The DSP  not only processes communication signals, but may also provide for receiver and transmitter control. For example, the gains applied to communication signals in the receiver  and the transmitter  may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP .","The processor  operates under stored program control and executes software modules  stored in memory such as persistent memory, for example, in the flash memory . As illustrated in , the software modules  comprise operating system software , software applications  comprising an email messaging application  (also referred to as an email client ), a personal address book , a calendar application , a phone application , and an out of office module . The out of office module  stores user preferences regarding whether to share out of office presence status with other users and processes received presence status data packets containing out of office presence status. The out of office module  may store the device user's out of office option setting, or this may be stored by the email client . The out of office option setting for other users may be stored in the out of office module , or in the personal address book .","User preferences regarding the out of office module  allow a user to determine whether the messaging server  and\/or global address book  may publish and\/or share the fact that the user's out of office utility has been enabled. User preferences may allow the user to limit who can access this information by individual users, user groups, or combinations thereof. If the user preferences specify that out of office status is not to be shared, or is only to be shared with specific users and\/or user groups, the out of office status will only be available to the specified entities and will not be available to other entities. The user preferences may be defined by one or more predetermined presence rules stored in the out of office module , the messaging server , or both. The predetermined presence rules may include a predetermined presence rule which specifies whether presence status is to be shared. The predetermined presence rule may also define the one or more recipients to which the presence status is shared, possible by user name and\/or user group.","The out of office module  is typically implemented as part of the email messaging application , whereas the modules - may be implemented as stand-alone software applications  or may be implemented together as part of a common software application  such as a personal information manager (PIM). However, the modules - could be implemented as a part of the operating system . In some example embodiments, the functions performed by one or more of the modules - may be realized as a plurality of independent elements, and any one or more of these elements may be implemented as parts of other software applications .","The personal address book  comprises electronic contact records created by the device user which are stored on the mobile device  in memory , and possibly in memory of the messaging server . A \u201clocal\u201d copy of the personal address book  on the mobile device  may be synchronized with a \u201cnetwork\u201d or \u201centerprise\u201d copy maintained by the messaging server  so that the personal address book  may be accessed by the device user on either the mobile device  or an enterprise computer , or another computer with remote access to the network . It will be appreciated that contact names and other contact details may vary between the personal address book  and global address book  even when contact records correspond to the same user. The personal address book  is a custom personal address book and so is allowed to override the enterprise data in the global address book . It will also be appreciated that a given user A may have a user B in his or her personal address book , whereas user A may not be in user B personal address book . It is also conceivable that the personal address book  includes the same contact records as the global address book .","The software applications  also may include a range of applications, including, for example, a notepad application, Internet browser application, voice communication (i.e. telephony) application, mapping application, or a media player application, or any combination thereof. Each of the software applications  may include layout information defining the placement of particular fields and graphic elements (e.g. text fields, input fields, icons, etc.) in the user interface (i.e. the display screen ) according to the application.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the software modules  or parts thereof may be temporarily loaded into volatile memory such as the RAM . The RAM  is used for storing runtime data variables and other types of data or information, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Although specific functions are described for various types of memory, this is merely one example, and those skilled in the art will appreciate that a different assignment of functions to types of memory could also be used.","In some embodiments, the auxiliary I\/O subsystems  may comprise an external communication link or interface, for example, an Ethernet connection. The mobile device  may comprise other wireless communication interfaces for communicating with other types of wireless networks, for example, a wireless network such as an orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM) network or a GPS (Global Positioning System) subsystem comprising a GPS transceiver for communicating with a GPS satellite network (not shown). The auxiliary I\/O subsystems  may comprise a pointing or navigational input device such as a clickable trackball or scroll wheel or thumbwheel, or a vibrator for providing vibratory notifications in response to various events on the device  such as receipt of an electronic message or incoming phone call, or for other purposes such as haptic feedback (touch feedback).","In some embodiments, the mobile device  also includes a removable memory card or module  (typically comprising flash memory) and a memory card interface . Network access typically associated with a subscriber or user of the mobile device  via the memory card , which may be a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card for use in a GSM network or other type of memory card for use in the relevant wireless network type. The memory card  is inserted in or connected to the memory card interface  of the mobile device  in order to operate in conjunction with the wireless network .","The mobile device  also stores other data  in an erasable persistent memory, which in one example embodiment is the flash memory . In various embodiments, the data  includes service data comprising information required by the mobile device  to establish and maintain communication with the wireless network . The data  may also include user application data such as email messages, address book and contact information, calendar and schedule information, notepad documents, image files, and other commonly stored user information stored on the mobile device  by its user, and other data. The data  stored in the persistent memory (e.g. flash memory ) of the mobile device  may be organized, at least partially, into a number of databases each containing data items of the same data type or associated with the same application. For example, email messages, contact records, and task items may be stored in individual databases within the device memory.","The serial data port  may be used for synchronization with a user's host computer system (not shown). The serial data port  enables a user to set preferences through an external device or software application and extends the capabilities of the mobile device  by providing for information or software downloads to the mobile device  other than through the wireless network . The alternate download path may, for example, be used to load an encryption key onto the mobile device  through a direct, reliable and trusted connection to thereby provide secure device communication.","In some embodiments, the mobile device  is provided with a service routing application programming interface (API) which provides an application with the ability to route traffic through a serial data (i.e., USB) or Bluetooth\u00ae (Bluetooth\u00ae is a registered trademark of Bluetooth SIG, Inc.) connection to the host computer system using standard connectivity protocols. When a user connects their mobile device  to the host computer system via a USB cable or Bluetooth\u00ae connection, traffic that was destined for the wireless network  is automatically routed to the mobile device  using the USB cable or Bluetooth\u00ae connection. Similarly, any traffic destined for the wireless network  is automatically sent over the USB cable Bluetooth\u00ae connection to the host computer system for processing.","The mobile device  also includes a battery  as a power source, which is typically one or more rechargeable batteries that may be charged, for example, through charging circuitry coupled to a battery interface such as the serial data port . The battery  provides electrical power to at least some of the electrical circuitry in the mobile device , and the battery interface  provides a mechanical and electrical connection for the battery . The battery interface  is coupled to a regulator (not shown) which provides power V+ to the circuitry of the mobile device .","The short-range communication subsystem  is an additional optional component which provides for communication between the mobile device  and different systems or devices, which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example, the subsystem  may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components, or a wireless bus protocol compliant communication mechanism such as a Bluetooth\u00ae communication module to provide for communication with similarly-enabled systems and devices.","A predetermined set of applications that control basic device operations, including data and possibly voice communication applications will normally be installed on the mobile device  during or after manufacture. Additional applications and\/or upgrades to the operating system  or software applications  may also be loaded onto the mobile device  through the wireless network , the auxiliary I\/O subsystem , the serial port , the short-range communication subsystem , or other suitable subsystem . The downloaded programs or code modules may be permanently installed, for example, written into the program memory (i.e. the flash memory ), or written into and executed from the RAM  for execution by the processor  at runtime. Such flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of the mobile device  and may provide enhanced on-device functions, communication-related functions, or both. For example, secure communication applications may enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using the mobile device .","The mobile device  may provide two principal modes of communication: a data communication mode and an optional voice communication mode. In the data communication mode, a received data signal such as a text message, an email message, or Web page download will be processed by the communication subsystem  and input to the processor  for further processing. For example, a downloaded Web page may be further processed by a browser application or an email message may be processed by the email messaging application and output to the display . A user of the mobile device  may also compose data items, such as email messages, for example, using the input devices in conjunction with the display screen . These composed items may be transmitted through the communication subsystem  over the wireless network .","In the voice communication mode, the mobile device  provides telephony functions and operates as a typical cellular phone. The overall operation is similar, except that the received signals would be output to the speaker  and signals for transmission would be generated by a transducer such as the microphone . The telephony functions are provided by a combination of software\/firmware (i.e., the voice communication module) and hardware (i.e., the microphone , the speaker  and input devices). Alternative voice or audio I\/O subsystems, such as a voice message recording subsystem, may also be implemented on the mobile device . Although voice or audio signal output is typically accomplished primarily through the speaker , the display screen  may also be used to provide an indication of the identity of a calling party, duration of a voice call, or other voice call related information.","Out of Office Presence Status","Referring now to , an example use case illustrating the sharing of out of office presence status in accordance with one example embodiment of the present disclosure will be described. As noted above in connection with , the messaging server  of the communication system  connects to network computers  either directly via a wired or wireless link to the network  or indirectly via an intermediate communication network such as the Internet . The computers  operate under stored program control and executes software modules stored in memory. The software modules include an email client  which is compatible with the messaging server . The email client  could be part of a personal information manager (PIN). In some embodiments, the email client  on the computers  could be Microsoft Office\u2122 client and the messaging server  could be a Microsoft Exchange\u2122 server. When connecting indirectly (e.g. remotely) to the messaging server , the email client  on the computers  could be a Web-based email client  such as Microsoft Office\u2122 Web Access client.","The software modules stored on the computers also comprise operating system software , software applications  comprising an address book , a calendar application  and an out of office module . The email client , address book , calendar application  and out of office module  may be implemented together as part of a common software application such as a personal information manager (PIM) as with the mobile devices .","The email clients  on the computers  and mobile devices  and the messaging server  are configured to support an out of office utility (commonly referred to as an Out Of Office Assistant) for email accounts managed by the messaging server . The out of office utility generates automatic replies to received email messages addressed sent to the email account (i.e., address to an email address of the email account) when enabled. These automatic replies are referred to as out of office replies. An out of office reply is a reply email message sent to the sender of the received email message. The out of office reply has a message body which typically includes predefined text set by the device user; however, the message body could include text which is dynamically generated based on the received email message. Typically out of office replies are sent by the messaging server ; however, out of office replies could be sent by the email client  on a computer  or mobile device .","The out of office utility can be enabled and disabled by changing the corresponding option setting accordingly. Typically, the out of office utility is enabled and disabled by the device user but could be enabled and disabled automatically in response to a trigger condition. The trigger condition may be the meeting of predetermined conditions including, but not limited to, calendar event data from the calendar application  for a particular time slot matching a rule that specifies the device user is out of office. In other words, when calendar event data indicates that the device user is out of office, this could trigger the out of office utility to be enabled. Similarly, when calendar event data indicates that user is in the office, or at least does not indicate that the device user is out of office, this could trigger the out of office utility to be disabled.","The option setting for each email account is stored on a mobile device  which is associated with the email account and the messaging server  managing the email account. The out of office option setting is typically stored on the mobile device  because it is indirectly connected to the messaging server  and therefore may have only intermittent communication with the messaging server  via the wireless network  at times. Accordingly, the out of office option setting may not be readily available to the device user if not stored on the mobile device . However, it is possible that the out of office option setting is stored only on the messaging server  and a lookup is performed as required. The out of office option setting could be stored on one or more computers  when the email client  on such computers  is or has been used to access the email account.","When users enable or disable the out of office utility from their computers  or mobile devices , the corresponding option setting change is sent to the messaging server . Similarly, when users disable their out of office utility from their computers  or mobile devices , the corresponding option setting change is sent to the messaging server .","Referring again to , the messaging server  is shown connected to two computers  represented individually as computers and , and to a mobile device  via the wireless network . In the shown example, the first computer is associated with the user \u201cHeather\u201d (referred to as \u201cHeather's computer\u201d) and the second computer is associated with a user \u201cSteve\u201d (referred to as \u201cSteve's computer\u201d). The mobile device  is also associated with the user \u201cSteve\u201d (referred to as \u201cSteve's mobile device\u201d). For the purpose of illustration, an enabled out of office option setting is shown using a check box with a corresponding check whereas a disabled option setting is shown using an empty check box. In practice, any suitable mechanisms for storing option settings may be used. The manner in which the out of office option setting is stored by the email client  and messaging server  does not affect the teachings of the present disclosure and is not intended to be limiting.","The messaging server  has a memory  which stores, among other things, user names  and out of office option settings  for email accounts managed by the messaging server  (in the shown example, email accounts for device users \u201cHeather\u201d, \u201cVesper\u201d, \u201cRick\u201d, \u201cSteve\u201d and \u201cRob\u201d are shown). The messaging server  also stores other information including, but not limited to, the email addresses of the email accounts managed by the messaging server . The user names  and out of office option settings  may be stored in a data table  or resolved into a logical table at runtime when required.","The computers and each have a memory  and  respectively for storing data such as out of office option settings ,  for other users, as well as the device user's own out of office option settings , . In the shown embodiment, the out of office option settings ,  for other users are limited to those users who are in the device user's personal address book. The out of office option settings ,  are stored in association with the respective user names of the contacts. The out of office option settings ,  for other users may be stored in the respective contact records for those users in the personal address book.","The mobile device  stores out of office option settings  for other users as well as the device user's own out of office option settings  in its memory . In the shown embodiment, the out of office option settings  for other users are limited to those users who are in the respective device user's personal address book  (). The out of office option settings  for other users may be stored in the respective contact records for those users in the personal address book .","As shown in , the user Heather has the out of office utility enabled as indicated by the out of office option setting  in stored in the memory  of the computer . While not shown in , if the user Heather had a mobile device  with an email account managed by the messaging server , the out of office option setting would also be stored in the memory  of her mobile device . The corresponding out of office option setting for user Heather is also stored by the messaging server  in its memory  along with the settings for the other users who have an email account managed by the messaging server  (in the shown example, email accounts for device users \u201cHeather\u201d, \u201cVesper\u201d, \u201cRick\u201d, \u201cSteve\u201d and \u201cRob\u201d). Heather's computer also stores the out of office option settings  for the user's Rick and Vesper as these users are in Heather's personal address book .","The user Steve also has the out of office utility enabled as indicated by the out of office option setting  in stored in the memory  of the computer . Steve's computer also stores the out of office option settings  for the user's Heather and Vesper as these users are in Steve's personal address book . Steve's mobile device  has the out of office option settings ,  stored in the memory . Thus, both the computer and mobile device  have access to the same out of office option settings , . The corresponding out of office option setting  for user Steve is also stored by the messaging server  in its memory .","Referring now to , an example dialing user interface screen  of the phone application  which is configured to display out of office presence status will now be described. The dialing screen  includes a dialing field  for entry of an input comprising a telephone number or contact name of a party to be called. In the dialing user interface screen  shown in , the name \u201cHeather\u201d has been input in the dialing field . The dialing field , in at least some embodiments, is the active field of the dialing screen  when it is invoked. A cursor  (also referred to as a caret) is provided within the dialing user interface screen . The cursor  functions as a text cursor within dialing field  but may function as a navigation cursor in other fields. The cursor  is an onscreen indicator used to show a position on the display  which responds to text input and\/or navigational input from the input and navigational input devices of the device , respectively. As will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art, text input via the respective input devices will cause the processor  to display corresponding text at the position of the cursor , and navigational input from respective navigational input devices will cause the processor  to move the cursor  between selectable fields of the dialing screen . In the shown embodiment, the dialing screen  also includes a status bar  which displays information such as the current date and time, icon-based notifications, device status and\/or device state.","The dialing screen  also includes a contact menu  which displays a list of contacts  which match the input in the dialing field . In the dialing user interface screen  shown in , the contacts \u201cHeather Barron\u201d, \u201cHeather Makkai\u201d and \u201cHeather Dawson\u201d were found to match the input \u201cHeather\u201d in the dialing field . The contact name and possibly telephone number of the matching contact records are listed in the contact menu  within the list . The number of contacts which match the input in the dialing field  may exceed the number of references which can fit within the menu . In such cases, the contact menu  may be scrollable so that contact records which are not shown in the contact menu  can be displayed and reviewed by the device user. A scroll bar (not shown) may be provided as an indication of the availability of scrolling, as well as providing a scrolling mechanism and an indication of the relative size of the list of contacts .","In some embodiments, the phone application  performs a local lookup operation in which the input of the dialing field  is compared to electronic contact records in a personal address book  stored in the memory . As the input in the dialing field  changes (e.g., more characters are added or characters are removed or changed), the phone application  re-compares the input in the dialing field  to the electronic contact records in the personal address book  to dynamically generate the list of contacts  based on the input in the dialing field . In some embodiments, the lookup may be repeated at predetermined durations (e.g. every few seconds), after each character change, or after a predetermined number of character changes in the dialing field . In some embodiments, the input in the contact input field is compared automatically to the personal address book to identify any matching contacts without user input. In other embodiments, input could be required to perform a local lookup operation.","The contact menu  may also include a lookup field  for performing a lookup of the global address book  (also referred to as a network or enterprise address book). In some embodiments, activating the lookup field  instructs the mobile device  to perform a lookup operation on the input in the lookup field  in the global address book  (e.g., to perform a lookup for the contact name \u201cHeather\u201d in the global address book  as shown in ). The lookup field , in at least some embodiments, is automatically populated with the input from the dialing field  (the input \u201cHeather\u201d is illustrated in ). In some embodiments, the lookup field  requires input to perform a lookup operation. That is, while the input from the dialing field  is automatically populated in the lookup field , the lookup operation is not performed without input to perform the operation. In some embodiments, the user can change the active field to be the lookup field  by corresponding navigational input via the navigational input device, for example by moving a scroll wheel or trackball downwards towards the lookup field  from the dialing field , or using corresponding directional input via a touchscreen. In other embodiments, the input of the lookup field  must be input directly via respective user input.","As part of the lookup operations for populating the contact menu , the out of office option settings  stored on the mobile device  are checked for contacts which match the input in the dialing field . When the out of office option settings  indicate that the out of office option setting is enabled for a user, a visual indication of the out of office presence status is displayed within the dialing screen . In , the visual indication of presence status when the device user is out of office is provided by the colour of the background and the colour of the text of the corresponding entry in the list of contacts . For example, in , the colour of the background and the colour of the text of the corresponding entry for the user \u201cHeather Barron\u201d indicates that she has her out of office utility enabled, whereas the colour of the background and the colour of the text of the corresponding entry for the users \u201cHeather Makkai\u201d and \u201cHeather Dawson\u201d\u201d indicates that these users do not have their out of office utility enabled.","In some embodiments, the colour of the background could be blue and the colour of the text could be white when the user is out of office, whereas the colour of the background could be white and the colour of the text could be black when the user is in the office. In other embodiments, only one of the background colour and text colour may be changed. For example, the colour of the text may be red when the user is out of office but black when the user is in the office. In other embodiments, different colours may be used as the default background colour and text colour. For example, users who are \u201cout of office\u201d may be un-selectable elements in the user interface screen and \u201cgrey-out\u201d or having a strike through extending through their user name. In yet other embodiments, presence status could be indicated by other means such as a corresponding icon, text label or both, in addition to, or instead of, changing the colour of the background and\/or text of the corresponding entry in the list of contacts .  illustrates such an alternative embodiment in which the visual indication is a text label \u201cOut of Office\u201d in brackets following the contact name. In yet other embodiments, presence status could be indicated by a pop-up window or other suitable means.","If no out of office presence status is stored, no visual indication of the presence status of users is provided in the dialing screen . Instead, the user contact names, telephone numbers, or both are displayed without any additional information.","In , more characters have been added to the dialing field  so that the input is unambiguously identified in the personal address book . That is, the input of \u201cHeather Barron\u201d in the dialing field  returns a single match from the personal address book . At this time, a visual indication of the presence status could be provided in the dialing field  as shown in  rather than the contact menu . In , the text label \u201cOut of Office\u201d is provided in brackets following the contact name; however, the presence status may be indicated by any suitable means.","Referring now to , an example email message composition user interface screen  for the email messaging application  for the mobile device  will now be described. The email message composition screen  includes an address portion  including a \u201cTo\u201d address field, \u201cCC\u201d address field and \u201cSubject\u201d field. A \u201cBCC\u201d address field (not shown) could also be included in other embodiments. The operation and use of such fields is known in the art and will not be described herein. The email message composition screen  also includes a message body field  for entry of a message. The email message composition screen  is provided with a cursor  which is navigable within and between the respective fields of the address portion , and between the address portion  and message body field .","When one of the address fields is active, i.e. when one of the \u201cTo\u201d \u201cCC\u201d or \u201cBCC\u201d fields is active, entry of an input causes the processor  to perform a local lookup operation of the input in the respective field to contact records in the personal address book  to determine if the input matches any contacts records. The lookup operation comprises comparing the input to one or more fields of the contact records. Typically, the fields used in comparison comprise at least the name field but may also comprise one or more of the company\/organization field, title\/department field,.email address field or other text fields of the contact records in the personal address book . Typically, the results of the lookup operation are displayed in a contact menu which, in the shown embodiment, is a pop-up window  adjacent to the address field which overlays a portion of the email message composition screen . In other embodiments, the contact menu results of the lookup operation could be provided inline within the email message composition screen  rather than being displayed in the pop-up window . In some embodiments, the input in the contact input field is compared automatically to the personal address book to identify any matching contacts without user input. In other embodiments, input could be required to perform a local lookup operation.","The pop-up window  is populated with a list of contact names  of the contact records which match the input in the address field. In other embodiments, the pop-up window  may be populated with a list of email addresses of the contact records which match the input in the address field. The type and nature of the displayed information in the pop-up window  may be determined in accordance with predetermined settings. The pop-up window  may also include a lookup field  similar to the lookup field . Alternatively, the lookup field  may be invoked from the email message composition screen , for example from the address field, by causing an options menu to appear and selecting a corresponding menu item requesting the lookup field  to be displayed.","When activated, for example in the manner described above in connection with the lookup field , the lookup field  performs a lookup on the global address book  to find contact records which match the input in the address field. Upon receiving input to perform a lookup, the processor  instructs the messaging server  to compare the lookup field input to the contact records in the global address book , the messaging server  determines which contact records match the lookup field input, and returns contact information to the mobile device  about the contact records that match the lookup field input. The comparison may be based on one or more of the fields of the contact records in the global address book . The comparison is typically based on at least the name field of the contact records, but could also be performed on other fields of the contact records such as organization.","As part of the lookup operations for populating the pop-up window , the out of office option settings  stored on the mobile device  are checked for contacts which match the input in the address field. When the out of office option settings  indicate that the out of office option setting is enabled for a user, a visual indication of the out of office presence status is displayed within the email message composition screen . In , the visual indication of presence status when the device user is out of office is provided by the colour of the background and the colour of the text of the corresponding entry in the pop-up window . For example, in , the colour of the background and the colour of the text of the corresponding entry for the user \u201cHeather Barron\u201d indicates that she has her out of office utility enabled, whereas the colour of the background and the colour of the text of the corresponding entry for the users \u201cHeather Makkai\u201d and \u201cHeather Dawson\u201d indicates that these users do not have their out of office utility enabled.  illustrates such an alternative embodiment in which the visual indication is a text label \u201cOut of Office\u201d in brackets following the contact name. In yet other embodiments, presence status could be indicated by a pop-up window or other suitable means.","In , more characters have been added to the address field so that the input is unambiguously identified in the personal address book . That is, the input of \u201cHeather Barron\u201d in the address field returns a single match from the personal address book . At this time, a visual indication of the presence status could be provided in the address field as shown in  rather than the pop-up window . In , the text label \u201cOut of Office\u201d is provided in brackets following the contact name; however, the presence status may be indicated by any suitable means.","Lookup operations of the email messaging application , phone application  and possibly other applications may be performed by separate lookup modules or a common lookup module. A common lookup module provides centralized lookup capabilities for contact information for the mobile device . The common lookup module could be part of the operating system  in some embodiments. This may increase computational efficiency by reducing the processing required by the mobile device , at least in part, by delegating responsibilities to aspects of the device software which are below the application level, such as to the operating system .","While the foregoing examples are directed to the provision of presence status in the context of the email messaging application  and phone application , it will be appreciated that presence status could also be provided in other communication applications which, in some embodiments, could be a text messaging application for sending SMS, MMS or other text messages, peer-to-peer device messaging application for sending peer-to-peer device messages, an IM application for sending instant messages, a chat application, or a personal address book. Moreover, while example user interface screens have been described in the context of the email messaging application  and phone application , it will be appreciated that presence status could be provided in user interface screens of these and other communication applications. Moreover, the foregoing presence scheme uses \u201cin the office\u201d as a default presence status as this tends to be the normal circumstance. Accordingly, no affirmative visual indication is provided when a user is \u201cin the office\u201d. That is, no icon, text or other visual indication is added to the user interface screen when a user is \u201cin the office\u201d. The default text and background are used to display the contact name and\/or other information. Nevertheless, the user's presence status of \u201cin the office\u201d can be determined by a device user by a lack of any affirmative visual indication. This avoids unnecessarily cluttering user interface screens.","In other embodiments, an affirmative visual indication could be provided when a user is \u201cin the office\u201d to provide affirmative presence status for all users. For example, an icon, text label such as \u201cIn the Office\u201d in brackets following the user name, or other affirmative visual indication could be provided. Additionally, a visual indication that no presence information is available could be displayed when no presence status is available.","In other embodiments, rather than storing out of office option settings in the memory of the computers  and\/or mobile device , out of office presence status could be looked up on the messaging server  in response to detection of a trigger condition, and sent to the requesting computer  or mobile device . In this manner, out of office presence status could be determined for contacts in personal address book , global address book  or both. In such embodiments, the operations  further comprises monitoring for trigger conditions for sending presence status, and sending the presence status data packet to the one or more recipients in response to detection of a trigger condition.","The trigger condition could be one of (1) inputting any number of characters in a contact input field of the communication application (2) inputting a predetermined number of characters in the contact input field of the communication application, (3) inputting an input in the contact input field which matches a predetermined number of contact records in the personal address book  or global address book , (4) a request via predetermined input to obtain out of office presence status for a particular contact or user, or (5) selection input selecting a specific contact which could be input in the contact input field of the communication application which unambiguously identifies a contact in the personal address book  or which is a predetermined selection input.","The use of a trigger condition for sending presence information to computers  and\/or mobile device  may reduce the amount of data transmitted compared with pushing out of office presence status. The reduction in the amount of data transmitted may reduce operating costs due to the resulting reduction in data charges when transmitting data to mobile devices . The described trigger conditions provide different balances between data efficiency and user convenience. For example, trigger condition (1) is relatively inefficient in that no filters are used. That is, a lookup may be performed as soon as the device user enters any input in the contact input field. Trigger conditions (2) and (3) are more efficient in that the number of matching contacts has been reduced compared with trigger condition (1). Trigger conditions (4) and (5) are the most efficient in that the contact is limited to a particular contact.","In some embodiments, out of office presence status stored by the messenger server  can be accessed and pushed by the wireless connector system  to mobile devices  for all contacts in a user's personal address book but is not pushed to the computers  via the messenger server . Instead, the computers  perform a lookup of the messaging server  as described above. This embodiment takes advantage of the increased connection speed between the computers  and messaging server  and the absence of a data charges for data exchanged within the network . Pushing out of office presence status to mobile devices  and storing it on the mobile devices , however, increases response time when accessing out of office presence status on the mobile devices . This solution reduces or eliminates problems associated with the indirect connection between the mobile devices  and the messaging server , and the potential for intermittent communication between mobile devices  and the messaging server  via the wireless network . While possibly requiring more data to be transmitted to the mobile devices , this embodiment attempts to make out of office presence status readily available to device users of mobile devices .","While presence status has been described as being \u201cout of office\u201d or \u201cin the office\u201d, other binary presence status indicators could be used. Other suitable presence status indicators include \u201cavailable\u201d or \u201cunavailable\u201d, \u201cpresent\u201d or \u201cnot present\u201d, \u201cable to communicate\u201d and \u201cunable to communicate\u201d. These presence status indicators are provided for purposes of illustration and are not intending to be limiting. In addition, while examples of visual indications of presence status have described in the context of example user interface screens, these are merely for purposes of illustration. The present disclosure is not intended to be limited to any particular scheme for providing a visual indication of presence status.","Referring now to , an example method of sharing presence information in accordance with one example embodiment of the present disclosure will be described. In the first step , the email client  receives input to enable an out of office utility in connection with a first email account from a computer  or mobile device . The input may be user input received via respective input via one or more input devices of the computer  or mobile device , or an automated input generated by the operating system or application of the computer  or mobile device  in response to a determination that the user is out of office.","A determination that the user is out of office may be made using any one or more of various methodologies. In some embodiments, the location of a mobile device  associated with the first email account may be determined via triangulation based on location information from base stations  in the wireless network , or a GPS subsystem of the mobile device . When the mobile device  is greater than or equal to a predetermined distance from a predetermined office location (i.e. the device user's office or place of employment), the respective device user is determined to be out of office. The predetermined distance and predetermined office location may be configurable in some embodiments, and could be stored locally on the mobile device  or shared with the messaging server .","In other embodiments, calendar event data from a calendar application  could be used to determine that the user is out of office, for example, based on the calendar event data of scheduled events stored by the calendar application  and\/or messaging server . As will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art, many calendar applications  have availability status fields which provide details such as the whether or not the user\/calendar event is \u201cout of office\u201d. For example, Microsoft Office\u2122 and Microsoft Exchange\u2122 messaging server  support to an availability status field which has four availability status options including \u201cFree\u201d, \u201cTentative\u201d, \u201cBusy\u201d, and \u201cOut of Office\u201d. The availability status option for the availability status field of a calendar event object is typically selected by the device user, for example, from a \u201cShow time as\u201d drop-down box of a corresponding detailed calendar event user interface screen. Applications and device users accessing the device user's calendar data stored by the messaging server  are provided with the selected availability status option for the respective calendar event. Thus, the calendar application  and\/or messaging server  could automatically generate an input to enable the out of office utility in connection with the device user's email account (i.e., the first email account) when a calendar event occurs in the device user's calendar with an availability status option of \u201cOut of Office\u201d.","While examples of automatically enabling the out of office utility have been described in accordance with example embodiments for the purpose of illustration, the present disclosure is not limited to any particular method of user input or automated input for enabling the out of office utility. It will be appreciated that the present disclosure extends to any mechanism which automatically enables the out of office utility in response to a trigger condition and to any method of user input for enabling the out of office utility. Thus, in accordance with the present disclosure the out of office utility could be manually set by device users, automatically set, or both.","Next, in step  the messaging server  managing the first email account is notified by the computer  or mobile device  that the out of office utility has been enabled. This step is performed by the out of office module , or by the email client  when the out of office module  is part of the email client . When a mechanism for automatically setting the out of office utility is used, the messaging server  could determine whether the user is out of office based on calendar event information or location information, or the messaging server  could be provided with the determination whether the user is out of office from other sources. When the messaging server  determines whether the user is out of office in step  rather than the computer  or mobile device , the notifying step  may be omitted. When another source (e.g. location service) determines whether the user is out of office, the notification is provided by that other source rather than the computer  or mobile device .","Next, in step  an out of office presence status is provided in response to the enabling of the out of office utility. In some embodiments, providing the presence status comprises sending a presence status of \u201cout of office\u201d in a presence status data packet to one or more other recipients\/users who have the \u201cout of office\u201d device user associated with the first email account in their personal address book . This may comprise identifying one or more users having email accounts managed by the messaging server  which have a contact record matching the first email account. The presence status data packet is then sent to the identified user. Alternatively, email accounts could be identified rather than users. In some embodiments, identifying users or email accounts comprises analysing personal address books  associated with email accounts managed by the messaging server , and identifying one or more email accounts having a contact record which matches a user name or email address of the first email account. The analyzed personal address books  are typically stored by the messaging server  and may be, for example, a mirrored copy of the personal address books  stored on mobile device  and\/or computer . The above steps could be performed by the wireless connector system  or messaging server , depending on the embodiment.","In other embodiments, providing the presence status comprises sending a presence status of \u201cout of office\u201d in a presence status data packet to the contacts of the \u201cout of office\u201d device user associated with the first email account have email accounts which are also managed by the messaging server . That is, enterprise contacts using the same messaging server . This may comprise identifying one or more contacts stored in the personal address book  associated with the first email account which are managed by the messaging server . The presence status data packet is then sent to the identified one or more email accounts. In such embodiments, identifying one or more contacts may comprises analysing the personal address book  associated with the first email account and identifying one or more email accounts in the personal address book  having a contact record which matches a user name or email address of an email account managed by the messaging server. The above steps could be performed by the wireless connector system  or messaging server .","In some embodiments, the messaging server  or wireless connector system  automatically pushes a presence status data packet to the contacts via the respective email addresses when the out of office utility is enabled. Where the email addresses of the contacts are associated with a mobile device , the presence status data packet is pushed wirelessly to the respective mobile devices  of the contacts via the wireless connector system . In some embodiments, the wireless connector system  could maintain information concerning the type of network with which mobile devices  are connected to the wireless network . In such embodiments, the presence status data packets could be pushed wirelessly to the respective mobile devices  when connected via a relatively inexpensive network type such as Wi-Fi\u2122 but sent only in response to a trigger condition or request when not connected via a relatively inexpensive network type.","As noted above, the personal address book  is synchronized between the mobile device  and the messaging server . The determination of which contacts in the personal address book  are managed by the messaging server  may be made ahead of time and stored by the wireless connector system  or messaging server . For example, this determination may be made each time a contact record is added or modified. In such cases, the messaging server  can automatically push a presence status data packet to the predetermined contacts via the respective email addresses. It will be appreciated that the contacts in the personal address book  may be associated with mobile device , a computer  or both.","As noted above, in other embodiments the presence status data packet is determined and sent to the contacts from the messaging server  in response to one of a number of different trigger conditions rather than being pushed. The trigger conditions may be any of the trigger conditions mentioned above such as a request for the out of office presence status for a particular contact or user, selection input or lookup of the contact or user in a communication application such as the email client  on the mobile device  or computer , selection input or lookup of the contact or user in personal address book, input or lookup of the contact or user in the global address book , or input or lookup of the contact or user in another communication application configured to share presence information based on out of office presence status.","It will be appreciated that sending the presence status data packet \u201con demand\u201d in response to a trigger condition and\/or request rather than automatically pushing the presence status data packet may reduce data charges by limited the presence status data packets which are sent by the messaging server .","The messaging server  may also cancel or override the sending of out of office replies for recipients to whom the presence status data packets were sent. This may involve the messaging server  updating its records in respect of the out of office utility of the first email account to indicate that out of office replies are not to be sent to those recipients. Messaging servers  supporting the out of office utility typically only send out of office replies the first time that a message is received from a particular user after the out of office utility has been enabled. To support this functionality, messaging servers  typically maintain a list of email addresses\/email accounts to which an out of office reply has been sent. When an email address\/email account is on this list, no further out of office reply is sent to the email address\/email account. The list is maintained until the out of office utility is disabled at which time the list is cleared. In a similar fashion, the messaging server  may store a list of recipients (e.g., email addresses\/email accounts) to which the data packet was sent when the out of office utility is enabled for the first email account. The messaging server  will then sending out office replies when an email message address to the first email account is received only when the received email messages is not in the list of recipients. The list is maintained until the out of office utility is disabled for the first email account at which time the list is cleared.","In some embodiments, one or more predetermined presence rules are checked by the messaging server  before sending the presence status data packet. Depending on the predetermined presence rules, the presence status may only be provided when a predetermined presence rule associated with the first email account specifies that presence status is to be shared. The predetermined presence rule may also define the one or more recipients with which the presence status is shared, possible by user name and\/or user group. The predetermined presence rule defining the one or more recipients with which the presence status is shared may be used instead of analysed personal address books of the \u201cout of office\u201d user or other users having email accounts managed by the messaging server  is, or could be applied as a filter on the results of that analyzed.","Next, in step  the presence status data packets sent by the messaging server  are then received by the contacts on respective mobile devices , computers , or both. This step is performed by the out of office module , or by the email client  when the out of office module  is part of the email client . The presence status data packets are typically device level messages rather than messages meant for display. The presence status data packets typically occur and are processed at the transport layer of the device communication protocol stack and are not displayed on the display screen . However, presence status data packets could occur at a different layer in the device communication protocol stack in other embodiments.","Next, in step  the presence status of \u201cout of office\u201d contained in the presence status data packet is stored in the corresponding contact record in the personal address book  in a presence status field, or possibly in the office of office module . The presence status field may or may not be a displayable field depending on the embodiment.","Next, in step  a visual indication of \u201cout of office\u201d presence status displayed in a user interface screen providing a visual indication of presence status on the display screen  of the mobile device , or a display screen of a computer . In at least some embodiments, the user interface screen is configured for receiving input identifying one or more users via the user interface screen. The user interface screen may be a dialing screen  of phone application  in which dialling information for an outgoing call is input as shown in , an email message composition user interface screen  in which information for an email message is input as shown in , a user interface screen of the personal address book  such as a contact record user interface screen providing a detailed view of a contact record or a contact list user interface screen providing a list or summary view of multiple contact records of the personal address book , or any other user interface screens of the mobile device  or computer  which provides a visual indication of presence status for other users. The user interface screen is typically a communication application user interface screen.","The input identifying one or more users could be input received via a contact input field of the user interface screen, such as a field of the address portion  of the email message composition user interface screen , the dialing field  of the dialing screen , or a look field of a personal address book user interface screen (not shown). In response to receiving the input identifying one or more users Alternatively, the input identifying one or more users could be selection input selecting one of the contact records displayed in a menu of contact entries in a personal address book user interface screen (not shown) to display a detailed view of that contact record. In response to the received input, the visual indication of presence status is displayed in the user interface screen for one or more users matching the input in accordance with the stored presence status.","In some embodiments in which the input identifying one or more users is input received via a contact input field, the method includes the steps (not show) of determining the one or more users which match the received input, and displaying a list of the one or more users which match the received input in the user interface screen. The visual indication of presence status is displayed in the list of the user interface screen in association with the respective users. In some embodiments, the visual indication is displayed only when the stored presence status is \u201cout of office\u201d.","If the user interface screen which provides a visual indication of presence status is not displayed on the display screen of the computer  or mobile device  when the presence update data packet is received, then the out of office presence status will be displayed when the corresponding user interface screen is next displayed. This may occur in embodiments in which presence status is pushed in that, when the pushed presence update data packet is received, the currently displayed user interface screen may not provide a visual indication of presence status. In contrast, trigger conditions which request presence status are typically generated in the context of user interface screens which do provide a visual indication of presence status.","The \u201cout of office\u201d presence status may be indicated by the background colour of a respective field in the user interface screen, the colour of the text within the respective field, a corresponding icon, a text label, or any combination of these. The indication of \u201cout of office\u201d presence status is not intended to be limited to any particular user interface scheme.","Next, in step  the email client  receives input to disable the out of office utility in connection with the first email account from a computer  or mobile device . The input may be user input received via respective input via one or more input devices of the computer  or mobile device , or an automated input generated by the operating system or application of the computer  or mobile device  in response to a determination that the user is \u201cin the office\u201d.","A determination that the user is \u201cin the office\u201d may be made using any one or more of various methodologies. In some embodiments, the location of a mobile device  associated with the first email account may be determined via triangulation based on location information from base stations  in the wireless network , or a GPS subsystem of the mobile device . When the mobile device  is less than a predetermined distance from the predetermined office location, the respective device user is determined to be \u201cin the office\u201d. The predetermined distance and predetermined office location may be configurable in some embodiments, and could be stored locally on the mobile device  or shared with the messaging server .","In other embodiments, calendar event data from a calendar application  could be used to determine that the user is in the office, for example, based on the calendar event data of scheduled events stored by the calendar application  and\/or messaging server . Thus, the calendar application  and\/or messaging server  could automatically generate an input to disable the out of office utility in connection with the device user's email account (i.e., the first email account) when a calendar event occurs in the device user's calendar with an availability status option other than \u201cOut of Office\u201d.","Next, in step  the messaging server  managing the first email account is notified by the computer  or mobile device  that the out of office utility has been disabled. This step is performed by the out of office module , or by the email client  when the out of office module  is part of the email client .","Next, in step  an out of office presence status is provided in response to the enabling of the out of office utility. In some embodiments, providing the presence status comprises sending a presence status of \u201cin the office\u201d in a presence status data packet to one or more contacts of the device user who have email accounts managed by the messaging server . In some embodiments, the messaging server  automatically pushes a presence status data packet to the contacts via the respective email addresses when the out of office utility is disabled. Where the email addresses of the contacts are associated with a mobile device , the presence status data packet is pushed wirelessly to the respective mobile devices  of the contacts. In other embodiments, the presence status data packet is determined and sent to the contacts from the messaging server  in response to one of a number of different trigger conditions rather than being pushed.","Next, in step  the presence status data packets sent by the messaging server  are then received by the contacts on respective mobile devices , computers , or both. This step is performed by the out of office module , or by the email client  when the out of office module  is part of the email client .","Next, in step  the presence status of \u201cin the office\u201d contained in the presence status data packet is stored in the corresponding contact record in the personal address book  in a presence status field, or possibly in the office of office module . In some embodiments, a default presence status of \u201cin the office\u201d is used as this tends to be the normal circumstance. In such embodiments, the presence status field could be empty when the presence status is \u201cin the office\u201d. Using a default presence status which assumes a device user is \u201cin the office\u201d unless otherwise provided reduces stored information and onscreen notifications, saving memory and processing resources. This also avoids cluttering or otherwise complicating user interface screens by providing onscreen notifications only when contacts are \u201cout of office\u201d.","Next, in step  a visual indication of \u201cin the office\u201d presence status is displayed in a user interface screen providing a visual indication of presence status. In accordance with the default presence status which assumes a device user is \u201cin the office\u201d, in some embodiments no affirmative visual indication is provided when a user is \u201cin the office. The user's presence status of \u201cin the office\u201d can be determined by a device user by a lack of any affirmative visual indication. That is, the default text and background are used to display the contact name and\/or other information. If the user interface screen which provides a visual indication of presence status is displayed on the display screen when the presence update data packet is received, then the user interface screen will need to be redisplayed with the new out of office presence status of \u201cin the office\u201d. If the user interface screen which provides the visual indication of presence status is not displayed on the display screen of the computer  or mobile device  when the presence update data packet is received, then the presence status will be displayed when the corresponding user interface screen is next displayed. In other embodiments, an affirmative visual indication could be provided when a user is \u201cin the office\u201d to provide affirmative presence status.","The present disclosure uses the out of office utility, a common feature of email clients, as the basis for presence status determination and delivery. This is advantageous in several respects. Firstly, because the out of office utility is a feature commonly used by users, it may be easier for users to adapt existing email behaviours to use the out of office utility for sharing presence status. Thus, out of office presence status enhances existing email messaging behaviours of device users rather than requiring users to change their habits or learn new habits in order to take advantage of the method of sharing presence provided by the present disclosure. This may increase adoption rates of using out of office presence status. Secondly, messaging servers and email clients  only require minor additions and modifications to support out of office presence status. Lastly, out of office presence status may be sharing with other messaging applications via the messaging server  and\/or the personal address book of a computer or mobile device. For example, out of office presence status may be provided in the message composition environment, address book, telephone application, or other communication application. When out of office presence status may be provided in the message composition environment in advance of a user sending a message so that the user can choose an alternative means for contacting the user who is \u201cout of office\u201d. For example, a user who was composing a message to a first email address may then use an alternate email address, initiate a telephone call, send an IM message or text message, or select another means of communication to reach the out of office user. Moreover, if out of office presence status is provided in advance of sending a message, the sending of traditional out of office replies could be eliminated if desired.","While the operations  have been described as occurring in a particular order, it will be appreciated to persons skilled in the art that some of the steps may be performed in a different order provided that the result of the changed order of any given step will not prevent or impair the occurrence of subsequent steps. Furthermore, some of the steps described above may be combined in other embodiments, and some of the steps described above may be separated into a number of sub-steps in other embodiments. In addition, while the operations  have been described as being performed by computing devices (e.g., computers  and mobile devices ) having email accounts managed by a common messaging server  within the network , the described functionality could be extended to \u201cexternal\u201d computing devices outside of the network  with the assistance of a proxy server for managing the out of office presence information between network computing devices and external computing devices.","While the present disclosure is primarily described in terms of a method of sharing presence information performed by electronic devices and a messaging server, the teachings of the present disclosure also extend to methods performed by an electronic device which has its out of office utility enabled\/disabled and notifies the messaging server, to methods performed by the messaging server or a wireless connector system in response to receiving the notification that the out of office utility enabled\/disabled and in generating presence status data packets, to methods performed by an electronic device which receives and processes presence status data packets from the messaging server or wireless connector system and uses the presence status, and to suitably configured electronic devices, messaging servers and wireless connector systems.","While the present disclosure is primarily described in terms of methods, a person of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the present disclosure is also directed to various apparatus including components for performing at least some of the aspects and features of the described methods, be it by way of hardware components, software or any combination of the two, or in any other manner. Moreover, an article of manufacture for use with the apparatus, such as a pre-recorded storage device or other similar computer readable medium including program instructions recorded thereon, or a computer data signal carrying computer readable program instructions may direct an apparatus to facilitate the practice of the described methods.
