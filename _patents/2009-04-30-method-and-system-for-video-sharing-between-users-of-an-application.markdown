For example, the action may be the selection of a menu item from a menu (e.g., selection of a radio button, selecting from a drop down menu, selecting an option from the menu bar or a submenu item), the selection of a button (e.g., submit button, accept button, etc.), the submission of data (e.g., entering a name or category of a transaction, adding a label, and other such submissions), and other such actions. In one or more embodiments of the invention, the actions stored by the textual based document () exclude the moving of a mouse or a cursor, such as from one position on the user interface to another position on the user interface.","In one or more embodiments of the invention, the steps (e.g., step  (), step n ()) include an action identifier (e.g., action identifier  (), action identifier n ()) and a parameter (e.g., parameter  (), parameter n ()). Each of these components of the steps is discussed below.","In one or more embodiments of the invention, the action identifier (e.g., action identifier  (), action identifier n ()) provides a unique identifier for the action. For example, the action identifier may be an identifier of the user interface component in which the user submits data, an identifier of the user interface component selected, etc. In one or more embodiments of the invention, the identifier is a name, a numeric identifier, or an alphanumeric identifier. Thus, rather than storing a series of screen images representing each movement of the mouse, an action identifier corresponding to the action is stored.","In one or more embodiments of the invention, the parameter (e.g., parameter  (), parameter n ()) identifies additional input about the action. For example, the parameter may include text submitted by a user in the text box, an identifier of the menu item selected, and other such information. In one or more embodiments of the invention, some steps may be stored without a parameter. For example, if the user is selecting an \u201caccept\u201d button (e.g., to accept a contract), then the step corresponding to the selection of the accept button may not include a parameter.","For the following example, consider the scenario in which the assisting user applies the travel category to a financial transaction then saves the assisting user's change. When the assisting user performs the above actions, the assisting user may perform the following: move the mouse from an initial position on the screen to a position covering the category identifier; select the travel category; move the mouse from the position covering the mouse category to a position over the file menu; select the file menu; move the mouse to the save button in the file menu; and select the save button.","In the example, the textual based document for the above action includes two steps in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention.

In one or more embodiments of the invention, the support video metadata () includes information describing the support video, such as an identifier of the assisting user, a date and time of the support video, an identifier of the discussion thread, keywords extracted from the support video or information about the subject of the support video, one or more identifiers of the version of application, year in which the version of the application was release, and other information. The keywords may be derived from the title of the support video (discussed above), description of the support video (discussed above), the graphical user interface components used in creating the support video, and\/or from other sources describing the support video.","In one or more embodiments of the invention, as shown in , the textual based document () is connected to a support video mapping (). In one or more embodiments of the invention, the support video mapping () provides a mapping between each possible action identifier () and actions (e.g., application\u2014version X action (), application\u2014version Y action ()). For example, the support video mapping () correspond to a universal translation table that maps actions for different versions of the application. Other data structures may be used to store the support video mapping without departing from the scope of the invention. Thus, each action identifier (e.g., action identifier  (), action identifier n ()) in the textual based document () is listed in the support video mapping () in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention.","In one or more embodiments of the invention, the action identifiers are common across different versions of the application. Thus, the same action identifier () may be used to define the action for the version of the application used by the assisting user and the version of the application used by the perplexed user.","In one or more embodiments of the invention, the action (e.g., application\u2014version X action (), application\u2014version Y action ()) defines how the step should be displayed based on the which version of the application that the user, who is viewing the support video, is using. The action (e.g., application\u2014version X action (), application\u2014version Y action ()) may be stored in memory as instructions, such as in a program's subroutine. For example, the action may be to select a specific graphical user interface component, submit data, etc.","Alternatively, rather than using action identifiers that are universal to different versions of the application, the action identifiers may be specific to the assisting user's version of the application. In such embodiments, the support video mapping may map the action identifiers as defined by the assisting user's version of the application with the corresponding actions for the perplexed user's version of the application. The mapping may contain a mapping for each combination of versions of the application.","In one or more embodiments of the invention, the same action identifier may map to a series of actions. Specifically, a single step in one version of the application may correspond to multiple steps in another version of the application. In such a scenario, the multiple steps correspond to the series of actions. Although not shown in , the textual based document () may be associated with one or more audio files. The audio files may be provided, for example, by the assisting user. In particular, while the assisting user is creating or editing the support video, the assisting user may describe the actions the user performed or is performing using an input device, such as a microphone.

Example  show an example in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention. In the example illustrated in example , consider the scenario in which Pete, a perplexed user, is trying to find out how to write a check using Version 2009 of a financial application (\u201cVersion 2009\u201d). Alex, the assisting user, created a support video using Version 2003 of the financial application (\u201cVersion 2003\u201d) for writing the check. In the example, to create the video, Alex selected a start support video command in the help menu of Version 2003.","Example  shows Version 2003 user interface () when Alex uses the financial application to create the support video in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention. As shown in example , Alex moves the mouse pointer () to the check toolbar icon (). Alex selects the check toolbar icon (). The Version 2003 may record \u201cselect, Write Checks\u201d as the action performed by Alex in the textual based document.","Example  shows the Version 2003 user interface () after Alex selects the check toolbar icon. As shown in , the Version 2003 user interface () shows a check. Because only a check is displayed and Alex does not perform any action of selecting a graphical user interface component or submitting data, the Version 2003 may not record anything until Alex performs the next step.","Example  shows the Version 2003 user interface () when Alex performs the next step in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention. As shown in example , Alex moves the mouse pointer () to the save and close button (). Alex selects the save and close button (). The Version 2003 may record \u201cselect, save and close\u201d as the action performed by Alex in the textual based document.","After Alex completes the actions for the support video, Alex selects a stop video command (not shown) in the help menu. Alex uploads the textual based document to a help forum devoted to the financial application. At this state, in one or more embodiments of the invention, the textual based document may include only two steps: 1. \u201cselect, Write Checks\u201d and 2. \u201cselect, save and close\u201d and may include metadata identifying it as created with Version 2003.","Continuing with the example, after Alex creates the support video, Pete searches the help forum using his internet browser. Specifically, Pete submits the question \u201cwrite checks\u201d to the help forum. One of the results shown to Pete is a link to the support video created by Alex. Pete selects the link to download the textual based document to his computer. The support video opens in the Version 2009 on Pete's computer.","Because the support video is created with Version 2003, Version 2009 obtains a translation table to map the steps listed in the textual based document to the Version 2009 actions. Specifically, in the example, the translation table maps \u201cselect, Write Checks\u201d to \u201cselect, Banking Menu\u201d and \u201cselect, Write Checks Menu Option.\u201d In the example, the translation table, maps \u201cselect, save and close\u201d to \u201cselect, save and close.\u201d Accordingly, for Version 2009, the support video renders 3 steps: 1. \u201cselect, Banking Menu,\u201d 2. \u201cselect, Write Checks Menu Option,\u201d and 3. \u201cselect, save and close.\u201d","Example  shows an example Version 2009 user interface support video () that is displayed for Pete in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention.

Version 2009 support video displaying the mouse pointer moving from the start position () to the end position () over the location of the banking menu (). Specifically, the action of the mouse moving is displayed for Pete in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention. The Version 2009 support video may then show the selection of the banking menu () and the result (shown in ).","As shown in the example , the Version 2009 renders the step of \u201cselect, Write Checks Menu Option\u201d by identifying the location of the write checks menu option () in the banking menu in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention. In one or more embodiments of the invention, Version 2009 support video displays the mouse pointer moving from the start position () to the end position () over the location of write checks menu option (). The Version 2009 support video may then show the selection of the write checks menu option () and the result shown in example  in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention.","Example  shows the Version 2009 support video when the Version 2009 support video renders the next step of \u201cselect, save and close\u201d in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention. In one or more embodiments of the invention, the Version 2009 renders the step of \u201cselect, save and close\u201d by identifying the location of the save and close button (). Version 2009 support video displays the mouse pointer moving from the start position () to the end position () over the location of save and close button (). The Version 2009 support video may then show the selection of the save and close button () in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention. In the example, at this stage, Pete has seen the steps required to write a check. Accordingly, Pete is no longer perplexed.","The following is another example of how the support video may be used. In the following example, consider the scenario in which Paul, the perplexed user, is using a business management application for the Paul's business. While Paul is configuring the business management application for his business, Paul wants to find out how to put the logo on the invoices he sends out for his business.","Accordingly, Paul searches the Help forum for an answer to this question. Paul searches the help forum by using the help menu option in his business management application. He may search the help forum with the question, \u201cHow do I put a logo on my invoices?\u201d","The search engine of the help forum responds to Paul's question with a list shown the most likely candidates for answering Paul's question. Next to each candidate in the list may include an icon that indicates to the user what type of help medium the candidate is. For example, an icon representing a piece of paper may indicate that the candidate is a text list of the steps to perform. As another example, a video camera may indicate that the solution is a support video.","Continuing with the example, Paul selects the candidate corresponding to the support video. In the example, the support video was created by Annabel, the assisting user. When Annabel created the support video, Annabel used the professional version of the management application. However, Paul's version of the application is the small business version.","In the example, once Paul selects the support video, Paul's management application downloads the textual based document corresponding to the support video. The textual based document is stored on the Paul's local machine in one or more embodiments of the invention.","Further, the management application automatically opens the textual based document without additional input from Paul and starts translating the textual based document to correspond to Paul's version of the management application. The translation may be performed, for example using a Universal Translation Table (UTT) that contains a list of all the action identifiers and shows how the action identifiers are associated across different versions. The UTT may be stored as a part of the overall video help solution that is included in all versions of the management application. The UTT may also be available via a product update for older versions. Thus, if Paul's version does not have a copy of the most current UTT, Paul's version may download the new copy.","In one or more embodiments of the invention, in the example, the translation is performed as following. The management application takes the textual based document that was downloaded when the Paul clicked that specific video. The management application translates each step from the document and finds the corresponding step in Paul's version of the management application using the UTT on Paul's local machine.","The output is displayed in the management application as a hyperlinked list of steps with the steps translated to match Paul's version. Each step is a \u201chyperlink\u201d to allow Paul to navigate through the video. Because each step is a hyperlink list, Paul can skip sections of the process that he already knows the first few steps. Specifically, as Paul navigates to the step, the step is played for Paul. More specifically, Paul can watch the mouse pointer move from one section to the screen to the next section of the screen and watch how the menu options are selected. In one or more embodiments of the invention, while Paul is watching the steps being performed in one pane of the management application, Paul can perform the steps himself to add the logo to his invoices. In other words, while the steps are displayed for the management application, Paul can also perform the steps. Thus, Paul can see exactly how to answer his question for his version of the application. Likewise, because the actions can be translated between versions of the application, Annabel's single creation of a support video can help multiple users that have heterogeneous versions of the application.","In one or more embodiments of the invention, the support video may be used, for example, by the vendor of the application. Specifically, a vendor may view the support video and or the inquiry video to analyze how users are using the application. The vendor may then use the analysis as a basis for changes in subsequent versions of the application or in patches for current versions of the application.","Embodiments of the invention may be implemented on virtually any type of computer regardless of the platform being used.
