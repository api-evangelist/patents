The image forming apparatus prints the print page received from the web server.","(First Embodiment)","An MFP (Multi Functional Peripheral), which serves as an image forming apparatus according to the embodiment of the present invention, and a web server will be described below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["100","401"]},"A service provider A , a service provider B , and a service provider C  provide a variety of information as web contents through a network . In the first embodiment, these service providers provide the following items of information, respectively. The service provider A  is a service provider for providing restaurant reservation information. The service provider B  is a service provider for providing discount coupon information. The service provider C  is a service provider for providing map information.","A service provider for executing a mashup service has a web server . The web server  responds to an information request made by a user via a network  from a browser .","The web server  requests and acquires contents which correspond to required information from the service providers A , B  and C , in response to a user information request transmitted from a PC (Personal Computer)  acting as a client terminal.","The web server  generates a web page according to mashup contents obtained by integrating the acquired contents with each other, and returns the generated web page to the PC  via the network . The PC  displays the web page received from the web server , on a screen of the browser .","An example of the mashup service will be described referring to .  shows an example of a browser screen upon accessing a mashup service site for restaurant reservation.","When a user specifies items such as \u201cdate and time\u201d, \u201cnumber of persons\u201d, \u201cbudget\u201d, and \u201clocation (to be designated on a map)\u201d, if there are restaurants meeting that condition and discount coupons at these restaurants, the items of information are listed, and locations of the restaurants are designated on a map.","Transfer of information in the mashup service will be described referring to .","First, a user accesses the web server  providing the mashup service from the browser  of the PC . Next, when a user inputs conditions (date and time, number of persons, budget, and location in the example of ) in an HTML style form, and presses an information acquisition button, the PC  transmits these items of information as an information request to the web server .","The web server  executes a web application  of a mashup service site, accesses a plurality of service providers (the service provider A , the service provider B , and the service provider C ), based upon information on the aforementioned conditions, and acquires required contents. The mashup service per se does not have restaurant information, discount coupon information, or map information.","The web server  acquires contents of these items of information via the network  from a plurality of service providers (for example, the service provider A  for providing restaurant reservation information; the service provider B  for providing discount coupon information; and the service provider C  for providing map information). The web server  integrates the acquired contents with each other, generates a web page of the mashup contents, and transmits the generated web page to the PC . The PC  acquires the web page transmitted from the web server , and displays the transmitted web page on the browser .","In addition, the web server  generates a print page based on a predetermined print format, in response to a user print request transmitted from the PC . The web server  transmits the generated print page to the MFP  (image forming apparatus), and MFP  prints the generated print page. Details of generating a print page will be described later.","Further, the web server  has a web application  and a variety of printer drivers  to  for printing. Details of these printer drivers will be described later in their related section.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":"100"},"The web server  has a CPU (Central Processing Unit) , a ROM (Read Only Memory) , a RAM (Random Access Memory)  and an HDD (Hard Disk Drive) .","The CPU  is a processor for executing the web application  and the described processes that use printer drivers  to , etc.","The ROM  is a nonvolatile memory for pre-storing programs and data.","The RAM  is a memory employed as a work area, for temporarily storing programs and data upon executing the programs.","The HDD  stores a web page created by a web page generating unit  to be described later, a print page created by a print page generating unit , and contents or the like acquired from a service provider. Instead of the HDD , a storage device such as a readable\/writable nonvolatile semiconductor memory or an optical disk drive may be used.","The web application  is a program for implementing a web service. The web server  functions as each of the several functional units, such as the web page generating unit , a print service calling unit , and a print page generating unit , by executing the web application . The web server  forms a storage area of a cache  in the HDD  by executing the web application .","Each of these functional units, and the cache , will be described below.","The web page generating unit  analyzes an information request from the PC , and determines which one of the information requests is to be transmitted to which one of the service providers. The web page generating unit  then transmits the information request to the service providers pertinent to this determination. When contents according to the information request are transmitted from these service providers, this generating unit then acquires the transmitted contents. The web page generating unit  generates a web page on which the acquired contents from the plurality of service providers are integrated with each other. The generated web page, as described previously, is passed to the web server , and is then transmitted to the PC .","The web page generated by the web page generating unit  is generally described in a markup language, and it is preferable that the page be described in HTML, XML, or XPS, in particular.","The cache  stores the web page generated by the web page generating unit . The web page generated as a result of a user having made an information request is stored in the cache . The web page accumulated in the cache  is returned to the PC  or the MFP  without making an information request to the service providers again by an information request from the PC  or an information request from the MFP . However, cache information may be incorrect due to a time lag between a time of the information request from the PC  and a time of the information request made from a user or a printer again. But even if data is present in the cache , the web page generating unit  can read web pages directly from the service providers. It is presupposed to be selectable as to whether the web page generating unit  acquires the web pages stored in the cache or newly acquires information from the service providers.","In addition, the cache  stores contents that the web page generating unit  has acquired from the service providers.","A print service calling unit  activates a print service unit  in the MFP  upon a print request from the PC . Specifically, when the print service calling unit  calls a print service of the MFP , the print service unit  of the MFP  is activated.","A print page generating unit  generates a print page for printing and transmits the generated print page to the MFP , in response to a print page generation request from a print page generation requesting unit  of the MFP . In detail, the print page generating unit  analyzes the print request transmitted from the PC , in advance of generating a print page, in response to the print page generation request. The print page generating unit  reads out contents which correspond to the print request from the cache , based upon a result of the analysis. Further, the print page generating unit  integrates the read out contents with each other, shapes the integrated contents in a printing form, and generates a print page. At this time, the print page generating unit  utilizes a printer driver to be described later, to thereby generate a print page of a format suitable for that printer driver. The paraphrase \u201cshaping in a printing form\u201d designates enlargement\/reduction of image object(s) or frame(s), page break settings, or additions of page number, etc.","If contents to be acquired have already been erased from the cache , the print page generating unit  transmits an information request to a service provider serving as a transmission source of the contents. Afterwards, if contents responsive to the information request from the service provider are transmitted, this generating unit acquires the transmitted contents, and generates a print page as described above.","Next, each of the printer drivers will be described. As described above, the print page generating unit  generates a print page in response to a print page generation request from the MFP . At this time, the print page generating unit  selects an optimal printer driver, based upon equipment information or print condition information transmitted from the MFP . The printer drivers include an HTML printer driver , a PDF printer driver , a PS printer driver , a specific-device-type-A printer driver , and a specific-device-type-B printer driver . Here, the HTML printer driver , the PDF printer driver , and the PS printer driver  are general-purpose printer drivers, which are not dependent upon a printer device type, according to a type of page to be generated. The specific-device-type-A printer driver  and the specific-device-type-B printer driver  are printer drivers for a specific printer type. Each of these printer drivers is called by the print page generating unit , and is executed by the CPU .","The HTML printer driver  generates a print page in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). In a case where this driver is selected, it is presupposed that a printer has a web page printing function. The HTML printer driver  not only merely outputs a browser screen as is, but also generates a web page such that a map does not break off of a certain page, for example, based upon a print condition such as a paper size.","The PDF printer driver  generates a print page in the PDF (Portable Document Format) style. In a case where this driver is selected, it is presupposed that the printer has a PDF document printing function.","The PS printer driver  generates a print page in the PS (POSTSCRIPT\u00ae) style. In a case where this driver is selected, it is presupposed that a printer has a PS printing function.","The specific-device-type-A printer driver  is a printer driver dependent upon a specific device type A. For example, it is possible to specify a printer in which printing is performed in an environment in which a mashup service system is used as an in-house system or the like. Therefore, with respect to a printer employed in-house, a printer driver for that device type is provided for the web server . Apart from such an in-house system, the mashup service system may be used in such a way that a printer driver of a popular printer driver frequently used, for example, is provided.","The specific-device-type-B printer driver  is a printer driver dependent upon a specific device type B, and is provided for a reason similar to that described above.","The PC (Personal Computer) , which may act as the client terminal, is a user-available device. The PC  has a browser  for accessing a mashup service site (web server ), and an OS (Operating System)  managing operation of the PC .","The MFP (Multi Functional Peripheral)  is an image forming apparatus that builds in a copy function, a print function, a scan function, a facsimile function or the like.","In a typical printing method, a screen displayed on a PC browser has been printed via a printer driver provided in the PC, by employing a printing function of the PC browser. The MFP  of the embodiment transmits a print page generation request to the web server , in response to a call for a print service from the web server . Further, the MFP  acquires and prints a print page generated by the web server .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":"401"},"The MFP  has a CPU (Central Processing Unit) , a ROM (Read Only Memory) , a RAM (Random Access Memory) , an HDD (Hard Disk Drive) , an operating panel , a print engine  and a document scanner .","The HDD  stores session information, etc., acquired by a session information storage unit  to be described later. Instead of the HDD , a storage device such as a readable\/writable nonvolatile semiconductor memory or an optical disk drive may be used.","The operating panel  is a panel unit having a display device and an input device for performing a variety of operations on the MFP . The display device displays a state of the MFP  or information for operational instructions. A user operates the MFP  by means of an input to the input device.","The print engine  performs a printing process. In the embodiment of the present invention, this engine prints on a sheet of paper a print page passed from the print service unit  to be described later.","The document scanner  is a functional unit for scanning an image of a hardcopy manuscript and converting the scanned image to electronic data.","The CPU  is a processor that executes a process of an operating program of the MFP .","The ROM  is a nonvolatile memory for pre-storing the operating program and data.","The RAM  is a memory employed as a work area, for temporarily storing the operating program and data upon executing the program.","The MFP  functions as each of the several functional units, such as the print service unit , the print page generation requesting unit , a session information storage unit , and a scan data combining unit , by executing the operating program.","The print service unit  is activated by an input from an external device, and provides a print service. Specifically, the print service unit  is activated in response to a print service call from a print service calling unit  of the web server . The activated print service unit  instructs the print page generation requesting unit  to transmit a request for generating a print page. Further, the print service unit  acquires the print page generated by the print page generating unit .","The print page generation requesting unit  transmits a print page generation request to the print page generating unit  of the web application  of the mashup service, in response to an instruction from the print service unit .","The session information storage unit  stores, in the HDD , session information required to generate a print page transmitted simultaneously with a print service call from the print service calling unit . For example, the session information storage unit  may store, as the session information, a URL obtained upon accessing the web server  and a parameter value following the URL, or may store print page attribute information. By storing these items of information, once a print page generation request has occurred, it becomes possible to store attribute information of the page, to display a screen on the operating panel  again without employing a PC, or to request print page generation. A detailed description will be given in a second embodiment.","The scan data combining unit  combines image data scanned by the document scanner  with print data. The scan data combining unit  passes the combined print data to the print service unit . The scan data combining unit  has an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) function. For example, the scan data combining unit  can combine scan data with data of a mashup service site by reading a receipt. In this manner, this combining unit can generate liquidation result data of the restaurant reservation in , for example, or alternatively, can combine a result of data combining with the mashup site concerning traffic conditions or accommodation reservations for business trip, with its related transport expense settlement. A detailed description will be given in a third embodiment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 5"],"b":["100","401"]},"In the first embodiment, there is provided a unit for calling a print service of the MFP  on the screen () of a web page transmitted from the web page generating unit  and displayed on a browser, for example, a \u201cprint\u201d button as shown in . When a user depresses the print button on the web page displayed on a browser , a PC  transmits a print request to the web server . The web server  calls a print service of the MFP  in response to this print request. In this manner, upon the printing process, the web server  and the MFP  are cooperatively linked with each other in response to the print request from the PC .","Specifically, processing is performed as follows.","S: The PC  accesses the web server  for providing a mashup service in response to a user instruction, and displays a web page on the browser .","S: When a user depresses a \u201cprint\u201d button on the web page displayed at S, the PC  detects a user print instruction via the browser .
