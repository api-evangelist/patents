title: Comb sense microphone
abstract: A miniature microphone, comprising a diaphragm, supported for displacement in response to acoustic waves, from which a plurality of projections extend; a plurality of projections extending from a surface; a body, supporting the surface to maintain the plurality of projections from the diaphragm and the plurality of projections from the surface in close proximity; and an electromagnetic sensor adapted to sense an electromagnetic interaction between the plurality of projections from the diaphragm and the plurality of projections from the surface and produce an electrical signal in response thereto. The interaction may be detected substantially without inducing a force which tends to substantially displace the diaphragm, since the electrostatic force is substantially parallel to the diaphragm surface.

The Government has certain right in the invention.","The invention pertains to capacitive microphones and, more particularly to capacitive microphones having rigid, silicon diaphragms with a plurality of fingers interdigitated and interacting with corresponding fingers of an adjacent, fixed frame.","A common approach for transducing the motion of a microphone diaphragm into an electronic signal is to construct a parallel-plate capacitor where a fixed electrode (usually called a back plate) is placed in close proximity to a flexible (i.e., movable) microphone diaphragm. As the flexible diaphragm moves relative to the back plate in response to varying sound pressure, the capacitance of the microphone varies. This variation in capacitance may be translated to an electrical signal using a number of well known techniques. One such method is shown in  which is a schematic diagram of a typical capacitor (condenser) microphone  of the prior art. A fixed back plate  is spaced apart a distance d  from a flexible diaphragm . A DC bias voltage Vb is applied across back plate  and diaphragm .","An amplifier  has an input electrically connected to diaphragm  so as to produce an output voltage Vo in response to movement of diaphragm  relative to back plate . Because the output signal Vo is proportional to bias voltage Vb, it is desirable to make Vb as high as possible so as to maximize output signal voltage Vo of microphone .","Unfortunately, the bias voltage Vb exerts an electrostatic force on diaphragm  in the direction of the back plate. This limits the practical upper limit of the bias voltage Vb. This electrostatic force, f, is given by the equation:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"f","mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mo":"\u2146","mrow":{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"x"}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":["1","2"]},"mo":"\u2062","msubsup":{"mi":["CV","b"],"mn":"2"}}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"C","mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mi":["\u025b","A"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},{"mi":["d","x"],"mo":"+"}]}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]}}}},"br":{},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["\u03b5 is the permittivity of air (\u03b5=8.86\u00d710farads\/meter);","A is the area of the diaphragm  of the microphone;","d is the nominal distance  between the back plate  and the diaphragm ; and","x is the displacement of the diaphragm, a positive value indicating displacement away from the back plate ."]}}}},"Combining Equations (1) and (2) yields:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0014"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"f","mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mrow":{"mo":"-","msubsup":{"mi":["V","b"],"mn":"2"}},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mi":["\u025b","A"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},{"mn":"2","mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["d","x"],"mo":"+"}},"mn":"2"}}]}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"3"}}]}}}}},"It will be noted that regardless of the polarity of Vb, this electrostatic force f acts to pull diaphragm  towards back plate . If Vb is increased beyond a certain magnitude, diaphragm  collapses against back plate . In order to avoid this collapse, the diaphragm must be designed to have sufficient stiffness. Unfortunately, this requirement for diaphragm stiffness conflicts with the need for high diaphragm compliance necessary to ensure responsiveness to sound pressure.","Because in microphones of this construction, electrostatic force f does not vary linearly with x, distortion of the output signal relative to the sensed acoustic pressure typically results.","Yet another problem occurs in these types of microphones. The presence of back plate  typically causes excessive viscous damping of the diaphragm . This damping is caused by the squeezing of the air in the narrow gap  separating the back plate  and the diaphragm .","The comb sense microphone of the present invention overcomes all of these shortcomings of microphones of the prior art.","In accordance with the present invention there is provided an ultra-miniature microphone incorporating a rigid silicon resiliently supported substrate which forms a diaphragm. A series of fingers disposed around the perimeter of the diaphragm interacts with mating fingers disposed adjacent the diaphragm fingers with a small gap in between.","In other words, the fingers are interdigitated. The movement of the diaphragm fingers relative to the fixed fingers varies the capacitance, thereby allowing creation of an electrical signal responsive to a varying sound pressure at the diaphragm. Because the electrostatic force on the fingers does not have a significant dependence on the out-of-plane displacement of the diaphragm, the classic problem of attraction of the diaphragm to the back plate discussed hereinabove is effectively overcome. The diaphragm can be designed to be very compliant without creating instabilities due to electrostatic forces. The multiple fingers allow creation of a microphone having a high output voltage relative to microphones of the prior art. This, in turn, allows creation of very low noise microphones.","The diaphragm is readily formed using well-known silicon microfabrication techniques to yield low manufacturing costs.","It should be noted that many capacitive sensors utilize interdigitated comb fingers. The primary uses of this sensing approach are in silicon accelerometers and gyroscopes well known to those of skill in those arts. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,233,213, 5,505,084, 5,635,639, 5,796,001, 6,032,352, 6,473,187, 6,904,804, 7,013,730, 7,024,933, 7,047,808, 7,074,637, 7,075,160, 7,077,007, each of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference. Such sensors generally consist of a resiliently supported proof mass that moves relative to the surrounding substrate due to the motion of the substrate. An essential feature of these constructions is that the proof mass is supported only on a small fraction of its perimeter, allowing a significant portion of the perimeter to be available for capacitive detection of the relative motion of the proof mass and the surrounding substrate through the use of comb fingers. This requirement has precluded the use of comb fingers for capacitive sensing in microphones because the typical approach to the formation of a microphone diaphragm is to construct a very thin plate that is effectively clamped along its entire perimeter. Because silicon accelerometers and gyroscopes utilize compliant hinges rather than entirely clamped perimeters, they readily permit the use of comb fingers for sensing.","A highly efficient capacitance microphone that overcomes the deficiencies of classic capacitance microphones of the prior art described hereinabove may be formed by making a diaphragm having a series of fingers disposed around its perimeter. These fingers are then interdigitated with corresponding fingers on a fixed structure analogous to a back plate in microphone  (). That is, the sets of interdigitated fingers are generally coplanar, and electrostatic forces act along the plane of the diaphragm, rather than normal to it, as is the case in known designs.","Referring now to , there is shown a schematic cross-sectional view of an interdigitated finger structure, generally at reference number . A series of fingers  projects from the surface of a substrate . The surface of substrate  is free to move out of the plane of the figure and forms the diaphragm of a microphone. Additional fingers  project from the surface of a fixed structure  representative of a microphone back plate. Fingers  projecting from diaphragm  are free to move with the diaphragm out of the plane of the figure as well as in the direction x indicated by arrow  relative to the fixed structure .","Referring now also to , there is shown an end view of a portion of the fingers of  showing one each of fingers , . Fingers  and  are separated by a gap d . Fingers  and  may overlap one another a distance h .","Each finger ,  has a length l (not shown) in a direction perpendicular to the cross-sectional view of .

Consequently, bias voltage Vb does not reduce the stability of the diaphragm's motion in the x direction; a significantly higher bias voltage Vb may be used without a need to increase diaphragm stiffness, resulting in increased microphone sensitivity without the diaphragm collapse problems of prior art microphones.","In all capacitive sensing applications, the applied static voltage results in an attractive force that acts to bring the moving sensing electrode toward the fixed electrode. In the case of the present comb-sense microphone, this attractive force acts to bring the microphone diaphragm toward its neutral position (i.e., x=0), in line with the fixed fingers. As a result, the bias voltage tends to stabilize the diaphragm rather than lead to instability. As long as the fingers are designed so that they themselves will resist collapsing toward each other, the diaphragm's compliance does not need to be adjusted to avoid collapse against the fixed electrodes. For small displacements, the electrostatic force along the axis of movement tends to return the diaphragm to a zero displacement position, with a force proportionate to the displacement. If for example, the interdigital fingers may be provided on opposing sides of the diaphragm structure, so that the forces tending to displace it with respect to the finger gap balance each other. This means that the diaphragm may be designed to be highly compliant and thus very responsive to sound.","One possible way to obtain an electrical signal from a capacitive microphone is shown in the circuit of , generally at reference number .

In other words, the voltage Vb  may be reduced to 1 volt and, with the 0.1 \u03bcm gaps, the same 2.4 mV\/Pascal output sensitivity may be obtained.","It should be noted that while a significant advantage of this invention is that the bias voltage does not adversely affect the stability of the diaphragm in the x direction, one must still be careful to design the fingers so that they have sufficient stiffness to avoid the situation where the neutral position of the fingers is made to be unstable by the use of too large a value of Vb. In this case, the fingers may deflect such that they touch each other and reduce the performance of the capacitive sensing system. However, it is important to emphasize that the design requirements for the stiffness of the fingers are uncoupled from the requirements that determine the compliance of the diaphragm; it is desirable to use stiff fingers along with a diaphragm that is very compliant in the x direction so that the diaphragm is highly responsive to sound.","In addition to considering the effect of the electrostatic forces on the stability of the fingers, it is not possible to use an arbitrarily large bias voltage because the finite break-down voltage of the air in the gap between the fingers may allow current to flow across the gap which would have a dramatic affect on the electronic signal.","Referring now to , there is shown a schematic representation of a typical diaphragm  in accordance with the present invention.

In alternate embodiments, diaphragm  may be resiliently supported by mechanisms other than a hinge or pivot . For example, diaphragm  could be supported by one or more springs or other resilient structures, not shown, at or near corners of diaphragm . Such springs could support diaphragm  from below in compression or could support diaphragm  from above in tension.

The radial arrangement of the fingers prevents them from getting stuck together when the diaphragm shrinks or expands during fabrication. The fingers radiate from a point on the diaphragm that doesn't move relative to the surrounding substrate. While substantially rectangular diaphragms (, B) have been chosen for purposes of disclosure, the inventive concept of radially disposed fingers may be applied to diaphragms of other shapes.
