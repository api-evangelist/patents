title: System and method for a combination group and individual travel insurance program
abstract: The present invention allows travel organizations to ensure that basic group, or “Core,” travel medical coverage is in effect for their travelers while allowing travelers the ability to upgrade the “Core” insurance if needed or desired. Thus, the organization need not purchase excess insurance, thereby reducing the organization's liability for their group purchase decision. Until now, combining group and individual travel medical insurance has been impossible. Individual travel medical insurance policies could be customized, but travelers covered by a group policy had to accept the coverage their organizations chose. The present invention allows travelers with different needs and tastes from around the world to customize group travel insurance coverage according to their needs and desires. By offering choice, the present invention reduces the likelihood that travelers can successfully claim later that insurance required under the group program was inadequate.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This Application is based upon but does not claim the benefit of Provisional Application No. 61\/110,982, filed in the US Patent and Trademark Office on 3 Jun. 2008.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a system and method of allowing travelers  who are traveling with a group such as an international organization, including but not limited to international volunteers with charitable organizations and international travelers  associated with a commercial traveling group, to combine group and individual travel insurance.","2. Description of Related Art","Today's group travel sponsoring organizations and individual travelers  are more concerned than ever about personal safety and security. Not only is physical safety more in question when traveling than it has ever been, the safety and proper delivery of a traveler's items is also less reliable than it has been in the past. Travelers  can need help in getting out of situations such as natural disasters or political unrest, and travelers  may want their insurance to link together travel programs and personal voyages. With these increasing demands for personal security and security of the traveler's belongings, traveler's insurance, especially for international travel, is now virtually required for each traveler to carry.","Persons traveling as volunteers for nonprofit or government-funded organizations may not have any life or accident insurance whatsoever, or the insurance they have in their home country may not respond well to incidents that occur outside of their home country. The volunteer may be a recent graduate from a high school, college or university, a member of a religion-based volunteer group, a member of a volunteer medical team, a corporate executive, or any other person who travels for volunteer purposes. Insureds may also be travelers  on educational or travel programs that do not include volunteering. The organization may be for-profit or non-profit. These travelers  don't usually buy travel insurance on their own, but generally rely on the travel organization to provide insurance for them.","If a traveler travels with an established group, such as a tour group, travel insurance is provided, with very favorable terms, in the cost of the tour. That level of travel insurance is generally not determined by the individual traveler. The benefit levels and terms for travel insurance are set for groups, and individuals have not been able to customize the limits or kinds of insurances they want. In general, travel insurance for individuals is not used by most travel groups because it does not provide enough benefits for risk management and cost; the organizations commonly use group coverage for volunteers and participants.","Upgrade  options have not been available to people insured under a group travel program in the way that they are available to individual travelers  who purchase individual travel insurance.","The term \u201crisk-taker\u201d is used herein to mean these various potential insurers and insurance mechanisms that are available to the traveler and the travel organization; this term may comprise a traditional insurance company, a self-insurance plan, or any other mechanism that accepts the risk and responsibility of payment of all or part of a client's medical expense  as.","The present invention provides a system and method for an individual to convert group travel insurance to an individual insurance plan while still using both. The present invention does not describe a portability plan; an individual can, under the present invention, add an individual insurance component onto a group travel insurance plan as an enhancement.","The organization that sponsors the travel purchases a basic amount of coverage for their travelers . Then each individual traveler is directed to a website  or other e-commerce means (including Web 2.0, USENET, e-mail, telephone , fax , and FTP) where he or she can choose customized upgrade  options for him-or herself and\/or family members and traveling companions such as wards or children under the program.","The present invention also provides systems and methods to design individual traveler insurance products for a traveler in a manner that provides the individual traveler with the benefits of group traveler insurance plans and rates.","The present invention allows travel organizations to ensure that basic group, or \u201cCore,\u201d travel medical coverage is in effect for their travelers while allowing travelers the ability to upgrade the \u201cCore\u201d insurance if needed or desired. This means the organization does not have to buy too much insurance and the organization's liability for their group purchase decision is reduced. Until now, it has not been possible for travelers to combine group and individual travel medical insurance. Travelers buying individual travel medical insurance could customize their policies, but if the travelers were part of a group policy, they had to accept the coverage their organizations chose for them. The present invention allows travelers with different needs and tastes from around the world to customize group travel insurance coverage according to their needs and desires. By offering choice, the present invention reduces the likelihood that travelers can successfully claim later that insurance required under the group program was inadequate.","Referring now to , a group sponsor  arranges group insurance coverage (referred to herein as \u201cCore Coverage\u201d) with a risk taker  that provides travel medical insurance or insurance of a similar nature through an insurance broker  or through the risk taker  directly. It is also within the scope of the invention for the Core Coverage  plan to be a self-insurance plan or a high-retention or captive plan.","Referring now to , the group sponsor  purchases a basic, or \u201cCore,\u201d coverage that all persons traveling  with the group must carry;","Referring now to , the individual traveler  has the choice to upgrade  his or her insurance package or to carry only the \u201cCore\u201d coverage .","Referring now to , the risk taker , the insurance carrier, or the organization  or the Core program  manager  or administrator  relays the availability of the individual choice option to the individual travelers  and refers them to a website  designed for adding individual upgrades  to the \u201cCore\u201d insurance  purchased by the organization . The term \u201cadministrator\u201d  or \u201cprogram manager\u201d  may refer to service provided by the risk taker . The term \u201cwebsite\u201d  may refer to a social networking or e-commerce website. The website  is, in the current embodiment, provided by the Core Travel Program manager ; however, it is within the scope of the invention for the upgrade website  or other e-commerce means to be provided by the international travel organization  or broker . In that embodiment, the international travel organization or broker  would collect the data regarding individual upgrades  and payment information  and forward that information ,  to the insurance carrier or broker . In an alternate embodiment, the upgrade website  or other e-commerce means may be provided by the risk-taker .","Referring now to , those travelers  who choose to do so can make upgrade purchases  directly on the website  or through other e-commerce means and receive a confirmation of upgrade  coverage from the website  or from the administrator  or Core program manager  or risk taker .","Referring now to , the premiums  for individual upgrades  are sent to the same risk taker  who provides the Core policy  to the group, and who upgrades  that individual's  insurance package  based on his or her choices for upgrades . The website  or other e-commerce means may provide a commercially available mechanism that allows the traveler  to pay  for the additional coverage  online; alternatively, the traveler  may choose to pay the premiums  for coverage by mailing payment to the international travel organization  or to the risk taker  or the broker , either of which may be the designated payee for the purpose of purchasing additional coverage . Upgrades  occur before premiums  are sent; they do not occur, however, until after purchases  are confirmed.","Referring now to , the individual traveler receives a communication  from the risk taker , the risk taker 's computer system, the travel group , or the administrator  confirming and binding the coverage. The binding communication  contains the name of the insured person , the coverages -extended, improved or added, a contact telephone number  and email address , the name of the risk taker , travel assistance information , the policy number , and a limitations statement .","Referring now to , the individual traveler may choose to print out an insurance identification card  from the Core travel insurance website . In the alternative, the sponsoring travel organization  may choose to control the identification card  process by printing and distributing the cards.","Referring now to , a travel group sponsor  arranges \u201cCore Coverage\u201d  with a travel risk taker  through a broker  or agent  or through the risk taker  directly.","The risk taker  is not a party to this invention and the choice of insurance carrier is interchangeable.","International travel organizations  may serve as travel group sponsors  and purchase \u201cCore\u201d insurance coverage  for travelers  planning to travel on programs that may include educational or volunteer programs sponsored by the travel group sponsor . The \u201cCore\u201d coverage  is generally an assortment of benefits that may include medical expense , medical evacuation , death benefit , disability , cancellation , \u201ctail medical\u201d , trip interruption , and\/or reunion benefits . In addition, there can be evacuation extension for natural disaster and political instability , for which the participant need not experience accident or illness for the benefit to apply. In addition, baggage , personal property and, automobile-related  benefits may be included, including collision and personal injury insurance. Specifically, automobile-related  \u201cCore\u201d coverage  may also include coverage for being the driver of an automobile , coverage for third-party liability , or trip delay and expanded travel coverages . The plan type may be a self-insurance plan, a high-retention plan, or a captive plan. Coverage can be provided for individual travelers, the individual traveler's family members, and the individual traveler's traveling companions (the traveler's children and the traveler's wards).","The \u201cCore\u201d benefits  apply automatically to each traveler . The assortment is not fixed and is negotiated with the broker  and\/or the risk-taker  for each sponsoring group . The enrollment is sent to a website  for download by the organization , the program manager , the administrator , or by use of an Application Programming Interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) .","The broker  or \u201cCore\u201d program manager  provides the travel group sponsor  with information about how travelers  can upgrade their individual benefits  on the website , and the organization  chooses the upgrade assortment  it wishes to allow travelers  to access. Travelers  can optionally extend the dates covered by the existing coverage , improve the limits of the existing coverage , and\/or add new coverage . New coverage  comprises any travel- and\/or medical-related coverage that is offered by the risk taker  and the sponsoring organization , but is not included by the sponsoring organization  in the \u201cCore\u201d coverage .","The organization  tells their travelers  of the upgrade option  using any available means of communication including print, telephonic, and\/or electronic, and refers the travelers  to the website  or other e-commerce means provided by the program manager . In an alternate embodiment, the website  or other e-commerce solution may be provided by the risk-taker . In yet an alternate embodiment, the website  or other e-commerce means may be provided by the sponsoring organization  or broker  for the purpose of allowing the traveler  to upgrade  Core insurance coverage .","Travelers  can optionally make upgrade  purchases directly on the website  or alternate e-commerce means, and receive a confirmation  of upgraded coverage . The upgrade  is automatically recorded on the traveler's  enrollment information, usually in a database . The database  minimally contains the following information:\n\n","The upgrade  is independent of the travel organization  and upgrades  play no role in the travel group  administration. At times when the newly insured traveler's  name is not in the database , the organization  can be asked to confirm that insured's  eligibility for coverage, either to a requestor or by downloading the traveler's  information.","In the present embodiment, the same risk taker  that provides the Core coverage  provides the upgrade benefits ; it is, however, within the scope of the invention for a risk-taker  that does not provide the Core coverage  to provide the upgrade benefits .","The upgrade  process can also be accomplished through the use of a paper-based or telephone-based system. The upgrade  can be done manually by the Core travel administrator  or program manager  or by a representative of the risk-taker  or broker . The individual traveler  contacts the travel company  or the program manager , administrator , and\/or risk taker  directly or indirectly to obtain the forms to fill out to select the upgraded coverages -desired. The traveler  then fills out the forms and mails, emails or faxes them to an address, an email address , or a fax number provided by the carrier ,  or the travel company , along with payment  in cash, check, money order, credit card or other means of payment. Requests can also be processed over the phone directly with the Core travel administrator  or program manager . While payment  is at this time made in US dollars, the currency used for payment is irrelevant to this invention and can be in any currency. Likewise, the language currently in use by the system is English, but it is within the scope of the invention to use any language that can be represented in writing.","Referring now to , the group sponsor  purchases a basic, or \u201cCore,\u201d coverage  that all persons  traveling with the group must carry.","Referring now to , the individual traveler  has the choice to upgrade  his or her insurance package or to carry only the \u201cCore\u201d coverage ;","Referring now to , the risk taker , the organization , or the Core program  manager  or administrator  relays the availability of the individual choice option to the individual travelers  and refers them to a website  designed for adding individual upgrades  to the \u201cCore\u201d insurance  purchased by the organization . The term \u201cadministrator\u201d  or \u201cprogram manager\u201d  may refer to service provided by the risk taker . The term \u201cwebsite\u201d  may refer to a social networking or e-commerce website . The website  is, in the current embodiment, provided by the program manager ; however, it is within the scope of the invention for the upgrade website  or other e-commerce means to be provided by the international travel organization  or broker . In that embodiment, the international travel organization  or broker  would collect the data regarding individual upgrades  and payment information  and forward that information ,  to the risk taker  or broker . In an alternate embodiment, the upgrade website  or other e-commerce means may be provided by the risk-taker .","Referring now to , those travelers  who choose to do so can make upgrade  purchases directly on the website  or through other e-commerce means and receive a confirmation  of upgrade  coverage from the website  or from the administrator  or program manager  or risk taker .","Referring now to , the premiums  for individual upgrades  are sent by the individual traveler  or, in an alternate embodiment, by the group sponsor organization , to the broker , program manager , or program administrator  for the travel group. If the premiums  are sent to the travel group sponsor , the travel group sponsor  forwards the premiums  to the broker  or program manager , who then sends the premiums  to the risk taker . It is also within the scope of the invention that the travel group sponsor  forwards the premiums  directly to the risk-taker , . Enrollment and upgrade information  is consolidated for the traveler  on the website's  database  or any data-collecting system that may be connected to the website , so that the information  is easily available to a medical assistance provider in the event of a medical need while the traveler  is overseas. The risk taker  and\/or claims administrator  can also find information about enrollments under Core  and upgraded benefits  on the website . In addition, the medical assistance provider is given specific information on the management and treatment of Core  travelers  that reflects their special needs as international educational or volunteering group  clients.","It is within the scope of the invention that an insurer  other than the Core coverage  risk taker  may provide individual upgrades . In this embodiment, the individual traveler  or the sponsoring organization  sends the premiums  for individual upgrade  to the broker  or program manager , who sends the premiums  to the insurer  providing the upgraded coverage . In an alternate embodiment, the individual  may send the upgrade information  directly to the risk-taker , eliminating the broker  or program manager  from the upgrade  process. The upgraded coverage  is reflected on the website  or other e-commerce means.","Referring now to , once the traveler  has upgraded  his or her Core coverage , the traveler  receives communication  from the system confirming and binding the coverage -. The communication  contains the name of the insured person , the coverages -extended, improved, or added, a contact telephone number  and email address , the name of the risk taker , the policy number , travel assistance information , and a limitations statement .","It is within the scope of the invention for the system or an employee or agent  of the risk taker  to confirm and bind coverage  using an email a, a SMS text message , a paper letter , a downloaded confirmation communication , or a fax to the traveler  who has upgraded  his or her Core overage . The communication  contains the name of insured person , the coverages -extended, improved, or added, a contact telephone number  and email address , the name of the risk taker , the policy number , travel assistance information , and a limitations statement .","Referring now to , participants can print individualized insurance Identification cards  from their organization's customized website . The Identification card  contains the relevant information about the participant  that reflects information pulled from the Core Travel database .","It is also within the scope of the invention for an individualized insurance Identification card  to be printed and distributed to the traveler  by the risk taker  or by the travel group .","It is within the scope of the invention that, rather than an email , the traveler is sent a hard-copy confirmation letter that binds the coverage. The traveler  receives a letter sent from the insurer that confirms and binds coverage. The letter contains the name of the insured person , the coverages -extended, improved, or added, a contact telephone number  and email address , the name of the risk taker , the policy number , travel assistance information , and a limitations statement .","It is a benefit of this invention that it could be licensed to insurance companies or brokers. This invention is particularly useful to organizations that have insured travelers originating from all around the world and traveling worldwide. Often these travelers do not pass through the United States and thus need access to an international venue for insurance purchase. These organizations are often at a loss to provide group travel insurance that fits the cultural, operational or personal demands of all their travelers. People going to Western countries often want higher medical expense limits, while people going to developing countries do not request this. People from certain parts of the world value higher death benefits. Some travelers require trip cancellation and baggage insurance, while others eschew it. Some travelers want to travel just before or after their official program and need to extend their coverage. Organizations can use Core travel insurance to cater to these different constituencies. It satisfies demand, keeps premium costs low, and lowers liability risk associated with buying group travel medical insurance that does not work as the traveler wishes.","It is a benefit of this invention that the Core insurance program is easy for travelers to use and carries no administrative burden for the organization purchasing the Core coverage. The introduction of the website or other e-commerce means as a medium for managing individual upgrades makes the product highly workable for the traveler, the travel organization, and the risk taker. Travel insurance upgrades are, in the present embodiment, accomplished through a website and the website's database. In an alternate embodiment, another e-commerce means may substitute for the website; examples include an FTP site, a USENET site, e-mail, and Web 2.0 functionality. The database may be a commercially available database product or a custom-designed database . It is populated through the use of an application wizard program associated with the website  or other e-commerce means. The application wizard incorporates questions that are asked of the traveler; the responses are put into a series of fields; the fields may comprise, but are not limited to:\n\n","In the present embodiment of the invention, the traveler must log in to the system to upgrade his or her coverages. However, it is within the scope of the invention that the traveler may be able to upgrade his or her insurance coverages merely with an identifier such as social security number, driver's license number, organization-issued identification number, or other unique identifier. There may also be electronic means by which traveler's information may be automatically downloaded to the carrier by groups or website using electronic systems such as API. The traveler may be required to enter a pair of identifiers, such as social security number and zip code for example; other identifier pairs are also within the scope of the invention. This identifier may or may not provide access to the traveler's complete profile, but the identifier does link to the profile such that additional coverage is assigned to that traveler when additional coverage is purchased.","It is also within the scope of the invention for the traveler to upgrade his or her insurance by communicating his or her wishes via letter, email, fax, or voice to an agent or employee of the risk-taker or travel company. In this case, the agent or employee inputs the traveler's information, accepts payment, and issues the upgrade or upgrades. The agent or employee then sends a communication using email, fax, downloadable written communication, or hard-copy (postal) delivery, or any combination, to the traveler confirming and binding the coverages. The communication contains the name of the insured person, the coverages extended, improved, or added, a contact telephone number and email address, the name of the risk taker, the policy number, travel assistance information, and a limitations statement.","The hierarchy for access to change information in the database is shown in Table 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0084"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Function","Access to Changing Information"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Database Administrator","Access and change every part"]},{"entry":[{},{},"of the database"]},{"entry":[{},"Travel Organization","Access to and changing permission"]},{"entry":[{},{},"for information related only to"]},{"entry":[{},{},"their own group"]},{"entry":[{},"Organizations supplying","Read-only access to the entire"]},{"entry":[{},"service to the insurance","database 165"]},{"entry":[{},"product"]},{"entry":[{},"Individual traveler","Access to and changing permission"]},{"entry":[{},{},"for only his or her own information"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"The system is fully automated, available fully to all users (including the risk taker, claim administrator, assistance company, Core travel e-commerce means administrator, and Core program manager) and can handle the insurance products as soon as the specifications are inserted for the upgrade products and the enrollments are downloaded onto the database.","The program can provide coverage for travelers going from the US to any country covered by the carrier's traveler's insurance; it can also provide coverage for travelers traveling from any non-US country to the US or any other country, depending on the limitations of the carrier's traveler's insurance. The program can also provide coverage for travelers whose itinerary does not include any stop in the United States, depending on the limitations of the risk taker's travel insurance.","A benefit of an upgrade package such as is described herein is that the individual traveler's upgrades are negotiated on group terms.","While a preferred embodiment is shown and described herein, it should be understood that the present disclosure is made by way of example only and that variations in the described method and its uses are possible within the scope of this disclosure without departing from the subject matter coming within the scope of claims to be examined, and a reasonable equivalency thereof, which I regard as my invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Referring now to , the workflow of the CORE process is shown as a flow diagram.
