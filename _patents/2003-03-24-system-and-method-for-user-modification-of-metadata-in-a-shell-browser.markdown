{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["None.","None.","The present invention relates generally to the field of computer software. More particularly, the invention relates to a system and method for providing an improved user experience within a shell or file system browser so that users can more readily identify an item based on the metadata associated with that item.","The need to readily identify items stored in a computing environment such as a personal computer (PC) is dramatically increasing as more individuals utilize computers in their daily routines and as the type of stored information varies between pictures, music, documents, etc. Documents and media are typically stored on computers in a hierarchical fashion and are organized with files of information or media stored within folders. File system browsers enable users to navigate through the file system and locate and open files and folders. For example, Microsoft Corporation's WINDOWS\u00ae EXPLORER\u2122 is an operating system utility which enables users to browse the file system.","Many users find it difficult to correctly identify a file based on the information currently available in conventional file system browsers. Of course the contents of a file can be verified by opening it with an application program, but this method of browsing files is extremely inefficient. The ability to view metadata about a file within a file system browser can greatly assist a user in identifying a particular file without having to open it. In Microsoft Corporation's WINDOWS\u00ae 9X operating systems, for example, a user can view object metadata by accessing the property sheet for a particular object. A property sheet presents the user with a list of the attributes or settings of an object in the form of a tabbed, index-card-like selection of property pages, each of which features standard dialog-style controls for customizing parameters. However, using the property sheet to locate an item can be slow and cumbersome, and some users find it difficult to locate the relevant metadata in a property sheet. Similarly, the use of infotips to locate an item can be slow and cumbersome because a user must hover the mouse over each file in order to view the limited metadata displayed in an infotip.","Conventional file system browsers do not allow users to enter and edit metadata relating to files and folders, which would significantly enhance a user's ability to later locate a file. To date, the ability of users to enter and edit metadata has been limited to special purpose software programs. For example, media players for electronic music files present users with the ability to edit metadata associated with music albums and artists. Another example of such programs includes application programs for electronic picture files. However, the utility of media players and other such programs is limited to the particular type of file supported by the program, as opposed to a general purpose file system browser which supports multiple file types.","Microsoft Corporation's WINDOWS\u00ae XP operating system includes an image browser for use in the My Pictures folder. The My Pictures folder is endowed with special features which enable users to view pictures as photos, not just as document icons. My Picture's image browsing features include the ability to view thumbnail-size and large versions of photos, rotate photos that are sideways, and create a slide show. A user can also view a photo's details, such as its dimensions, the date and time it was taken, and the name of the camera that took it. The preview control area in the My Picture's folder contains an enlarged preview image of a user-selected image, iterator buttons to assist a user in iterating through a series of pictures and controls for rotating pictures in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. While the image browsing features in WINDOWS\u00ae XP have advanced the state of the art by alleviating the need to invoke an application program to view and manipulate pictures, users still cannot enter and edit metadata associated with the pictures.","Accordingly, there is a need for an improved user experience within a shell or file system browser which enables users to readily locate an item based on the metadata associated with that item. There is also a need for a system and method which allow users to enter and edit metadata associated with items of various types within a shell browser without the need to invoke an application program.","The present invention meets the above needs and overcomes one or more deficiencies in the prior art by providing a system and method for user modification of metadata in a shell browser. In one aspect of the present invention, a shell browser is provided which includes a window and an edit control. The window displays a group of items and also displays metadata values associated with one or more of the displayed items. The edit control permits user modification of at least a portion of the metadata values displayed in the window.","Another aspect of the present invention is a graphical user interface embodied on a computer-readable medium and executable on a computer. The graphical user interface includes a first screen area which displays a set of items in a shell browser and a second screen area which displays metadata associated with one or more of the displayed items. The graphical user interface also presents the user with means within the shell browser for modifying the displayed metadata.","In a further aspect of the present invention, computer-implemented methods are provided for enabling a user to modify metadata within a shell browser. One such method includes displaying a plurality of items, receiving a first input from the user representing a selection of at least one displayed item, displaying metadata associated with the selected item(s) and providing an edit control for user modification of the displayed metadata. Another such method includes displaying a welcome pane and metadata associated with the welcome pane and providing an edit control for user modification of the displayed metadata.","Still another aspect of the present invention is a data structure containing metadata associated with one or more items displayed in a shell browser. The data structure, which is stored on one or more computer-readable media, includes a field containing user modifiable metadata associated with the one or more displayed items, and the user modifiable metadata contained in the data structure is also displayed in the shell browser.","The present invention relates to a system and method for providing an improved user experience within a shell browser so that users can more readily identify an item based on the metadata associated with that item. An exemplary operating environment for the present invention is described below.","Referring to the drawings in general and initially to  in particular, wherein like reference numerals identify like components in the various figures, an exemplary operating environment for implementing the present invention is shown and designated generally as operating environment . The computing system environment  is only one example of a suitable computing environment and is not intended to suggest any limitation as to the scope of use or functionality of the invention. Neither should the computing environment  be interpreted as having any dependency or requirement relating to any one or combination of components illustrated in the exemplary operating environment .","The invention may be described in the general context of computer-executable instructions, such as program modules, being executed by a computer. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, etc., that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Moreover, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention may be practiced with a variety of computer-system configurations, including hand-held devices, multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable-consumer electronics, minicomputers, mainframe computers, and the like. The invention may also be practiced in distributed-computing environments where tasks are performed by remote-processing devices that are linked through a communications network. In a distributed-computing environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote computer-storage media including memory storage devices.","With reference to , an exemplary system  for implementing the invention includes a general purpose computing device in the form of a computer  including a processing unit , a system memory , and a system bus  that couples various system components including the system memory  to the processing unit .","Computer  typically includes a variety of computer-readable media. By way of example, and not limitation, computer-readable media may comprise computer-storage media and communication media. Examples of computer-storage media include, but are not limited to, Random Access Memory (RAM); Read-Only Memory (ROM); Electronically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM); flash memory or other memory technology; CD-ROM, digital versatile discs (DVD) or other optical or holographic disc storage; magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices; or any other medium that can be used to store desired information and be accessed by computer . The system memory  includes computer-storage media in the form of volatile and\/or nonvolatile memory such as ROM  and RAM . A Basic Input\/Output System  (BIOS), containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within computer  (such as during start-up) is typically stored in ROM . RAM  typically contains data and\/or program modules that are immediately accessible to and\/or presently being operated on by processing unit . By way of example, and not limitation,  illustrates operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data .","The computer  may also include other removable\/nonremovable, volatile\/nonvolatile computer-storage media. By way of example only,  illustrates a hard disk drive  that reads from or writes to nonremovable, nonvolatile magnetic media, a magnetic disk drive  that reads from or writes to a removable, nonvolatile magnetic disk , and an optical disc drive  that reads from or writes to a removable, nonvolatile optical disc  such as a CD-ROM or other optical media. Other removable\/nonremovable, volatile\/nonvolatile computer-storage media that can be used in the exemplary operating environment include, but are not limited to, magnetic tape cassettes, flash memory units, digital versatile disks, digital video tape, solid state RAM, solid state ROM, and the like. The hard disk drive  is typically connected to the system bus  through a nonremovable memory interface such as interface . Magnetic disk drive  and optical disc drive  are typically connected to the system bus  by a removable memory interface, such as interface .","The drives and their associated computer-storage media discussed above and illustrated in  provide storage of computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules and other data for computer . For example, hard disk drive  is illustrated as storing operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data . Note that these components can either be the same as or different from operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data . Typically, the operating system, application programs and the like that are stored in RAM are portions of the corresponding systems, programs, or data read from hard disk drive , the portions varying in size and scope depending on the functions desired. Operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data  are given different numbers here to illustrate that, at a minimum, they can be different copies. A user may enter commands and information into the computer  through input devices such as a keyboard ; pointing device , commonly referred to as a mouse, trackball or touch pad; a wireless-input-reception component ; or a wireless source such as a remote control. Other input devices (not shown) may include a microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner, or the like. These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit  through a user-input interface  that is coupled to the system bus  but may be connected by other interface and bus structures, such as a parallel port, game port, IEEE 1394 port, or a universal serial bus (USB), or infrared (IR) bus.","A display device  is also connected to the system bus  via an interface, such as a video interface . Display device  can be any device to display the output of computer  not limited to a monitor, an LCD screen, a Thin Film Transistor (TFT) screen, a flat-panel display, a conventional television, or screen projector. In addition to the display device , computers may also include other peripheral output devices such as speakers  and printer , which may be connected through an output peripheral interface .","The computer  in the present invention will operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computer . The remote computer  may be a personal computer, and typically includes many or all of the elements described above relative to the computer , although only a memory storage device  has been illustrated in . The logical connections depicted in  include a local-area network (LAN)  and a wide-area network (WAN)  but may also include other networks, such as connections to a metropolitan-area network (MAN), intranet, or the Internet.","When used in a LAN networking environment, the computer  is connected to the LAN  through a network interface or adapter . When used in a WAN networking environment, the computer  typically includes a modem  or other means for establishing communications over the WAN , such as the Internet. The modem , which may be internal or external, may be connected to the system bus  via the network interface , or other appropriate mechanism. Modem  could be a cable modem, DSL modem, or other broadband device. In a networked environment, program modules depicted relative to the computer , or portions thereof, may be stored in the remote memory storage device. By way of example, and not limitation,  illustrates remote application programs  as residing on memory device . It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers may be used.","Although many other internal components of the computer  are not shown, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that such components and the interconnections are well-known. For example, including various expansion cards such as television-tuner cards and network-interface cards within a computer  is conventional. Accordingly, additional details concerning the internal construction of the computer  need not be disclosed in connection with the present invention.","When the computer  is turned on or reset, the BIOS , which is stored in ROM , instructs the processing unit  to load the operating system, or necessary portion thereof, from the hard disk drive  into the RAM . Once the copied portion of the operating system, designated as operating system , is loaded into RAM , the processing unit  executes the operating-system code and causes the visual elements associated with the user interface of the operating system  to be displayed on the display device . Typically, when an application program  is opened by a user, the program code and relevant data are read from the hard disk drive  and the necessary portions are copied into RAM , the copied portion represented herein by reference numeral .","As previously mentioned, the present invention may be described in the general context of computer-useable instructions. Computer-useable instructions include functions, procedures, schemas, routines, code segments, and modules useable by one or more computers or other devices. The computer-useable instructions form an interface to allow a computer to react according to a source of input. The instructions cooperate with other code segments to initiate a variety of tasks in response to data received in conjunction with the source of the received data.","Turning to , a window  represents a screen-size display area for a graphical user interface of a shell browser. The window  contains a preview pane area  and a view area . The preview pane  may include a preview control , a user interface (UI) or edit control , and a task control . Typically, the preview control  will provide the user with an image or other visual display of the item being previewed (e.g., a selected file). The preview control  may also present the user with controls such as iterator buttons which allow the user to shift the focus from one item to the next by clicking a mouse button. Metadata corresponding to one or more items and\/or metadata corresponding to the item container may be displayed in a variety of locations within the window . For example, the edit control and metadata may be co-located within edit control area  so that the edit control area not only includes a display of key properties of the previewed item but also presents the user with the option of making edits to the metadata. The task control  contains tasks relevant to the namespace and\/or the selection.","For purposes of the present invention, the terms \u201cmetadata\u201d and \u201cuser modifiable metadata\u201d exclude the shell item name. The term \u201cshell item name\u201d refers to the property which is used for purposes of sorting and displaying the item within the shell browser. As mentioned above, one unique aspect of the present invention is the ability of a user to edit metadata within a shell browser.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention contemplates the presence of optional features within the window . For example, the preview control  and the task control  are not essential features for purposes of the present invention. Moreover, other non-essential features which are not shown in , such as a toolbar which includes iterator buttons or a show\/hide button so the user can open\/close the preview pane, are also within the scope of the present invention. Nevertheless, these and other optional features may assist the user in readily locating a particular item in the shell browser.","The view area  provides a listview of one or more items , such as file system files or folders. The term \u201clistview\u201d refers to an enumeration or list of items within a container. The terms \u201citem\u201d and \u201cshell item\u201d are used interchangeably herein to refer to files, folders and other such containers, and other non-file objects which can be represented in a listview. Examples of non-file objects may include, but would not be limited to, contacts, favorites and email messages. The terms \u201cshell browser\u201d and \u201cfile system browser\u201d are used interchangeably herein to refer to a browser which allows a user to navigate through various namespaces including files and other non-file items.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention contemplates many possible designs and layouts for the window . For example, the preview pane  is shown above the view area  in . However, other layouts, such as placing the preview pane  and the view area  side-by-side, are clearly within the scope of the present invention. The location of the edit control  is also independent of the location of the displayed metadata and independent of the location of any other controls. There are also many possible view types for the items depicted in listview area , such as details, slide show, filmstrip, thumbnail, tiles, icons, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A"],"b":["204","214","212","212","214","216","218","208","200","202","214","214","218"]},"Referring next to , a schematic illustration is provided of a welcome pane  in a shell browser. A welcome pane is sometimes referred to as a \u201cnull select\u201d pane because it represents a namespace or container as opposed to a selection. If the user has not yet made a selection, a preview pane  displays metadata  and key tasks relating to the folder or shell library. If desired, the tasks may be separated into premiered tasks  and other relevant tasks . The welcome pane  also includes a view area , in which multiple files or other items  may be viewed. The welcome pane metadata  may include information such as properties of the container (e.g., MyPictures), in which case the metadata display may be static. Alternatively, the welcome pane metadata  may include information such as a sampling of metadata from each of the items within the container, in which case the metadata display may change frequently. For example, the metadata display may be limited to properties of one item at a time by cycling from one item to the next every 30 seconds.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 3","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","400","402","404","406","408","300","400","410","412","404","406","408"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4","FIG. 5"],"b":["500","500","500","500"]},"Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention contemplates means other than context menus for enabling user modifications to displayed metadata within a shell browser. Another such means for is for the user to click on the metadata to enter an editing mode. By contrast, a user could enter an editing mode by hovering over the relevant text or object in the preview pane.

Alternatively, the displayed metadata may include a rotating sample of metadata from each of the selected items (e.g., cycling from one selected item's metadata to the next selected item's metadata every 30 seconds). It is possible for the display of metadata which would result from a selection of all of the items to be identical to the display of metadata which would result from a null select.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","800","802","802","800","804","800","806","804","806","800","808","808","804","806","800"]},"The present invention enables a number of scenarios which were not possible with conventional shell browsers. As a first example, a student can manage her projects using the preview pane. When she obtains new documents as part of a project she is working on, she can select those documents in her document library and enter the name of the document author and the name of the project into keyword fields using the edit control. Now the new documents will show up in her favorite view: \u201cDocuments Grouped by Keyword and Listed by Author.\u201d A second example of a new scenario enabled by the present invention involves an employee looking for materials for an upcoming ad campaign. As he browses through his employer's stock collection of photos using the shell browser, he selects a couple of pictures and, from the preview pane, adds a new keyword \u201cSummer 2003 Campaign.\u201d Having updated the metadata for a multiple selection, the employee then pivots by keyword and can view all of the \u201cSummer 2003 Campaign\u201d files grouped together. Many other scenarios which take advantage of the present invention would be apparent to those skilled in the art.","Alternative embodiments and implementations of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art to which it pertains upon review of the specification, including the drawing figures.
