{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This invention relates generally to products and services, more particularly, to systems and methods for cloud computing related services and products.","The advent of cloud-based computing architectures has opened new possibilities for the rapid and scalable deployment of virtual Web stores, media outlets, and other on-line sites or services. In general, a cloud-based architecture deploys computing resources such as processors, operating systems, software and other components that can be combined or strung together in an abstract structure or \u201ccloud network\u201d to form and support virtual machines. A user or customer can request the instantiation of a virtual machine or set of virtual machines from those resources from a central server or management system to perform intended tasks or applications. For example, a user may wish to set-up and instantiate a virtual server from the cloud network to create a storefront to market products or services on a temporary basis, for instance, to sell tickets to an upcoming sports or musical performance. The user can lease or subscribe to the computing resources needed to build and run the virtual machines on a comparatively short-term basis, such as hours or days, for their intended application. Likewise, a user can utilize a cloud-based architecture to form a cloud network on existing computing resources owned by the user.","Often data stored in a cloud network is not fixed. As cloud resources because available or as a user adds new data to the cloud network, the location of data stored in the cloud network may change. Likewise, because the cloud network may be supported by geographically diverse computing resources, data may be stored in one jurisdiction, e.g. country, on a given day and stored in a different jurisdiction on a different day. The transient nature of data in a cloud network, and the diverse locations of computing resources supporting the cloud network present issues for data storage and data migration. Depending on the jurisdiction, the data may be subject to rules and laws governing the data storage, security, and access controls. For example, patient medical data stored in the United States is subject the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which governs how the patient medical data must be stored and accessed. Further, as data is moved in and out of different jurisdictions, the data may be subject to the import and export rules and laws of the jurisdictions. For example, software that might contain encryption technology or national security material is subject to United States export and import laws. Accordingly, cloud providers and users are presented with possible violations of jurisdictional rules and laws and subject to sanction of fines due to the storage and migration of data in cloud networks.","For simplicity and illustrative purposes, the principles of the present teachings are described by referring mainly to exemplary embodiments thereof. However, one of ordinary skill in the art would readily recognize that the same principles are equally applicable to, and can be implemented in, all types of information and systems, and that any such variations do not depart from the true spirit and scope of the present teachings. Moreover, in the following detailed description, references are made to the accompanying figures, which illustrate specific embodiments. Electrical, mechanical, logical and structural changes may be made to the embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the present teachings. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the present teachings is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.","Embodiments of the present teachings relate to systems and methods for automatically verifying compliance with jurisdictional transfer and storage requirements for data transfer and storage in a cloud computing environment. According to embodiments, a compliance tool can verify compliance with jurisdictional transfer and storage requirements for data migration into or within a cloud. The compliance tool can monitor and check data transfers and storage to determine if the data transfer and\/or storage will cross jurisdictional boundaries. If the transfers or storage crosses jurisdictional boundaries, the compliance tool can identify the transfer and storage requirements of any jurisdictions involved with the transfer and\/or storage. The compliance tool can verify that the data transfers complies with the identified transfer and storage requirements. If the data transfer and\/or storage does not comply with the identified transfer and storage requirements, the compliance tool can terminate the data transfer and\/or storage, modify the data transfer and\/or storage, and\/or modify the data, itself, to comply with the identified transfer and storage requirements.","By automatically verifying compliance of data migrations with jurisdictional transfer and storage requirements, cloud providers and cloud users can freely move data without the worry of violating jurisdictional rules and laws. Accordingly, the data compliance tool allows the cloud providers and cloud users flexibility in data storage and migration without the added effort of personally checking the compliance of every data migration.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","102","108","108","108","108"]},"In embodiments, the entire set of the resource servers  or other hardware or software resources used to support the cloud  along with its instantiated virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes can be managed by a cloud management system . The cloud management system  can comprise a dedicated or centralized server and\/or other software, hardware, and network tools that communicate via one or more networks  such as the Internet or other public or private network with all of the resource servers  to manage the cloud  and its operation. To instantiate a new virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes, a user can transmit an instantiation request to the cloud management system  for the particular type of virtual machine, software appliance, or other process they wish to invoke for their intended application. A user can for instance make a request to instantiate a set of virtual machines configured for email, messaging or other applications from the cloud . The request can be received and processed by the cloud management system , which identifies the type of virtual machine, software appliance, or other process being requested. The cloud management system  can then identify the collection of resources necessary to instantiate that virtual machine, software appliance, or other process. In embodiments, the instantiated virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes can, for example, comprise virtual transaction servers used to support Web storefronts, or other transaction sites.","In embodiments, the user's instantiation request can specify a variety of parameters defining the operation of the virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes to be invoked. The instantiation request, for example, can specify a defined period of time for which the instantiated virtual machine, software appliance, or other process is needed. The period of time can be, for example, an hour, a day, or other increment of time. In embodiments, the user's instantiation request can specify the instantiation of the virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes on a task basis, rather than for a predetermined amount of time. For instance, a user could request resources until a software update is completed. The user's instantiation request can specify other parameters that define the configuration and operation of the virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes. For example, the request can specify an amount of processing power or input\/output (I\/O) throughput the user wishes to be available to each instance of the virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes. In embodiments, the requesting user can for instance specify a service level agreement (SLA) acceptable for the virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes. Other parameters and settings can be used. One skilled in the art will realize that the user's request can likewise include combinations of the foregoing exemplary parameters, and others.","When the request to instantiate a virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes has been received and the necessary resources to build the virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes have been identified, the cloud management system  can communicate with one or more the resource servers  to locate resources to supply the virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes. The cloud management system  can select resources from any of the resource servers  to assemble the resources needed to build the requested virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes. It may be noted that in some embodiments, permanent storage such as hard disk arrays may not be included or located within the resource servers  available to the cloud management system , because the virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes may be intended to operate on a purely transient or temporary basis. In embodiments, other hardware resources, software resources, or other resources not strictly located or hosted in the cloud can be leveraged as needed. For example, other software services that are provided outside of the cloud  and hosted by third parties can be invoked by in-cloud virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes. For further example, other non-cloud hardware and\/or storage services can be utilized as an extension to the cloud , either on-demand, subscribed, or decided basis.","With the resource requirements identified, the cloud management system  can extract and build the virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes on a dynamic or on-demand basis. For example, a group of the resource servers  can respond to an instantiation request for a given quantity of processor cycles with an offer to deliver that computational power immediately and guaranteed for the next hour. A further group of the resource servers  can offer to immediately supply communication bandwidth, for example on a guaranteed minimum or best-efforts basis. In other embodiments, the virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes can be built on a batch basis or at a particular future time. For example, a group of the resource servers  can respond to a request for instantiation at a programmed time with an offer to deliver the specified quantity of processor cycles within a specific amount of time, such as the next 12 hours.","The cloud management system  can select a group of the resource servers  that match or best match the instantiation request for resources needed to build the virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes. The cloud management system  can then coordinate the integration of the group of the resource servers , to build and launch the requested virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes. The cloud management system  can track the integrated group of the resource servers , or other distributed resources that are dynamically or temporarily combined, to produce and manage the requested virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes.","In embodiments, the cloud management system  can generate a resource aggregation table that identifies the group of the resource servers  that will be used to supply the resources for the virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes. The resource servers  can be identified by unique identifiers such as, for instance, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or other addresses. The cloud management system  can register the group of the resource servers  contributing to the virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes.","The cloud management system  can then set up and launch the initiation process for the virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes to be delivered from the cloud . The cloud management system  can for instance transmit an instantiation command or instruction to the group of the resource servers  providing resources to the virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes. The cloud management system  can receive a confirmation message back from each server in the group of the resource servers  indicating a status regarding the provisioning of their respective resources. Each of the resource servers  can confirm, for example, the availability of a dedicated amount of processor cycles, amounts of electronic memory, communications bandwidth, or applications or other software prepared to be served.","As shown for example in , the cloud management system  can then instantiate one or more than one set of virtual machines , software appliances (not shown), or other processes (not shown) on the resources supplied by the group of the resource servers . In embodiments, the cloud management system  can instantiate a given number, for example, 10, 500, 1000, or other number of virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes to be made available to users on a network , such as the Internet or other public or private network. Each virtual machine, software appliance, or other process can be assigned an instantiated machine ID that can be stored in the resource aggregation table, or other record or image of the instantiated virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes. Additionally, the cloud management system  can store the duration of each virtual machine, software appliance, or other process, and the collection of resources utilized by the complete set of virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes, for example as illustrated, the instantiated virtual machines .","In embodiments, the cloud management system  can further store, track and manage a user's identity and associated set of rights or entitlements to software, hardware, and other resources provided by the cloud . Each user that populates virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes in the cloud  can have specific rights and resources assigned and made available to them. The cloud management system  can track and configure specific actions that a user can perform, such as provision virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes with resources, configure virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes to desired specifications, submit jobs to virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes, manage other users of virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes, and other privileges or actions. The cloud management system  can further generate records of the usage of virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes, for example virtual machines , to permit tracking, billing, and auditing of the resources consumed by the user. In embodiments, the cloud management system  can, for example, meter the usage and\/or duration of the instantiated virtual machines , to generate subscription billing records for a user that has requested resources for those machines. Other billing or value arrangements are possible.","The cloud management system  can configure each virtual machine, software appliance, or other process to be made available to users of the one or more networks  via a browser interface, or other interface or mechanism. Each virtual machine, software appliance, or other process can communicate with the cloud management system  and the resource servers  supporting virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes via a standard Web application programming interface (API), or via other calls or interfaces. The virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes, for example instantiated virtual machines , can likewise communicate with each other, as well as other sites, servers, locations, and resources available via the Internet or other public or private networks, whether within a given cloud  or between clouds.","It may be noted that while a browser interface or other front-end can be used to view and operate virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes, for example the virtual machines , from a client or terminal, the browser interface or other front-end required to view the virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes can be hosted remotely in the cloud . In embodiments, the virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes, for example, the virtual machines  or other resources may not depend on or require the user's own on-premise hardware or other resources. In embodiments, a user can therefore request and instantiate virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes on a purely off-premise basis, for instance to build and launch a virtual storefront or other application.","Because the cloud management system  in one regard specifies, builds, operates and manages the virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes, for example, the virtual machines  on a logical level, the user can request and instantiate virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes on a real-time or near real-time basis, without a need to specify or install any particular hardware. The user's virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes, such as the instantiated virtual machines , can be scaled up or down immediately or virtually immediately on an on-demand basis, if desired. In embodiments, the resource server  that are accessed by the cloud management system  to support the virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes can change or be substituted, over time. The type and operating characteristics of the virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes, for example the instantiated virtual machines , can nevertheless remain constant or virtually constant, since instances are assembled from abstracted resources that can be selected and maintained from diverse sources based on uniform specifications.","In terms of network management of the virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes, such as the instantiated virtual machines  that have been successfully configured and instantiated, the cloud management system  can perform various network management tasks including security, maintenance, and metering for billing or subscription purposes. The cloud management system  of a given cloud  can, for example, install or terminate the software and hardware resources on individual resource servers  or the virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes, themselves. The cloud management system  can monitor the virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes to detect any virus or other rogue process on individual virtual machine, software appliance, or other process, and for instance terminate the infected virtual machine, software appliance, or other process. The cloud management system  can likewise manage the virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes, for example, the instantiated virtual machines  on a collective basis, for instance, to push or deliver a software upgrade to all virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes. Other management processes are possible.","In embodiments, more than one set of virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes can be instantiated in a given cloud at the same, overlapping or successive times. The cloud management system  can, in such implementations, build, launch and manage multiple sets of virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes based on the same or different underlying resource servers , such as may be requested by different users. The cloud management system  can institute and enforce security protocols in a cloud  hosting multiple sets of virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes. Each of the individual sets of virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes can be hosted in a respective partition or sub-cloud of the resources of the cloud . The cloud management system  of the cloud  can for example deploy services specific to isolated or defined sub-clouds, or isolate individual virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes within the cloud to a specific sub-cloud. The subdivision of the cloud  into distinct transient sub-clouds or other sub-components which have assured security and isolation features can assist in establishing a multiple user or multi-tenant cloud arrangement. In a multiple user scenario, each of the multiple users can use the cloud  as a common utility while retaining the assurance that their information is secure from other users of the cloud . In further embodiments, the sub-clouds can nevertheless be configured to share resources, if desired.","In embodiments, the virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes generated in the cloud  can also interact with the virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes generated in a second cloud . For example, as illustrated in , the instantiated virtual machines  can also interact with virtual machines  of the cloud . The cloud management system  of the cloud  can interface with the cloud management system  of the cloud , to coordinate those domains and operate the clouds and\/or can also interact with on a combined basis. The cloud management system  of the cloud  can track and manage virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes instantiated in the cloud , as well as virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes in the cloud . Additionally, when instantiate the virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes, a portion of the virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes can be instantiated in the cloud  and a portion of the virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes can be instantiated in the cloud .","In the foregoing and other embodiments, the cloud  can offer software programs of different vendors for use by the subscribers and customers of the cloud . For example, the subscriber and customers can buy, lease, or utilize, under a software as a service model (SaaS), the software programs. The software programs can include any type of software such as operating systems, such as a distribution of Linux provided by Red Hat\u2122 Corporation, and various software programs requested or typically desired by subscribers, such as middleware applications, web hosting applications, electronic mail (email) applications, and the like. The software programs can include software programs provided by different vendors, for example Red Hat\u2122 Corporation, Oracle\u00ae, and the like. The software programs can include any type of product and\/or service provided by a vendor in the cloud . For example, the software programs can include operating systems and\/or updates to these, application programs and\/or updates to these, software appliances and\/or updates to these, and any combinations of operating systems, application programs and\/or software appliances. The software programs can also include services provided by the vendor, for example, application services, data storage, identity management, security, communications, technical support, and\/or other services. The vendors can offer the software programs in the cloud  under a variety of different schemes, such as offer for purchase, offer for lease, and\/or offer for \u201con-demand\u201d use under a subscription, for example, a Software as a Service (SaaS) model.","In the foregoing and other embodiments, the user making an instantiation request or otherwise accessing or utilizing the cloud  or  can be a person, customer, subscriber, administrator, corporation, organization, or other entity. In embodiments, the user can be or include another virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes. In further embodiments, multiple users or entities can share the use of virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes. Additionally, while the above description reference an off-premise or \u201cpublic\u201d cloud, the cloud computing environment illustrated in  can be created and supported by computing resources owned and\/or operated by the user in order to form a on-premise, local, or \u201cprivate\u201d cloud.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["100","102","300","302","102","102","100"]},"The cloud computing environment  can include the cloud . The cloud  can include the hardware and software resources to support virtual machines, software appliances, or other processes, as described above, including the cloud management system . The cloud  can be any type of cloud that is controlled by any type of entity. For example, the cloud  can be an off-premise or \u201cpublic\u201d cloud that is owned and\/or operated by a public cloud vendor, such as Amazon\u2122, Inc., in order to provide the services of the cloud to subscribers and customers. Likewise, the cloud  can be created and supported by computing resources owned and\/or operated by an entity and\/or user in order to form a on-premise, local, or \u201cprivate\u201d cloud.","As illustrated in , the cloud  can include storage resources  and storage resources , which can be physically located in different jurisdictions. The storage resources  can be located in jurisdiction , and the storage resources  can be located in jurisdiction . As described herein, a jurisdiction can include any type of geographic and\/or political division or sub-division, such as a city, county, state, country, and the like. For example, the jurisdiction  and the jurisdiction  can be different countries such as the United States and Canada or political divisions such as the European Union or countries covered by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).","In embodiments, the one or more computing systems  can represent the computing systems owned and\/or operated by an entity such as a user, a corporation, a company, a university, a governmental agency, and the like. The one or more computing systems  can include any type of conventional computing system, such as a desktop, laptop, server, thin-client, tablet computer, mobile phone, personal digital assistant, mainframe, etc., that are connected by wired or wireless networks. The one or more computing systems  can include a number of hardware resources, such as processors, memory, network hardware and bandwidth, storage devices, etc. and a number of software resources, such as operating systems, application programs, software appliances, virtual machines, etc. Additionally, the one or more computing systems  can be coupled to the cloud  by one or more communications networks . The one or more communications networks  can be or include the Internet, or other public or private networks. The one or more communications networks  can be or include wired, wireless, optical, and other network connections. One skilled in the art will realize that the one or more communications networks  can be any type of network, utilizing any type of communication protocol, to connect the cloud  and the one or more computing systems .","In embodiments, an entity that owns and\/or operates the one or more computing systems  can desire to migrate data  to the cloud . The data  can include any type of data that can be supported by the cloud . For example, the data  can include operating systems, software application, software appliance, virtual machine, computing processes, and the like, that are supported by the one or more computing systems  that are being migrated to the cloud . Likewise, the data  can include any other information and data utilized by the operating systems, software application, software appliance, virtual machine, computing processes, and the like to perform their functions. For example, the data  can include files, databases, records, metadata, etc. utilized by the operating systems, software application, software appliance, virtual machine, computing processes, and the like to perform their functions.","In embodiments, the data , being transferred to and stored in the cloud , can cross jurisdictional boundaries. For example, based on availability in the cloud , the data  can be transferred and stored in the storage resources , which are located in jurisdiction . By crossing the jurisdictional boundary, the data  can be subject to rules, regulations, agency or administrative requirements, laws, treaties, etc. of the jurisdiction , jurisdiction , or both regarding the transfer and\/or storage of the data  (hereinafter \u201crequirements\u201d).","For the transfer of data  across jurisdictional boundaries, the jurisdiction , from which the transfer originates, can have requirements that govern the transfer of the data  outside its boundaries. The requirements of the jurisdiction  can be based on the jurisdiction, e.g. jurisdiction , to which the data  is being transferred. For instance, if the jurisdiction  is the United States, the United States can have requirements that prohibit the transfer of data to certain other countries that are under an embargo, sponsor terrorism, and the like. The requirements of the jurisdiction  can also be based on types of the data  which are based on the attributes of the data  such as subject matter, content, format, etc. For instance, if the jurisdiction  is the United States, the United States can have requirements that prohibit certain data, e.g. data relating to encryption or national security, to certain other countries that are unfriendly to the United States, sponsor terrorism, and the like.","Additionally, for the transfer of data across jurisdictional boundaries, the jurisdiction , which is receiving the data , can have requirements that govern the transfer of the data  into its boundaries. The requirements of the jurisdiction  can be based on the jurisdiction, e.g. jurisdiction , from which the data  originates. For instance, if the jurisdiction  is the United States, the United States can have requirements that prohibit the transfer of data, into its borders, that originate in other countries that are under an embargo, sponsor terrorism, and the like. The requirements of the jurisdiction  can also be based on a type of the data  that is being transferred into its borders. For instance, if the jurisdiction  is the United States, the United States can have requirements that prohibit certain data, e.g. money transfers, data relating to encryption or national security, from entering its borders from other countries that are unfriendly to the United States, sponsor terrorism, and the like.","Additionally, the storage of data in a different jurisdiction than its originates can be subject to requirements of the originating jurisdiction, e.g. the jurisdiction , and\/or the jurisdiction where the data will be stored, e.g. jurisdiction . The requirements of either the jurisdiction  or the jurisdiction  or both can be based on the jurisdiction from which the data  originates, the jurisdiction where the data  will be stored, or both. Likewise, the requirements of either the jurisdiction  or the jurisdiction  or both can be based on the a type of the data being stored. For example, if the jurisdiction  is the United States and the data  is patient medical records, the United States has requirements under HIPAA that govern the storage of patient medical records, such as particular security requirements for storing the data , access control requirements, and data backup requirements, but the jurisdiction , for example, Canada, may not have the same requirements. If the storage resources  located in jurisdiction , do not meet the requirements of the jurisdiction , e.g. United States, the storage of the data  in the storage resources  can violate the requirements of the jurisdiction .","When the data  is transferred from the jurisdiction  to the jurisdiction  and\/or stored in the jurisdiction  violates the requirements of the jurisdiction  or the jurisdiction  or both, the entity associated with the data , the operator of the cloud , or both can be subject to penalties and sanctions by the jurisdiction  or the jurisdiction  or both. As such, it is necessary to verify that the transfer from the jurisdiction  to the jurisdiction  and\/or storage in the jurisdiction  does not violate the requirements of the jurisdiction  or the jurisdiction  or both.","In embodiments, the compliance tool  can be configured to verify that the transfer from the jurisdiction  to the jurisdiction  and\/or storage in the jurisdiction  does not violate the requirements of the jurisdiction  or the jurisdiction  or both. To verify compliance, the compliance tool  can be configured to check each data transfer in the cloud  to determine if the data transfer crosses jurisdictional boundaries. If the data transfer crosses jurisdictional boundaries, e.g. transfer of the data  from jurisdiction  to jurisdiction , the compliance tool  can be configured to verify that the transfer complies with the requirements of the jurisdiction  or the jurisdiction  or both. Likewise, if the data is being stored in a jurisdiction other than the jurisdiction it originates, e.g. the storage of the data  in the storage resources  located in the jurisdiction , the compliance tool  can be configured to verify that the storage of the data  complies with the requirements of the jurisdiction  or the jurisdiction  or both.","The compliance tool  can be implemented as a software program that is configured to perform the verification as described herein. Likewise, the compliance tool tool  can be implemented as a portion of other software programs, such as the cloud management system . In either case, the compliance tool  can be configured to include the necessary logic, commands, instructions, and protocols to perform the processes described herein. In any implementation, the compliance tool  can be written in any type of conventional programming language such as C, C++, JAVA, Pert, and the like. While  illustrates the compliance tool  being executed in the cloud , the compliance tool  can be executed on any computing system in the cloud computing environment . For example, the compliance tool  can be executed on the one or more computing system .","In embodiments, to verify the compliance, the compliance tool  can be configured to identify any data, for example, the data , being transferred into the cloud . The compliance tool  can be configured to identify transfer, prior to or simultaneously with, the transfer of the data . For example, the compliance tool  can be configured to receive a notification, from the cloud management system , of the data  being transferred into the cloud . To achieve this, the compliance tool  can be configured to include the necessary logic, commands, instructions, and protocols to communicate with the cloud management system . Likewise, the compliance tool  can be configured to receive the notification from other entities or systems such as the computing systems  and\/or the entity and\/or users associated with the computing systems . To achieve this, the compliance tool  can be configured to include the necessary logic, commands, instructions, and protocols to communicate with the computing systems , the entity and\/or users via command line interfaces, graphical user interfaces (GUIs), and\/or other communications channels such as email.","Additionally, to identify a data transfer, the compliance tool  can be configured to monitor for any data transfers into the cloud , for example, the transfer of the data . To achieve this, the compliance tool  can be configured to include the necessary logic, commands, instructions, and protocols to monitor, listen, and\/or detect events, such as a request for a data transfer or a data transfer, occurring in the hardware and software resources of the cloud  and\/or the cloud management system  to identify a data transfer and\/or storage.","Once the compliance tool  has identified a data transfer, the compliance tool  can be configured to determine if the data transfer will cross jurisdictional boundaries and\/or will be stored in a different jurisdiction than the data originated, for example, the transfer and storage of the data . To determine this, the compliance tool  can be configured to identify an originating jurisdiction, e.g. the jurisdiction , and a destination and\/or storage jurisdiction, e.g. the jurisdiction . For example, the compliance tool  can be configured to identify the jurisdictions involved in the transfer by communicating with the cloud management system  and\/or other entities or computing systems in the cloud computing environment . Likewise, the compliance tool  can be configured to examine the request for the transfer and\/or storage of the data  and\/or examine the data , itself, being transferred and\/or stored. For example, the compliance tool  can be configured to identify that the data  is being transferred from jurisdiction  to jurisdiction  and that the data  is being stored in the storage resources  of the cloud , which are located in the jurisdiction . For instance, the compliance tool  can be configured to identify the network addresses of the computing systems , from which the data  originates, and the network addresses of the storage resources  and translate the network addresses into geographic locations.","Once the compliance tool  determines that the data  is being transferred and\/or stored in different jurisdictions, the compliance tool  can be configured to determine if the transfer and\/or storage of the data  complies with the requirements of any jurisdictions involved in the transfer and\/or storage of the data , e.g. the jurisdiction  and the jurisdiction . To achieve this, the compliance tool  can be configured to maintain a record  of the requirements of any jurisdictions that can be involved in a transfer and\/or storage of data. The record  can be any type of searchable data record system (e.g. database) that is capable of storing information about the data transfer and\/or data storage requirements of any jurisdictions that can be involved in a transfer and\/or storage of data. For example, the record  can store information describing the data transfer and\/or data storage requirements of the jurisdiction  and the jurisdiction .

Exemplary computer readable storage devices and media include conventional computer system RAM (random access memory), ROM (read-only memory), EPROM (erasable, programmable ROM), EEPROM (electrically erasable, programmable ROM), and magnetic or optical disks or tapes. Exemplary computer readable signals, whether modulated using a carrier or not, are signals that a computer system hosting or running the present teachings can be configured to access, including signals downloaded through the Internet or other networks. Concrete examples of the foregoing include distribution of executable software application program(s) on a CD-ROM or via Internet download. In a sense, the Internet itself, as an abstract entity, is a computer readable medium. The same is true of computer networks in general.","While the aspects have been described with reference to the exemplary embodiments thereof, those skilled in the art will be able to make various modifications to the described embodiments without departing from the true spirit and scope.
