title: Zero fixed placement ads
abstract: Techniques for zero fixed placement (ZFP) ads are described. ZFP ads may be triggered independently of a fixed placement for the ad in a user interface. In an implementation, data describing a user interface includes a trigger associated with a ZFP ad. The ZFP ad may be configured to set various modifiable attributes of the user interface. Setting the modifiable attributes of the page enables a ZFP to modify both the appearance and layout of elements and modules included in the user interface. A client may load the data having the trigger and render the user interface without presenting the associated ZFP ad or including a placeholder for the ZFP ad. When the trigger is detected, the client executes the associated ZFP ad, modifies attributes of the user interface in accordance with the ZFP ad, and outputs the modified user interface to present the ZFP ad.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","CONCLUSION"],"p":["The use of the Internet and World Wide Web (or simply the Web) is ever increasing. Web-enabled applications may make use of webpages and other user interfaces that are retrieved from servers and displayed on a user's computer to integrate web resources (e.g., content and services) within applications of the computer.","In some situations, a provider that makes web resources available to users generates revenue by reserving fixed placeholders for advertisements (ads) in the layout of user interfaces for the resources and selling the reserved space to companies or individuals. This allows an advertiser to display advertisements to users when they are displaying or interacting with various resources, such as when navigating to webpages using a browser. These advertisements, however, can result in awkward appearing webpages because the appearance of the advertisements may be inconsistent with the appearance of the remainder of the webpage. Further, reserving fixed placeholders for ads in a user interface limits flexibility and consumes space that might otherwise be used for additional content.","Techniques for zero fixed placement (ZFP) ads are described. ZFP ads may be triggered independently of a fixed placement for the ad in a user interface. In an implementation, data describing a user interface includes a trigger associated with a ZFP ad. The ZFP ad may be configured to set various modifiable attributes of the user interface. Setting the modifiable attributes of the page enables a ZFP to modify both the appearance and layout of elements and modules included in the user interface. A client may load the data having the trigger and render the user interface without presenting the associated ZFP ad, or including a placeholder for the ZFP ad. When the trigger is detected, the client executes the associated ZFP ad, modifies attributes of the user interface in accordance with the ZFP ad, and outputs the modified user interface to present the ZFP ad.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Overview","Traditional techniques for placing ads in user interfaces associated with web resources involves using ad placeholders fixed within a layout for the user interface. Different ads may then be obtained from ad sources and presented using the placeholders. Since the placeholders are fixed, flexibility to customize the user interface is limited. Moreover, appearance of the user interface and the ads may not be coordinated, which can result in awkward differences in appearance.","Techniques for zero fixed placement (ZFP) ads are described. ZFP ads may be triggered independently of a fixed placement for the ad in a user interface. Moreover, ZFP ads may incorporate code that enables interactions with an ad interface of a client to create modifications of the user interface. The modifications may include altering the layout of elements and modules included in the user interface. Further, the modifications may enable a variety of customized functionality (e.g., interactive features) to be added to a user interface. Advertisers may make use of modifications that are available via the ad interface to coordinate their ads with a user interface in which the ads appear and produce rich ad presentations that include a variety of content types, styles, layouts, sizes, colors, interactive features, and so forth","For instance, a webpage definition may be configured to include a script to define a trigger and associate an ad with the trigger. The trigger may be implemented as an invisible element or ad of the webpage. This may include a hidden ad that is embedded with the script associated with the webpage, a transparent ad such as a single pixel image, or an ad that matches the color of the background of the webpage. When the webpage is loaded by a browser, the trigger may be initiated to enable the associated ad. The ad may be configured to define various modifiable attributes to coordinate the look and feel between the webpage and the ad. When the browser detects occurrence of the trigger, the browser may cause execution of the ad to modify attributes of webpage. The browser may then output the modified webpage to present the ad.","In the discussion that follows, a section entitled \u201cExample Environment\u201d describes an example environment and devices, which may be employed to provide zero fixed placement (ZFP) ads in various embodiments. Following this, a section entitled \u201cExample Procedures\u201d describes example techniques related to zero fixed placements ads in accordance with one or more embodiments. After that, a section entitled \u201cZero Fixed Placement Implementation Examples\u201d describes example implementation details of zero fixed placement ad techniques that may be employed in one or more embodiments. Last, a section entitled \u201cExample Devices\u201d is provided and describes example devices that can be used to implement one or more embodiments.","Example Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","106","108","108","108","108","108"]},"For the purposes of the following discussion, a referenced component, such as service provider , may refer to one or more entities, and therefore by convention reference may be made to a single entity (e.g., the service provider ) or multiple entities (e.g., the service providers , the plurality of service providers , and so on) using the same reference number.","The service provider  may have one or more processors  and memory . Service provider  is depicted as storing a service manager module  in the memory  that is executable via the one or more processors . Service manager module  represents functionality operable by service provider  to manage various services  that may be made available over the network . For example, various services  may be provided via web pages or other user interfaces that are communicated over the network for output by the one or more clients . Service manager module  may manage access to the services , performance of the services , configuration of user interfaces or data to provide the services , and so on.","Some examples of services  include, but are not limited to, a search service, an email service to send and receive email, an instant messaging service to provide instant messages between clients , and a social networking service to facilitate connections and interactions between groups of users who share common interests and activities. Services  are also illustrated as including an advertisement service . The advertisement service  may enable advertisers to place ads for presentation to clients  in conjunction with other services. This may include placement of ZFP ads in accordance with techniques described herein. Additional examples of services  include a shopping service, a weblog service, productivity service, authentication service, a news service, and an advertisement service to name a few.","The authentication service may be provided by the service manager module  to authenticate clients to access various services  that may be provided by one or more of the service providers . For example, a client  may provide a username and password that is authenticated by the authentication service. When the authentication is successful, the authentication service may pass a token or use other suitable authentication techniques to enable access to corresponding services . Authentication of the client  to an account may provide access to a single corresponding service provider  and\/or service . Additionally or alternatively, -a single authentication may correspond to many services , such that authentication to a single account provides access to many service providers  and\/or to an entire suite of services .","The service manager module  may also manage an accounts database  that may be configured to store a variety of data related to user accounts with the one or more service providers . By way of example and not limitation, accounts database  may store account identifiers that may be used for authentication and access control (e.g., unique account IDs, usernames, passwords, and so on) and profile data that may correspond to personal data and pages accessible through various services . A variety of other data is also contemplated, including service authorizations, user preferences, program files such as documents and spreadsheets maintained online, and other data typically associated with user accounts.","The service provider  is also depicted as storing user interface (UI) data  in memory  that relates to user interfaces configured to enable various interactions with the services . User interface data  is representative of various code that may define webpages and\/or other user interfaces for applications of the clients . User interface data  may include but is not limited to HTML, XML, JavaScript, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and other code and\/or mark-up languages typically used to define user interfaces or portions thereof.","Rather than defining fixed placements for ads, user interface data  may make use of triggers  for the ads. The triggers  may be associated in various ways with ads from the ad source  (or other suitable sources) that are to be presented when the trigger occurs. The triggers  are independent of a reserved or fixed location for corresponding ads in the layout of a user interface. Thus, instead of selling fixed space to advertisers, service provider  through advertising service  may enable advertisers to associate ads with various triggers  embedded in or otherwise defined by a user interface. Ads that make use of the triggers  are referred to herein as zero fixed placement (ZFP) ads. In general, triggers  may be configured to cause execution of associated ZFP ads upon the occurrence of different events. The triggers  may be configured in various ways, further discussion of which may be found in relation to the following figures.","The user interface data  may also define content  and attributes  associated with a corresponding user interface (UI). Content  may be included in and\/or referenced by the user interface data . A variety of attributes  may be set to control an appearance of a corresponding user interface. By way of example and not limitation, attributes may be employed to select different content modules, set a layout for the UI and content modules, select colors, set a background image, add sounds and\/or video, designate a theme for the UI, present animations and other special effects, and so forth. At least some of the attributes  may be modifiable via ads to enable the advertiser to have selective control over the appearance of a user interface in which their ads are placed. User interface data  may also include various other data , such as templates, theme definitions or identifiers, authentication information, ad source identifiers, content URLs, and so forth. Further discussion of various attributes and themes that may be modified using ZFP ads may be found in relation to the following figures.","The one or more clients  are depicted as having one or more processors  and memory . To enable various communications over the network , the one or more clients  may also include a communication module . Communication module  may be configured to process user interface data  from the service provider  to output a corresponding user interface .","The communication module  is depicted as being stored in memory  and is also executable via the processor  to provide various interactions with service providers  and\/or services . Examples of such interaction include, but are not limited to, communicating one to another, navigating content, searching web pages, accessing services , interacting with ad sources , accessing web pages and other resources, instant messaging, e-mail, and so forth. The communication module  may be implemented as a browser or other suitable application to obtain and output webpages from the service provider  over the network . The communication module  may also represent a component of another application used to obtain one or more services  from the service providers . For example, a communication module  may be configured as a component of an email application, an instant messaging application, or other Web-enabled application of a client .","Communication module  may include or otherwise make use of an ad interface  to enable presentation of one or more ZFP ads, as well as other ads, in user interfaces  output via the communication module . In particular, ad interface  represents functionality operable to detect triggers  for ads and, in response, output a modified user interface that presents an associated ad. Again, this may occur independently of reserving space in the user interface  for an ad. As discussed in greater detail below, this may involve obtaining an ad associated with a trigger  from an ad source , setting attributes  of a user interface  in accordance with the ad, and outputting a modification of the user interface  that includes a presentation of the ad. In an embodiment, functionality represented by the ad interface  may be implemented as an application programming interface (API) that exposes methods to set attributes  of a user interface  that are modifiable. In this example, ads may be configured to cause calls to the API to set the attributes , and accordingly create the modification of the user interface .","The one or more ad sources  are depicted as having one or more processors  and memory . Processor  is depicted as executing an ad server module  that is also storable in memory . Ad server module  represents functionality operable to serve ads in response to ad requests from clients . Such requests may be made by a client  in response to occurrence of triggers . Memory  is depicted as storing ads  that may be provided over the network  to the clients . The ads  stored by ad sources  may include ZFP ads, as well as traditional ads. Ads  may be configured to include various combinations of text, video, audio, animations, images, and so forth.","The ZFP techniques also enable ads that are ZFP capable to define and set attributes  of a UI . In this manner, ZFP ads may create a flexible and rich presentation that includes a variety of content types, styles, layouts, sizes, colors, and so forth. ZFP ads are not limited to, or driven by, fixed characteristics (e.g., size, location, shape, and timing) of traditional placeholders. Moreover, the appearance and\/or layout of the UI for an ad may be modified to coordinate the UI with the ad. By doing so, advertisers may achieve an integrated look and feel that enhances their ads and avoids discontinuities between ads and UI's (e.g., differing styles, fonts, themes, color schemes, and so forth) that may occur with traditional techniques.","Having considered devices and components of an example environment, consider now example zero fixed placement ad procedures that may be implemented in the environment using the example components, as well as in other environments.","Example Procedures","The following discussion describes techniques for zero fixed placement ads that may be implemented utilizing the previously described systems and devices. Aspects of each of the procedures may be implemented in hardware, firmware, software, or a combination thereof. The procedures are shown as a set of blocks that specify operations performed by one or more devices and are not necessarily limited to the orders shown for performing the operations by the respective blocks. In portions of the following discussion, reference may be made to the example environment  of .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","200","104","136","140","140","136","140","122","102","140","104","108"]},"A UI is presented having a trigger for an ad that is independent of a fixed placement in the UI for the ad (block ). One way this may occur is by way of a communication module  executed by the client  of . The communication module  may represent various client applications (or a component of the applications) that makes use of network-based resources, including but not limited to a browser, an email client, a productivity suit, a messaging application, and so on. For example, communication module  may be configured as an email application that enables electronic communications. A user interface  for the email application may be output to present an inbox associated with a user account\/identity and to enable email functionality such as viewing, preparing, sending, and receiving email. The user in this example may have an account that is accessible to make use of various resources (e.g., services  and content ) from the service provider , including email service. The user interface  may also be configured to present various ads the user. At least some of these ads may be configured as ZFP ads as described herein. By way of the email application, client  may obtain UI data  that includes one or more triggers  for ZFP ads that may appear in the user interface .","Occurrence of the trigger is detected (block ). In the above example, ad interface  may be configured to detect occurrence of a trigger  that is associated with a ZFP ad for the email client. Triggers  may be configured in various ways to cause execution of ads responsive to different events. For example, triggers  may occur according to timers, a user selection, interaction with particular elements of a UI, and so forth. Triggers  may also be implemented to occur on the server side in response to client requests. For instance, ad service  can be configured to include ZFP ads in pages that are served based upon a number of times a page is accessed (e.g., every 5time), based on context information in the request (e.g., user contacts, browsing history, and profile data), and so forth. Various example triggers  for the email application may be configured to occur when an inbox folder is opened, upon selection of an email, and\/or when a cursor is \u201chovered\u201d over different portions of the UI or a particular email.","The UI is modified in accordance with the ad (block ). In at least some embodiments, modification of a UI occurs by setting attributes  for the UI as defined by the ad. In another example, an ad may describe or select a theme (e.g., a collection of attributes, properties, and behaviors) for a UI that is applied upon occurrence of the trigger.","In the preceding example, ad interface  may be invoked by the email application to cause modifications of various attributes of a UI, or application of a theme for the email application. This may include changing an appearance and\/or a layout of the UI. Typically, the ad is presented within the UI. In other words, the UI, ad, and modifications may be presented within a single application window. The UI in this case is modified according to attributes designated by the ad. Thereafter, the modified UI having the ad may be output via the email application. Other applications may be configured in a similar manner to create UI modifications in accordance with a ZFP ad that is configured to control various attributes . Additional details regarding various triggers, modifiable attributes, and themes that may be employed with one or more embodiments of ZFP ads are described in relation to  below.","Interaction is enabled with the ad (block ). In general, various interactions may be enabled for ZFP ads presented in a user interface. For instance, ZFP ads may include controls selectable to enable resizing and repositioning of the ad within a user interface. For animated or other audio\/visual ads, the ads may include controls operable to pause, stop, or replay the ad, and so forth. Interaction may also include functionality selectable to close out a presentation of an ad. Still further, ads may incorporate mini-games, slideshows, videos, and other functionality and interactive features that provide at least some interactive control to a user. Controls and corresponding interaction may be defined, enabled, and\/or or disabled at least in part by selectively setting attributes  by a particular ad.","Upon termination of the ad, the UI is restored (block ). In the continuing example, an ad presented via the email application may be terminated after a certain amount of time, when a user closes the ad, upon navigation to another email or folder, and so forth. When termination of the ad occurs, the UI is restored. In other words, the modifications caused by the ad may be reversed and the presentation of the ad may be concluded.","In at least some embodiments, some of the modifications to a particular UI caused by an ad may be preserved. For instance, interactive features of the ad may enable a user selection to maintain modifications made by the ad. In one example, an option may be provided to the user to enable the user to save modifications made by an ad as a theme. The theme may then be applied to the particular UI and\/or may be available for use with other UI's associated with the user and\/or a client .","Optionally, a fixed ad may be introduced following execution of the ZFP ad. The fixed ad may be operable (e.g., selectable) to \u201creplay\u201d the ad presentation. Note that traditional fixed ads may also be employed in a UI in conjunction with the ZFP ads described herein. However, unlike traditional techniques the flexible and rich presentations enabled via ZFP techniques do not rely upon a connection to fixed placeholders in a user interface. Thus, fixed ads may be employed in conjunction with ZFP techniques in a manner that does not interfere with the independence of ZFP ads to fixed placeholders. For instance, a fixed ad and a ZFP ad for the same product may appear in a user interface, however, there may be no functional connection between the fixed ad and the ZFP ad.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["300","300","106","300","104","136","104","108","140","300","102"]},"At the browser, a webpage request is received (block ). This request may be received from a user, may be a default request of the browser, may be received from another application, and so forth. The browser sends a request to the service provider for the requested webpage (block ). The service provider maintains or hosts one or more pages that enable zero fixed placement ads (block ), making these pages available to requesters. To enable ZFP ads in webpages, the pages may be configured to include triggers  instead of including fixed placeholders, positions, or space in the layout defined for the pages. The service provider receives the page request (block ) and returns the requested page having the triggers for ZFP ads to the requester (block ).","The browser receives the requested webpage from the service provider and loads the webpage (block ). In the course of loading the webpage, the browser may identify triggers  for ZFP ads and determine whether the triggers  are enabled. Also during loading, the browser may obtain ads associated with an identified trigger . In other words, the ads may be pre-loaded when the webpage itself is loaded. In at least some embodiments, the ads (e.g., actual ad definition and\/or content) may be received along with the webpage. In this case, service provider  may operate to configure the webpages with the ads prior to sending the webpages to the client . Alternatively, the browser may obtain ads through interaction with one or more ad sources . Additionally, the ads may be obtained apart from loading the webpage, such as when an associated trigger  occurs.","The browser may render the requested webpage for presentation to a user of the client . The browser also detects occurrence of triggers associated with ZFP ads for the webpage (block ). The triggers  may be configured as script in the webpage that initiates ZFP ads upon the happening of different events. Triggers  may be tied to a single hidden pixel or other invisible element of the webpage, such as an element or ad configured to match the background color. These triggers are independent of a fixed ad placeholder in the webpage. As such, underlying fixed ads (e.g., banner ads, pre-placed ads, and so forth) corresponding to the triggers  may not appear when the browser renders the webpage. Rather, the ZFP ads are executed upon occurrence of an associated trigger .","In instances in which ads are not pre-loaded, the browser may send an ad request to the ad source to obtain ads associated with a trigger (block ). In any of the ad loading scenarios described above, a context associated with the browser may be employed to select ads related to the context. For example, a browsing history, user profile, website context, and\/or user interaction may be employed to select ads targeted to the user. In this example, a particular trigger  may selectively cause different ads to be presented to different users in accordance with the context. Context information to enable selective presentation of ads may be communicated to the service provider  when a webpage is initially requested. Additionally or alternatively, the context information may be included with an ad request made to the ad source .","The ad source defines and\/or maintains one or more ads (block ), making these ads available to requesters. The ads may include ZFP ads, as well as traditional ads. The ad source receives the ad request (block ) and returns one or more ZFP ads to the requester (block ). For example, ad server module  may process ad requests and return corresponding ads. To do so, ad server module  may make use of context information that is provided with a request to serve targeted ads. In this manner, different users accessing the same webpage may be served different ads.","Web browser receives the ad(s) from the ad source (block ), and the browser presents the webpage as modified by the ZFP ads (block ). For example, ad interface  may communicate over the network  with the ad server module  to obtain ZFP ads in response to ad requests. In instances in which ads are pre-loaded, the requesting and receiving just described may occur when the webpage is loaded in block . The pre-loading may be employed to reduce latency in presentation of ads when an associated trigger occurs.","Regardless of how and when the ZFP ads are loaded, ZFP ads may be configured to define attributes  of the webpage to achieve a rich ad presentation as discussed above. The browser is configured to modify the webpage in accordance with the ZFP ads. For example, the browser may make calls defined by the ZFP ads to the ad interface  to modify various attributes  of the webpage. The ad interface  may be configured as an add-in or other integrated component of the browser. The ad interface  may also be configured as a separate component, such as an API that is callable via the browser, as well as by other applications, to enable ZFP ads for corresponding user interfaces. The browser may render a modified UI that includes the modifications caused by the ZFP ads. A presentation of the ZFP ads may occur within the modified UI.","The webpage content and the ad presentation may appear within a single window of the browser. In other words, ZFP ads may be implemented without employing pop-up windows to present the ZFP ads. The ad presentation in the modified UI may include various interactive aspects operable by a user as noted above. Upon completion or termination of the ad presentation, the browser may undo the modifications to the UI to restore the UI to its pre-ad appearance. An illustrative example of a modification of UI that makes use of ZFP ads is described below in relation to .","Having considered example procedures related to zero fixed placement ads, consider now a discussion of example implementations of zero fixed placement ads that may be employed in one or more embodiments.","Zero Fixed Placement Implementation Examples","The following discussion describes example implementation details of zero fixed placement ad techniques that may be employed in one or more embodiments. These implementation details are described in relation to an example modification of a UI as illustrated in . Just below, a description of the example depicted in  appears and thereafter various implementation details are described with reference to the depicted example.","In particular,  illustrates an example implementation  showing example acts that may occur in the course of employing ad triggers to execute a ZFP ad. Data describing at least some portions of a user interface may be received by a client (Act A). For instance, a document  is depicted in  that represents data received by a client  that defines a user interface. In at least some embodiments, the client  may communicate with a service provider  to obtain data for a UI configured to enable interaction with services  available from the service provider . The client  may obtain data that defines a complete UI, defines at least some portions and\/or elements of the UI, includes instructions to cause a UI to be rendered, or otherwise provides data sufficient to enable the client to form the user interface. In at least some embodiments the document  is configured as a mark-up language document (e.g., HTML, XML, and\/or other suitable code) that describes one or more pages to be rendered by applications of a client, including but not limited to webpages for a client browser. The document  further includes a trigger  that is associated with a ZFP ad . The ZFP ad  may be available from an ad source , a service provider , or another suitable location configured to serve ads.","An application of the client may make use of the data to output a UI defined by the data that does not include a fixed placeholder for the ZFP ad (Act B). For instance, the document  may enable a client  to render a UI  configured for interaction with one or more services . In the depicted example, the document  represents a webpage that may be obtained over the network from a service provider  and output via a browser. In particular, the webpage is depicted as a home page for \u201cProvider.com\u201d that may be output within a document display portion of a UI for the browser. The document  may describe various elements  that appear in the UI. Example elements  of the \u201cProvider.com\u201d home page include a \u201cNews\u201d portion to present news stories, an \u201cEmail\u201d portion to enable user interaction with an Email account, and a \u201cScores\u201d portion that may include sports stories and scores. The document  may also describe various attributes  for the UI that may be configured to control the appearance, style, and layout of the UI  and\/or the elements . The UI  is illustrated being associated with the trigger  defined by the document . The trigger is illustrated to the side of UI  to represent that the trigger does not appear in UI. In other words the trigger  may be configured as an invisible or hidden element defined by the document .","Responsive to occurrence of the trigger, the client application may configure and output a modified UI (Act C). In particular, a modification of the UI  may occur when the trigger  corresponding to the UI  is detected. The modification may be defined by and\/or caused by the ZFP ad  that is associated with the trigger .  depicts an example modified UI  that may be output in response to the trigger  and includes the ZFP ad . The modified UI  is configured to display a presentation of the ZFP ad . For instance, the example of  depicts an ad for football on \u201cChannel \u201d. When presented, the example ad may show a football that appears to be thrown across the modified UI .","The modified UI  also includes modified attributes  that are modified in accordance with the ZFP ad . For instance, in the example \u201cProvider.com\u201d home page, the browser may configure attributes as defined by the ZFP. The modified UI  may further include interactive features , such as a button to close the ad, an option to replay the ad, a feature enabling a user to select and \u201cthrow\u201d the football around the UI, and so on. Consider now example implementation details regarding triggers, attributes, and themes that are discussed with reference to the example modification depicted in .","Triggers for ZFP Ads","As noted previously, triggers  that are employed to implement ZFP ads may be configured in a variety of ways. In general, the triggers  are configured to cause execution of ZFP ads upon occurrence of various events. By way of example and not limitation, triggers  may be configured as script embedded within UI data  describing a page. The script may be configured to execute upon processing of a particular pixel of the UI. More particularly, the script to implement a trigger  may be tied to an invisible pixel or element of the UI. In other words, a rich ad presentation may be driven by a trigger  that is invisible to user (e.g., does not appear in the UI). When a UI is loaded, the script is processed and the corresponding trigger  may be initiated. The trigger  may then be set to occur to cause presentation of an ad in response to various events. Initiating a trigger  may include pre-loading of an ad related to the trigger  when a page is loaded. Alternatively, the script may be configured to cause an ad to be obtained apart from loading, e.g., when the corresponding trigger occurs.","In an embodiment, the triggers  may be implemented via calls to an interface configured to facilitate ZFP ads. For instance, an ad interface  may expose various functionality that is callable by a UI to associate triggers  with various events. In this example, UI data  may define functions calls to the ad interface  to select various events, associate triggers  for ads with the events, and initiate the triggers . Thus, instead of explicitly including the script to implement the triggers  with the UI data , the UI data  may specify variables for a trigger function that implements a trigger  for a ZFP ad. By way of example, a trigger function may be configured to accept as input an event name, an ad identifier, and an ad source identifier and to create a trigger  based on the input.","Triggers  may be associated with a variety of different events. This may include associations with timers, user input or selections, elements  of a UI, particular content or content modules, and so forth. For instance, the football ad of  may be triggered according to a timer that begins when the page is loaded. A timer may be set for various times, such as 5 seconds, 10 seconds, or 30 seconds after loading. In another example, the football ad may be triggered responsive to user input, such as when movement of a cursor or input of text is detected. In yet another example, a trigger may be set to occur and trigger the an ad when a user interacts in some manner (e.g., selects, hovers a cursor near or within, zooms in on, and so forth) with a particular portion of the of the user interface . For instance, the football ad of  may be triggered responsive to interaction with the \u201cScores\u201d portion.","Note that the football ad presented in the example of  is a sports related ad that may be selected to correspond to the \u201cScores\u201d portion. This illustrates one example of using context to select a particular ad. This selection may occur by including context information with ad requests made to an ad source. For instance, responsive to the user interaction with the \u201cScores\u201d portion, a trigger associated with the \u201cScores\u201d portion may cause data describing a sports context to be included with an ad request sent to an ad source . The ad source  that receives the request may make use of the context to select and return a sports related ad, such as the example football ad depicted.","If a user subsequently interacts with a different portion, the football ad may disappear and a trigger  associated with the different portion may cause presentation of a different corresponding ad. For example, a news ad may be selected responsive to interaction with the \u201cNews\u201d portion.","Thus, triggers  may be configured in various ways to cause execution of ZFP ads that modifies attributes of a user interface responsive to various events.","Modifiable Attributes","ZFP ads described herein may create customizations for a user interface by setting a variety of modifiable attributes of the user interface. In general, attributes  associated with a user interface may be set to modify the look and feel of the user interface. This may include changing the appearance and layout of elements in the user interface. The modification may encompass formatting, service additions, themes, color schemes, animations, and so forth. This may also include adding or removing elements of the user interface. The ad may then be presented in conjunction with the modifications made to the user interface.","Attributes  may be set in a variety of ways. In one example, attributes  may be set by way of markup language tags configured to define a group of attributes that may be modified. For example, markup language tags may be employed to enable modifications of attributes  including but not limited to user interface controls, coloration, images, animations, page structure\/layout, element shape, element size, styles, sounds, background, fonts, positions, and other modifiable attributes of the user interface. In an embodiment, a ZFP ad may be configured to designate values for the various attributes  using the tags coded within UI data . An ad interface  of a client  may be configured to process the tags to implement modifications designated by a particular ad when the ad is executed.","Other suitable techniques to implement attribute modifications are also contemplated. For instance a ZFP ad may be configured to make functions calls to the ad interface  to set attributes  using functions integrated with the ad interface  or with another application configured to make use of the ad interface . Another technique is to use script within a ZFP ad that is configured to define and cause modification through functionality integrated with a client operating system, such as by invoking a graphics management subsystem of the operating system.","Referring again to the example modified UI  of , a number of examples of modified attributes  are represented. Comparing the UI  to the modified UI  illustrates that background has been changed. For instance, the ZFP ad  may be configured to cause the background for the football ad to appear as an image of a football field. Modified attributes  also have been employed to rearrange the layout of the elements . Additionally, corners of the elements  now appear as squared off rather than rounded, and a different font has been selected for the modified UI  using modified attributes . Of course,  depicts just a few examples of the wide variety of modifications that may be made using ZFP ad techniques described herein. Accordingly, ZFP ads may be configured to set attributes  in various ways to define modified attributes and create customized ad presentations.","Themes","In at least some embodiments, a trigger  may cause a corresponding theme to be applied. A theme represents a collection of attributes, properties, and characteristics that may be applied to a user interface to control the look and feel of the user interface. Using themes may enable an ad (or other content item) to conveniently reference or otherwise make use of a designated theme rather than having to set different attributes  individually. Themes may be pre-defined and re-used by different ads. A theme name or other suitable identifier may be referenced by a ZFP ad to make use of a corresponding theme. A theme name or other identifier may be employed to implement a corresponding theme when initiated by a trigger  and\/or ad. This enables a theme definition to be maintained apart from the ad that makes use of the theme. For instance, theme definitions may be available from a service provider , an ad source , locally at a client , or from another suitable storage location accessible to a client .","Additionally or alternatively, a ZFP ad may explicitly describe a collection of settings to define a custom theme. In this case, an option for a user to save, install, and\/or make use of the theme may be exposed in conjunction with presentation of the ZFP ad via an application of a client .","A client  may selectively install various themes to enable selection of the themes by ZFP ads. The installed themes may then be available for use with a variety of different applications and user interfaces of the client . A theme initiated via ZFP techniques herein may even be applied as a desktop theme for the client . Service provider  may provide a theme service to enable creation, selection, sharing, downloading, and installation of various themes. Advertisers and users may create themes and publish the themes via the theme service to make the themes available for use by others. Thus, once a custom set of modifications is defined, the set of modifications may be saved as theme, shared among users, deployed to clients, and used in conjunction with ZFP ads, as well as being employed with various applications and user interfaces of a client .","Having considered example implementation details related to zero fixed placement ads, consider now a discussion of an example device that may be configured to implement aspects of zero fixed placement ad techniques in one or more embodiments.","Example Device",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"],"b":["500","500","104","102","106"]},"The computing device  includes one or more processors or processing units , one or more memory and\/or storage components , one or more input\/output (I\/O) devices , and a bus  that allows the various components and devices to communicate one to another.
