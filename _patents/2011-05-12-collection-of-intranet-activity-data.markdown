title: Collection of intranet activity data
abstract: Systems, methods and computer program products for facilitating the collection of data within a computer network (especially an intranet) while complying with applicable privacy laws and regulations, as well as individual organizations' rules addressing intranet users' privacy are disclosed. Such systems, methods and computer program products allow for the collecting of activity information related to computer-based activities performed by users while logged into an organization's intranet. Such activity includes navigating to URLs, opening and editing documents, writing, opening and reading email and instant messages, and the like. The collecting, consolidating, storing and exposing of such activity information—while ensuring privacy requirements—serves as a basis for high-value services (e.g., augmenting documents with extra information, improving search results, automatic news feeds, social networking announcements, etc.) to be offered and provisioned to such users.

No. 12\/773,319, titled \u201cPresentation of Information Describing User Activities With Regards To Resources,\u201d filed on May 4, 2010; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/771,290, titled \u201cPrioritization of Resources Based On User Activities,\u201d filed on Apr. 30, 2010; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/106,307, titled \u201cAutomatic Social Graph Calculation,\u201d filed concurrently herewith; and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/106,149, titled \u201cPersonalized News Feed Based on Peer and Personal Activity,\u201d filed concurrently herewith; each of which is hereby incorporated by reference as to its entire contents.","The present invention generally relates to computer networks and more particularly to systems, methods and computer program products for facilitating the collection of data within such networks.","In today's technological environment, it is common for business enterprises and other organizations to deploy private computer networks\u2014intranets\u2014to securely share such organization's information or network operating systems within that organization. The term \u201cintranet\u201d is used in contrast to \u201cinternet\u201d, which is a network between organizations, the most common of which is the global, public Internet. That is, an intranet is a network within an organization which sometimes refers only to the organization's internal (private) website, but may be a more extensive part of the organization's information technology (IT) infrastructure. It may host multiple private websites and constitute an important component and focal point of internal communication with, and collaboration among, individual computer users associated\/affiliated with the organization (e.g., students within a university, co-workers within a company or local, state or federal government department or agency, co-workers within a charitable or any other type of organization).","As individual computer users associated\/affiliated with the organization perform various computer-based activities while logged into the organization's intranet, there are a constant stream of activities occurring such as navigating to URLs, opening and editing documents, writing, opening and reading email messages, and the like. Information about these activities can be very useful (e.g., augmenting documents with extra information, improving search results, creating automatic news feeds, sending social networking announcements, etc.). Normally, however, such information is not collected within intranets and is lost. Yet, collecting, consolidating, storing and exposing activity information while ensuring privacy requirements allows for a number of high-value services to be built and offered based on such information.","Should such information be collected, there is one concern that must be addressed\u2014privacy. That is, protecting personal privacy is more complex in the information age. As more and more business is transacted \u201conline,\u201d the volume of personal information available on computer networks continues to grow. Thus, individuals using these computer networks are demanding greater control over how their personal information is stored, used and shared. Also, organizations are seeking better ways to manage and safeguard the sensitive personal data in their custody. In response, many governments on the national (e.g., federal), state, and local level, have passed laws dealing with individuals' privacy\u2014especially concerning Personally Identifiable Information (PII) which is any information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact, or locate the person to whom such information pertains, or from which identification or contact information of an individual person can be derived. More specifically, PII includes names, addresses, and phone numbers as the more obvious examples. Email addresses and IP addresses may also be included in this category. An emerging category of such information includes geo-location information that allows the sharing of the physical location of the user, a feature that is becoming popular in location-based services and social networking scenarios.","Sensitive PII includes financial profiles, health profiles, national ID numbers, social security numbers, credit card information, and other information designated as such by legislation (e.g., race, ethnicity, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade-union membership, sex life, etc.). Collecting sensitive PII data may bring enhanced exposure to legal, regulatory, and political risks and requires additional safeguards for data security, integrity and notice.","Collective information is a more subtle issue for privacy issue spotting because a single piece of information such as website usage would seem relatively benign and by itself would not be PII. However, data collected over time for online behavior such as search, web surfing, and social networking habits may eventually allow the user's identity to be discovered using data mining and correlation methods.","Privacy concerns are exacerbated in the context of private networks such as intranets. This is because use of these private networks requires users to log in with a \u201cuser id\u201d and password assigned by the owner of the network (e.g., the user's employer). This destroys the anonymity provided by other networks such as the Internet.","Given the foregoing, what are needed are systems, methods and computer program products for facilitating the collection of data within a computer network (especially an intranet) to allow for the provisioning of high-value services while complying with applicable privacy laws and regulations, as well as individual organizations' rules and policies addressing intranet users' privacy.","This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts. These concepts are further described below in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is this summary intended as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","The present invention meets the above-identified needs by providing systems, methods and computer program products for facilitating the collection, consolidating, storing and exposing of data within a computer network (especially an intranet) to allow for the provisioning of high-value services while complying with all applicable privacy laws and regulations (i.e., all national and local privacy laws and regulations that are applicable given the one or more jurisdictions in which the computer network traverses), as well as individual organizations' rules\/policies addressing their intranet users' privacy.","In an embodiment, a set of configurable data collectors which are operating on variety of existing data sources within an intranet, such as web content management log files, document management log files, web server log files, proxy server log files, directory service information, email servers, and the like, are combined with a local or cloud based-storage, and configuration, status and retrieval services to transform, aggregate and anonymize collected information as needed for the provisioning of high-value services, and as required by all applicable privacy laws or organizational policies.","Further features and advantages of the present invention, as well as the structure and operation of various embodiments of the present invention, are described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings.","The present invention is directed to systems, methods and computer program products for facilitating the collection, consolidating, storing and exposing of data within a computer network (especially an intranet) to allow for the provisioning of high-value services while complying with all applicable privacy laws and regulations, as well as individual organizations' rules\/policies addressing their intranet users' privacy. In various embodiments, such high-value services offered to the intranet's users include augmenting documents with extra information, improving search results, creating automatic news feeds, creating social networking announcements, and\/or the like.","Referring to , a block diagram illustrating an exemplary intranet activity data collection system , according to an embodiment of the present invention, is shown.","Intranet activity data collection system  includes a plurality of users  (shown as users -in ) accessing, via a computing device  (shown as devices -in ), an organization's intranet (i.e., private network) . As will be appreciated by those skilled in the relevant art(s) after reading the description herein, intranet  may be a private network deployed by an organization such as a business enterprise for use by its employees, deployed by a university for use by its students and faculty, deployed by a government agency for its workers, and the like. As will also be appreciated by those skilled in the relevant art(s) after reading the description herein, system  may be deployed across one or more jurisdictions as, for example, a multinational business enterprise makes its intranet  available to its employees around the world. This would thus subject system  to a plurality of national, state and\/or local privacy laws and regulations that are applicable in such one or more jurisdictions in which intranet  spans.","In various embodiments, device  may be configured as a desktop , a laptop , a PDA , a tablet or mobile computer , an intelligent communications device or the like.","As users  log into intranet , they perform various computer-based tasks while logged into the organization's intranet. Thus, there are constant streams of activities occurring such as navigating to URLs, opening and editing documents, writing, opening and reading email and\/or instant messages, and the like. System  thus further includes one or more data collection servers  which perform the importing and processing of raw (user ) activity data from various sources within system . In an embodiment, such sources of raw activity data include log files from one or more intranet web servers , one or more proxy servers , and one or more email servers . In alternate embodiments, data collection servers  may receive raw activity data directly (via intranet ) from one or more client-side activity collection applications executing in the background on any of devices .","In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, each collection server  can host one or more activity data collection rules (or \u201cadapters\u201d) which are designed to retrieve data from a specific data source (e.g., web server , proxy server , email server , a client-side logging application executing on device , and\/or the like). In such an embodiment, all adapters share a common collector infrastructure which includes one or more of the following:\n\n","In alternate embodiments, other sources of activity data within system  may include directory service information, web content management log files, document management log files (e.g., high business impact, web server log files, proxy server log files, email distribution lists or news groups, instant messages, text messages, telephone calls, and the like).","System  also includes a data storage , which can be local (e.g., an on-site database such as one or more SQL servers) or cloud based (e.g., the SQL Azure\u2122 storage platform available from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash.), which stores the data collected by servers  in a unified format. In an alternate embodiment, data stored within database  (and the network connections thereto) may be encrypted to ensure compliance with privacy laws and organizational rules.","In an embodiment, system  includes one or more control servers  that are used for configuration, status and data retrieval control. That is, control servers  monitor the collection of activity data as well as allow the data to be consumed for the provisioning of high-value services (not shown in ) as permitted by any applicable privacy laws and organizational rules.","In an alternate embodiment, control servers  may employ a web interface (e.g., the SharePoint\u00ae web platform available from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash.) to allow intranet administrators to configure and monitor data collection and data consumption. For example, such a web platform can be used as a base and can allow for complete configuration and monitoring of system  such as the location of log files, access credentials, privacy and organizational rules, data filtering and the like as shown in screenshot  of .","In an alternate embodiment, an intranet administrator would have access to control servers  via a web service-based application programming interface (API) (e.g., Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) or RESTful). In such an embodiment, the intranet administrator may enforce privacy laws and organizational rules based on access credentials. For example, an unprivileged user might be allowed to retrieve the total number specific documents being accessed within intranet , while an authorized user can retrieve more detailed information such as which user  accessed certain documents and when. This allows privacy protection while storing complete and detailed information as permitted by applicable privacy laws and organizational rules.","In various embodiments, control servers  allow for built-in support for enforcing privacy laws and organizational rules, including facilities for the following:\n\n","Referring to , a flowchart illustrating an intranet data collection process , according to an embodiment of the present invention, is shown. Process , which would execute within system , begins at step  with control passing immediately to step .","In step , database  is setup and deployed within system  (locally or cloud-based) to store all intranet  activity data collected by process .","In step , one or more data collection servers  are deployed within system  to access and collect activity data from data sources within intranet \u2014such as web servers , proxy servers , email servers , and client-side logging applications running on one or more devices , and to eventually store the collected activity data into database .","In step , one or more control servers  are deployed within system  to control data collection from intranet  and expose the collected data to various consumers implementing high-value services.","In step , one or more configuration tables are created within control servers  to specify the activity data to be collected by collection servers . That is, the configuration table, in an embodiment, reflects the access rules, aggregation and\/or transformation rules, exclusion rules, and consent rules specified by the administrator of intranet  reflecting the one or more applicable jurisdictions' privacy laws or regulations and the one or more of the organization's policies.","In step , process  begins to collect activity data in accordance with the one or more configuration tables loaded onto control servers  by, for example, an intranet administrator.","In step , the activity data collected by collection servers  are normalized and then stored in database . In an embodiment, data normalization  occurs in process  based on item meaning. For example, if a user  opens a spreadsheet document, action is taken on that document no matter how it was opened (e.g., saved to the disk from a website, opened from a spreadsheet application directly or opened from a spreadsheet application web viewer). All these cases might result in different URLs, while they all represent the same document (and thus should all reflect the same activity data). Thus, in such an embodiment, the normalization process  may first detect the fact that the document was opened via a web viewer, and then extracts the file location. In such a case, activity data would be recorded by process  based on the document location as opposed to being based on the original URL.","In an alternate embodiment, data normalization  occurs in process  based upon canonical URL representations. In such an embodiment, data normalization resolves textually different URLs that are logically equivalent into one URL for data integrity purposes. This involves disassembling a URL and then reconstructing it such that the resulting URL has a unified format, same escape sequences and\/or encoding, same query string parameter order and the like.","In step , collected data is exposed to consumers (i.e., applications and\/or servers not shown in ) providing high-value services as determined by the rules set in step .","Process  then terminates as indicated by step .","As will be appreciated by those skilled in the relevant art(s) after reading the description herein, in various embodiments, steps - may be repeated according to one or more pre-determined time schedules based upon the requirements of one or more high-value services built and offered to users  based on such information (e.g., augmenting documents with extra information, improving search results, automatic news feeds, social networking announcements, etc.).","As will also be appreciated by those skilled in the relevant art(s) after reading the description herein, step  may be repeated anytime the intranet administrator needs to update the one or more configuration tables to specify the activity data collected by updating one or more access rules, aggregation and\/or transformation rules, exclusion rules, consent rules in response to: a change in one or more applicable jurisdictions' privacy laws or regulations; a change in one or more of the organization's policies; and\/or the new or changing data requirements of one or more high-value services being provisioned to users  based upon such collected activity data.","Referring to , a sample activity data collection configuration table , in one embodiment of the present invention, is shown. In such an embodiment, intranet  utilizes the SHAREPOINT\u00ae web platform available from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash. Thus, in such an embodiment, table  contains the following fields: \u201cAdapterId\u201d\u2014the primary key in the table and may indicate which of the plurality of collector servers  the activity data collection rule (or \u201cadapter\u201d) specified by the table entry is to execute upon; \u201cDescription\u201d\u2014a free text description for administrative purposes; \u201cConfigData\u201d\u2014a configuration string for specific adapter type (e.g., a domain name from which to collect active directory data (ID ), URL of a SharePoint site from which to collect metadata (ID ), URL of the site, and location of the IIS log files (ID  and ID ) and other data as applicable (ID )); \u201cAsemblyName\u201d\u2014the name of the computer executable code file which contains the actual implementation of the adapter; \u201cIdleTime\u201d\u2014time (in seconds) between collections; \u201cImpersonateAccount\u201d\u2014alternative credentials to collect data where if it is not set, then the default credentials would be used; \u201cDayOfWeek\u201d and \u201cHourOfDay\u201d\u2014the execution schedule (e.g., execute only during night hours or on weekends), and if it is not set, then collection is run continuously while giving effect to the \u201cIdleTime\u201d filed.","In an alternate embodiment, a configuration table may contain a list of \u201cblacklisted\u201d users and items (e.g., URLs) stored in an XML or other formatted file. In such an embodiment, \u201cusers\u201d may include users  who opted-out of activity collection or even crawling robots executing within system  to make intranet  operational and thus such activity data is not useful for the provisioning of high-value services. Items, on the other hand, might be blacklisted for multiple reasons (e.g., privacy or a commonly-used API within intranet ).","In another embodiment, a configuration table may include rules for extracting specific patterns of usage (e.g., access to a specific productivity application or website). In such an embodiment, these rules may be implemented as series of accept\/reject rules which are chained together. Such rules can simply be the (whole or partial) matching of URLs, or more sophisticated such as looking up the URL history of a user  so an actual pattern is triggered by more than one record in the web server log file. Further, there can be line of business (LOB)-specific information rules which search for application-specific patterns (e.g., searching for ISBN codes in the URLs of visited sites, thus making it possible to determine book-related activities by users ).","In yet another embodiment, a configuration table may include rules to exclude items which may present privacy concerns or might have a high business impact. For example, such a configuration table may be formatted as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0058"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["ItemId","URL","UriCheckSum"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["6864","http:\/\/sharepoint\/SensitiveSubSite","\u22122123596221"]},{"entry":["6865","http:\/\/AnotherSensitiveSite","\u22121226526623"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}},"br":{}},"In one embodiment, the present invention (i.e., system , process  or any components thereof) is directed toward one or more computer systems capable of carrying out the functionality described herein.
