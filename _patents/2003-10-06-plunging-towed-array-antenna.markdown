title: Plunging towed array antenna
abstract: A towed antenna system and method of use includes a communication device disposed on a buoyant body attached to a housing by a tether. The housing includes a spool, a reel-wire guide, and a motor. The buoyant body and the reel housing are deployed from and towed at from a submerged platform. Hydrodynamic forces from towing prevent the buoyant body from rising to the surface while maintaining the housing at an equilibrium depth. To establish communication, the tether is released from the spool and the buoyant body rises to the surface. The tether is released until the communication session is over or until the tether is fully deployed. The reel-wire guide prevents the tether from becoming snagged during release. Once the communication session has been completed, the tether is retracted and the buoyant body re-establishes its equilibrium depth.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","(1) Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a towed antenna system and more particularly, to a plunging towed antenna system.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","Submersible vehicles must occasionally communicate with surface ships, satellites, aircraft, and other platforms as part of their operation. In order to broadcast and receive radio transmissions, they must deploy a large antenna above the ocean surface. To maintain stealth, for example, the submarine must remain submerged during this deployment. There are several known ways to accomplish this.","According to one method of antenna deployment, an antenna is mounted to a mast that is incorporated into the submarine  sail. When the submarine needs to communicate, the mast is deployed from the submarine sail by extending the antenna to the ocean surface similar to the extension of a periscope.","Mast deployed or mounted antennas are associated with several problems. In a first example, mast antennas create a significant wake when deployed at moderate boat speeds. This wake can be easily detected with electromagnetic, infrared, and optical sensors. Consequently, ship speeds are limited when a mast antenna pierces the surface and a wake is created.","Utilizing another method of antenna deployment, a submersible vehicle can communicate with other platforms while submerged using a buoyant towed antenna. A buoyant towed antenna typically includes a buoyant body that is connected by a tether to a winch disposed on the submerged vehicle. The winch allows the submerged vehicle to deploy the buoyant towed antenna to the ocean surface allowing the submerged vehicle to communicate with other platforms, and then to retrieve the buoyant towed antenna when the communication has been completed. Known buoyant towed antenna systems, however, use a winch that cannot operate in a \u201cfreewheel\u201d manner, i.e. the winch does not permit the spool to spin freely. Thus, the winch must be powered in either direction to deploy or reel the buoyant towed antenna in. ","Buoyant towed antennas do not create large wakes associated with mast antennas while being towed, however, when towed at moderate speeds, their dynamic interactions with surface waves and the tow cable cause buoyant towed antennas to occasionally plunge under the ocean surface, crash through ocean waves, violently pitch and yaw, and create water sprays. All of these high-speed motion effects interfere with the operation of the onboard electromagnetic communication devices.","Accordingly, it is a general purpose and primary object of the present invention to provide a system that allows a submersible vehicle to maintain its stealth and stay submerged, while still allowing the submersible vehicle to effectively communicate with other platforms.","To obtain the objects described, there is provided a buoyant antenna system adapted to be towed behind a submerged platform. The buoyant towed assembly includes a buoyant body, a tether and a reel housing. The buoyant body includes at least one communication device and is adapted to propel to a surface of a body of water. The tether includes a first end connected to the buoyant body and a second end connected to the reel housing. The reel housing is adapted to be connected to a primary tow assembly disposed on the submerged platform. ","The reel housing generally includes at least one aperture, a spool, a motor in communication with and driving the spool. The spool is adapted to contain a substantial length of the tether.","The reel housing may be disposed within the submerged platform or the buoyant body, but is preferably a separate body disposed between the submerged platform and the buoyant body.","The reel housing optionally includes a depressor and a reel-wire guide. The depressor controls the buoyant elevation of the reel housing while the reel-wire guide prevents the tether from becoming jammed within the reel housing. Additionally, the reel housing may also include at least one bushing disposed about the aperture to prevent chafing of the tether.","The present invention also features a method of deploying a buoyant body having a communication device from a submerged platform at high-speed. The method includes releasing a reel housing from a submerged platform and subsequently establishing an equilibrium depth for the reel housing. A tether cable connecting the reel housing to a buoyant body is then released from the reel housing and is allowed to float to the surface of the water. Once on the surface, a communication operation with another platform is established while the tether is continuously released from the spool. Upon the completion of the  communication operation or upon the depletion of the tether from the spool, the cable is retrieved by the reel housing. Additionally, the buoyant body is re-submerged and an equilibrium depth in re-established. Throughout the entire process, the submerged platform maintains a high-speed. The method further includes re-releasing the tether to establish a subsequent communication, if necessary.","Referring now to the drawings wherein like numerals refer to like elements throughout the several views, one sees that  depicts the towed antenna system  of the present invention. The towed antenna system , as shown, allows a submarine or submerged platform  operating at relatively high-speeds to tow a buoyant body  on the surface  of a body of water  while eliminating intermittent plunging and wave wash-over as well as the creation of significant surface waves.","The towed antenna system  includes the buoyant body  attached to a reel housing  using a tether . The reel housing  is attached to the submerged platform  using a tow cable .","The buoyant body  floats on the surface  and is preferably designed to minimize turbulence and drag from any surface waves; including any design known to those skilled in the art.","The buoyant body  includes any known communication device  such as, but not limited to, an electromagnetic transmitting\/receiving antenna. The communication device  is typically disposed on the surface of the buoyant body , though the exact placement of the communication device  will depend  upon the characteristics of the specific communication device  used.","The buoyant body  is preferably connected to the reel housing  preferably using a high strength cable as the tether . The tether  may optionally include a communication wire such as, but not limited to, a composite cable or fiber optic filaments that allow the communication device  to transfer data to and from the submerged platform . Alternatively, the communication device  may communicate with the submerged platform  using any known wireless communication methods such as, but not limited to, electromagnetic communication.","The reel housing  may be incorporated into the buoyant body  or the primary tow system, i.e. the handling system onboard the submerged platform , but is preferably a separate body that is connected to the submerged platform  using the tow cable  and a suitable connection  such as, but not limited to, a shackle, turnbuckle, or splice cable.","For the sake of brevity, and not intended to be a limitation of the present invention, the towed antenna system  will be described wherein the reel housing  is a separate body, though one skilled in the art will be able to readily determine any modifications necessary to incorporate the reel housing  into the buoyant body  or the handling system aboard the submerged platform . ","Accordingly, the reel housing  preferably has the streamline shape shown in  to reduce the amount of drag and turbulence generated as the reel housing is towed through the body of water . The reel housing  includes a wing-like depressor  as will be described in greater detail hereinbelow.","Referring now to , the reel housing , generally includes at least one aperture , a spool , a reel-wire guide , and a motor . The tether  enters and exits the reel housing  through the aperture , which preferably includes a bushing (not shown) or the like to reduce friction on the tether . The tether  is then wrapped around the spool  after being guided through one or more pulleys  or guide rings.","The tether  is connected to the spool  using any connection known to those skilled in the art thereby allowing the spool  to reel the tether  in. A connection , such as a slip ring or the like, provides a suitable electrical connection between the tether , the spool  and the tow cable  when a communication wire is used in the tether  and allows a signal transmitted by the communication device  to be transmitted through the tow cable .","The spool  preferably has a small diameter that allows the spool to hold a relatively long length of the tether . Consequently, the provided tether  should tolerate a small bending radius. ","The reel-wire guide  includes one or more pulleys  that direct the tether  around the length of the spool  as the motor  rotates the spool , thus preventing the tether  from becoming snagged or jammed within the reel housing . The reel-guide  preferably includes a lead screw assembly  acting with the rotation of the spool , but may include any reel-guide design that directs the tether  about the length of the spool.","Use of the towed antenna system  is depicted in . Initially, the buoyant body  and the reel housing  are deployed from the submerged platform  and are towed at a high-speed. The hydrodynamic forces (F) on the tether  and reel housing , and the buoyant body  prevent the buoyant body  from rising to the ocean surface . The depressors  on the reel housing  include stabilizing or control surfaces that allow the reel housing  to be deployed to a certain depth from the surface  (preferably about 20 feet) and slow the speed of the reel housing  rising to the surface . (See ) In this condition, the tether  is substantially wound about the spool  within the reel housing .","Referring specifically to , the submerged platform  communicates with another platform (not shown) starting with a signal (either a wireless signal or a signal transmitted through the communication wire disposed in the tow cable ) transmitted  from the submerged platform to the motor .(See ) The transmitted signal releases a clutch  disposed between the spool  and the motor  thereby allowing the spool  to spin freely to rapidly release the tether  from the spool . The clutch  includes any clutching mechanism known to those skilled in the art such as, but not limited to, a high friction disk disposed between a flywheel and a pressure plate or a racket-style clutch.","The reel-guide  ensures that the tether  does not become snagged or jammed within the reel housing . As the tether  is released from the reel housing , the buoyant body  slows down and the forces (F) generated against the buoyant body  are also reduced, thus allowing the buoyant body  to rise to the ocean surface . Upon the buoyant body  reaching the ocean surface , the communication device  establishes a communication with another platform. The tether  is continuously released from the spool  until either the communication is complete or the supply of tether  on the spool  is exhausted.","Once the communication has been completed, or the supply of tether  on the spool  is exhausted, another signal is transmitted from the submerged platform  to the motor  which engages the clutch  and reverses the motor. The motor  reels in the tether , as well as the buoyant body , toward  the reel housing assembly . The motor  is powered by an electrical source (not shown) disposed in the reel housing  or the submerged platform . When the desired amount of the tether  has been reeled in, the motor  stops. The reel housing  and the buoyant body  are then allowed to rise to their equilibrium depths (as shown in ), and the process is then repeated, when required or desired.","The towed antenna system  of the present invention allows the submerged platform  to maintain a relatively high and constant speed while allowing the buoyant body  to intermittently pop up to the ocean surface , conduct communication operations, and then quickly disappear beneath the ocean surface . The buoyant body  therefore reduces a large hydrodynamic wake that could be detected by a variety of sensing devices.","In light of the above, it is therefore understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.
