{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application is a divisional of application Ser. No. 09\/354,287, filed on Jul. 15, 1999 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,289,971, which is a continuation of application Ser. No. 08\/898,160, filed on Jul. 22, 1997, U.S. Pat. No. 5,987,440, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/022,035, filed on Jul. 22, 1996, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference as if set forth fully herein.","The present invention relates to the software management of information within a network computing environment. More specifically, the present invention relates to a software system operating on the Internet that creates a virtual private network where a user may author, secure, search, exchange and process personal information in a trusted and controlled manner. This software system encapsulates trusted communities and their members, where a trusted authority certifies the identity and the informational-self of community members. Once a user is registered with a trusted community, the user can author and secure at will the hypermedia content, command and control the rule-based presentation and processing of their personal information.","The introduction and accelerating use of the Internet has resulted in an explosion of both the quantity and availability of personal information. Unfortunately, since the Internet is largely unregulated, there is no assurance that all this information is accurate or reliable, and often the source of the data is not even ascertainable. Additionally, unless particular precautions are taken, anything sent via the Internet is subject to interception and misuse. These joint concerns for data reliability and data protection can be combined into a multifaceted concept of a trusted information utility. Data reliability or trustworthiness is present if the data is accurate and can be authenticated and\/or corroborated. Trusted utilization is when data is available for access or processing only by those approved by the owner of the data, and assurance of continued command and control according to rules established by the owner is present. Trusted utilization or trusted processing is especially critical when dealing with personal data. Personal information, such as an individual's credit worthiness, medical history, employment background, or lifestyle is now finding its way on to the Internet. It is likely that law enforcement agencies, credit bureaus, landlords, and others will be using this information to assist in making decisions. Since all these groups make decisions that dramatically impact an individual's life, using incorrect data, or information that they shouldn't even have, can be devastating.","Thus, people realize that something must be done to protect a person's personal information and as more individuals join the Internet, there will be more pressure to collect, use, and market the available personal information, and the individual will want to participate in, command, and control this activity. Collectively, these ideas cannot be properly implemented with the Internet tools presently available, and no tool can efficiently incorporate these ideas. Thus, there is a need to provide an Internet utility or tool for the security and exchange of personal information.","It is therefore an object of the present invention to assist in the trusted utilization of personal information on the Internet by 1) providing a mechanism for individuals or entities securely author and encapsulate personal data and processing rules governing the presentation and processing of personal information, while 2) empowering the individual or entity, at will, command and control of their personal information within network computing environments.","The present invention is a software system for operating on network servers, with supporting applications operating on an individual user's personal computer system, inclusive of wire-line and wireless tele-computing devices. This invention is directed to a system for allowing an individual or entity to protect, command, control, and process personal information on a computer network, including the Internet. Specifically, this invention facilitates the formation and use of networked Trusted Electronic Communities, hereafter referred to as E-Metro Communities, where each E-Metro Community comprises several members meeting common admission requirements. Preferably, it is the E-Metro Community that sets registration rules and verifies member identity itself or facilitates the use of other trusted Certificate Authorities. The informational identity of each member is encapsulated within the E-Metro Community as electronic personal information agents, hereafter referred to as E-PIAs, with each E-PIA representing a member's information and behavior, with some of the information supplied by each member and some of the information coming from trusted sources external to the member's E-Metro Community. By establishing and enforcing registration rules and performing accountable and audited verifications of member identity, and if so chosen, personal information certification, the E-Metro Community builds a community wherein each of its members can belong and participate in a electronic domain where the rights and responsibilities of privacy and informational self-determination are realized. Thus, it is through the association and certification by a trusted E-Metro Community that a member becomes trusted and reliable in other transactions, but more importantly gains control of their data.","Once a user is a member of an E-Metro Community, the member can assign access rules to each piece of personal information. These access rules set the requirements that must be met before an individual piece of information can be processed. Additionally, the E-Metro Community may get minimum standards for all transactions which must be met. When a request for a particular piece of information is received, E-Metro Community standards and the rule attached to that piece of information is checked by a processes specific to the E-Metro Community, hereafter referred to as the E-Metro Community's E-Broker. The E-Broker is the actual process that checks to see if the requester and the situation meet the requirement of the rule. If so, the E-Broker allows the requested information to be processed; if not, the E-Broker does not allow the information to be processed. Additionally, the information may be transport packaged with transitive privilege rules attached, that is, rules that define the requirements for processing by anyone other than the original member. Using these transitive privilege rules, a member can maintain command and control on third party dissemination and processing of their personal information.","A member may also create an agent, hereafter referred to as an E-AutoPIA, to interact with other members in any E-Metro Community, or even with data external to any E-Metro Community. This agent contains a subset of the personal information on the member, plus contains an itinerary that directs the activity of the agent. Thus, the agent is able to interact with the personal information of other members as directed in its itinerary.","The preferred embodiment of the invention primarily operates on a network server, with supporting applications operating on the individual's personal computer system. To a user, the preferred embodiment appears as a Web site, so it may be accessed simply by knowing its Web site address, but it is a Web site with comprehensive security safeguards: firewalls, proxy servers, SSL enabled Web servers and clients, digital certificates, hardware tokens, security policies and procedures. Not only will the Web site typically require certificate-based identification for access, but all communications between E-Metro Communities and members and other E-Metro Communities will be encrypted. For additional assurance of user identification, an optional hardware token or secure card security system may be implemented. This security system will be discussed in a later section.","As discussed earlier, trusted processing of information has two components: reliability of content and controlled processing, and each is addressed by the preferred embodiment of the invention. It is easiest and most clear to discuss the preferred embodiment using a metropolis analogy. Just as in a city, the Internet provides an individual a place to meet others, share information, seek entertainment, do work, and shop. Likewise, every individual on the Internet has an address where correspondence may be sent. In the city, caution must be used when meeting someone for the first time as it may be unwise to give too much information to someone who is untrustworthy. Also, business transactions with a new person must be done carefully as the quality of goods, standard of support, or origin of the product is not known. These same concerns appear with new encounters and transactions on the Internet.","In the city, people use an unfamiliar person's associations to lower the risk of these new encounters and transactions. For example, if someone is wearing a police uniform, we will typically be more likely to give them our drivers license number, home address, and other personal information. If someone is seated in an attorney's office and hands us a business card with the title of \u201cAttorney,\u201d we are more likely to expose confidential information. Also, if someone lives in our same community, maybe even our neighbor, we too will be more likely to share information and feel safe conducting a transaction. On the Internet, if a person has an address that ends in .gov, we may feel safer doing business with them, as some government agency has allowed them access to the Internet from a government network server, thus giving that user an air of trustworthiness. If that user conducts a bad transaction, the agency that allowed their access to the Internet can be contacted, and the agency is likely to sanction that user. However, the vast majority of users on the Internet will be from network servers that provide no hint as to their trustworthiness. Therefore, the preferred embodiment of the present invention provides a method to reduce the risk in new interactions, and increase the probability that the other user is who they say they are: the preferred embodiment creates agent-rule based trusted electronic communities.","In the city, citizens belong to several communities. Some communities are defined by geography, ethnic background, religion, alma mater, employment, or hobbies. Commonly, people get a great deal of self-identification and satisfaction from choosing the communities to which they belong. It is quite common for someone to refer to themselves as an employee of a company, as a member of a religion, or as an expert at a hobby. Belonging to a community is not only personally satisfying to the member, but allows the reputation of the E-Metro Community to lower the risk of dealing with any one of its members.","In the preferred embodiment, a user may join one or more E-Metro Communities. Each of these E-Metro Communities is independently operated by an administrator that sets admission requirements, authenticates membership, issues digital certificates, and sets the services available to members. The E-Metro Communities are actually implemented as Web sites on the Internet, but are special Web sites as they have a great deal of intelligence and utility.  diagrams a user's view of the Internet using the preferred embodiment. The user will be a member of one or more E-Metro Communities  and be aware there are several other E-Metro Communities  on the Internet. The user will use a Web Browser such as Netscape Navigator  running on their personal computer to access the Internet and attempt to become a member of one or more E-Metro Communities. When desiring to become a member of an E-Metro Community, it is possible to retrieve an unregistered or empty E-Being object from the E-Metro Community or from a public E-Being repository  that will need to be initialized with identity information and certified in order to become a member. An unregistered E-Being may be retrieved prior to visiting the E-Metro Community desired to be joined. Once a user is authorized to join an E-Metro Community, the user becomes a member of that E-Metro Community and can use the services the E-Metro Community administrator has provided. Services may include links to other E-Metro Communities, shopping, or access to information. Besides the standard Netscape Navigator , the member will also need some additional support programs at their local computer, the client subsystem . These client subsystem  support programs are processes that allow the Netscape Navigator to have specific functionality in support of specific E-Metro Communities. These programs will be provided as part of the preferred embodiment, but will be configurable by the E-Metro Community administrator or even the user to provide specific functionality. These programs could be created in any language, but Java is presently preferred. It should be a goal of each E-Metro Community, however, to not require additional software besides standards based browsers, as this maintains a much easier to support client software subsystem. Additionally, the member may desire to gain privilege or access to specific E-Metro Community services to which it does not have rights. The E-Metro Community may require further information to be filled out in forms that must be submitted for approval. These forms are stored in an E-Being repository , and can be set up as an independent Web site, an FTP site, or any other storage mechanism allowed on the Internet.","Remembering that trusted processing comprises reliability and controlled processing, in the preferred embodiment, trusted processing of personal data is improved by two means. First, the personal information that is processed is authored and monitored by the individual. The information can also be verified by third parties who issue digital certificates which corroborate the facts claimed by the individual. The information stored is transparent to the individual. Additionally, the users themselves can request trusted certificate authorities to verify and assert the reliability of the personal information. The Certificate Authorities issue digital certificates asserting the reliability of the data. An example would be a credit union, which will certify personal financial or loan data. As an E-Metro Community's reputation for reliability and user-centric control of personal information processing increases, the informational value and mutual trust of its users will also increase.","The other aspect of trusted processing, protection of data, is improved in two ways by the preferred embodiment of the present invention. First, the preferred embodiment uses state-of-the-art techniques, such as public-key cryptography, to securely store and transmit information. Public-key cryptography is discussed in more detail in a later section. These techniques assure that the data can not be deciphered if intercepted during transmission, and only the intended reader can decrypt and understand the information. The second security feature of the preferred embodiment is designed to place controls on the amount of information processed and to limit the utilization of data to recipients meeting criteria established by the user. This security feature allows the user to set rules that govern the processing and utilization of personal information. For example, one rule may state that it is acceptable to release legal history information to a user that is from the American Bar Association E-Metro Community. Another rule may state it is acceptable to utilize a home phone number by a user that is single, from a particular geographic area, and also agrees to have their home number utilized in a controlled manor. By setting sufficient rules, an individual can control the utilization of personal information by only trusted users. Additionally, the user may set transitive rules that attach to information that control electronic distributed processing of the information. Thus, when a user authorizes trusted remote processing of personal information, the information is utilized in a manner that allows the user to maintain command and control of how the information is subsequently utilized.","The preferred embodiment additionally allows an individual to set rules for processing personal information for money or other value. An individual's preferences, physical characteristics, and buying habits have value to those selling products. Traditionally, marketing firms would collect and organize such information and sell those mailing lists to businesses that had a product that may appeal to those on the list. Using the preferred embodiment, an individual can \u201clicense\u201d their own personal information to a business directly or to a marketing firm, thus sharing in the value created by the trusted processing of reliable personal information.","Referring now to , an example of what a user may see when accessing an E-Metro Community Web site is shown. Here, the computer user is running Netscape Navigator on their personal computer, and the standard Netscape Navigator menu items  can be seen. To get to this point, the user had to tell the Netscape Navigator the address of the E-Metro Community Web site, and the Netscape Navigator, through the user's network server, connected to the remote network server where this E-Metro Community Web site is located. Once accessed, the E-Metro Community Web site sends this introductory screen  to the user, which contains a graphical logo  and title  specific to this E-Metro Community. The user can select one of three option buttons : get more information on this E-Metro Community, go to the services available in this E-Metro Community (will require a security check-in), or, if a new user, register for admission to this E-Metro Community. If the user selects to register, the registration objects will be supplied by the E-Metro Community or retrieved from a E-Being repository and the user will author their E-Being, similar to filling out a standardized form.","If the user selects the services option, the user will be asked for security information and\/or hardware tokens. In , the E-Metro Community only asks for a certificate-based identification  and a security code or challenge response . Once the user selects \u201cOK\u201d , and the user is allowed into the E-Metro Community, the user can utilize the available services. In this example, the member is presented with the communities available screen  shown in , which is made of the graphical logo  and the community links . Services available in this E-Metro Community include search and selection, registration updates, advertising, shopping, customer support and other services selected by the E-Metro Community administrator. Search services provided in this E-Metro Community is the availability to perform parametric queries.  shows a partial view of the members who met a specific search request in this E-Metro Community, allowing the searching member to select particular E-PIAs by selecting a picture-link . Provided the requesting member has the proper qualifications as set by the interrogated member, the interrogated member's information can be seen by the requester.","The preferred embodiment is premised on a user's membership in at least one E-Metro Community, with the E-Metro Community defining the member's duties and rights. In the preferred embodiment, the E-Metro Community has three primary responsibilities. First, the E-Metro Community sets admission requirements that produces a high probability that the applicant for admission is who they say they are. Second, the E-Metro Community has security measures in place to reasonably assure that a member's identity can't be appropriated by someone else. Third, the E-Metro Community sets standards that place a high probability that the member is transacting business and disclosing accurately and in good faith.","The first responsibility for assuring the applicant is who they say they are is met in the preferred embodiment in a two step process. In the first step, an applicant, using the Netscape Navigator  accesses the Web site for the E-Metro Community  they wish to join. This user selects the registration object from an E-Being repository , fills it out and submits it to the E-Metro Community administrator. The E-Metro Community administrator reviews the application to assure that the applicant meets the E-Metro Community qualifications. If the applicant meets the qualifications, the application process moves to step two. In step two, the applicant\/user appears in-person to the E-Metro Community administrator or another trusted authority or entity, such as a Certificate Authority or notary, to verify the user's identification. The applicant can present one or more pieces of identification, such as birth certificates, drivers' licenses, passport, social security card or other reliable means of identification. Once the applicant is personally identified and a key pair generated, they are issued a digital certificate binding the public key and both member and E-Metro Community information. A security code or challenge response access method is chosen and hardware token if requested. At a minimum the member will have a digital certificate and access method to fully use the selected and approved E-Metro Community services. The E-Metro Community is now reasonably assured that the person is who they say they are and has accounted for the processing of the registrant's application.","The second responsibility of the E-Metro Community is to assure that only the original applicant can use that member's identity. The digital certificate and security code or challenge response described above will assist in assuring the security of an individual's identity, but new technology allows for even greater security. For this advanced security, the E-Metro Community may issue the user a hardware token or secure-card, such as those sold commercially by Gemplus, Schlumberger, and Spyrus corporation. Although the LYNKS secure card from Spyrus has several options as to what information it can hold, three particularly useful items are 1) the basic information about the user, 2) a digital certificate, and 3) E-Metro Community digital certificate digitally signed by the certifying E-Metro Community. The first item may contain several pieces of information, including passwords, security codes, and particular challenges or code phases that can be used by the preferred embodiment to verify the identity of the user. For this challenge security, the user loads the security card with challenge response pairs that only the user will know. When the user wants to access an E-Metro Community, the security card \u201cchallenges\u201d the user by presenting a challenge phrase that must be answered precisely. The second item, the digital signature, is an advanced security mechanism that allows the sender to attach a digital signature to a document that gives an assurance that a specific document was actually originated by that sender. The digital signature will be discussed in more detail in a later section. Those skilled in the art will recognize other alternatives to assure on-going security of a user's identity such as biometrics. The third item possibly held in the card stores information on the authority that certified this particular member. This authority could be the government, an E-Metro Community administrator or surrogate, or a commercial business. The more accountable, diligent and exhaustive the security policy and procedures are of the certifying agency, the higher the assurance that the member is also trustworthy.","The third responsibility for the E-Metro Community is to assure that the member properly transacts business and discloses personal information accurately and in good faith. This is mostly a policing process for the E-Metro Community, where those who violate the interaction policies for ethical interaction are removed from the E-Metro Community. Stricter enforcement of the rules will lead to a better E-Metro Community reputation for trustworthiness and accuracy.","Once there is assurance of the member's identity, the next level of security is to assure that the member can communicate with the E-Metro Community without messages and information being intercepted and interpreted by unauthorized individuals. This security level has two main components. First, the preferred embodiment uses security protocols approved by Netscape for commerce transactions, including purchases made on the Internet with a credit card. Second, the Netscape Navigator web browser has built in cryptography techniques, called public-key cryptography, that can assure the communication from the member to the E-Metro Community is secure from outside interception and interpretation. The preferred embodiment uses the public-key cryptography techniques supplied by RSA Data Security, Inc, but those skilled in the art will recognize alternatives.","Public-key cryptography is one method currently known for secure transfer of information. A diagram on the operation of public-key cryptography is shown in . In this method, each user has a code pair, where one code is public and one is private. These codes are commonly called keys, so each user has a public key and a private key. The public key list  is widely distributed to anyone that may need to send the user information. However, the private key is kept secret by the user. For example, if \u201cA\u201d wants to securely send a file to a \u201cB,\u201d A will encrypt the file using the Bs public key . This key is publicized and available to anyone who wants it. After encryption, the file  can be deciphered only by using Bs private key , which is known only to B. Thus, if B has properly secured the private key, only B will be able to receive and interpret the encrypted file. It doesn't matter if the file is sent via an unsecured transmission method such as the mail, Internet, or phone lines, since no one that intercepts the message can interpret it, unless they have somehow appropriated Bs private key .","A second security mechanism is the previously introduced digital signature, and assures the receiver that the message was actually sent by the stated sender. As briefly discussed above, a member can use a digital signature to \u201csign\u201d files so to give a high degree of assurance that it was the owner of the signature that sent the message.  will assist in explaining the use of the digital signature. To add a digital signature to a file, the member passes the file  through a mathematical formula  that produces a digital pattern, or message digest , that is unique to that file. This message digest  is then encrypted using the members private key  as discussed above, creating the digital signature . This digital signature, then, can tie a particular file to a particular owner of a private key. The member then attaches the digital signature  to the file  and sends both to the receiver. In this example, the file  is sent unencrypted, but if the file must be securely sent, the member can use the method describe in the previous paragraph to encrypt the file with the receivers public key. When the file and signature are received, the receiver deciphers the digital signature  using the senders public key , revealing the digital pattern  unique to the file . The public key, as before, is available from a published public key list . If the digital signature  was made using any other user's private key, the resulting pattern will not match the file, and the receiver will know the file was not sent by the named sender. Using this digital signature technique, the preferred embodiment can place a high assurance that a particular file was sent by a specific member.","Using the techniques described above, there is a high level of assurance that information and business transactions will be made securely and accurately. However, security is only one part of a successful Internet interaction. Presently, interaction on the Internet is an impersonal and often random experience. A common critique of using the Internet is that interacting on-line doesn't allow us to locate, understand and know with assurance the person behind the e-mail ID or message\u2014to hear the voice, to see the face, to know a little about the senders personality, characteristics, and trustworthiness. Without these, the interaction is not only personally unsatisfying, but frustrating and useless.","Virtual communities are forming but people have little assertive control over their digital persona or interactions and much of the rationale behind these virtual communities is data gathering. This data gathering is performed by commercial entities seeking to track consumers, performing continuous and subtle surveillance of community members. Overwhelmingly consumers want control of their personal information and are demanding change as a backlash is mounting seeking legislation to circumvent this unbridled gathering, trafficking and processing of personal information. The present invention creates a trusted virtual community enforcing informational privacy and informational self-determination, wherein people can individually and corporately demand value in exchange for accessing and processing personal information controlling the many attributes which make up their informational existence.","A digital persona or Internet personality is determined by the personal information available for an individual. The more complete and reliable the information, the more accurately the Internet personality will reflect the real-life personality. This personal information is valuable not only to accurately define an on-line presence, but, as discussed earlier, has commercial value to others. Personal information may take many forms, including health, financial and legal records, school transcripts, employment history, or buying preferences. Each of these pieces of information, if accurate, is an asset that can make interacting on the Internet more effectual and enjoyable. In the preferred embodiment, these information assets are compiled and made available to others according to the desires of the individual E-Metro member. All the personal information, taken as a whole, makes up the electronic presence or digital persona of an individual. For purposes of clarity and ease of explanation, it is useful to think of this electronic presence in a Web site E-Metro Community as an electronic personal information agent or E-PIA, as introduced earlier.","Some of the informational assets of an E-PIA are created and held by others, but can be dispatched or processed in accordance with the rules embedded in the E-PIA, such as medical records and school transcripts. Other assets are those that can be authored by E-Metro Community members. The preferred embodiment allows a member to self-assure or collaboratively assure the information encapsulated within the E-PIA is accurate and reliable.","In  a user has accessed an E-Metro Community Web site using Netscape Navigator and is displaying the initial registration application . The standard Netscape interface  is near the top of the figure. Specifically, the user interface includes a menu bar , control buttons , quick access tree structure , and a communication activity indicator . Additionally, the key graphic  near the bottom of  tells us that security is in operation, so all communications with the E-Metro Community Web site are encrypted.","The registrant can navigate to other data subject areas (professional, financial, medical) within the notebook shown in the left most scrollable window. If the user selects the professional data area , the user will see the professional profile and begin data entry or update the information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":["FIG. 30","FIG. 31","FIG. 32","FIG. 31"]},"In this example Dieter has several options for rule processing depending upon Dieter's anticipation of rule interactions and the level of hands-on control he'd like to maintain or entrust to the E-PIA. Dieter may simply wish this requesting user to provide, in exchange, their Home Phone number and so a simple rule interaction will begin. Either processing of this rule will be done at the requesting client site confirming rule satisfaction or the messaging system will be activated with a message sent back to Dieter's Home E-PIA requesting his Home Phone be provided or a signal to his dispatched E-PIA be sent authorizing decryption and display of the encapsulated Home Phone data.","An automated rule-based response can be executed on the client-side given rule interactions are pre-defined and can continue the user-agent dialog or delayed interactions supported by the messaging system will continue the rule interactions. Dieter's Home E-PIA may already have a response established by a rule which says if your show me yours I\u2032ll show you mine and so the message response is semi-automatic.","In the case where Dieter has already defined a rule for processing his Home Phone data at the requesting client site the interaction is carried out and triggers a client-side message to Dieter's E-PIA. So, within the requesting user's E-Metro client-side application Dieter's dispatched E-PIA receives a signal to decrypt his Home Phone number for controlled access. The rule interaction Broker within the E-Metro client-side application checks to see if the Home Phone has been properly provided.","In the above case the E-Metro Community E-Broker has dispatched an already loaded E-PIA with encrypted data encapsulated which will save the messaging sending, rule-processing, and hands-on response some overhead by processing the rule right at the client-side. Dieter will decide how trusting he wishes to be in that he can rely upon the system to fetch data in return prior to releasing his data over E-Metro's virtual private network or have the data and rules dispatched within this E-PIA for processing right at the client station.","Rule response dialog boxes display rules and give the requesting person the option to respond. The rule may specify a financial transaction to occur. In this case the user authorizes a debit from their E-Metro wallet for the amount required by the rule.","Rule specifications are authored in . The figure depicts a dialog screen wherein Dieter navigates on the left his PIA's data attributes , specifying what kind of rules will govern that attribute or group of attributes. Access groups are a means to group rules by particular communities or sub-communities . Initial Contacts is a group Dieter has specified as a sub-community in which his Age attribute rule is not disclosed and this attribute in locked  i.e. not revealed in an initial contact scenario.","His other attributes: City, Date of Birth etc. are open and will be displayed upon processing. With this screen Dieter can create a \u201cNeed To Know\u201d Prompting where in the requesting user is prompted for a need to know. Dieter will have to process this response himself via E-Metro's messaging system. Some message interactions will be automated by pre-built rule responses such as \u201cI'll Show You Mine If You Show Me Yours rules.\u201d So Dieter's Home E-PIA can react to rule messages automatically.","Some data attributes will have Time Requirements in that the E-PIA will only allow so much time to pass for viewing or processing the E-PIA's data. A case in point is that Dieter will only allow 24 hours to pass and then his E-PIA locks itself up (encrypts) in order to prevent further processing.","As shown in  the sub-community Initial Contacts  must meet the above rules  and  in order to process Dieter's E-PIA. So Dieter is specifying the criteria other persons must meet prior to processing his E-PIA.","So community members will send queries to the E-Metro for processing and although a query may have several matches the decision to dispatch the E-PIA which meets the query requirements may not be sent due to the fact the requesting person may not meet the person's rule requirements. In the prior case Dieter's E-PIA was dispatched as the person requesting his E-PIA met the above criteria.","As shown in , the E-Being repository  may be anywhere on the Internet, that is, it may be on the same server where the E-Metro Community resides, or the E-Metro Community may use a E-Being repository residing somewhere else on the Internet. When a member joins an E-Metro Community, one of the first tasks will be to author, according to the users discretion, the personal profiles. These profiles, plus any information from outside sources, comprise the E-PIA representing an individual on the Internet.","A user can belong to several E-Metro Communities in the preferred embodiment. The user must, however, select one of the E-Metro Communities to be the home E-Metro Community. The selected E-Metro Community houses an E-PIA designated to be the \u201cHome E-PIA\u201d which keeps track of all the other E-Communities where the member resides. In this way, a change in the home E-PIA can be used to update the information in all the other E-Communities, if necessary. Once a member has joined an E-Metro Community and designated the E-Metro Community as its home, the member can join another E-Metro Community by simply meeting the admission requirements for the next E-Metro Community and then copying the E-PIA to the new E-Metro Community. As will be discussed in a later section, when a member desires to create a special E-PIA, called an E-AutoPIA, that is capable of moving to other E-Metro Communities and perform requested tasks, the E-AutoPIA can only be spawned from the home E-PIA. The E-AutoPIA, then, has a subset of the information contained in the parent home being, thus assuring anyone encountering the E-AutoPIA that the information it carries is related to a home E-PIA.","A member defines rules for the access-processing of their personal information to assure the information is processed appropriately. When a user tries to access the personal information of a member, the preferred embodiment checks to see if the user meets the requirements for trusted processing of the information. The preferred embodiment only dispatches an E-PIA to the requesting user containing information, which the user is authorized and qualified to process. These rules define the limitations on information processing and form the basis for interaction between E-PIAs in the E-Metro Communities. That is, when a member, represented by an E-PIA, contacts another member's E-PIA, the two E-PIAs can determine what, if any, information can be exchanged without any concurrent input from the represented humans. The specifics of this rule checking is described in a later section.","To this point the E-PIA in the E-Metro Community has been described as simply a storage repository for personal information with the ability to selectively release information according to rules, and acting only within one E-Metro Community. In the preferred embodiment, however, the E-PIA may also take the form of a more active entity, called an E-AutoPIA, capable of substantial unsupervised activity with other E-Metro Communities and E-PIAs in other E-Metro Communities on the Internet in general. The E-AutoPIA contains a subset of the personal information and rules of the full E-PIA, plus an itinerary that directs its activities. The itinerary tells the E-AutoPIA what E-Metro Communities to visit, what information to collect, and, in conjunction with the rules, what information may be processed. Using an itinerary, then, an E-AutoPIA will \u201cmove\u201d about the Internet, visiting other E-Metro Communities where it can interact with the E-PIAs in each E-Metro Community.","In the preferred embodiment, the E-AutoPIA does not directly interact with other E-PIAs. Instead, each E-Metro Community has at least one process that acts as a brokering agent between an E-AutoPIA and the E-PIA members of the E-Metro Community. This brokering agent is the E-Broker presented earlier. When two E-PIAs or an E-PIA and an E-AutoPIA desire to interact, both present the E-Broker with their respective rules, and the E-Broker determines what, if any, information may be exchanged. Additionally, the E-Metro Community administrator may set minimum rules that apply to all the E-Broker mediated transactions to occur in that E-Metro Community, assuring that only transactions that meet minimum E-Metro Community standards will occur.","As alluded to, there are two modes of E-PIA Interaction. A user, electronically represented by his member E-PIA within an E-Metro Community, may invoke a single Interaction for an E-Metro Community via his Netscape Browser and the appropriate HTML document. This is known as Online Interaction Mode. When an E-AutoPIA invokes Interactions within an E-Metro Community, this is called Batch Interaction Mode.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0086","num":"0085"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 6"],"b":["35","37","37","39","41","41","39","35"]},"The E-Broker has three main functions within the E-Metro Community. First, the E-Broker has been defined by the E-Metro Community administrator to check the credentials of any E-PIA that wants to enter an E-Metro Community. In this policing role, the E-Broker checks certification, verifies identity, and inquires into the purpose of any approaching E-PIA. After applying the rules set by the E-Metro Community administrator, the E-Broker will either deny access to the E-PIA or allow it into the E-Metro Community. Second, the E-Broker acts to search for members that meet the criteria designated by an E-PIA during its request for interaction. For example, if an E-PIA enters an E-Metro Community to find members who are interested in purchasing a car, the request is given to the E-Broker. The E-Broker, using several-subsystems available in the preferred embodiment, then searches all the members to find those that have expressed an interest in purchasing a car and creates a list of all members meeting the necessary criteria. Third, the E-Broker acts as an intermediary between the E-AutoPIA and the E-Metro Community E-PIAs. In the above example, even after the E-Broker has created the list of members that express an interest in purchasing a new car, the E-Broker still acts as a mediator. The E-AutoPIA presents its rules for collecting information, and each member E-PIA presents its rules for disclosure, and the E-Broker determines what information, if any, will be exchanged. Of course, even if the two beings agree to exchange information, the E-Metro Community administrator may have set a more stringent rule that will not allow the E-Broker to finish the transaction.","One of the possible tasks that an E-Broker may negotiate is the controlled processing of a member's personal information. Provided both the E-Metro Community administrator and the user want to process personal information, the E-Broker can be instructed to collect money from a visiting E-PIA that wants personal information. In the preferred embodiment, the money collected may go to the E-Metro Community, the member, or split between them. An E-Metro Community with a substantial membership may find this an attractive way to finance other E-Metro Community services.","The E-Metro Community may provide several services to its members. Services may include intra-community functions such as collaboration groups, consensus building or voting systems, capital disbursement systems to manage the community revenues generated from services, on-line customer satisfaction databases to protect consumers promoting accountability and just resolution of customer complaints, or community subsidized provision of advanced wireless communicators to promote \u2018equal access\u2019 policy objectives. The E-Metro Community may also provide extra-community services, such as access to cross-community mobilization efforts for philanthropic or political purposes, joint electronic commerce services, sharing of communication infrastructure costs to facilitate cross-community advanced or newly introduced wireless networks and technology for all community members.","A typical physical arrangement for the preferred embodiment is shown in  where a user  accesses the Internet  by using a personal computer  to connect to a network server , and the network server  makes the connection to the Internet . Both wire-line and wireless connections will be supported with where more than one E-Metro Community can reside on one network server , and E-Metro Communities may even form a hierarchical relationship. That is, an E-Metro Community may contain not only members, but may contain other sub-communities as well.  shows network servers  with one, two, or three E-Metro Communities on each server. Additionally, E-Being objects for authoring member information for the particular E-Metro Communities may be requested from the E-Metro Community E-Broker or, if made available publicly, in the E-Being repositories . The preferred embodiment allows any public storage subsystem for E-Being objects. Two possible storage subsystems are an FTP site or a Mail server which is simply a file storage and communication system holding assorted file types and is available off the shelf from Netscape or other vendors. These E-Being repositories may be on any server  or , or the E-Being objects may even be held by user at their personal computer  or a wireless Communicator device .","We now turn to the specific software implementation for the preferred embodiment. The preferred embodiment is a modularized application, that is, the application is divided into several parts, with each part, or module, assigned specific functions. Some of these modules are designed to operate on one or more network servers, while other modules are designed to operate on a user's local computer system. The user and server processes necessary to the preferred embodiment are shown in , and are associated with the physical devices shown in . Referring to both diagrams, the user , from their personal computer , runs the Netscape Navigator Web Browser , a commercially available application. The Netscape Navigator  allows the user to conveniently access any E-Metro Community Web site. Also, the Netscape Navigator provides compatibility with other Netscape products that bring specific tools to the preferred embodiment. Besides the Netscape Navigator, the user locally runs several utilities  in support of E-Metro Community activities. These specific applications may be DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries), Java applications, applets and scripts, or some other code of a similar nature that supports specific E-Metro Community activities. As mentioned earlier, however, in almost all cases, additional subsystems and DLLs should not be necessary.","The heart of the preferred embodiment is the Web site E-Metro Community system , which operates on the network servers . A top level view of the Web site E-Metro Community system  architecture is shown in . The system comprises the Distributed Object Resource Management System (DORMS) , which is shown in more detail in , a Netscape Enterprise Server , the Netscape Application Programming Interface , a LivePayment payment card transaction processor , an FTP server , and an FTP client . Each of these system components will be individually discussed below, and then their interaction explained, but first the important consideration of security will be addressed.","Strict security is necessary in order to ensure that only intended communications and information dissemination occurs. Security can be divided generally into two categories: 1) security mechanisms to assure that eavesdroppers or accidental recipients cannot access information, and 2) security measures to assure that information is only released to a trusted entity. The first type of security is accomplished by using cryptographic techniques to transfer data between entities. Referring to , several Web site E-Metro Community systems  and a user accessing the preferred embodiment with the Netscape Browser are shown. Each Web site E-Metro Community system  is operating on a network server as a secure process. It is expected that anyone skilled in the art of process security can create a local secure process for each Web site E-Metro Community system . For inter-community communications, each Web site E-Metro Community system  maintains its own private key and public key for encryption use.","When a source E-Metro Community wants to communicate with another target E-Metro Community, such as when an E-PIA is transferred, a double encryption technique is employed. The source E-Metro Community encrypts the message using the public key of the target E-Metro Community. The source E-Metro Community then encrypts the now encrypted message again, but this time with its own private key. Each E-Metro Community is aware of all other E-Communities and their public keys. When the target E-Metro Community receives a message, it first decrypts the message with the public key of the source E-Metro Community and then it decrypts the message with its own private key. This \u201cdouble\u201d encryption assures the target E-Metro Community that the source E-Metro Community was indeed the source E-Metro Community mentioned in the message and also assures the source E-Metro Community that only the target E-Metro Community will be able to decrypt the message intended for it. Similar security measures are used for communications from an E-Metro Community  to a user.","Another important security aspect concerns assuring the source of an E-PIA or E-AutoPIA. This assurance of origin is shown through the use of a Certificate  and TrustedToken . Certificates are held by all E-PIAs and E-AutoPIAs, and contain the name of the person or entity represented and their associated public key. Since the personal information held by an E-PIA or E-AutoPIA has been encrypted by the private key of the person or entity represented, if the public key in the certificate matches the published public key, and the personal information correctly deciphers, then there is certainty that the E-PIA or E-AutoPIA originated from the stated source. The Certificate, then, is to assure that a being represents who they say they represent and the information was originally encrypted by that representative. The TrustedToken represents a necessary privilege to perform an Interaction, given by an E-Broker at E-PIA or E-AutoPIA authoring time. Each Interaction that needs to be secured will require that a TrustedToken be issued. Before an E-Broker will act on a requested Interaction, it will check to see that the requesting E-PIA has the necessary to assure that the E-Broker had granted privilege to perform the Interaction previously. Each TrustedToken will be associated with a specific Interaction and will be encrypted by the requesting E-PIA's private key. By using the requesting E-PIA's known public key, the TrustedToken can be decrypted and compared to the expected value, thus giving assurance that the ability to request the Interaction was actually granted specifically to the requesting E-PIA.","The second security mechanism assures that information is only released to trusted entities. When an E-PIA gives some of its personal information to another, the personal information given is still secured and owned by the original E-PIA, so subsequent dissemination can be controlled. The mechanisms concern initial release of information and subsequent dissemination by others. The initial release of information is controlled by having both the Web site E-Metro Community administrator and the individual set rules which must be met before information can be released. The E-Metro Community administrator can set rules that generally apply to all potential exchanges in the Web site E-Metro Community, allowing the E-Metro Community to maintain control on the types of acceptable transactions. Also, the individual can assign a rule to each piece of personal information in their E-PIA. By setting these rules, the E-PIA will only share information in a trusted environment with a trusted being. A more difficult issue relates to control over subsequent dissemination of information. In fact, if the receiver of the information, in turn, passes the information on to a third E-PIA, the preferred embodiment still retains knowledge of the original owner of the personal information and continues to police access to the information. This subsequent security is set by Transitive Privilege Rules declared by the original E-PIA. The transitive privilege rules create a transitive trust such that: If A trusts B with information X, and B trusts C with information X, then A trusts C with information X. This important concept assures to A that its information is never passed on to an entity which it does not trust according to the Transitive Privilege Rules it has declared for the data it has submitted. Information is always passed as a version of the E-PIA which submitted its information. For example, suppose an E-PIA contains a rich set of information which includes birth date, address, phone number, etc. Further, suppose it wishes to release only its phone number to another during an interaction. The receiving entity will actually receive an E-PIA object informational E-PIA, which contains only the phone number. More specifically, the E-PIA object received is a version of the original E-PIA which represents how the submitting E-PIA wishes to be perceived by the receiving entity.  depicts the collection of versions  of E-PIAs by a traveling E-AutoPIA. The versions of E-PIA objects is the only manner in which information is exchanged in the preferred embodiment.","The Distributed Object Resource Management System (DORMS) is central to the operation of the Web site E-Metro Community system . As shown in , the DORMS  handles several core activities for the system, including storing of E-Metro Communities, E-Brokers, and members, E-PIAs maintaining a directory of all E-Metro Communities on the Internet, holding auto beings, and handling the interaction between E-PIA and between E-PIAs and E-AutoPIAs. Each of these activities will be discussed below.","The activities of the DORMS  are implemented with a series of interrelated subsystems, as diagrammed in . The interaction processor  is the key subsystem for the DORMS , and is responsible for all external communication and most internal decisions. Once the interaction processor  decides on a particular course of action, the action is implemented by the use of an E-Broker process. There are several E-Brokers available to do specific, reoccurring tasks. The operation of the interaction processor is discussed in detail in a later section, but first the other DORMS functions and individual subsystems will be addressed.","The DORMS is responsible for the storage of the E-Metro Communities, E-Brokers, and E-PIAs. Although each of these items is quite different, they are all stored in a common structure within the Object Repository . The Object Repository  employs a simple object oriented interface over a relational database. The relational database can be any that operates on the network server, such as the popular Oracle Database system.","E-Metro Communities, E-Brokers, and E-PIAs are all objects in the preferred embodiment, with each instance of an E-Metro Community, E-Broker, or E-PIA assigned a unique Object Identifier, or OID . The characteristics are then stored with the OID  in the form shown in . This figure shows the structure of each row of a table within a relational database. Referring to the figure, the OID  is in the first field. The next field, the CollectionOID  identifies if this object is included in any other object, allowing for the creation of relationships between objects. Using a common CollectionOID , for example, several E-Brokers, E-PIAs, or even other E-Communities can be associated with a single E-Metro Community. The CollectionOID , then, is the preferred embodiment's method for tracking the hierarchical relationships between E-Communities, and the method for tracking E-Broker and E-PIA assignment within a particular E-Metro Community. Following the CollectionOID  are several key fields  that contain selected information about the object. These fields are \u201ckeys\u201d that may be used for search and selection criteria by the database program. In the preferred embodiment, six key fields  are allowed for each row in the database table. Of course, more or fewer keys could be used, or alternate search techniques are clear to those skilled in the art. The specific identity of the keys is left to the E-Metro Community administrator to assign, thus allowing E-Metro Community needs to direct the most effective fields for efficient searching. The last item in the row is the object itself, which is stored in BLOb (Binary Large Object) format. BLOb format is a standard database storage structure that allows a single field in a database to hold multiple pieces of discrete information and is unaffected by the content of each piece of information. Thus, the DORMS can search the key fields  in the object repository  to quickly select appropriate objects, then extract and view the objects themselves from the BLOb format, a much slower operation.","As stated above, E-Metro Communities, E-Brokers, and E-PIAs use this common row structure. Each, however, uses a slightly different naming convention. The convention used by the E-Metro Community is shown in . Notice the CollectionOID  references a parent E-Metro Community by the ParentOID , if any. In this manner the preferred embodiment maintains the hierarchical structure for the E-Metro Communities. The only additional difference is that the first key field  is assigned to hold the name of the E-Metro Community. Since the database engine often will use the name of the E-Metro Community for searching, it is appropriate that the name be a dedicated key for all E-Metro Community objects.","The row structure for an E-Broker is shown in . Just as with the E-Metro Community, the first key field  is a name, in this case it is the name of a specific E-Broker. However, the CollectionOID  field contains the OID of the E-Metro Community that \u201cowns\u201d this E-Broker, thus associating a particular E-Broker with a specific E-Metro Community using a CommunityOID . This association method allows an efficient method to know which E-Brokers are allowed to operate in an E-Metro Community. Additionally, this same association method is carried through with the row structure for the E-PIA, which is shown in . In the E-PIA, the CollectionOID field contains the Metro CommunityOID , thus associating a particular E-PIA with a specific E-Metro Community. As can be seen in , all six keys are undefined in the E-PIA row structure, allowing the E-Metro Community administrator the flexibility to define each field to meet specific E-Metro Community needs.","Referring again to , the DORMS  also maintains a current directory of all E-Communities on the Internet. This directory is maintained by a special E-Broker in the E-Metro Community called the Directory Broker , with every E-Metro Community having a Directory Broker . The Directory Broker  tracks all E-Communities on the Internet and their address. Additionally, the Directory Broker  holds information on all other E-Brokers in all other Internet E-Communities. Information held includes the E-Broker's name, rules, and other information the E-Metro Community administrator desires to keep about other Internet E-Brokers. To keep the directory information current, an E-Metro Community's Directory Broker  will periodically inquire to see if its E-Metro Community has added, deleted, or changed any E-Brokers or E-Communities, and if so, the directory E-Broker  will launch an E-AutoPIA. This E-AutoPIA will be sent to all other E-Communities to interact with their Directory Broker, updating each E-Metro Community with the changes. The frequency of this update will vary, but most likely a schedule of once-per-day updating will be sufficient to support accurate E-Metro Community interaction.","The DORMS  also contains a Messaging system  that allows the E-Metro Community to send an E-AutoPIA to another E-Metro Community. As can be seen from this figure, the DORMS  communicates with other remote E-Communities through the FTP client  and the FTP server . Although the FTP processes are shown connected directly with the Messaging subsystem , all actual communication is controlled by the interaction processor. A more detailed diagram of the Messaging Subsystem is shown in . As discussed earlier, the Messaging subsystem  uses the FTP protocol to conveniently send and receive messages from or to the Web site-based E-Communities. This Messaging subsystem is employed exclusively for transporting E-AutoPIAs from one E-Metro Community to another. When an E-AutoPIA is sent to another remote E-Metro Community, the interaction processor  first retrieves the address of the remote E-Metro Community using the directory E-Broker . The interaction processor  then bundles the E-AutoPIA with the remote address and forwards the bundle to the sender dispatcher . The sender dispatcher  places the message in the message queue  and notifies the FTP client  that a message (an auto-being bundled with an E-Metro Community address) is ready to be sent. At a convenient time, the FTP client  sends the message (the auto being bundled with the address) to the FTP server of the receiver E-Metro Community and subsequently erases the outgoing message for the message queue . For an in-coming E-AutoPIA, FTP server  accepts the message and places the message in the message queue . The receiver dispatcher  monitors the message queue , and when a new message is seen, it unbundles the message, revealing an E-AutoPIA. The receiver dispatcher  then notifies the interaction processor  that a new E-AutoPIA has arrived, and the interaction processor  determines what next to do with the E-AutoPIA. The incoming message in the message queue  is not deleted until the E-AutoPIA in that message has completed its tasks within the E-Metro Community and has left the E-Metro Community. Saving the incoming messages assures that the E-AutoPIA's assigned tasks will be completed, even if the DORMS server should shut down in error and lose the E-AutoPIA currently active in the network server. When the network server is restarted, the E-AutoPIA can be restarted from the original message and its tasks completed. The message queue  itself is a standard FTP file system which may comprising an incoming message file and an outgoing message file. It will be clear to those skilled in the art that other transfer methods may be substituted for the FTP process described above.","The Virtual interpreter  is a software subsystem that provides the ability to execute the script language and rules language of the preferred embodiment. The Virtual Interpreter  plays a major part in the use of the rules processor  and the Itinerary processor, both which are discussed in a following section.","The DORMS  contains a Rules processor , which is an important subsystem for ensuring that information is securely distributed. A member or the E-Metro Community administrator uses rules to set the limitations and controls on the distribution of personal information. The rules are actually a series of strings, written in the programming language chosen for the preferred embodiment, that defines the requirements under which information will be released. It is possible to make the rules as simple or as complex as needed. The E-Metro Community administrator may provide minimum rules that will apply to all transactions, and allow the member to adjust rules for their particular needs. Although the preferred embodiment uses an application to set rules, those skilled in the art will recognize several alternative methods for a user or administrator to input rules.","As discussed earlier, requests for a member's personal information may come from either of two sources: another E-PIA member or an E-AutoPIA via Online Interaction mode or Batch Interaction Mode, respectively. If an E-AutoPIA enters an E-Metro Community and requests a member's information, the interaction processor  will start an E-Broker process to handle the request. The process to handle such a request is detailed in a later section after all subsystems have been describe, but generally, the E-Broker takes the rules that define the E-AutoPIA's request criteria and sends them through the virtual interpreter  and into the rules processor . The rules processor  converts the request into a standard database query request, such as a standard SQL SELECT command, and runs the query to select E-PIAs from the object repository . The E-Broker then accesses each selected E-PIA's rules, sends then through the virtual interpreter , to the rules processor , and the rules processor  compares the requirements set by the member E-PIA to the characteristics of the E-AutoPIA, and if the requirements are met, the E-Broker sends the requested information from the E-PIA to the E-AutoPIA.","If another member of the same E-Metro Community requests information on another member, the process is similar, although much simpler. In this case the interaction processor  again starts an E-Broker process, and the E-Broker sends each E-PIAs' rules through the virtual interpreter and finally to the rules processor . The rules processor compares the rules for each member and determines what, if any, information may be disseminated.","As previewed earlier, an E-AutoPIA is instantiated from a user's E-PIA and includes an itinerary. The itinerary is a set of instructions that direct the activity of the E-AutoPIA. Thus, the E-AutoPIA acts as an agent for the user. The itinerary, like the rules, can be a program written in Java, or other convenient language chosen for the preferred embodiment. As with the rules, those skilled in the art will recognize several alternative methods to creating an itinerary to direct an E-AutoPIA.","The Virtual Image  is used to improve the performance of the preferred embodiment by placing selected information in local RAM (Random Access Memory) for quick access. Since the system can access information in RAM much faster than it can retrieve information from a data base located on a hard drive, such as the Object Repository , the system runs more efficiently. Once an E-Metro Community, E-Broker or E-PIA is needed by the preferred embodiment, an E-Broker selects the needed entity from the object repository  and places a copy of the entity in the virtual image . From then on, the system uses the copy in the virtual image  rather than the original in the object repository .","As can be understood from a previous discussion, E-Brokers are processes that execute on the network server and are used within an E-Metro Community to assist in the orderly and efficient functioning of that E-Metro Community. Each E-Metro Community has at least one E-Broker, but may have more. Two special E-Brokers exist in the preferred embodiment, but there may be more. The first one is the mandatory directory E-Broker  and was discussed earlier. The second one must be present in E-Communities that require secure modification access to the E-PIAs and is called the Home E-Broker . The home E-Broker is responsible for assuring that only the owner of an E-PIA has edit access to his home E-PIA. The home E-Broker may be set to require very strict security access, such as having the member use a secure card, passwords, and challenge system, or may be set up with weak security, such as just having the member supply a proper member identification name.","Each E-Broker is a custom built executable that runs in the Web site. Each E-Broker executable  implements a specific set of E-PIA interaction choices provided by the E-Metro Community it resides in. When an E-PIA requests a specific interaction, the Interaction Processor  invokes the E-Metro Community's E-Broker and tells it to attempt the requested interaction. In order for the Interaction Processor  to communicate with each E-Broker executable with a unified communication protocol, E-Broker Adaptors  are employed. Thus, the Interaction Processor  actually communicates with an E-Broker Adaptor  specially built for the E-Broker executable which, in turn, communicates with the E-Broker executable . Thus, the E-Broker Adaptor  acts as a \u201cbridge\u201d for communication between the Interaction Processor  and an E-Broker executable. This adaptor mechanism is necessary since E-Brokers constructed from C, C++, Java, Visual Basic, PowerBuilder, or other development environment may require different means for invocation and information transfer.","As a means to assist the construction of all necessary activities that an E-Broker executable may need to perform, the E-Broker Service API DLL is provided as part of the DORMS server subsystem. E-Brokers must be capable of calling APIs in a DLL to employ these helpful services. Some services that have been identified are: 1) input a set of rules and output a list of E-PIAs in the current E-Metro Community that satisfy the rules; 2) interact with the Transaction Server to perform credit card processing; 3) bill a credit card; 4) validate a Security Card that is entered on-line. It should be clear to those skilled in the art that other APIs may be added as needed.","Referring to  again, so far the DORMS , FTP client , and FTP server  portions of the Web site E-Metro Community System  have been discussed, with the LivePayment Server , Netscape Enterprise Server , and Netscape API  yet to be detailed.","The LivePayment Server  is a commercially available application from Netscape that handles payment card transaction processing, event logging, and settlement. The LivePayment Server  will be customized to handle E-Metro payment card transactions. Anytime a transaction by an E-Broker involves the transfer of money or value, the E-Broker sends the information to the Interaction Processor , and the Interaction Processor  forwards the data to the customized LivePayment Server . Additionally, when the customized LivePayment Server  needs to send information to an E-Broker, as for credit card approval notification, the customized LivePayment Server  sends the data to the Interaction Processor , and the customized LivePayment Server  forwards the information to the proper E-Broker. Individual E-Brokers and E-PIAs can define their own billing policies, allowing a member or the E-Metro Community administrator to collect fees for the release of information. As an example, the E-Metro Community administrator could set a charge of $1.00 per name and telephone number released, but an individual could add a requirement that they receive $0.25, too. This raises the cost to $1.25 if an E-AutoPIA wants to utilize that user's name and phone number. Since the customized LivePayment Server  is aware of all financial transactions in the E-Metro Community, it can easily create accurate billing and financial summaries.","The Netscape Enterprise Server  is also a part of the Web site E-Metro Community system . This server is a standard commercial offering from Netscape, and when run on a network server allows that network server to be a Web site, communicate over the Internet, and efficiently interact with the Netscape Navigator. The Netscape Navigator, as discussed earlier, operates on a user's personal computer and is a client to the Netscape Enterprise Server .","The standard Netscape Enterprise Server , while providing the basic tools for allowing a network server to be a Web site and gain access to the Internet, must be enhanced to provide the services and tools necessary to support the E-Communities of the preferred embodiment. The Netscape Enterprise Server  can be modified using the Netscape API  (Application Programming Interface). The Netscape API  is a set of commands that can be accessed from any program to perform modified Enterprise Server  functions. In the preferred embodiment, the Netscape API  is used to modify the standard security measures and method for responding to requests, for example.","Now that all the systems and subsystems have been described, a specific example will be used to demonstrate system interaction. For this example, assume that a remote user has created an E-AutoPIA to enter the example E-Metro Community to retrieve information on selected members of the E-Metro Community. Refer to , , , , and  for the following procedure sequence. For convenience, the steps are organized into preliminary steps that will only be done once to initialize the E-Metro Community, and request handling steps that are repeated each time an E-AutoPIA requests E-Metro Community information.","Preliminary Steps:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0119","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["1. An E-Metro Community administrator loads the preferred embodiment on a network server . This administrator employs an E-Metro Community administration tool to install the E-Metro Community. The administrator also creates several E-Brokers for handling tasks such as requests from E-AutoPIAs or transacting financial business. The E-Brokers may be constructed by modifying an existing E-Broker or by writing a new E-Broker process in any programming environment that can be \u201cadapted\u201d with the E-Broker Adaptor mechanism. The administrator additionally defines what services (interactions) to make available to members and creates the screens to present the information to the members. The latter is done with the standard Netscape Enterprise Server  or any other tool that can create Web site pages. The administrator either creates or modifies existing admission forms and places the forms in a forms-object repository . The forms repository  can be on the same network server  as the E-Metro Community, or may be placed on any available remote network server . Finally, the E-Metro Community administrator brings the E-Metro Community on-line and begins announcing the presence of a new E-Metro Community. The E-Metro Community is now ready for members.","2. Internet users or members of other E-Communities become aware of the new E-Metro Community and access the E-Metro Community's Web site address to get more information. Using the Netscape Navigator  Browser on their personal computer  they join an E-Metro Community. They can access admission forms and submit the requested information. At this point, the administrator may manually check the admission forms for completeness and minimum E-Metro Community requirements, or more likely, the administrator will have an E-Broker automatically check the form for the minimum requirements and set an in-person appointment with the user if the forms are acceptable. Depending on other requirements set by the E-Metro Community Administrator, the user may then be notified to come down to the E-Metro Community administrator's office or some other trusted authority and present sufficient identification and records to convince the administrator that the user is who they say they are. If E-Metro Community requirements dictate that security measures be maintained, then the user may be issued passwords, a secure-card, or other security mechanism. If all is in order, the user will become a member of the E-Metro Community. If the member has chosen the E-Metro Community to be his\/her Home E-Metro Community, they must input a complete personal and professional profile, including compiling records held by others, such as medical and legal records. When the E-Metro Community is not the member's Home E-Metro Community, only a subset of information needs to be submitted and should be directly derived from the new member's Home E-PIA wherever it may reside. Several other users may also become members of this E-Metro Community.","3. At this point there is a going-concern E-Metro Community with active members. Members can take advantage of E-Metro Community services, communicate with other members, or create an E-AutoPIA that can go out and browse other E-Communities. The member may also define the rules for releasing personal and professional information, including the ability to charge for such release, or even require that the other side release similar information. There is such flexibility because the member creates the rules by writing a program in a language compatible with the E-Metro Community. Forms are available in the forms repository  to assist in the creation of rules, and the E-Metro Community administrator may even provide a default set of rules that simply need to be modified. Also, the E-Metro Community administrator is likely to create a set of minimum rules that will apply to all transactions to assure that an E-AutoPIA meets certain minimum standards and all transactions within the E-Metro Community are conducted in a proper manner. These minimum rules that apply to everyone can be called the E-Metro Community rules.\n\nRequest Handling:\n","4. Suppose that at this point an E-AutoPIA arrives at the FTP server  from another E-Metro Community. The server places the message in the Message Queue  and subsequently the Receiver dispatcher  recognizes that a message was received. The receiver dispatcher  notifies the interaction processor  that an E-AutoPIA message is waiting in the message queue  and retrieves the message containing the E-AutoPIA, but does not erase the original copy from the message queue . The Interaction Processor will retrieve the message from the receiver dispatcher and unbundle the E-AutoPIA from the message. The interaction processor  then starts an E-Broker process to handle the interaction requested by the E-AutoPIA. Since the E-AutoPIA is encrypted, the E-AutoPIA must be decrypted using the public key of the source DORMS server and private key for the local DORMS server. If the E-AutoPIA was intended for this E-Metro Community, it will properly decipher. Each E-AutoPIA also contains a Certificate to assure that the owner of the E-AutoPIA actually initiated the sending of the E-AutoPIA, which was discussed in an earlier section."]}},"While the E-AutoPIA is present in the E-Metro Community, the E-Broker places it in the virtual image  for easy access. The E-Broker then collects the rules from the E-AutoPIA, and using the virtual interpreter  and the rules processor  checks the rules against the E-Metro Community rules to see if this E-AutoPIA should be allowed to interact with members. If not, the E-Broker will send the E-AutoPIA to the sender dispatcher , and the sender dispatcher  will send the E-AutoPIA back to its Home E-Metro Community. However, if the E-AutoPIA satisfies the E-Metro Community rules, the E-AutoPIA will be allowed to interact with member E-PIAs. Additionally, the E-AutoPIA may be holding E-PIA data that is intended to be E Communicated or shared. If so, the transitive privilege rules of each E-PIA is checked in a similar manner, assuring that the E-PIA will only be shared if the transitive privilege rules taken from the original E-PIA are met.\n\n","Now that the interactions of all processes and objects in the preferred embodiment are understood, it is important to describe a specific and important example of an implementation of a type of E-Metro Community known as the \u201cE-Bazaar.\u201d The focus of the example is the E-Broker implementation because it is an E-Broker that contains all of the machinery and maintains the behavior of an E-Metro Community. This E-Bazaar E-Broker maintains unique properties that are original to the extent that they are included in the claims of the invention.","E-Broker Example: The E-Bazaar","The E-Bazaar is a type of E-Metro Community that offers three useful commercial scenarios or case studies. While serving as an example E-Broker, the E-Bazaar E-Broker is also very complex. The three case studies are general privacy enabled commerce, semi real-time auction, and large quantity sales. In all three cases, the salient objects are E-PIAs acting as sellers, E-PIAs acting as buyers, and an E-Broker. Note that an E-PIA may also be an E-AutoPIA in this context. The E-Broker handles various public services and Interactions directly on behalf of the E-Bazaar, as well as mediate the Interactions between E-PIAs. An important purpose of the E-Broker is to validate that commercially interacting parties satisfy each others privilege rules for interacting. In the context of this document, the term trade shall be used to refer to a generic notion of either \u201cbuy\u201d or \u201csell.\u201d Additionally, the term advertiser shall be used to refer to someone who publicizes a desire to trade. The term shopper shall be used to refer to someone who browses advertisements and who may eventually place an order to trade.","The privacy enabled commerce case provides a means for both buyers and sellers to:","advertise a desire to trade","actively place an order for a trade","fulfill an order for a trade.","When the trading interaction occurs, it is guaranteed to be performed securely and in privacy between buyer and seller according to all the privilege rules configured by both parties. The actual trade activity is what is privacy enabled.","The semi real-time auction case is the same as the privacy enabled commerce case except that a seller or buyer has decided to advertise an electronic auction. In this case, the goods or services are typically advertised along with the current bid so other potential bidders know what to beat. However, auctions may be performed with secret bid.","The large quantity of sales case is also the same as the privacy enabled commerce case except that a seller or buyer has decided that it won't trade unless it can trade a certain quantity of goods or services. Therefore, a placed order may not be fulfilled immediately.","It will be shown that the E-Bazaar is able to perform each of these three case studies with the identical framework in the invention, the subject of a later discussion. It will be shown that the primary distinguishing feature between each scenario is the manner in which an order for buying or selling is fulfilled.","E Bazaar Activity Model","An overview of E-Bazaar activities is best described by presenting the activities lifecycle of an E-Bazaar when employed in E-PIA Online Interaction mode. An enumeration of the Online mode activities in the lifecycle are listed below. Refer to .\n\n","For E-AutoPIA Batch Interaction mode, the activities are identical except that the sequence of Interaction activities would be performed according to the E-AutoPIA's Itinerary.","For an E-AutoPIA advertiser, the E-AutoPIA would submit product information to the E-Bazaar E-Broker as part of its Itinerary and typically proceed to another E-Metro Community. However, for an E-AutoPIA shopper, the Interaction sequence in the E-Bazaar would typically be quite different. Since E-AutoPIAs tend to automate Interactions, it would be most likely that it already has a copy of order forms it needs. It just needs to submit filled in order forms. Thus, the E-AutoPIA would avoid browsing and a request for an order form and simply place orders. For asynchronous fulfillment orders, the E-AutoPIA can check on status in its Itinerary later, or the person representing the E-AutoPIA can wait for Internet e-mail.","E-Bazaar E-Broker Administration Tool","The E-Bazaar Administration Tool primarily provides the following \u201cbirth\u201d features:","1. The E-Bazaar Administration Tool is used to deploy an empty E-Metro Community representing the E-Bazaar in a WebServer containing the preferred embodiment.","2. The E-Bazaar Administration Tool is used to configure the empty E-Bazaar.","The E-Bazaar Administration Tool assists an Administrator in getting an E-Bazaar ready for commerce. The primary task is to decide on which attributes are the most important for all goods and services that will be traded in the E-Bazaar. Such attributes are known as the E-Bazaar's public attributes. For example, some attributes such as brand (advertiser E-PIA name) and price are always of interest. The E-Bazaar Administration Tool will suggest always including these attributes. Other attributes may only be interesting to a particular kind of E-Bazaar. For example, an E-Bazaar that deals exclusively with wine bottles would typically include year as a public attribute. However, if the E-Bazaar deals with many different products where year is not appropriate for all of the products, then a wine product in the same E-Bazaar would have to employ a private attribute assigned only to the wine product. Note that all attributes may be associated with any rule expression governing type restrictions or other general restrictions such as value ranges.","The E-Bazaar may also assist in configuring the product list before commerce commences. Products are organized by category and type. A category represents a group of products that have similarities. For example, in a \u201cMilk\u201d category one might find product types such as quarter gallons of milk, half gallons of milk, gallons of milk, as well as possibly cream or even cheeses. In this example, the milk, cream, and cheeses are product types within the product category. Finally, each product has its own productId, a number assigned by the E-Bazaar Administration Tool. An InteractProtocol exists on the E-Bazaar E-Broker so that products may be added at runtime.","E-Bazaar E-Broker Subsystem Architecture","As mentioned earlier, an E-Broker  executable may be any subsystem which can execute in the preferred embodiment. In the E-Bazaar E-Broker case, the executable is very complex consisting of databases, files, and dynamically changing subsystems depending on the E-PIA being interacted with. In the actual implementation, the subsystems may be an EXE which invokes several DLLs, a Java Application, or any other alternative which maintains the suggested subsystem architecture presented below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0140","num":"0153"},"figref":"FIG. 34"},"As shown in , the architecture of the E-Bazaar executable is such that there is an E-Bazaar Community Info Encrypted File , a Commercial Activity Dispatcher , a TrustedToken Processor , a \u201cPublic Product Database\u201d , and other \u201cRunnables\u201d (contained in the Advertiser Directory ) for each Advertiser where each Advertiser has its own OrderProcessors , ProductInfos , and OrderForms  which it maintains to trade its products. Finally, each Advertiser will need to maintain its own \u201cPrivate Activities Database\u201d .","The E-Bazaar Community Info file  contains information to manage various aspects of the E-Bazaar. During actual development, this file may be found to be a convenient place to store additional information.","The Commercial Activity Dispatcher  is the main subsystem of the E-Bazaar. It handles all incoming Interaction requests, which involves processing and controlling the flow of information from and to all subsystems, files, and databases as necessary. More specifically, it processes many of the requested Interactions with the E-Bazaar E-Broker  proper, and it is also responsible for invoking the necessary E-Broker Service APIs  for specific E-PIA Interaction determination.","The TrustedToken Processor  remembers public keys of E-PIA visitors, issues TrustedTokens, and validates TrustedTokens presented by those E-PIAs attempting to do business.","The Public Product Database  primarily consists of one Table with one Record per product which has been submitted to be publicized. The columns of the table correspond to the public attributes that have been configured by the E-Bazaar Administration Tool for all products in the E-Bazaar. Meanwhile, there is a BLOb column in the table containing a Dictionary of each product's private attributes. The Table of Products is meant to be browsed and queried.","The three special Runnables are stored in a root file directory called the Advertiser Directory. The Advertiser Directory  then has one subdirectory for each Advertiser. When one of the three is needed, the Advertiser is known so that the Commercial Activity Dispatcher  knows which subdirectory to obtain the needed Runnable. The E-Broker  itself has its own subdirectory as well.","The Private Activities Database  provides the means for an Advertiser to store pending orders if it needs to, store its inventories, or whatever other information it needs to maintain in order to carry out commerce in the E-Bazaar. It should be possible to maintain such private activity databases wherever the Advertiser desires. This just means that the OrderProcessor  will need to access information external to the WebServer where the E-Bazaar is running. Such external information should be able to reside in an external Database Server or even a mainframe. In either case, it should be possible for the external database to reside locally or remotely as needed.","The E-Bazaar should be provided with a variety of simple OrderProcessors , as well as ProductInfo  and OrderForm  templates so that an Advertiser may quickly and easily become an advertising participant in an E-Bazaar. With the simple OrderProcessors, a simple database may also be configured to reside in the WebServer or even tables within the same database as the Public Product Database  (as long as the database provides per table security).","E-Bazaar E-Broker InteractProtocols","When the E-PIA Internet Client communicates with the DORMS Server via HTTP, the requests get converted into Interaction requests submitted to an E-Metro Community E-Broker. In this section, the available Interactions that can be requested are presented in detail. This complete list and description of E-Bazaar Interactions intends to provide a full understanding of all the possible and important activities that can take place in a fully functioning E-Bazaar E-Metro Community.","As is obvious from the discussion thus far, the E-Bazaar E-Broker is the heart of a running E-Bazaar E-Metro Community.

The private attributes are returned in the Dictionary aListOfPrivateAttributes.","getProductTradeForm(in String aProductId, out Runnable anOrderForm)\u2014Obtain a Runnable anOrderForm representing the OrderForm of the product with productId aProductId.","putProductTradeOrder(in Dictionary aFilledOrderForm, out String anOrderNumber, out Boolean fulfilled, out String aStatus)\u2014Place an order with the Dictionary aFilledOrderForm. A String anOrderNumber is returned representing a unique order number for the order placed.

Also returned is a general status string indicating any other fulfillment information.","cancelProductTradeOrder(in String anOrderNumber, out String aStatus)\u2014The order anOrderNumber which has currently not been fulfilled is canceled so that it will never be fulfilled. aStatus is returned indicating any other cancel information.","getProductTradeOrderStatus(in String anOrderNumber, out Boolean fulfilled, out String aStatus)\u2014The order anOrderNumber is submitted to obtain current status information about the order. If fulfilled is TRUE, then the order has been fulfilled already, else it has not been fulfilled yet. aStatus is a String containing further status information.","getOrderHistory(in Query aQuery, out OrderedCollection aListOfOrderRecords)\u2014Obtain all of the OrderRecords for Orders for products from an E-PIA which satisfy the SELECT in aQuery. The OrderRecords are returned in the OrderedCollection aListOfOrderRecords. A useful example using the Query is to employ the expression \u201cfulfilled==TRUE\u201d to obtain only those OrderRecords which correspond to actual trades performed.","Commercial Scenarios Using the E-Bazaar Framework","As presented, any E-PIA can participate as an advertiser in an E-Bazaar by providing its own implementations of OrderProcessor, ProductInfo, and OrderForm Runnables. This framework allows an advertising E-PIA to maintain a very general capability for performing its necessary commerce. Additionally, the framework provides the means for efficient trading scenarios not possible without an electronic commerce system and which is not possible without special attention to privacy, security, and privilege which the invention provides so well. Additionally, E-PIAs and E-AutoPIAs may also participate as shoppers using this unified framework and receive the same benefits of efficiency, privacy, security, and privilege. Efficiency in this context applies to the effort in connecting with trading partners as well as the efficiency in the cost to do business.","As mentioned at the start of the E-Bazaar discussions, the primary distinction between the three case studies is their implementation of the OrderProcessor. This single distinction was intentional so that a single E-Bazaar Framework could successfully implement all three cases. The three cases that the E-Bazaar can handle are now discussed below.","The \u201cPrivacy Enabled Commerce\u201d scenario allows for any desired commerce to take place securely and privately. The model for ordering and fulfilling orders is meant to be general. Thus, there is really nothing to expound on since the framework itself is able to accomplish this case due to its intended generality. The Semi Real-time Auction and Large Quantity Sales cases are, therefore, members of the \u201cPrivacy Enabled Commerce\u201d case due to this generality. Note that Internet E mail may be a useful tool for notifying shoppers of asynchronously fulfilled orders.","The \u201cSemi Real-time Auction\u201d case requires certain processing and functionality in the ProductInfo as well as the OrderProcessor Runnables. The ProductInfo Runnable should not only advertise product information as is done normally, but should also display the current bid and any other real-time parameters of the auction that are deemed necessary to present to a shopper.","The processing of Orders is interesting because most will be canceled eventually. However, totally adhoc order fulfillment is possible if the OrderProcessor is coded to allow it. For example, it could allow the auctioneer to examine the Order history. The auctioneer could decide at any time to extend the time of the auction, cut it short, fulfill the non-highest bid (order), fulfill multiple bids (order), or cancel all bids (orders). The behavior of the auction is governed by the OrderProcessor.","Internet E mail will be very useful in Semi Real-time Auctions. For example, orders may be placed with a request to be notified of important bid updates in the future may be requested. However, it should be possible to build a Semi Real-time auction system which allows Online E-PIA clients to realize periodic updates from the E-Bazaar periodically.","The \u201cLarge Quantity of Sales\u201d case mostly requires certain processing in the OrderProcessor Runnable. All orders for a product will typically maintain a \u201cpending\u201d unfulfilled status. At some point in time, however, the aggregate order quantity for a certain product exceeds its predetermined threshold for invoking order fulfillment. However, a real OrderProcessor for the Large Quantity Sales case must allow premature fulfillment in the scenario where it is taking too long for a certain quantity of orders to come in. Premature cancellation of all or some orders should also be possible.","It may also be desirable to allow real-time price adjustments. In this case, an Advertiser may find it desirable to maintain a hybrid of an auction along with a large quantity of sales scenario. The Advertiser who finds that he can trade product for less because there are enough Orders and still make sufficient profit, should be able to go ahead and invoke order fulfillment rather than wait and possibly be left with a large unwanted expensive inventory.","Some Advertisers may desire to display real-time information in the ProductInfo Runnable such as the current quantity ordered and the total quantity desired.","E mail can be used for notification of sudden changes in order status, just as in the other commercial scenarios.","Specific Objects","Since the preferred embodiment is designed to be implemented with an object-oriented programming language, we now turn to the design of the individual objects.","Before continuing with each of the objects in the preferred embodiment, the fundamental object classes that make up the preferred embodiment objects that will be presented are listed below. Most of these object classes are commonplace in fundamental object oriented frameworks and should be familiar to those skilled in the art of object orientation.

The user view of the E-Metro World is achieved primarily through a Netscape Browser, and from that application, the view is that of many E-Communities all connected to each other via the Internet as shown in . Ultimately, the user does not care where the E-Communities are physically located, only that they serve as a logical place for interaction with other E-PIA's with similar interests.","As a facility for building up one's information asset structures, E-Metro Forms Repositories are also available. Forms can be retrieved using the E-Metro Client authoring facility and incorporated into existing or new E-PIA's to add information according to a useful reusable structure. A user may then store his E-PIA into one or more E-Communities.","System Architecture Overview","E-Metro World Machine Configuration","In reality, each E-Community resides on an E-Metro Web site Server. As depicted in , more than one E-Community may reside on one such Server. Furthermore, E-Communities residing in a single Server may be configured to maintain a hierarchical relationship to one another.","Two E-Being\u2014Forms Repositories  are depicted in . As indicated by the text in , one E-Being\u2014Forms Repository is implemented by an FTP site, while another is implemented by a Mail Server System. It is even possible that no Forms Repository exists and that the Forms are simply managed as local files.","E-Metro World System Processes Architecture","The Client and Server Processes in an E-Metro World are shown in . The client workstation consists of the Netscape browser and E-Metro specific DLLs, JAVA scripts, or some other client code of similar nature meant to facilitate various E-Metro client activities. FTP Servers are well known staples on the internet while the Netscape Server System is discussed in Netscape's Server documentation. The focus of this document is the shaded E-Metro Trusted Server Systems  in . While using E-Metro, the Clients always communicate with an E-Metro Trusted Server. At authoring time, InteractProtocols and InteractInstructions may only be obtained from the correct E-Brokers (Actually, the Forms for InteractProtocols and InteractInstructions may be obtained from Form Repositories if set up to do so, but the required TrustedTokens for these activities may only be obtained from the E-Brokers). At runtime, E-Metro Clients query a user's Home E-PIA at the E-Community, and therefore E-Metro Server, where it resides to see the latest results or status of associated E-AutoPIA's. E-Metro Server Systems actually consist of many processes which will be discussed in the next section.","E-Metro Security Architecture","E-Metro emphasizes security of information assets and trusted interactions. E-Metro guarantees that all information put into the E-Metro World System will be secure and that only those who are trusted to have access to specific information will. The reader is referred to  for a depiction of when and where encrypted transmissions occur in what is essentially the \u201cpublic\u201d interlinks of the E-Metro World System. All of the necessary cryptographic security is handled by Netscape's SSL communication layer. To maintain the level of security described, the following system attributes are maintained:","1) Each E-Metro Trusted Server Subsystem at a Web site consists of secure processes that nobody can get access to while they are running. It is assumed that an ordinary person skilled in the art of process security on a single machine can achieve this runtime integrity.","2) Each E-Metro Trusted Server Subsystem maintains its own private key and public key. The public key of a specific E-Metro Trusted Server Subsystem is known by all other E-Metro Trusted Server Subsystems via the DirectoryService E-Broker.","3) All E-PIAs and E-AutoPIAs are encrypted when transmitted between E-Metro Trusted Server System Web sites. Encryption is performed with both the public key of the E-Metro Trusted Server Subsystem that is the destination of the transmission as well as the private key of the source of the transmission. This double encryption accomplishes a double guarantee:\n\n","4) All interactions between E-PIAs and E-AutoPIAs are performed in private on a single machine within an E-Metro Trusted Server System.","5) When a client requests information contained in its Home E-PIA, the E-Metro Trusted Server Subsystem maintaining the Home E-PIA encrypts the information for the transmission with the Home E-PIA client's public key so that only the receiving client will be able to decrypt the information. When writing information to the Home E-PIA, the information is encrypted with the destination E-Metro Trusted Server Subsystem's public key so only that the correct destination will be able to decrypt the information. Writing information also includes E-AutoPIA and associated itinerary authoring. See .","6) When a client is obtaining authoring information from an E-Broker, the authoring information is encrypted with the client's public key, again so that only the client knows how to decrypt the information. This encryption is important mostly for the transmission of TrustedTokens during authoring which must immediately be encrypted via the client's private key upon reception.","Metro Trusted Server System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0228","num":"0243"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},"DORMS Server","As mentioned, the DORMS Server is the heart of the E-Metro system architecture. It essentially governs the trusted storage and brokering of all E-Metro objects and resources with the assistance of the smaller grained objects, namely E-Communities and E-Brokers, that it internally manages. More specifically, the DORMS Server performs the following:\n\n","Netscape Commerce Server","The Netscape Commerce Server is the core subsystem enabling an E-Metro Server to be a Web site and interact over the Internet. Since it uses the open Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, it provides full Internet security. SSL provides encryption, server authentication, and message integrity using technology from RSA Data Security. When the client makes a request, it always communicates with the Netscape Commerce Server initially. In turn, the Netscape Commerce Server will cooperate with the DORMS Server via the Netscape Server API. This communication with an E-Metro Server via the Netscape Commerce Server is what allows the client subsystem to consist primarily of an HTTP\/HTML compliant World Wide Web Browser such as Netscape Navigator. The details of this cooperation are described in the next section.","Netscape Transaction Server","As noted in , the Netscape Transaction Server handles credit card processing, transaction logging, and billing management. The DORMS Server interacts with the credit card processing function when a person wishes to begin using E-Metro services for the first time, or add new capabilities to their E-PIA. The charges for initial or new capabilities are processed automatically by the credit card function of the Transaction Server. The DORMS Server also interacts with the transaction logging function to track what is going on at an E-Metro site and may employ the billing management function as well. It is assumed that an ordinary person skilled in the art of computer programming can easily follow the necessary Netscape manuals to configure the cooperation between the DORMS Server and Transaction Server.","An important E-Metro feature is that individual E-Brokers and E-PIA's can configure their own billing policies. E-Brokers can require the entry of credit card information in order that it submit a required TrustedToken for an InteractProtocol or InteractInstruction. E-PIA's may do the same, but realize that E-PIA's can only do so via an E-Broker implementation. Both credit card and billing APIs are available in the E-Broker Service API which E-Broker implementations may call. This will be discussed later.","Netscape Server API (NSAPI)","The NSAPI works closely with the Netscape Commerce Server in order to provide the means for a Web site to have control over the processing when a normal HTTP compatible request comes in to the Commerce Server. In order to do this, Netscape has identified the following steps in the normal response process:\n\n","The NSAPI provides the ability to override the processing that is performed in any or all of these steps. It is assumed that an ordinary person skilled in the art of computer programming can easily follow the necessary NSAPI manuals to enable the required overriding of these steps. In particular, steps 1, 2, 3, and 5 will need specific E-Metro replacements. An overview of the replacement implementations are enumerated below:","For NS1,","The E-Community privilegeRules necessary for the request can be checked; and","The TrustedToken necessary for the request can be checked.","For NS2,","Paths may refer to hierarchically located E-Brokers or E-Communities. The path submitted is munged by leaving only the relative path corresponding to the E-Broker or E-Community assuming the site portion of the path is correct.","For NS3, the E-Broker or E-Community is checked to see if it exists. For NS5, the requested DORMS service is performed. There are several types of requests which are:","1) Client requests to browse the DORM Directory","2) Client requests authoring time information from an E-Broker.","3) Client requests retrieval of owned E-PIA information assets.","4) Client requests to store E-PIA information assets after assets were updated on Client.","5) Client requests to launch an E-AutoPIA.","Note that E-AutoPIA's do not utilize this entrypoint because E-AutoPIA activities are not a Client driven process.","FTP Server and FTP Client","As will be introduced later in the architecture, E-Metro requires a reliable Messaging Subsystem for transporting the E-AutoPIA's from E-Community to E-Community. Since Internet E Mail is not reliable, FTP Servers and FTP Clients are used to implement the transport. E-AutoPIA's are marshalled into a BLOb and transported to remote sites via a file. The file is then uploaded via initiation of an E-Metro Server's FTP Client to another E-Metro Server's FTP Server. The later section describes the details of the use of FTP for the Messaging Subsystem machinery.","Distributed Object Resource Management System (DORMS) Server",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0250","num":"0279"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},"Interaction Processor","As mentioned, the Interaction Processor is the focal point of the DORMS Server and it satisfies all requests via an E-Broker. When the Messaging Subsystem submits an E-AutoPIA to the DORMS, it is actually submitting it to the Interaction Processor which is the driving body of code for the whole DORMS Server. When the Messaging Subsystem does this, it assumed that it also has unmarshalled the E-AutoPIA BLOb so that the E-AutoPIA is in a suitable form for the rest of its processing. As enumerated in Tables 1 and 2 below, there is much processing to be done for a client request as well as for a visiting E-AutoPIA. The service requests that the Interaction Processor handles are all the Client requests listed below, as well as the InteractInstructions of incoming E-AutoPIA's. The complete list of requests serviced by the Interaction Processor and an overview of how they are handled is enumerated below.\n\n","When the Interaction Processor performs any of these services, it employs the assistance of all of the other subsystems pictured in . When a Client request arrives, the Interaction Processor performs the steps listed in Table 1. Similarly, the steps listed in Table 2 are the actions invoked by the Interaction Processor when an E-AutoPIA arrives with a request. These two tables are invaluable resources for understanding the operations of the DORMS Server. However, a complete understanding of what happens may only be obtained by reading the rest of the section which describe more details of each step and more details about the assisting subsystem which performs the step.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0254","num":"0291"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00015","num":"00015"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"A request from the Client application -- the"},{"entry":"Interaction Processor's steps and use of intra-DORMS"},{"entry":"subsystems."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Subsystem Used","Action"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1","Netscape Commerce Server","Receives service request.

It checks privilegeRules, and additionally, the Rule Processor also handles conversions to SQL statements to aid in E-PIA selection.","Validation of privilegeRules requires a fairly complex procedure. In the case of E-AutoPIA's, the privilegeRules can refer to \u201cmyself\u201d and \u201cyourself.\u201d Each privilegeRules is a Set of Rule objects. Each Rule object must initially be broken into subexpressions which include \u201cmyself\u201d references only. These \u201cmyself only\u201d subexpressions may be immediately be reduced to TRUE's or FALSE's by executing the Virtual Interpreter on the E-AutoPIA which is the current context.","The remaining \u201cyourself\u201d subexpressions are combined with the results to form a reduced expression. This remaining reduced expression is then parsed and transformed into a SQL SELECT statement which may have an ORDER BY clause if the Rules language provides this. This SELECT statement is used later to collect the E-PIA's that satisfy all the rules so far evaluated up to this point.","Since each E-PIA has its own privilegeRules for the interaction with the E-AutoPIA which is the current context, the collected E-PIA's from the above SELECT must be further filtered. This is accomplished by taking each E-PIA one at a time from the collected set and executing their privilegeRules with the E-AutoPIA as \u201cyourself\u201d and the current E-PIA as \u201cmyself.\u201d This execution requires the Virtual Interpreter. Note that this portion of the privilege check may have poor performance since the database SELECT is not employed. It is therefore important to construct specific privilegeRules for E-AutoPIA's so that the collected E-PIA sets are as small as possible.","Virtual Interpreter","The Virtual Interpreter is simply the machinery that gives dynamics to the programming language of E-Metro. The programming language may be any language even a new one, but it is suggested that it have similar features to that of Smalltalk. This programming language is the one that must be used in the privilegeRules and the scripts of the Itineraries.","Virtual Image","The Virtual Image is the place where all E-Metro specific classes and objects which are being processed are kept in RAM. The Virtual Interpreter is what gives dynamics to these objects. As shown in , all E-Communities and E-Brokers are kept in the Virtual Image as a performance technique, although each is persistently stored in the Object Repository.","When an E-AutoPIA or E-PIA is processed, they and all of the objects they own are brought into the Virtual Image. The privilegeRules then employ the Virtual Interpreter to process expressions. A special method on Class EPIA is able to check for the existence of a specific TrustedToken.","E-Broker Objects","Each E-Broker object may represent an executable which is essentially external to the delivered E-Metro software which implements their InteractProtocols in a variety of ways. However, if all that is desired is information sharing between an E-AutoPIA and an E-PIA then the E-Broker requires no external executable. Instead, the Interaction Processor will know only that an exchange of data is to occur if the privilegeRules are obeyed. An E-AutoPIA's InteractInstruction should be authored as though only one E-PIA will be involved in the interaction with the E-AutoPIA. The Interaction Processor will automatically construct Sets of size equal to maximumInteractions for the output parameters.","E-Broker Adaptor and E-Broker Executable","All E-Broker objects are accessed using a unified protocol with the Virtual Interpreter. However, the type of each E-Broker executable is possible different. An E-Broker can be a C or C++EXE, a C or C++ DLL, a Visual Basic program, an OLE  object, a SOM, or other. The procedure required to invoke the implementation of an InteractProtocol or service in each case is possibly different. Therefore, each new type of executable requires an E-Broker Adaptor which transforms the unified protocol invocations into the mechanism required to communicate the necessary signals and information to and from the E-Broker executable.","The Adaptor is always a DLL which is dynamically loaded and which always supports the following APIs (with signatures undetermined):","start( )\u2014called just after Adaptor DLL loads","stop( )\u2014called just before Adaptor DLL is unloaded","execute( )\u2014this is the main entrypoint to execute an InteractInstruction. The name of the InteractProtocol must be passed in along with a linked list of all the parameters. The implementation of execute( ) is important because it must contain the code that binds the InteractProtocol name somehow to the executable code body representing the InteractProtocol's implementation. Execute then invokes the executable code body.","E-Broker Service API","As mentioned the E-Broker executable may be any of the executable types mentioned above. In order to facilitate the writing of code to perform the service\/InteractProtocol that the E-Broker developer is trying to achieve, APIs are supplied. The executable must be capable of calling C procedures from a C DLL to perform these procedures.","Some of the identified useful procedures (with signatures undetermined) are:","collectTrustedEPIAs( )\u2014This API is the only one that must be called by each E-Broker executable. It is the only way for the executable to get a hold of the \u201cprivilege compliant\u201d collection of E-PIA's. This API takes as input, additional Rules to be applied for the collecting of E-PIA's. The Rules Processor is employed to combine the input Rules with the SQL statement formed prior to entry into the E-Broker. This produces the final SQL SELECT statement to be employed. The SELECT statement is performed to obtain the collection of E-PIA's that satisfy the SELECT. The collection is not returned yet, however, until the individual privilegeRules of the E-PIA's in the collection are checked by executing the Rules Processor.","Once the entirely \u201cprivilege compliant\u201d collection is returned, the E-Broker executable may do whatever it wants with them before returning from the interaction. Note that in the case of small maximumInteractions values for an InteractInstruction, \u201corder by\u201d rules may be very important.","processCreditCard( )\u2014interacts with the Transaction Server after obtaining credit card information for a purchase of something.","billActivity( )\u2014interacts with the Transaction Server to bill an E-AutoPIA based on an activity name.","validateWithSecureCard( )\u2014requires a specific Electronic Secure Card to be entered into a card reader in order to return TRUE. The specific Secure Card is identified by information and Rules supplied as parameters to this API.","Meta E-Brokers","Since some of the E-Metro System proper is implemented by E-Brokers, these special E-Brokers are known as \u201cMeta\u201d E-Brokers. So far, only two have been identified. More may be needed.","Home E-Broker","This E-Broker primarily needs to validate that the user editing or browsing information assets of a specific Home E-PIA is in fact the person who owns it. While this special E-Broker needs to be present in perhaps many E-Communities, its implementation may be overridden. For example, a one \u201cHome\u201d E-Broker implementation may provide strict security such that a Secure Card is absolutely required. Other \u201cHome\u201d E-Brokers may only require a password. A very loose E-Community may have no security.","DirectoryService E-Broker","This E-Broker attempts to maintain up to date knowledge of the entire E-Metro World. Only one DirectoryService E-Broker is needed per E-Community which is the top level parent at a site. Specifically, it keeps track of the public key of each online E-Metro Trusted Server Subsystem, of all E-Communities and the Internet addresses they are located at, as well as which E-Brokers reside in them and the names of the InteractProtocols each E-Broker owns. The Directory information must persist so it is stored in the Object Repository.","To keep the Directory Information up to date, every DirectoryService E-Broker periodically checks to see if there were any E-Community or E-Broker assignment changes. If there was, the DirectoryService E-Broker launches an E-AutoPIA with an Itinerary to visit each and every other DirectoryService E-Broker to notify them of the changes. The frequency of the period may be something like once per day since such changes are probably fairly infrequent. Note that a new E-Metro Site must obtain a copy of the entire current E-Metro directory upon installation.","Itinerary Interpreter","The Itinerary Interpreter understands that an Itinerary comes in one of two forms. Either the Itinerary has scripts or has no scripts. In either case, the Itinerary must have at least one InteractInstruction in the instructions OrderedCollection. In the case of no scripts, the instructions OrderedCollection is simply executed sequentially. In the case of scripts present, the InteractInstructions don't have to actually have parameters filled in because the script performs the call with parameters. In this case, the OrderedCollection of InteractInstructions merely represents the InteractInstructions that can be called from the scripts. There is no reason to have duplicate InteractInstructions for the scripts present case.","For the no scripts case, the Itinerary Interpreter merely increments an instructionPointer in the E-AutoPIA to keep track of which InteractInstruction in the Itinerary is the current one. When scripts are present, the Itinerary Interpreter must be able to compile and execute scripts. It achieves this only by employing the Virtual Interpreter. Each script is like a Smalltalk method in which the programming language may be employed to perform any general processing. The variables referenced in the scripts bind to the named information within the E-AutoPIA. At any time within a script, an InteractInstruction or even an entire Itinerary may be called by referring to the special variable \u201cInstructions.\u201d The syntax for calling an InteractInstruction would be \u201cInstructions at: aProtocolName performWith: aDictionaryOfParameters.\u201d In this example, aProtocolName is the name of the InteractProtocol to perform, while aDictionaryOfParameters is a Dictionary keyed on parameter name and valued on the values of the parameters.","Object Repository","The Object Repository is primarily meant to be the place where E-PIA's are maintained persistently. However, E-Communities and E-Brokers are stored there as well.","The Object Repository employs a simple object oriented interface over a relational database implementation (e.g. Oracle). The features of the simple object to relational table row design are as follows:\n\n","An Object Repository is installed for each top level E-Community residing in an E-Metro Server. The database schema includes only three tables, one for E-Communities, one for E-Brokers, and one for the E-PIA's. The PersistentMultKeyedCollection schemas for E-Communities, E-Brokers, and E-PIA's are shown in , , and , respectively.","In each of the three tables, the CollectionOID refers to a different grouping concept. In the E-Community table, the ParentOID is a CollectionOID which treats a parent E-Community as a Collection of its children E-Communities. In the E-Broker and E-PIA tables, the ECommunityOIDs is the CollectionOID. The keys have been intentionally unidentified. This is because these keys should be determined by the needs of the E-Community and should be configurable via the E-Community Administration Tool.","It is important to note how access with hierarchical E-Communities is achieved. Suppose a query needs to allow any E-PIA that is a member of an E-Community or any of its children E-Communities to be in a result. First, the OIDs referring to all of the hierarchically reachable E-Communities must be discovered before the query and collected. The SELECT query then can be constructed with a bunch of ORed \u201cCollectionOID==X\u201d expressions.","Remember that most of the E-Community and E-Broker only processing is intended to be done directly in RAM in the Virtual Image. Only E-PIA's will be accessed in the Object Repository regularly.","Messaging Subsystem","As far as the Interaction Processor is concerned, the Messaging Subsystem is solely a source and sink of E-AutoPIA's which will request brokered services. When the service for an E-AutoPIA is complete, the Interaction Processor submits the E-AutoPIA to the Itinerary Interpreter. The Itinerary Interpreter interprets the current script as far as can until it gets to the very next InteractInstruction invocation. This will be immediate if there are no scripts and only a linear Itinerary of InteractInstructions. When the Itinerary Interpreter is finished, the Interaction Processor gets the E-AutoPIA back. The DirectoryService E-Broker is then conferred to see which site the E-AutoPIA needs to go to next. The Interaction Processor then submits the E-AutoPIA back to the Messaging Subsystem so it can be transported to its next destination. The details of the Messaging Subsystem are presented in the next section.","Messaging Subsystem","The Messaging Subsystem is employed exclusively for transporting E-AutoPIA's from one remote E-Community to another reliably. The messaging machinery pictured in  is fairly simple. The Messaging Subsystem primarily relies on E-AutoPIA's arriving and being sent out of the Message Queue with the assistance of the external FTP Client and FTP Server. The E-AutoPIA Dispatchers are the primary interfacers to the DORMS Server. Note, however, that FTP is not required as the Messaging Subsystem implementation. Rather, any reliable means for sending information can be employed. Each of these subsystems are described in detail below.","E-AutoPIA Sender Dispatcher","When an E-AutoPIA is being sent to a remote E-Community, its FTP Internet address will have already been looked up by the Interaction Processor. Note that there is one FTP Internet address per top level E-Community. The Interaction Processor calls the E-AutoPIA Sender Dispatcher by handing off the E-AutoPIA to be sent along with this address.","The E-AutoPIA Sender Dispatcher puts the E-AutoPIA into an outgoing MessageQueue and then invokes the FTP Client to send the E-AutoPIA to its destination. If for any reason the FTP Client cannot send the E-AutoPIA right away, the FTP Client will read the entries in the outgoing Message Queue later and attempt to send the outgoing E-AutoPIA's then.","Message Queue","The Message Queue is really just an FTP file system. There is a single outgoing Message Queue and one incoming MessageQueue which can be two distinct FTP file directories.","E-AutoPIA Receiver Dispatcher","When the E-AutoPIA Receiver Dispatcher observes an arrived E-AutoPIA in the incoming Message Queue, it unmarshals the E-AutoPIA from its file format and then immediately calls up a new Interaction Processor server process to handle it. The E-AutoPIA file in the incoming Message Queue is not deleted until the E-AutoPIA is submitted to the outgoing Message Queue. This is required for recovery in case the DORMS Server crashes. Since only so many such server processes may be running simultaneously, a backlog of E-AutoPIA can build up in the incoming Message Queue. If the incoming Message Queue becomes empty, the E-AutoPIA Receiver Dispatcher may go to sleep and wake up periodically to check if anything has arrived. If there is a way for the FTP Server process to signal the E-AutoPIA Receiver Dispatcher, then the sleeping process can be asynchronously awakened on an as needed basis.","FTP Client","The FTP Client process really needs to perform a few more tasks than what a vanilla FTP Client does. It must delete the E-AutoPIA file in an outgoing Message Queue once it has successfully transferred the E-AutoPIA file to its next destination. Again, FTP is employed for transport since it is reliable. If errors occur during transmission, the FTP Client will know about it because transmission is directly point to point. The FTP Client will know that it must keep the failed E-AutoPIA in the outgoing Message Queue and try the transmission again later.","FTP Server","The FTP Server does not need to do anything special. It just stores incoming E-AutoPIA file transfers to the requested FTP directory. As mentioned the FTP directory designated represents the incoming Message Queue for one of the top level E-Communities at the local E-Metro Site.","Object Model Overview","This section describes the object model of a cyber-community based personal and private information protection and brokerage system called \u201cE-Metro.\u201d The object model focuses on the user's view of objects in E-Metro. This object model provides a detailed description of how objects behave and how they relate to each other at the user level. In some cases the objects and classes at the user level will not map to an object or class in the target programming language. However, the transition from OOA objects to OOD objects is, for the most part, very smooth. The object oriented Booch notation is employed in the diagrams of this document as a means to communicate relationships of objects visually.  depicts the basic notational symbols used and their meaning. The \u201cuses for implementation\u201d symbol is largely used for instance variables to denote that a Class needs the object in its implementation.","Foundation Objects","At the highest level of description of the E-Metro object model, there are E-Beings, E-Communities, and E-Brokers. An E-Being is the cyber-being concept mentioned previously. This is like a virtual person since it is supposed to \u201cbe\u201d the person it represents, but in cyberspace. E-Beings reside in E-Communities in order to keep their information assets secure. Meanwhile, E-Brokers are the actual mediators of all E-Being interactivity in order to maintain the security provided by the E-Community as well as any designated personal (E-Being specific) security measures.","An E-Community is a cyber-community which is secure and trusted. An E-Community guarantees security in that only E-Beings with the proper E-Community privileges may enter or reside there. Security is also maintained within an E-Community in that the information assets of the E-Beings residing in it are only shared with those that have the proper personal privileges. An E-Community is trusted in that it guarantees that its contained E-Beings and visiting E-Beings will interact according to the rules that each E-Being has established, thus maintaining \u201ctrusted only\u201d interactivity.","There exists at least one E-Broker per E-Community whose purpose it is to actually mediate privileged information sharing and interaction. In fact, both E-Being information sharing and interaction may only occur via an E-Broker.","E-Beings as Personal Information Agents","There are two primary subclasses of E-Beings in E-Metro. They are E Personal Information Agents (E-PIA) and E Auto Personal Information Agents (E-AutoPIA). The term \u201cPersonal Information Agent\u201d exemplifies the purpose of the E-Beings in that they manage the electronic information assets of a real person. An E Corporate Information Agent (E CIA) representing a real corporation is also a possible subclass of E-Being that may be useful.","It is the E-PIA that shares its owned information while residing in an E-Community. However, such \u201cpassive\u201d sharing may only occur with a more \u201cactive\u201d E-PIA known as an E-AutoPIA. Only an E-AutoPIA with the proper privileges established by the perused E-PIA may interact with the E-PIA and enjoy the information sharing. An E-Broker  assigned to the E-Community , where the E-PIA  resides, mediates the privileged information sharing as shown in . Note that only an E-AutoPIA  may initiate an activity.","If an E-AutoPIA desires to initiate interactions such as engaging in secured information sharing with other E-PIA's, requesting secured services from other E-PIA's, or performing secured transactions with other PIA's, the E-AutoPIA must visit the proper E-Broker for each specific activity. The list of interactions to be carried out by an E-AutoPIA is known as its Itinerary. As with E-PIA's residing at E-Communities, E-AutoPIA's are secured by an E-Broker and may only interact with other E-PIA's or E-AutoPIA's via an E-Broker. All information sharing and other general forms of interaction always occur via InteractProtocols. While the E-AutoPIA in  is shown visiting several E-Brokers each located at a distinct E-Community, it is possible that multiple E-Brokers are present at a single E-Community and that they are each visited by a single E-AutoPIA depending on its desired activities.","Security and Transitivity of Trust","The reader should note the continual use of the qualifier \u201csecured.\u201d Security is key in E-Metro as the chief means for maintaining the integrity of intended interactions between persons represented by E-PIA's. Strict security is necessary in order to ensure the intended E-PIA Interrelationships and to maintain the confidence of E-Metro users that only those who are meant to see specific information, can.","When an E-PIA gives some of its personal information to another E-PIA, the personal information given is still secured and owned by the original E-PIA. In fact, if the receiving E-PIA, in turn, passes another E-PIA's information on to a third E-PIA, E-Metro still knows the original owner of the personal information and continues to police access to the information according to declared by the original E-PIA. This security paradigm pioneered by E-Metro is known as Transitivity of Trust. Transitivity of Trust means that:","If A trusts B with information A\u2032,","and B trusts C with information A\u2032,","then A trusts C with information A\u2032.","This important concept guarantees to A that its information is never passed on to an entity which it does not trust according to the Transitive Privilege Rules it has declared for the data it has submitted.","It is easy for E-Metro to tell which E-PIA owns the information, because information is always passed as a version of the E-PIA which submitted its information. For example, suppose an E-PIA contains a rich set of information which includes birth date, address, phone number, etc. Further, suppose it wishes to submit only its phone number to another E-PIA during an interaction. The receiving E-PIA will actually receive an E-PIA object which contains only the phone number. More specifically, the E-PIA object received is a version of the original E-PIA which represents how the submitting E-PIA wishes to be perceived by the receiving E-PIA.  depicts the \u201ccollection\u201d of versions of E-PIAs  by a traveling E-PIA . The versions of E-PIA objects is the only manner in which information is maintained by E-PIAs in E-Metro.  also depicts a version of the traveling E-AutoPIA that has been given to a non-traveling E-PIA  in one of the E-Communities.","Subsystem Model","Before presenting the details of object behavior and relationships, it is important to understand the subsystems that various users are aware of while using E-Metro. This section describes the activities of the major client and server subsystems.","Modes of Use","Authoring Time","E-PIA","E-PIA's have only two authorable items: their information assets and their interactProtocols. The assets need to be authored by employing some sort of hierarchical GUI. This GUI must allow for any data to be entered in a field and the field given a name. The GUI must also provide a means to create hierarchical structures by adding a sub-Folder concept. Hopefully, this hierarchical presentation is possible with some aspect of the HTML Form protocol.","InteractProtocols are strictly secured and may only be obtained from one of the E-Brokers residing in the same E-Community of the E-PIA being authored. A person may browse an E-Broker in an E-Community to obtain its protocolDirectory in HTML format. The returned HTML text includes an HTML Form representing the means to request obtaining one or more of the InteractProtocols listed. Actually obtaining a specific protocol may require some validation and\/or paying a fee. When the InteractProtocol is actually obtained, it is stored in the E-PIA. However, the InteractProtocol has privilegeRules and a defaultMap which may be used as is or modified via HTML Forms.","E-AutoPIA","E-AutoPIA's have only to author their itineraries. This is because an E-AutoPIA is always instantiated from an E-PIA. To author an Itinerary, browsing an E-Broker for InteractProtocols is performed in the same manner as with E-PIA's. However, instead of retrieving an InteractProtocol, an InteractInstruction with parameters to fill in is obtained.","Forms Repository","Since the structure of E-PIA information is likely to be reused again and again, the HTML Forms necessary for filling out the information of various E-PIA structures can be stored in shared locations known as Forms or E-Being Repositories. These repositories can be simple FTP sites or possibly even Netscape Server Systems. It is also possible to store the HTML Forms associated with InteractProtocols, InteractInstructions, and Itineraries. However, as will be described later, E-PIA's employing these objects during runtime must have specific TrustedTokens associated with each of these objects in order to actually perform their intended activity.","Runtime","At runtime, a person who owns an E-PIA or E-AutoPIA does not see anything happening because all interactions are processed by E-Metro servers. However, to see progress or the latest results of interactions, an owner may retrieve his information assets and audit trail contained in his E-PIA(s) or E-AutoPIA(s). Note that a person may have multiple E-PIA's but that one is designated to be the Home E-PIA (more will be said about the home E-PIA later). As always, the presentation employs HTML text. In some cases, the state of an E-PIA may indicate that someone is waiting for further action on the owner's part to take place before the waiter can continue.","E-Community Administration Time","The E-Community Administrator needs to maintain, fix, and upgrade E-Brokers in an E-Community. The E-Community Administrator also needs to be able to have privilege to everything within an E-Community's boundaries (i.e. contained E-Communities) in order to make sure everything is running smoothly or find out where problems are. Backup and recovery functions must also be performed.","E-Metro Administration Time","An E-Metro Administrator employed by E-Metro who simply has access to everything does not exist. Each E-Community maintains and administrates its own assets autonomously according to the rules set up by the E-Community. This is a key ownership concept in E-Metro.","Client and Server Subsystems","User Perspective","The user's world consists only of E-Communities and the E-Brokers that belong to them, Forms Repositories, and the Netscape World Wide Web Browser. The user is aware that all of the E-Communities are attached to each other via the Internet and that they can be connected to via an \u201chttp:\/\/www.\u201d address. In the previous section it was mentioned how all of the data in E-Metro is transformed into an HTML format before being presented to the user. This transformation occurs on the server so that only the Netscape Client and an existing HTML conversant Client programming systems (e.g. C++ and NCAPI, or JAVA) are needed on the client workstation. Note that separate E-Communities may or may not actually be located at the same site in reality, but that this physical location consideration is irrelevant to the user.","Users may also want to use an Electronic E-Metro Secure Card to store E-PIA information assets. This may be needed for user validation while using some services, but may also be another way a person wishes to store his assets. It may be the only place a person wants to keep his assets at certain time\u2014it is totally a decision of the person owning the E-PIA where, when, and how their information assets are to be stored and\/or shared.","Community Administrator Perspective","An E-Community Administrator employs the E-Community Administration Tool to manage one or more E-Communities on a single E-Metro World Wide Web Server. While each E-Community Administrator is aware of his E-Communities and their corresponding E-Brokers created by the E-Communities' development team, one E-Community Administrator designated the \u201cE-Community Site Administrator\u201d is also aware of the E-Metro and Netscape server processes which may need to be monitored and\/or configured. Due to strict security measures required in E-Metro, the Administration Tool client application requires a direct log in directly to the E-Metro server rather than via any Internet protocols. Note that this restriction does not exclude remote login. An E-Community Administrator may also install a Forms Repository on the server if this is desired.","Detailed Object Model","A major feature of the E-Metro Object Model is that the first-class objects, namely E-PIA's, are not instances of Classes (at the user level), but rather just instances. Instead, they are dynamically assigned behavior at any time via protocol assignments. This provides a facility which adds behavior incrementally or subtracts behavior decrementally. It is believed that this facility is necessary for the everyday changing needs and desires of a person desiring to do or explore different activities.","E-Being","B1. Purpose of E-Being\u2014An E-Being represents a \u201clife\u201d in the cyberworld of E-Metro. This life, or E-Being, must have at least one desire or one goal to interact with other E-Beings in order to exist on-line in E-Metro.","B2. An E-Being may represent the life of anything\u2014Note that \u201clife\u201d in cyberspace can be given to objects that normally would not be considered to have \u201clife.\u201d For example, dead persons can be represented. While the primary goal of E-Metro is to have E-Beings represent real living people, they can also represent real animals, real corporations, real organizations, real inanimate objects, or even real objects that are stored or kept alive in electronic forms outside of E-Metro. Dead as well as totally fictitious (non-real) analogies of all of the above may also be represented.","B3. An E-Being is essentially an abstract root class, there are no direct instances of E-Beings.","Fundamental Information Objects","I1. Purpose of Fundamental Information Objects\u2014Information Objects hold data in E-Metro and are instances of Classes. It is important to mention fundamental data since the user interacts with various fundamental data types frequently.","I2. The base Classes are:\n\n","I3. The base Classes have default protocol\u2014the default protocol corresponds to the methods of the Classes. For example, methods that obtain the size of an OrderedCollection, Set, and Dictionary are needed as well as specific indexes of OrderedCollections and specific keys of Dictionaries.","I4. An ExecutableString represents a piece of code that can be passed around as an object, interpreted when it needs to be, and processed\u2014ExecutableStrings require input arguments. Zero, one, and two argument ExecutableStrings should be supported. Each ExecutableString identifies the name of its Compiler\/Interpreter. This allows the names referenced in the ExecutableSring to bind to information in different contexts controlled by the Compiler.","I5. SQLStatements are intended to provide a vehicle for fast look up of information while being able to reference E-PIA information\u2014since a reference to E-PIA information is hierarchical and, thus, not SQL compliant, SQLStatement Objects do not support SQL exactly. The references get fixed up by a special compiler provided by E-Metro.","I6. A Folder is able to store Objects using hierarchically arranged keys.","I7. An extended set of Classes will have to be provided to support the various standard object protocols\u2014some examples are OLEObject, OpenDocObject, and SOMObject. This is needed since some information asset data will be desired to be stored in such formats by persons.","I8. An extended set of Classes will have to be provided to support various multimedia\u2014some examples are Audio, Video, Picture.","I9. The very important Dictionary object appears as simply a list of keyed objects to the client of a Dictionary\u2014The keyed objects are frequently referred to as the \u201cvalues\u201d of the Dictionary. A key is used to look up a value or object in the Dictionary. Keys are typically Strings or Symbols (as in Smalltalk) and are used as names for the objects so keyed. But keys can be any object the programmer sees as useful as a key. The values can be any object as well. An example Dictionary is shown below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0362","num":"0416"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00017","num":"00017"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"keys","Values"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"\u201cFirstName\u201d","a String object"]},{"entry":[{},"\u201cHeight\u201d","a Float object"]},{"entry":[{},"\u201cStreet\u201d","a String object"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}},"br":{}},"PIA1. Purpose of E-PIA\u2014An E-Being which represents a real person and maintains the real person's information assets that are intended to be shared in a secured fashion.","PIA2. An E-PIA may exist on an Electronic E-Metro Secure Card.","PIA3. Each E-PIA consists of an unstructured Folder that is created and edited at authoring time\u2014the editing is to be accomplished with HTML forms which is facilitated by the E-Metro client subsystem.","PIA4. Each E-PIA may be assigned a Set of InteractProtocols by the E-PIA's owner at authoring time\u2014E-PIA's share information at runtime only via an InteractProtocol and only one protocol at a time.","PIA5. An E-PIA contains a Set of Privilege Rules which must be checked and satisfied on all InteractProtocol executions.","PIA6. An E-PIA contains a Set of TrustedTokens which it obtains from E-Brokers at authoring time\u2014some or all of these may be used anytime the E-PIA interacts.","PIA7. An E-PIA contains an audit trail of all interactions that occur with it\u2014each RecordedEvent stores the information about an interaction that is interesting (e.g. time started, time completed, any access violations, etc.)","For an E-PIA, everytime an InteractProtocol is performed on it, a RecordEvent object is added to its auditTrail. For an E-AutoPIA, everytime an InteractInstruction is performed in its Itinerary, a RecordEvent object is added to its auditTrail. The contents of the RecordEvent objects needs to be determined based on audit trail needs during E-Metro development. Additionally, filtering of certain RecordEvents may not wish to be recorded for performance or disk space reasons. Finally, the point of the audit trail is to allow the owner of the E-PIA or E-AutoPIA to look back on what has been done.","PIA8. An E-PIA may exist in multiple E-Communities simultaneously.","PIA9. A Home E-PIA must be designated if there are more than one E-PIA's for a given person\u2014The Home E-PIA contains the E-Community names where the other E-PIA's are located.","PIA10. Only the Home E-PIA may be modified at authoring time.","PIA11. Each E-PIA contains a Certificate with its the name of the person it represents and that person's public key\u2014it is assumed that at any time a process can validate the (name, public key) pair by querying the appropriate certificate authority.","PIA12. A Version of an E-PIA is constructed at runtime when information from an E-PIA is supplied in an information interaction\u2014an E-PIA version contains only:","Certificate","Assets","privilegeRules.","The possibility of including an auditTrail should be considered. Note that versions of E-PIAs typically represent a subset of information actually contained in a source E-PIA, so that assets may be a copy of only a small part of the original assets folder. The certificate assists in validating that the information actually originated from the E-PIA whose name is stated in the certificate. This is important as the information can be passed on in \u201ctransitively trusted\u201d third party information sharing. Additionally, each individual piece of information in the original E-PIA assets Folder is encrypted with the E-PIA's private key when assembled at the E-PIA owners personal workstation. By using the public key in the certificate in a version of an E-PIA, another E-PIA may have the data decrypted and know for sure that the version of the E-PIA is, in effect, \u201csigned\u201d by the owner.","TrustedToken","TT1. Purpose of TrustedToken\u2014A TrustedToken is obtained at authoring time from an E-Broker along with some other object in order to secure use of the object, typically an interaction or service, that the E-Broker brokers. The TrustedToken grants the new owner a primary and necessary privilege (but not necessarily sufficient privilege) to performing the secured interaction.","TT2. When a TrustedToken is given to an E-PIA author, it is encrypted with the E-PIA author's private key at his local machine\u2014the E-Broker then remembers the E-PIA author's public key.","TT3. When a secured interaction is requested, the E-Broker must be given the E-PIA's name and the encrypted TrustedToken. From this pair, the TrustedToken can be decrypted with the public key obtained from a previous authoring session\u2014the E-Broker knows that the E-PIA requesting interaction is trusted only if the TrustedToken can be decrypted successfully.","InteractProtocol","SP1. Purpose of InteractProtocol\u2014An InteractProtocol object designates specific named information and the conditions which must be true in order for the specific information to be shared. The shared information is packaged in the form of a version of an E-PIA. The version of the E-PIA is specifically defined by the outputs of the InteractProtocol.","SP2. An InteractProtocol must have a name.","SP3. An InteractProtocol consists of a 5-tuple of","1) Set of input Parameters","2) Set of output Parameters defining which information to store in version of E-PIA that will be shared","3) Default parameter mapping","4) Set of Privilege Rules for immediate sharing to occur","5) Set of Transitive Privilege Rules for sharing of version of E-PIA to occur by third parties (transitive sharing). At runtime, these rules are copied and placed in the privilegeRules of the version of E-PIA that will be shared.","6) Enable boolean\u2014an Interact may be disabled","SP4. Execution of an InteractProtocol creates a version of the E-PIA based on the runtime outpu parameter values. This version of the E-PIA is what is given and shared with the E-AutoPIA that is interacted with\u2014however, if ALL output parameter values are previously obtained E-PIA versions, then an E-PIA version is not created. Instead the information is passed along in the originally obtained E-PIA forms.","NOTE: Consideration to passing data as raw data in some situations, rather than always as a version of an E-PIA, should be investigated. Perhaps passing data as an E-PIA version or raw data can be a choice during InteractProtocol and InteractInstruction authoring.","SP5. The version of E-PIA that is shared, has each of its pieces of fundamental information encrypted with the E-PIA's private key\u2014this encryption occurs at the E-PIA's personal client workstation when the information for the Home E-PIA is assembled. Later, another E-PIA or process can decrypt the information by using the public key of the version of the E-PIA found in its certificate.","Note that since private keys are never located in servers, the input or output parameters used to pass data in an E-PIA version may need to be severely restricted in expression richness, since in general, an expression result would require re-encryption with the private key.","SP6. An InteractProtocol's Default parameter mapping is a Dictionary showing the name of zero or more Parameters and a hierarchical name that each listed parameter is associated with.","SP7. An InteractProtocol may inherit an existing InteractProtocol\u2014the subclassing InteractProtocol inherits the 4-tuple to which it may add more Parameters and Rules.","SP8. An E-PIA may overwrite privilegeRules in any or all of the InteractProtocols assigned to it.\u2014the authoring time E-PIA facility must provide this ability.","SP9. The default map is meant to act as an assistant to the construction of a corresponding InteractInstruction\u2014Since InteractInstructions must \u201cfill in\u201d the parameters of an InteractProtocol with ExpressionStrings, it might be nice to fill in some or all of the parameters with the commonly expected defaults. The table below shows an example default map.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0400","num":"0454"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00018","num":"00018"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Parameter name","default value"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"\u201cFirstName\u201d","FirstName"]},{"entry":[{},"\u201cHeight\u201d","profile.physicalAttributes.height"]},{"entry":[{},"\u201cStreet\u201d","address.street"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"The analogy in C\/C++ would be the function prototype:","processSuperficialInfo(String* FirstName, Float* Height, String* Street)","that would be automatically filled with the default call: processSuperficialInfo(firstName, profile.physicalAttributes.height, address.street)","Realize that the default parameters reference variables that reference (and hence, bind to) the E-AutoPIA's Folder.","Parameter","P1. Purpose of Parameter\u2014A Parameter is a named \u201cpassageway\u201d for an InformationObject to either be input to an interaction or be output from an interaction.","P2. Each Parameter is a 2-tuple of (name, validation Rule)\u2014the validation Rule may be used to verify type at runtime. For example, the expression \u201cisKindOf: aClass\u201d determines whether the runtime parameter value is an instance of aClass or one of its subclasses. A more complex example would be the combination of a type validation and a general expression such as:","(myself isMemberOf: Float) & (myself >203500.00).","Rule","R1. Purpose of Rule\u2014A Rule is assigned to some activity and describes the conditions under which the activity will occur. Otherwise the activity does not occur. It is important to note that the Rule grammar needs to be multiple party centric.","R2. Rules are ExecutableStrings representing expressions that evaluate to TRUE or FALSE.","R3. The Rule expression grammar must recognize multiple contexts\u2014in the most interesting case, two E-PIA's can meet so we are interested in two contexts.

To facilitate reference to more than one object that meet, the keyword \u201cyourselves\u201d shall be established in the grammar\u2014yourselves refers to the Set of sharees (E-PIA's that meet with sharer). Indexes can be used to refer to specific sharees. Yourself is always the same as yourselves at index 0.","R6. References are used to refer to a hierarchically positioned piece of data in an object\u2014a Reference may use names separated by spaces to denote hierarchical access.","EXAMPLE: To restrict an activity to only those over 6 feet tall a sharer's rule might be yourself profile physicalAttributes height >6","R7. Rules are meant to be interpreted at runtime\u2014therefore, only some errors are intended to be found at authoring time.","E Auto Personal Information Agent (E-AutoPIA)","APIA1. Purpose of E-AutoPIA\u2014E-AutoPIA's are intelligent agents that do work on behalf of a Home E-PIA. An E-AutoPIA is an E-PIA which initiates tasks intending to interact with other E-PIA's in local or remote E-Communities.","APIA2.

At runtime, these Rules are copied and placed in the privilegeRules of the version of E-PIA that will be shared.","I5. An Itinerary contains a Set of zero or more Scripts\u2014a Script is just an ExecutableString written in some programming language. Scripts can control when and how InteractInstructions are to be performed. Thus, Scripts are just general programming code to do whatever processing a programmer wants to do. However, a Script can call an InteractInstruction by its name and pass it any variables as parameters that are within scope. Only the InteractInstructions of an Itinerary or superclassed Itinerary may be called from the Scripts that are attached to the same Itinerary object. The net affect is that the InteractInstructions can get called in any order. InteractInstructions are only called in sequence when no Scripts are present in the Itinerary.","I6. An Itinerary consists of one or more InteractInstructions\u2014if there are no Scripts, then the InteractInstructions are executed sequentially.","I7. An Itinerary may inherit an existing Itinerary\u2014the subclassing Itinerary inherits the Rules, Scripts, and Itinerary of the parent Itinerary.","InteractInstruction","II1. Purpose of InteractInstruction\u2014InteractInstructions are the single point in the whole system that cause interactions between E-PIA's (actually, E-AutoPIA and E-PIA) to take place. Each InteractInstruction describes the interaction that will occur and the rules under which it can occur. It is also important to note that is the execution of an InteractInstruction that is the only way to exchange information assets.","II2. Each InteractInstruction is a 5-tuple of","1) E-Community name","2) InteractProtocol name","3) Parameter assignments","4) Set of Privilege Rules for immediate sharing to occur","5) Set of Transitive Privilege Rules for sharing of version of E-AutoPIA to occur by third parties (transitive sharing).","6) Maximum number of interactions","II3.

Note that this special InteractInstruction requires the E-AutoPIA to physically visit its Home E-PIA.","Clarifying the Relationship between InteractProtocols and InteractInstructions","An InteractProtocol maintains essentially a template relationship to an InteractInstruction. An InteractProtocol is represented by a signature of parameters to be \u201cfilled in,\u201d while the InteractInstruction counterpart is the same except with parameters \u201cfilled in.\u201d","InteractProtocols and InteractInstructions are both authoring time entities. The InteractProtocols represent the services provided by an E-Broker and are authored along with an E-Broker. InteractInstructions are authored during the construction of an Itinerary for an E-AutoPIA. Each InteractInstruction represents the call of a \u201crequested interaction\u201d or InteractProtocol.","Also, shown in  are privilegeRules that are part of InteractProtocols. Each privilegeRules is a Set of Rule objects. As described previously, each Rule is an ExpressionString which employs the Rule Compiler to process. In order for an InteractProtocol to execute all of the Rules in the privilegeRules must be true. As mentioned previously, the Rules can reference both myself (the provider of the InteractProtocol interaction) and yourself (the E-AutoPIA requesting interaction). It was also shown that Parameter objects have validation Rule objects. These Rules are applied only to the actual parameter being passed in.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0445","num":"0499"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},"E-Community","C1. Purpose of E-Community\u2014An E-Community provides a grouping concept for E-PIA's and other E-Communities. In this regard, an E-Community also provides security for the objects it groups.","C2. An E-Community is an E-Being\u2014an E-Community maintains a E-Metro notion of life concept in that it has goals to share information and interact with general E-Beings.","C3. An E-Community must have a name.","C4. E-Communities contain zero or more E-PIA's\u2014the E-PIA's reside together because they share the same goals as far as sharing information. Thus, E-AutoPIA's looking for specific E-PIA's will know which E-Communities to visit.","C5. E-Communities may contain other E-Communities such that they can be arranged hierarchically\u2014The contained E-Communities may, in turn, each contain one or more as well. The hierarchy must be strict, however, in that no E-Community is contained by more than one parent E-Community.","C6. Each E-Community consists of E-Brokers that the E-Community has decided to make available.","C7. Each E-Community contains no InteractProtocols because they may not interact.","E-Broker","BR1. Purpose of E-Broker\u2014An E-Broker is required for all inter-PIA Interactions. E-Brokers guarantee that the all E-PIA's involved in an interaction have the rights based on InteractProtocols to interact in the manner that the interaction is performed.","BR2. Each E-Broker owns one or more InteractProtocols.","BR3. An E-Broker contains the subsystems implementing all InteractProtocols it owns.","BR4. An E-AutoPIA may only interact with an E-PIA in an E-Community which has an E-Broker with the InteractProtocol identified by the E-AutoPIA's current InteractInstruction.","BR5. An E-Broker must generate a unique TrustedToken for each of its InteractProtocols.","BR6. InteractInstructions may only be authored by obtaining the corresponding InteractProtocol from an E-Broker.","BR7. An E-Broker mediates the interaction between an E-PIA and an E-AutoPIA as follows:","1) Validate that the E-AutoPIA satisfies the E-Community's privilegeRules.","2) Validate that E-AutoPIA has a decryptable TrustedToken corresponding to the InteractProtocol being executed.","3) Validate E-AutoPIA's privilegeRules.","4) Validate the E-AutoPIA's Itinerary privilegeRules.","5) Validate the E-AutoPIA's current InteractInstruction privilegeRules.","6) Validate the privilegeRules of any transitively exchanged E-PIA versions that are going to be passed as an input or output Parameter.","7) Call the entrypoint of the E-Broker which corresponds to the InteractProtocol's implementation\u2014only the Parameters that passed validation in (6) of the E-AutoPIA's InteractInstruction are passed in.","8) Determine the specific collection of E-PIA's involved in the interaction\u2014this is based on three items:\n\n","9) The E-Broker's implementation is executed\u2014if any failures occur, the InteractInstruction is not completed successfully.","10) Only the Parameters that passed validation of the E-PIA's InteractProtocol are passed out.","BR8. Each E-Broker offers an \u201cinteractProtocolDirectory\u201d service\u2014this service answers a generated HTML document describing all of the InteractProtocols provided by the E-Broker.","BR9. Each E-Broker offers a \u201cgetRightsToInteractProtocol\u201d service\u2014the service answers the InteractProtocol with the TrustedToken. It is important to note that this service can be implemented in any manner by the E-Broker. For example, this service may be where the person desiring rights to an InteractProtocol has to validate who he is and\/or pay to obtain privileges. The E-Broker can refuse to answer a TrustedToken for any reason.","BR10. E-Brokers may be directly interacted with out regard to the E-Community privileges of the E-Community they belong to\u2014however, interaction with an E-Broker does require privileges to be obeyed of any parent E-Communities.","Having described and illustrated the principles of our invention with reference to a preferred embodiment, it will be apparent that the invention can be modified in arrangement and detail without departing from such principles.
