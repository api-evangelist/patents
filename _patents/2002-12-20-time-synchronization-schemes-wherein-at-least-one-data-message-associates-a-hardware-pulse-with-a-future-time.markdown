The stations , ,  may include fiber-optic connector(s) for connecting to fiber-optic cable(s) and fiber-optic signal converter(s) for converting a fiber-optic signal to a hardware pulse.","The exemplary synchronization scheme  may be understood in the following manner with reference to . At the master station , the GPS receiver  may receive time data from one or more satellites and may synchronize its on-board clock  to the time. The date\/time monitor  may retrieve the time data from the GPS receiver  via an API. Based on the time data, the date\/time monitor  may determine a future time for transmitting a hardware pulse. The date\/time monitor  may generate a data message that associates a hardware pulse with the future time. The date\/time monitor  may multicast or otherwise transmit the data message to slave stations ,  via IPC .","In one embodiment, the time set monitor  may use the time data to synchronize system clock  with on-board clock  to provide a backup time source, for example, in the event of failure of GPS receiver .","At a slave station, such as slave station , the active STK component  may employ IPC  to detect the data message from the active MTK component . The received data message can cause STK component  to store the associated future time for use by the ISR  or another module for adjusting system clock .","At the master station , the HPG  may transmit a hardware pulse to the slave stations ,  at the future time specified in the data message. The HPG  may transmit the hardware pulse based on receiving an instruction from the date\/time monitor . In one embodiment, the HPG  may be hardcoded to transmit a hardware pulse at a particular time. The HPG  may multicast or otherwise transmit the hardware pulse to the slave stations ,  over second communication link . In one embodiment, the HPG  may include a fiber-optic signal converter and may convert a hardware pulse to a fiber-optic signal for transmission over a second communication link  including fiber-optic cable(s).","At slave station , receipt of the hardware pulse may cause ISR  to process the hardware pulse. The ISR  may associate the hardware pulse with the stored future time, and the ISR  may adjust the system clock  based on the future time. In one embodiment, as previously indicated, the ISR  may prompt another module to process the hardware pulse.","In one embodiment, the ISR  may be designed to process a fiber-optic signal. As previously indicated, the HPG  may convert the hardware pulse to a fiber-optic signal for transmission on fiber-optic cable(s). Receipt of the fiber-optic signal may cause ISR  to associate the fiber-optic signal with the stored future time and adjust the system clock  based on the future time. In one embodiment, ISR  and\/or another component of slave station  may include a fiber-optic signal converter for converting a fiber-optic signal from HPG  to a data message, a hardware pulse, or another signal for processing by ISR .","The exemplary synchronization scheme  may be modified to compensate for a fixed or otherwise known propagation delay of the hardware pulse. A known propagation delay may be calculated, measured, or otherwise determined based on a variety of physical parameters, including, for example, length(s) of transmission cable(s), a number of repeaters, and other physical parameters. In one embodiment, a known propagation delay may be calculated and stored on STK component  for use by ISR . During processing of a hardware pulse, ISR  may associate the hardware pulse with a stored future time and the stored delay and may adjust the system clock  based on the future time and the delay. In one embodiment, a known propagation delay may be calculated and stored on MTK component  for use by date\/time monitor . The date\/time monitor  may determine a future time for transmitting a hardware pulse and may generate a data message that associates a hardware pulse with the future time and the stored delay. The date\/time monitor  and\/or the ISR  may be hardcoded with a known propagation delay. In one embodiment, re-calculations, measurements, or determinations of the propagation delay can be performed.","The exemplary synchronization scheme  may be performed at intervals to maintain synchronization between networked stations. For example, master station  may transmit updated data messages and corresponding hardware pulses to slave stations , , and slave stations ,  may update their respective system clocks ,  based on the future times included in the updated data messages. The master station  may regularly or periodically transmit updated data messages and corresponding hardware pulses.","Based on the drift specifications of system clocks ,  and other factors, respective slave stations ,  may drift between updates. To reduce drift between updates, master station  may periodically transmit hardware pulses to slave stations , , as described herein.","An exemplary synchronization scheme for reducing drift may be understood in the following manner with reference to . At the master station , the date\/time monitor  may transmit a data message to slave stations ,  associating consecutive hardware pulses with a periodic interval. This data message may be transmitted separately from the data message associating a hardware pulse with a future time. In one embodiment, this data message may be part of the data message associating a hardware pulse with a future time. For example, the master station  may transmit a data message associating a first hardware pulse with a future time and associating at least one second hardware pulse with a periodic interval. In one embodiment, the TKPs ,  at the respective slave stations ,  may be hardcoded with the periodic interval. The date\/time monitor  may instruct the HPG  to transmit a hardware pulse to the slave stations ,  at the periodic interval. In one embodiment, the HPG  may be hardcoded to transmit a hardware pulse at the periodic interval.","The slave stations ,  may process hardware pulses based on schemes similar to those described herein. For example, in one embodiment, an active STK component  may employ IPC  to detect a data message from master station . Receipt of a data message can cause the active STK component  to store the periodic interval for use by the ISR . Receipt of consecutive hardware pulses can cause the ISR  to associate the hardware pulses with the periodic interval, and the ISR  may adjust the system clock  based on the periodic interval.","Generally, master station  may periodically transmit data messages and hardware pulses to slave stations , , and slave stations ,  may adjust their respective system clocks ,  based on the future time or the periodic interval, and also based on whether a hardware pulse is preceded by a data message associating a hardware pulse with a future time.","In one exemplary embodiment, the master station  may transmit hardware pulses at a period of five seconds and data messages associating a hardware pulse with a future time at a period of 60 seconds. In such an embodiment, slave stations ,  may be synchronized to a tolerance of less than approximately one millisecond, provided that respective system clocks ,  have drift specifications less than approximately 0.1 millisecond\/second.","Slave stations ,  may perform several time sensitive operations during a synchronization cycle, where a synchronization cycle may refer to a cycle for processing a hardware pulse based on a future time or a periodic interval. Due to ISR processing limitations, a slave station may adjust a system clock in increments of approximately one millisecond or less per synchronization cycle. As such, slave stations ,  may react to a difference between the time source on the master station , such as GPS receiver , and the respective system clocks ,  by incrementally adjusting the system clocks ,  over several synchronization cycles.","As previously described, master station  may implement exemplary synchronization scheme  to synchronize slave stations ,  to an external time source, such as time established by GPS receiver . In one embodiment, master station  may implement exemplary synchronization scheme  to synchronize slave stations ,  to an internal time source, such as system clock  and\/or on-board clock . Master station  may synchronize slave stations ,  to an internal time source when an external time source becomes unavailable. An external time source may become unavailable based on a hardware failure or other event. For example, GPS receiver  may fail or may be unable to provide time data. Since an internal time source may drift from an external source that provides absolute time, networked stations that are synchronized to the internal source may not include accurate absolute time.","An exemplary scheme for synchronizing networked stations to an internal time source on failure of an external time source may be understood in the following manner with reference to . At master station , on failure of GPS receiver , time set monitor  may determine whether the system clock  and\/or the on-board clock  had been previously synchronized to the external time source . For example, as previously indicated, GPS receiver  may have synchronized on-board clock  to UTC time, time set monitor  may have synchronized system clock  with on-board clock , and\/or a user may have provided a time for system clock . If system clock  and\/or on-board clock  had been previously synchronized, time set monitor  may multicast or otherwise transmit a message via IPC  to slave stations ,  indicating the new time source, i.e. system clock  or on-board clock . Synchronization may proceed according to schemes previously described. If neither clock had been synchronized, however, time set monitor  may prompt a user via display manager  to set system clock . TKP  may convert the time provided by the user to UTC time, and may transmit or multicast the new time in a data message via IPC  to slave stations , . Slave stations ,  may adjust their respective system clocks ,  based on the data message. Synchronization may proceed according to schemes previously described.","As previously described, master station  may synchronize slave stations ,  by implementing exemplary synchronization scheme . Master station  may also synchronize slave stations ,  by implementing a NTP synchronization scheme. In one embodiment, master station  may implement a NTP synchronization scheme in the event that an exemplary synchronization scheme described herein becomes unavailable due to, for example, a failure of: a second communication link ; at a slave station, an ISR; and\/or at master station , an HPG . Generally, a NTP synchronization scheme may be implemented concurrently with an exemplary synchronization scheme described herein. For example, master station  may implement an NTP synchronization scheme to synchronize stations incapable of receiving hardware pulses and may concurrently implement synchronization scheme  to synchronize other stations. Generally, TKPs may determine a suitable synchronization scheme based on information contained in OM shared variables.","An exemplary scheme for synchronizing networked stations using NTP may be understood in the following manner with reference to . As shown in , master station  and slave stations ,  may include NTP daemons , , , respectively. NTP daemon  may be configured by TKP  to be a server daemon or a time source and NTP daemons ,  may be configured by respective TKPs ,  to be clients of NTP daemon . NTP server daemon  may be configured to refer to an internal time source, such as system clock  or on-board clock . TKPs , ,  may monitor respective NTP daemons , ,  via socket messaging, although other monitoring configurations are possible. Generally, on failure of an exemplary synchronization scheme described herein, NTP server daemon  may use socket messaging to synchronize NTP client daemons ,  based on a NTP scheme.","Generally, a standby TKP component may monitor the health or state of operation of an active TKP component and may become active on failure of the active TKP component. For example, at a station, a standby STK component may monitor the health of an active MTK component. Also, for networked stations, a standby MTK component at a slave station may monitor the health of the active MTK component at the master station. The health of a TKP component may be monitored based on, for example, OM shared variables and\/or error messages provided by an error reporter. A system utility may determine whether a particular standby TKP component may become active.","A variety of backup synchronization schemes that allow a standby STK component on a slave station to assume responsibilities of an active MTK component on a master station are possible. Generally, a backup synchronization scheme may include a primary MTK component operating in an active state and at least one backup MTK component operating in a standby state. A backup synchronization scheme may also support a hierarchy providing an order of succession of the at least one backup MTK component. An order of succession can include a backup MTK component with an external time source and an HPG, a backup MTK component with an internal time source and an HPG, a backup MTK component with an external time source, and a backup MTK component with an internal time source. A backup synchronization scheme may support an exemplary synchronization scheme described herein, an NTP synchronization scheme, or a combination of both schemes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0084"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 1 and 2"],"b":["400","402","414","424","430","502","514","524","530","602","614","626","702","1002","402","1002","702","1002","790","1090","792","1092"]},"Operation of backup synchronization scheme  may be understood in the following manner. Primary MTK component  and first backup MTK component  may implement exemplary synchronization schemes described herein to synchronize slave stations \u2013 to time established by respective GPS receivers , . As shown in , primary MTK component  may provide hardware pulses  to ports-A \u2013, while first backup MTK component  may provide hardware pulses  to ports-B \u2013. During operation of primary MTK component , slave stations \u2013 may adjust their system clocks based on pulses  received at respective ports-A \u2013. On failure of primary MTK component , however, slave stations \u2013 may adjust their system clocks based on pulses  received on respective ports-B \u2013.","In one embodiment, on failure of one of a port-A and a port-B, a slave station may be reconfigured to receive hardware pulses from the primary active MTK component  on a non-failed port. In such an embodiment, the slave station may receive hardware pulses from the first backup MTK component  on the non-failed port on failure of the primary active MTK component .","In one embodiment, on failure of port-A and port-B, a slave station may be synchronized according to a NTP synchronization scheme.","Backup synchronization scheme  may permit the first backup MTK component  to assume at least some timekeeping responsibilities on failure of primary active MTK component . In one embodiment, the first backup MTK component  may assume timekeeping responsibilities on failure of master station , GPS receiver , and\/or HPG . In one embodiment, primary active MTK component  and first backup MTK component  may share timekeeping responsibilities. For example, on failure of HPG , primary active MTK component  may continue to establish time and transmit data messages, and first backup MTK component  may transmit hardware pulses. In one embodiment, on failure of HPGs , , an MTK component associated with a non-failed GPS receiver may implement a NTP synchronization scheme to synchronize stations \u2013 to time established by the GPS receiver. In one embodiment, on failure of GPS receivers  and , an MTK component associated with a non-failed HPG may implement an exemplary synchronization scheme described herein to synchronize stations \u2013 to an internal time source.","Backup synchronization scheme  may also permit the second backup MTK component  to assume timekeeping responsibilities on failure of both primary active MTK component  and first backup MTK component . In one embodiment, on failure of GPS receivers ,  and HPGs , , one of stations , ,  may implement a NTP synchronization scheme to synchronize stations \u2013 to an internal time source. In another embodiment, on failure of both master station  and first backup slave station , second backup MTK component  may implement a NTP synchronization scheme to synchronize stations \u2013 to internal time source . Generally, a new master station may reconfigure its associated NTP daemon to become a server daemon, and slave stations may reconfigure their associated NTP daemons to become client daemons of the new server daemon.","Transfer of timekeeping responsibilities from a primary MTK component to a backup MTK component may affect the synchronization of networked stations. At least three transfer scenarios may be possible, specifically, (1) transfer from a primary MTK component having an external time source to a backup MTK component having another external time source, (2) transfer from a primary MTK component having an external time source to a backup MTK component having an internal time source, and (3) transfer from a primary MTK component having an internal time source to a backup MTK component having another internal time source. Generally, networked stations may experience a synchronization gap during these scenarios, where a synchronization gap can be understood to include a time interval during which slave stations may become out of synchronization with a master station. A synchronization gap may arise during a transfer of timekeeping responsibilities between MTK components because the time sources associated with the MTK components may provide different time data. For example, networked stations may experience a synchronization gap in scenario (2) because the internal time source associated with the backup MTK component may include a different time than the external time source associated with the primary MTK component. Such a time difference may occur because either the internal time source was not previously synchronized to the external time source or because the internal time source drifted after being synchronized. Generally, as previously described, a slave station may react to a synchronization gap by incrementally adjusting a system clock over several synchronization cycles. As such, during a transfer of timekeeping responsibilities between MTKs, networked stations may not be synchronized to a specified tolerance for a time interval.","The schemes described herein are not limited to a particular hardware or software configuration; they may find applicability in many computing or processing environments. The schemes can be implemented in hardware or software, or in a combination of hardware and software. The schemes can be implemented in one or more computer programs, in which a computer program can be understood to include one or more processor-executable instructions.
