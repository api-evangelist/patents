{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Examples relate generally to software and user interfaces. More specifically, expandable user interface menu techniques and implementations are described.","User interface menus often include menu items that use additional user input. For example, a user interface menu, such as one typically labeled \u201cFile,\u201d often includes a \u201cSave As . . . \u201d menu item, which uses a user to enter a filename. Other examples of menu items that use additional user input include \u201cOpen . . . ,\u201d \u201cPrint . . . ,\u201d \u201cFind . . . ,\u201d and \u201cReplace . . . . \u201d The ellipses in a menu item typically signify that additional user input is used.","Conventionally techniques for gathering additional user input typically involve one or more \u201cpopup\u201d windows or displays that disengage from an initiating user interface menu. For example, when a user selects a \u201cSave As . . . \u201d menu item from a menu, the menu typically disappears. Then, a window pops up for the user to (1) enter a filename and (2) either confirms the user's action (e.g., clicking on a \u201cSave\u201d button to confirm saving a file) or cancels the user's action (e.g., clicking on a \u201cCancel\u201d button). In some situations, such as selecting a \u201cPrint . . . \u201d menu item to print a file, a second, third, and more windows may appear or \u201cpop up\u201d to receive additional user input (e.g., for specifying printer properties or customizing document formatting). However, there are problems associated with conventional techniques.","In some conventional techniques, a new popup window typically disrupts the user experience by visually interrupting a user's attention and mentally interrupting user focus on a given task. Conventional popup windows demand user interaction or intervention (e.g., clicking on one or more buttons in a popup window to close it) before allowing a user to return to the task at hand or to interact with previously popped up windows. For example, if providing additional user input to a menu item results in several popup windows appearing in succession, a user must close all displayed popup windows before being able to return to an application user interface. Further, popup windows use up more space on a display screen than a user interface menu. Conventional displays become visually \u201ccluttered\u201d with popup windows.","Another problem with conventional techniques is the denial of the ability to access other menu items when a popup window appears. For example, a menu of font sizes typically includes options for selecting font sizes and an \u201cOther Size . . . \u201d menu item for a user to manually input a numerical value to specify a font size not appearing in the menu. However, when conventional solutions present a popup window to enter a font size, the font size menu typically disappears, preventing the selection of other items or options, limiting or altogether eliminating further user input.","Thus, a solution for providing user input without leaving the context of a given application without the limitations of conventional techniques is needed.","Various embodiments or examples may be implemented in numerous ways, including as a system, a process, an apparatus, a user interface, or a series of program instructions on a computer readable medium such as a computer readable storage medium or a computer network where the program instructions are sent over optical, electronic, or wireless communication links. In general, operations of disclosed processes may be performed in an arbitrary order, unless otherwise provided in the claims.","A detailed description of one or more examples is provided below along with accompanying figures. The detailed description is provided in connection with such examples, but is not limited to any particular example. The scope is limited only by the claims and numerous alternatives, modifications, and equivalents are encompassed. Numerous specific details are set forth in the following description in order to provide a thorough understanding. These details are provided as examples and the described techniques may be practiced according to the claims without some or all of the accompanying details. For clarity, technical material that is known in the technical fields related to the examples has not been described in detail to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the description.","In some examples, the described techniques may be implemented as a computer program or application (\u201capplication\u201d) or as a plug-in, module, or sub-component of another application. The described techniques may be implemented as software, hardware, firmware, circuitry, or a combination thereof. If implemented as software, the described techniques may be implemented using various types of programming, development, scripting, or formatting languages, frameworks, syntax, applications, protocols, objects, or techniques, including C, Objective C, C++, C#, Adobe\u00ae Integrated Runtime\u2122 (Adobe\u00ae AIR\u2122), ActionScript\u2122, Flex\u2122, Lingo\u2122, Java\u2122, Javascript\u2122, Ajax, Perl, COBOL, Fortran, ADA, XML, MXML, HTML, DHTML, XHTML, HTTP, XMPP, and others. Design, publishing, and other types of applications such as Dreamweaver\u00ae, Shockwave\u00ae, Flash\u00ae, and Fireworks\u00ae may also be used to implement the described techniques. The described techniques may be varied and are not limited to the examples or descriptions provided.","Various examples of expandable user interface menus are described, including menu items, menu expansions, input controls, input data, or other user interface elements. Devices, computing systems, user interfaces, processes, methods, and programming instructions that implement various expandable user interface menus are also described. These and other techniques may be implemented in any applications, including those executed on a mobile device, that use one or more user interface menus. Various techniques for expandable user interface menu may be selectively implemented. In other examples, different techniques may be implemented differently and are not limited to the examples provided and described.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["101","110","120","125","130","125","110"]},"Application window  may occupy a portion of a display screen (not shown) or the entire display screen. An application may implement any number of menus, including one or more submenus (e.g., menu  of ). Here, menu  is shown near the top of application window . In some examples, menu  may be displayed anywhere in application window , such as near the left side, right side, bottom, or center of application window . Further, menu  may be moved to another location, within, overlapping, or outside application window .","In some examples, a menu, such as menu  may include any number of menu items, such as one, two, five, eight, 11, 18, 25, 40, 59 or more. Here, menu  is shown with nine menu items  and . Here, menu items  and  are shown in a vertical arrangement in menu . In some examples not shown, menu items  and  may be arranged differently, such as horizontally, following a curvature (e.g., an arc or circle), or in a combination of horizontal-vertical groups (e.g., arranging menu items vertically in each two or more groups and arranging the groups horizontally). In some examples, users may be allowed to configure menu  to add more menu items. Any of menu items  and  may be represented by a graphical element (e.g., an image, thumbnail, or icon), a textual element (e.g., one or more characters, symbols, or words), or a combination of both, as shown. Here, for illustration purposes, menu  and text associated with menu items  and  are shown in English. However, text in any language or in more than one language may be used in an expandable user interface menu.","In some examples, menu items  may be referred to as \u201caction\u201d menu items (i.e., an action or function is performed upon selection of a menu item). Menu item  and the like may be referred to as customizable menu items or \u201cellipses\u201d menu items. Ellipses menu items may receive additional user input before an action or function is performed. In some examples, ellipses menu items (i.e., menu items customized with additional user input) may be indicated by including ellipses in the menu items. There may be other types of menu items. For example, a menu item may, upon selection, cause the display of another menu (i.e., a submenu), such as some of menu items  of . This type of menu items may be referred to as \u201csubmenu\u201d menu items and may be indicated using a symbol (e.g., an arrow), as shown in the first four menu items  (). In some examples, ellipses or submenu menu items may include other signifying symbols or no signifying symbol. Any menu item in a menu, such as menu  (), may be an action menu item, ellipses menu item, submenu menu item, or another type of menu item. A menu (e.g., menu ) may have any combination of different types of menu items, including menu items of one or multiple types (i.e., ellipses, action, submenu, or other).","User interface elements, such as menu  and menu items  and  may be selected or activated via control pointer , other controls (not shown), or other methods. For example, a user may provide user input or data via one or more controls to select a menu (e.g., menu ), submenu (e.g., menu  of ), menu item (e.g., menu item  or ), or another user interface element. As used herein, the term \u201ccontrol\u201d refers generally to any input interface or mechanism. A control may be physically implemented (e.g., a key, button, mouse, trackball, touch screen, tablet, lever, switch, pen, and others) or virtually implemented, such as a graphical user interface (\u201cGUI\u201d) control (e.g., a pointer, icon, button, box, checkbox, list box, or another GUI widget or element). In some examples, a control may be activated with a single action, such as a single click or keystroke. In other examples, activating a control may be performed with two or more actions (e.g., two or more keystrokes, clicks, or combination). In some examples, when a control is activated, a signal is generated. For example, activating a control may generate a signal to select a menu, select a menu item, expand a menu, or interface an input control.","A menu may be activated or selected using any methods. For example, a user may select or activate menu  (the \u201cTheme\u201d menu in application window ) by clicking control pointer  on the word \u201cTheme\u201d, by hovering control pointer  over the word \u201cTheme\u201d, or by pressing a key or combination of keys on a keyboard (\u201ckeyboard shortcut\u201d). The term \u201chovering,\u201d with respect to user interface, refers generally to moving a control (e.g., control pointer ) over a widget or item (e.g., the word \u201cTheme\u201d or a menu item) and keeping the control over such widget or item for a period of time (e.g., a fraction of a second). Once activated, menu  is displayed showing menu items  and  for selection. In some examples, the selected menu may be de-selected or another menu may be selected.","A menu item may be selected, for example, when a control is activated, such as control pointer . For example, to select menu item , control pointer  may be clicked on menu item . In other examples, selecting menu item  may be achieved by hovering an element (e.g., control pointer ) over menu item  for a pre-determined period of time, such as a fraction of a second. In yet other examples, menu item (e.g., ) may be selected by other methods or controls, such as a keyboard shortcut. Upon selecting an ellipses menu item, such as menu item , menu  expands to allow additional user input.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 1B","b":["151","110","160","160","165","170","160","125","125","130","110","160"]},"In some examples, one or more parameters associated with a menu item (e.g., menu item ) may be used to determine various aspects of an expandable user interface menu. Parameters associated with a menu item may be the type of a menu item (e.g., ellipses or action), the position of a menu item in a menu, the level of additional user input (e.g., one piece of data or more than one piece of data), the form of data (e.g., text data, selection list, checkbox, or other form), and other properties. For example, the size of menu portion  may be based on the level of additional user input used to customize menu item . Here the level of additional user input, as indicated by input controls , uses \u201cColor\u201d checkboxes, a \u201cFont\u201d list, and a \u201cFont Size\u201d list. Further, menu portion  may be designed to use minimal amount of display space to minimize the covering of application window  and to minimize interrupting a user's focus on the current task. For example, the number and sizes of input controls  may be used to determine a layout of menu portion .","In some examples, the direction of expansion may be based on one or more parameters associated with menu item . For example, menu portion  may be expanded downwards in the direction shown by arrow . In other examples, menu portion  may be expanded substantially adjacent to menu  in another direction (not shown), such as to the right of, to the left of, or above menu . Menu portion  may be moved, either independent of menu , or in unison with menu . For example, after menu portion  is expanded and displayed, a user may move menu portion  to another location within, overlapping, or outside application window .","Input controls  may be any controls designed to collect, accept, or otherwise gather user input. There may be any number of input controls, such as one, two, three, five, eight, 15 or more. In some examples, input controls  may be any combination of one or more checkboxes, selection boxes, dropdown lists, selection lists, buttons (including radio buttons), input fields, widgets, elements, and other structures. In other example, one or more input controls may be ellipses input controls (i.e., causing another menu portion to be expanded with additional input controls). An input control may be accompanied by a description, such as \u201cColor,\u201d \u201cFont,\u201d or \u201cFont Size.\u201d For example, application window  may be showing a menu for selecting font displaying themes. When menu portion  is expanded with input controls , input controls  may include one or more \u201cColor\u201d checkboxes for selecting one or more theme colors, a \u201cFont\u201d dropdown list of font names for selecting a font, a \u201cFont Size\u201d list for selecting a font size, a button to confirm any input entered (e.g., \u201cApply,\u201d \u201cOK,\u201d or \u201cCommit\u201d), and a \u201cCancel\u201d button to cancel and close menu portion . In some examples, expanded menu portion  may include fewer or more input controls than shown or other input controls. Further, menu portion  may include output controls, for example, providing instructions, warnings, descriptions, or other information.","In some examples, data entered via input controls  may be associated with menu item , which caused input controls  to be presented. Input data via input controls  may be any form of data, such as text, ASCII characters, binary bits, bytes, words, symbols, objects, or data of another form. Data entered via input controls  may be stored for other uses or for used by other menu items or controls.","In some examples, data entered via input controls  may be used as default values by input controls  in a later time. Having the ability to remember and reuse data values in a later time allows users to customize an ellipse menu item (e.g., menu item ). For example, a user may customize menu item  by using input controls  to check a red color checkbox, select a Times New Roman font, or select a medium font size. The next time the user selects menu , menu portion  may expand to show input controls  with a red color checkbox checked by default, a Times New Roman font selected by default, or a medium font size selected by default. The user may accept or change any of the default values, which may further appear as default values in a subsequent activation of menu item .","Note that as users interact with one or more input controls  (other than pressing \u201cCancel\u201d or \u201cApply\u201d), menu  remains displayed along with menu portion . Menu items in menus  (e.g., menu items ) remains displayed and available for selection. For example, after selecting menu item , which causes menu portion  to be expanded, a user may have an option to select one of menu items . Keeping menu items  and input controls  available for selection at the same time preserves or otherwise retains the context of menu  in its expanded state. Further, having menu  and menu portion  opened may allow a user to continue to focus on the user's task without interruptions, visual or mental.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["201","203","205","205","210","220","225","220","225","210","225","210","260","265","260","270"]},"With respect to menus in graphical user interface, a \u201csubmenu\u201d refers to a menu (e.g., menu ) that is activated from another menu (e.g., menu ). A first-level submenu refers to a submenu of a menu, which itself is not a submenu. A second-level submenu refers to a submenu of a first-level submenu. Generally, an N-level submenu refers to a submenu of a N-minus-one-level submenu. In some examples, menu  may be a submenu, such as a first-level submenu (i.e., submenu of menu ), as shown. In other examples, menu  may be a second, third, fourth, or a deeper level of submenu (e.g., a submenu of a fourth-level submenu).","In some examples, one or more parameters associated with menu  may be used to determine various aspects of an expandable user interface menu. Parameters associated with menu  may be the size, position, and dimensions of the menu, the number of menu items  and , the size, position, and dimensions of application window  in which the menu  is shown, and other properties associated with menu . For example, when an input is received for selecting menu item , one or more parameters associated with menu  are determined before expanding menu . In some examples, if there is insufficient space, for example, between the bottom edge of menu  and the bottom border of application window , menu portion  may be expanded to the right or left of menu  instead of downwards as shown.","In some examples, one or more selection may be performed by keyboard shortcuts. For example, a user may use keyboard shortcuts to select the \u201cFormat\u201d menu , the \u201cFont Size >\u201d menu , or the \u201cOther . . . \u201d menu item , which causes menu portion  to be expanded and displayed with input controls . Here, a text box input control  may be interfaced by a keyboard or by a GUI control (e.g., control pointer , ). For example, a user may type in a number (e.g., \u201c86\u201d) to the text box input control  or use a GUI control to interface the text box input control  (e.g., manipulate the arrows shown next to the input control) to arrive at a desirable data (e.g., \u201c86\u201d). To accept the entered data (i.e., \u201c86\u201d), a user may activate the \u201cApply\u201d input control  (e.g., with a GUI control or keyboard shortcut). Again, menu items  may remain displayed, providing a user an option of selecting one of the given font sizes presented (i.e., displayed) as menu items . Notice the small amount of display space used by menu portion  to display input controls . Here, parameters such as the number of input controls  and the sizes of input controls  may be used to determine a layout of menu portion  to minimize or reduce any disruptions to the user experience.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 3A","b":["310","325","325"],"i":"a"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 3B","b":["310","325","325","360","310","365","360","370","370","380","385","370","365","385","325"],"i":["b ","b ","b ","b ","b","b ","b ","b ","b","b ","b "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 3C","b":["310","325","325","360","310","365","360","370","380","385","370","310","310","360","365","385"],"i":["c ","c ","c ","c ","c","c ","c ","c","c ","c","c ","c "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 3D","b":["310","325","360","365","360","370","360"],"i":["d ","c ","d ","d ","d ","d "]},"In general, a menu portion may be expanded substantially adjacent to a menu in any location or in any direction (e.g., above, below, to the right, to the left, or near a corner of a menu).
