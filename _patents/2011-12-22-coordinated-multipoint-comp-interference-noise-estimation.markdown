No. 61\/430,879, filed Jan. 7, 2011.","Wireless mobile communication technology uses various standards and protocols to transmit data between a base transceiver station (BTS) and a wireless mobile device. Some wireless devices communicate using an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) digital modulation scheme via a physical layer. OFDM standards and protocols can include the third generation partnership project (3GPP) long term evolution (LTE), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.16 standard (e.g., 802.16e, 802.16m), which is commonly known to industry groups as WiMax (Worldwide interoperability for Microwave Access), and the IEEE 802.11 standard, which is commonly known to industry groups as WiFi. In 3GPP radio access networks (RANs) in LTE systems, the BTS can be a combination of evolved Node Bs (also commonly denoted as enhanced Node Bs, eNode Bs, or eNBs) and Radio Network Controllers (RNCs) in a Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN), which communicates with the wireless mobile device, known as a user equipment (UE). Both the BTS and wireless mobile device can transmit and receive data. The transmitting station (Transmitter or Tx) can transmit data via a signal on a channel to a receiving station (Receiver or Rx), where a channel uses a specified frequency bandwidth. The transmitted signal on the channel from the transmitter can vary from the received signal at the receiver due to noise and interference. Estimating the effects of the channel in an OFDM signal can improve data transmission between wireless devices. The BTS can be grouped together with other BTSs in a Coordinated MultiPoint (CoMP) system where BTSs from multiple cells can transmit signals to the mobile communication device and receive signals from the mobile communication device.","Reference will now be made to the exemplary embodiments illustrated, and specific language will be used herein to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended.","Before the present invention is disclosed and described, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular structures, process steps, or materials disclosed herein, but is extended to equivalents thereof as would be recognized by those ordinarily skilled in the relevant arts. It should also be understood that terminology employed herein is used for the purpose of describing particular examples only and is not intended to be limiting. The same reference numerals in different drawings represent the same element.

The term matrix and vector may be used interchangeably. A matrix (plural matrices) can be a rectangular array of numbers, symbols, or expressions. A vector (or vector space) can be a mathematical structure formed by a collection of vectors: objects that may be added together and multiplied (\u201cscaled\u201d) by numbers, called scalars.","An initial overview of technology embodiments is provided below and then specific technology embodiments are described in further detail later. This initial summary is intended to aid readers in understanding the technology more quickly but is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the technology nor is it intended to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","A non-cooperating interference noise covariance matrix can be generated directly using channel-state information reference signals (CSI-RSs) with coordinated muting of resource elements (REs) of cooperating transmitting stations in a Coordinated MultiPoint (CoMP) system, or generated indirectly using cell-specific reference signal (CRS) and channel matrices for each cooperating transmitting station in the CoMP system where the channel matrices can be measured using CSI-RS.","In an example of direct non-cooperating noise and interference estimation, the noise and interference estimator calculates the interference noise covariance matrix {circumflex over (R)}based on the CSI-RS with coordinated muting of the cooperating evolved NodeB (eNB) (or remote radio equipments [RREs]) on the REs occupied by CSI-RS. The serving eNB (or RRE) is not muted during the measurement of the CSI-RS. Thus after subtracting a product of a channel estimate of a serving eNB (or RRE) \u0125 and a transmitted CSI-RS rfrom signal y, the noise that remains provides the non-cooperative interference noise covariance matrix {circumflex over (R)}that represents the desired interference noise from the non-cooperating eNB's. The direct non-cooperative interference noise covariance matrix {circumflex over (R)}can be represented by {circumflex over (R)}=E{(y\u2212\u0125\u00b7r)(y\u2212\u0125\u00b7r)}.","In an example of indirect non-cooperating noise and interference estimation, the noise and interference estimator calculates the total interference noise covariance matrix {circumflex over (R)}(including cooperating eNBs) using CRS. The channel matrices gfor each cooperating eNB can be measured using CSI-RS. A power ratio of CSI-RS to CRS for each cooperating eNB, \u03bb, can be calculated at the eNB and sent to the UE. The \u03bbwith the channel matrix gfor each eNB can be summed together and subtracted from the total interference noise covariance matrix {circumflex over (R)}providing the noncooperative interference noise covariance matrix {circumflex over (R)}. The indirect non-cooperative interference noise covariance matrix {circumflex over (R)}can be represented by",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msubsup":{"mover":{"mi":"R","mo":"^"},"mi":["ni","out"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"E","mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["{","}"],"mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"y","mo":"-","mrow":{"mover":{"mi":"h","mo":"^"},"mo":"\u00b7","mi":"r"}}},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"y","mo":"-","mrow":{"mover":{"mi":"h","mo":"^"},"mo":"\u00b7","mi":"r"}}},"mi":"H"}}}},{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mi":"k"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":[{"mi":["\u03bb","k"]},{"mi":["g","k"]}],"mo":"\u00b7"},{"msubsup":{"mi":["g","k","H"]},"mo":"."}],"mo":"\u2062"}}],"mo":"-"}}}}},"In one example, data in wireless mobile communications can be transmitted on the physical (PHY) layer by the transmitting station (Transmitter or Tx) to the receiving station (Receiver or Rx) using a generic long term evolution (LTE) frame structure, as illustrated in . While an LTE frame structure is illustrated, a frame structure for an IEEE 802.16 standard (WiMax), an IEEE 802.11 standard (WiFi), or another type of communication standard using OFDM may also be used.","In the example illustrated in , a radio frame  of a signal used to transmit the data can be configured to have a duration, T, of 10 milliseconds (ms). Each radio frame can be segmented or divided into ten subframes that are each 1 ms long. Each subframe can be further subdivided into two slots and , each with a duration, T, of 0.5 ms. The first slot (#0) can include a physical downlink control channel (POOCH)  and a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) , and the second slot (#1) can include data using the PDSCH. Each slot for a component carrier (CC) used by the transmitting station and the receiving station can include multiple resource blocks (RBs) , , , , and based on the CC frequency bandwidth. Each RB (physical RB or PRB) can include 12-15 kHz subcarriers  (on the frequency axis) and 6 or 7 orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) symbols  (on the time axis) per subcarrier. The RB can use seven OFDM symbols if a short or normal cyclic prefix is employed. The RB can use six OFDM symbols if an extended cyclic prefix is used. The resource block can be mapped to 84 resource elements (REs) using short or normal cyclic prefixing, or the resource block can be mapped to 72 REs (not shown) using extended cyclic prefixing. The RE can be a unit of one OFDM symbol  by one subcarrier (i.e., 15 kHz) . Each RE can transmit two bits and of information in the case of quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) modulation. Other types of modulation, such as 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) or 64 QAM, may be used to transmit a greater number of bits in each RE. The RB can be configured for a downlink transmission from the eNode B to the UE, or the RB can be configured for an uplink transmission from the UE to the eNode B.","Reference signals can be transmitted by OFDM symbols via resource elements in the resource blocks. Reference signals (or pilot signals or tones) can be a known signal used to estimate a channel and\/or noise in the channel. Reference signals can be received and transmitted by transmitting stations and mobile communication devices. Different types of reference signals (RS) can be used in a RB. For example, in LTE systems, downlink reference signal types can include a cell-specific reference signal (CRS), a multicast\\broadcast single-frequency network (MBSFN) reference signal, a UE-specific reference signal (UE-RS) or a demodulation reference signal (DMRS), positioning reference signal (PRS), and a channel-state information reference signal (CSI-RS).  illustrates a RB  with CRS for antenna port 0 in a two antenna port wireless transceiver. As illustrated in , the RB may include CRS REs (cell-specific reference signal OFDM symbols) used for transmitting CRSs for a specific antenna port (antenna port 0) and unused REs (unused OFDM symbols)  not used for transmission on the specific port, which allow other antenna ports to transmit their reference signals.  illustrates the CRS REs  in a RB  used for transmitting CRSs for antenna port 1, which can be located in the REs with the same frequency-domain index and time-domain index as unused REs for antenna port 0. So, the CRSs of antenna port 0 are transmitted on the REs with the same frequency-domain index and time-domain index as unused REs for antenna port 1, and the CRSs of antenna port 1 are transmitted on the REs with the same frequency-domain index and time-domain index as unused REs for antenna port 0. The number of reference signal REs and unused REs used in the RB can depend on the number of antenna ports and type of reference signal being transmitted.","The CRS can be transmitted on antenna ports 0 and 1 for transmitter with two or mode antennas. CRS can be transmitted in downlink subframes in a cell supporting a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH). Data is transmitted from an eNode B to a UE via a PDSCH. A physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) is used to transfer downlink control information (DCI) that informs the UE about resource allocations or scheduling related to downlink resource assignments on the PDSCH, uplink resource grants, and uplink power control commands. The PDCCH can be transmitted prior to the PDSCH in each subframe transmitted from the eNode B to the UE.","The channel-state information reference signal (CSI-RS) can be transmitted on antenna ports 15 to 22 and can be used for downlink channel estimation in downlink channel state information measurements.","Both CRSs and CSI-RSs can be used in a Coordinated MultiPoint (CoMP) system (also known as multi-BS multiple input multiple output [MIMO]) to provide noise and interference estimation.  illustrates an example of an inter-site CoMP system . The CoMP system in  is illustrated as a plurality of cooperating transmitting stations (outlined with a bold line) surrounded by a plurality of non-cooperating transmitting stations. In a CoMP system, the transmitting stations can be grouped together as cooperating transmitting stations A-C in adjacent cells, where the cooperating transmitting stations from multiple cells can transmit signals to the mobile communication device  and receive signals from the mobile communication device, as illustrated in  for an inter-site CoMP system . The transmitting station can include a BTS, a base station (BS), an eNode B, a relay station (RS), a remote radio unit (RRU), a remote radio equipment (RRE), and so forth. The mobile communication device can include at least a UE or a mobile station (MS). The BTS, BS, or eNode B can provide signaling over an optical fiber or wired transmission path or connection to an RS, RRU, or RRE. The BTS, BS, or eNode B can provide signaling over an optical fiber or a wired transmission path or connection to other BTSs, BSs, or eNode Bs. Each transmitting station can serve multiple cells (or sectors) A-K, A-K, and A-K. The cell can be a logical definition generated by the transmitting station or geographic transmission area or sub-area (within a total coverage area) covered by the transmitting station, which can include a specific cell identification (ID) that defines the parameters for the cell, such as control channels, reference signals, and component carriers (CC) frequencies. By coordinating transmission among multiple cells, interference from other cells can be reduced and the received power of the desired signal can be increased. The cooperating transmitting stations can coordinate transmission\/reception of signals from\/to the mobile communication device. The transmitting stations outside the CoMP system can be non-cooperating transmitting stations D-K.","Downlink CoMP transmission can be divided into two categories: coordinated scheduling or coordinated beamforming (CS\/CB or CS\/CBF), and joint processing or joint transmission (JP\/JT). With CS\/CB, a given subframe can be transmitted from one cell to a given mobile communication device (UE), and the scheduling, including coordinated beamforming, is dynamically coordinated between the cells in order to control and\/or reduce the interference between different transmissions. For joint processing, joint transmission can be performed by multiple cells to a mobile communication device (UE), in which multiple transmitting stations transmit at the same time using the same time and frequency radio resources and dynamic cell selection. Two methods can be used for joint transmission: non-coherent transmission, which uses soft-combining reception of the OFDM signal; and coherent transmission, which performs precoding between cells for in-phase combining at the receiver. By coordinating and combining signals from multiple antennas, CoMP, allows mobile users to enjoy consistent performance and quality for high-bandwidth services whether the mobile user is close to the center of a cell or at the outer edges of the cell.","In both a CoMP system and non-CoMP system, the CSI-RS can be used for noise and interference estimation by the mobile communication device (or wireless device). In a CoMP system, each cooperating transmitting station can transmit CSI-RS in a RB, as illustrated in  for a two CSI-RS antenna port transmitter. The CSI-RS of a cooperating transmitting station can be transmitted with or without RE muting by other cooperating transmitting stations.","With RE muting, a CSI-RS for a cell can be transmitted by each cooperating transmitting station while remaining cooperating transmitting stations mute transmission of REs with the same frequency-domain index and the same time-domain index as the CSI-RS transmitted by the cooperating transmitting station. For example  illustrate an example CSI-RS configuration with RE coordinated muting (within a physical resource block (PRB)) for three cooperating cells or transmitting stations in a in a CoMP environment. A RB  of a first transmitting station can include a CSI-RS (RS) , which can occupy 2 REs, and unused REs (X)  in a RB location (with the same frequency-domain index and the same time-domain index) of a CSI-RS (RS) from a second transmitting station and a CSI-RS (RS) from a third transmitting station, as illustrated in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 4B","FIG. 4C","FIGS. 4A-4C"],"b":["254","274","270","256","276","270"],"sub":["2","3","1","2","3"]},"In contrast, the CSI-RS of a cooperating transmitting station can be transmitted without RE muting by other cooperating transmitting stations. For example,  illustrates a RB  of the first transmitting station with the CSI-RS (RS)  without muting of REs.  illustrates a RB  of the second transmitting station with the CSI-RS (RS)  without muting of REs.  illustrates a RB  of the third transmitting station with the CSI-RS (RS)  without muting of REs. Thus, other cooperating transmitting stations may generate interference during the transmission of the CSI-RSs (RS, RS, and RS).","In another example, CoMP transmission and reception allows for fractional frequency reuse (FFR). FFR can be a control method which assigns different frequency ranges (CC frequencies, channels, or sub-channels) for a cell-edge (or edge cell) transmission than an inner cell (or center cell) transmission to reduce interference from adjacent cells during transmission to a mobile communication device located on a cell-edge. For example,  illustrates an example of an inner cell (or center cell) A-B that represents an area in space (a geographic area) near the transmitting station where the transmission power and signal can be strong and a co-channel interference can be minimal. A cell-edge (or edge cell) A-B can be area near to the boundary of the cell where the transmission power and signal is weaker than an inner cell signal and the co-channel interference can be more significant. An inner cell mobile communication device  within the inner cell A of a first cell A can transmit and receive signals on the same inner cell frequency range (CC frequencies, channels, or sub-channels) as another mobile communication device (not shown) within the inner cell B of a second cell BA (or another cell) without any coordination between adjacent transmitting stations. Each cell can transmit and receive signals on the same inner cell frequency range because the transmission power and interference from an adjacent transmitting station within the inner cell can be minimal.","In contrast, a cell-edge mobile communication device  may be within both the cell-edge A of the first cell A and the cell-edge B of the second cell B. The first cell and second cell can allocate a subset of a total frequency bandwidth (CC frequencies, channels, or sub-channels) available to the cells for transmitting and receiving signals which are coordinated between cooperating transmitting stations (or adjacent transmitting stations). The cooperating transmitting stations may share use of the same cell-edge frequencies. In an example of coordinated scheduling, the coordination may allow one cooperating transmitting station (or cooperating cell) to transmit on a cell-edge frequency for a time period while the other cooperating transmitting stations (or cooperating cells) cease transmission for the duration of the time period on the cell-edge frequency. Then another cooperating transmitting station may take a turn using the cell-edge frequency while other cooperating transmitting station mute their transmissions on the cell-edge frequency, thus allowing cooperating transmitting station to share the cell-edge frequency. By coordinating transmission among multiple cooperating transmitting stations (or cooperating cells), interference from other cells can be reduced and the power of the desired signal can be increased.","Alternatively in an inter-site CoMP example, FFR can be used to assign different frequency ranges for site-edge (or edge site) transmission than inner site (or center site) transmission, as illustrated in . A site can be associated with a transmitting station A-C. A mobile communication device  can be located within a site-edge area A-C which can overlap with other site-edge area, or a mobile communication device  can be located within an inner site area A-C. A site-edge transmission may be coordinated between cooperating transmitting stations.","In an intra-site CoMP example illustrated in , RRUs of an eNode B may located at different locations in space, and CoMP coordination may be within a single eNode B. A cell A of an eNode B may be further sub-divided into sub-cells , , and . RRUs , , and  may transmit and receive signals for a sub-cell. RRUs  and  may transmit and receive signals for a cell A and A. A mobile communication device  can be on a sub-cell edge (or cell-edge) and intra-site CoMP coordination can occur between the RRUs.  illustrates an example wherein each sub-cell may have an inner sub-cell space , , or  and a sub-cell edge space , , or  with different frequencies assigned to the inner sub-cell space and the sub-cell edge space. Similarly, each cell may have an inner cell space  and cell-edge space  with different frequencies assigned to the inner cell space and the cell-edge space.","A transmitting station with CoMP functionality can perform signal processing for coordinated transmission and reception by multiple cells to one or more mobile communication device. For example, CoMP transmission and reception can be implemented as autonomous distributed control based on an independent eNode B configuration, or centralized control based on RRUs or RREs. With an independent eNode B configuration, signaling over wired\/fiber or wireless transmission paths can be used between multiple eNode Bs to coordinate among cells, as illustrated in . With RRE configurations, multiple connected RREs carry a baseband signal between cells and the central eNode B, which performs the baseband signal processing and control, so the radio resources between the cells can be controlled at the central eNode B, as illustrated in .","A wireless communication system can be subdivided into various sections referred to as layers. In the LTE system, communication layers can include the physical (PHY), media access control (MAC), radio link control (RLC), packet data convergence protocol (PDCP), and radio resource control (RRC) layers. The physical layer can include the basic hardware transmission components of a wireless communication system , as illustrated in . A basic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system is used for simplicity in illustrating the basic hardware transmission components, but the components can also be adapted for a SISO system or similar system. For example in a MIMO system, at the transmitter , binary input data  can be protected through encoding using a channel encoder , interleaved against fading phenomenon using an interleaver , and mapped to improve reliability using a mapper . The mapped data can be separated into layers for antenna ports by a transmitter (TX) beamformer  and the layers can be OFDM modulated into OFDM symbols using modulators A-B. The modulators can use an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) algorithm to compute the inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) to generate modulated signals (vector x for each antenna port). The modulated signals can be converted to analog signals with digital-to-analog converters (DACs) A-B. The analog signals can be transmitted via radio frequency (RF) transmitters (TXs) A-B configured to send the signal to transmitter antennas A-B operable to communicate the signal. The analog signals will follow a path referred to as a channel. The analog signals travelling through that path can be referred to as a channel signal . The physical layer can include other components (not shown), such as series-to-parallel (SIP) converters, parallel-to-serial (PIS) converters, cyclic prefix (CP) inserters and deleters, guardband inserters and deleters, and other desired components.","The transmitted channel signal  can be subject to noise  and interference . The noise and interference is represented as an addition  to the channel signal, which can be received by receiver antennas A-B and a radio frequency (RF) receivers (RXs) A-B at the receiver . The channel signal combined with the noise and interference can be converted to a digital modulated signal with analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) A-B. The digital signal can be OFDM demodulated using demodulators A-B. The demodulators can use a fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm to compute the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to generate demodulated signals (vector y for each antenna port). A noise and interference estimator  can use the demodulated signal to estimate the channel  and the noise  and interference  that occurs in the channel and provide noise and interference estimation. The noise and interference estimator can generate a non-cooperating interference noise covariance matrix for use in a CoMP environment. The non-cooperating interference noise covariance matrix can be an input to a feedback generator , which can generate a feedback report, such as a channel quality indicator (CQI) report, a preceding matrix indicator (PMI) report, or a transmission rank indicator (RI) report. The CQI can be used to assist the MIMO transmissions modes. The demodulated signals can be combined using a HMO decoder , demapped using a demapper , deinterleaved using a deinterleaver , and decoded by a channel decoder  to generate binary output data  that can be used by other layers of the receiving station.","The non-cooperating interference noise covariance matrix can be calculated directly using the CSI-RS with coordinated muting of REs of the cooperating transmitting station in the CoMP system, or generated indirectly using CRS and channel matrices for each cooperating transmitting station in the CoMP system where the channel matrices can be measured using CSI-RS.","In an inner cell or a single-cell (without CoMP or coordination), the transmitted signal can be distributed by the channel to the several receive antennas (as in a MIMO system) and disturbed by additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). A received signal vector y for each antenna port can be represented by y=h\u00b7r+n where r is the transmitted reference signal. An estimated channel \u0125 for each antenna port is vector with complex entries which can account for the random fluctuations and the random phase shifts of the channel transfer characteristics. The vector y can represent the (N\u00d71) received signal at the antenna array at the receiver, where N is a number of receiving antennas. A vector n can be the (N\u00d71) complex noise vector.","In non-CoMP system, channel state information (CSI), which includes the CQI, PMI, and RI, can be calculated by a mobile communication device based on channel measurements \u0125 for each antenna port from a serving transmitting station, and an interference and noise estimation or covariance matrix {circumflex over (R)}from other interfering transmitting stations and sources. The channel estimation matrix \u0125 can be obtained from the received signal vector y on the resource elements (REs) occupied by cell-specific reference signal (CRS) r, which can be determined at the mobile communication device. The interference estimation {circumflex over (R)}may also be obtained from the received signal vector y by using the estimated channel \u0125 and the CRS r, transmitted by the serving transmitting station. For example, the estimation of the interference noise covariance matrix {circumflex over (R)}represented by Equation 1, shown below, can be calculated using a noise and interference estimator where E{ } is an averaging procedure over REs occupied by reference signals of different antenna ports in a given time-frequency resource(s), such as a RB, ( )is a Hermitian function or a conjugate transpose, y is a received signal of the CRS, \u0125 is an estimated channel for the serving transmitting station using the CRS, and ris the CRS transmitted by the serving transmitting station. The noise and interference estimator can measure the residual interference noise after subtraction of the CRS signal \u0125\u00b7rtransmitted by the serving transmitting station from the total received CRS signal vector y. For the inner cell or a single-cell scenario, the estimated interference noise covariance matrix can include aggregated interference from the interfering transmitting stations transmitting in the same time-frequency resource (e.g., RB) as the serving transmitting station.\n\n{()()}\u2003\u2003[Equation 1]\n","In the multi-cell systems with coordination (or CoMP systems), calculating the CSI can use a separate interference noise estimation for cooperating transmitting station of the CoMP system and the other remaining transmitting stations (non-cooperating transmitting stations), which are not involved in a beamforming coordination. The interference noise from cooperating transmitting stations can include the channels matrices gfrom each cooperating transmitting station(k) (eNB) involved in the coordination, where k is an integer representing each transmitting station in the coordination. For obtaining the channel estimation \u0125 for each antenna port, the channel measurement for the coordinated transmitting station(k) may follow a similar channel measurement procedure as is used for the serving transmitting station using references signals, such as the CRS or CSI-RS. The interference noise from the other remaining transmitting stations outside the CoMP system can consist of an aggregated non-cooperating interference noise covariance matrix {circumflex over (R)}, which represents a part of the interfering transmitting stations which are not involved in the coordination. So compared with inner cell or a single-cell aggregated noise and interference {circumflex over (R)}, a non-cooperating interference noise covariance matrix {circumflex over (R)}excludes the interference from cooperating transmitting stations.","A total interference noise estimation based on CRS calculates the total aggregated noise and interference {circumflex over (R)}from the interfering transmitting stations, including the cooperating transmitting stations. The total interference noise covariance matrix {circumflex over (R)}includes both the non-cooperating interference noise covariance matrix {circumflex over (R)}and a cooperating interference noise covariance matrix. The total interference noise estimation may not be used for CSI calculation in a coordinated beamforming scheme (or other type of coordination) because the total interference noise estimation may not account for the CoMP environment. Thus, the mobile communication device estimates the non-cooperating interference noise covariance matrix {circumflex over (R)}corresponding to the CoMP environment mobile for a CSI calculation.","The non-cooperating interference noise covariance matrix {circumflex over (R)}can be calculated directly or indirectly. In direct non-cooperating noise and interference estimation, the mobile communication device can use the CSI-RS (instead of the CRS) with enabled coordinated muting of the cooperating transmitting stations on the REs occupied by CSI-RS for the interference noise measurement, as illustrated in . Enabled coordinated muting facilitates the generation of the interference measurement from the transmitting stations which are not involved in the coordination. With the enabled coordinated muting of the cooperating transmitting stations on the REs occupied by CSI-RS, the CSI-RS may experience interference from other remaining transmitting stations (non-cooperating transmitting stations) which are not involved in the coordination. In the CSI-RS with the RE muting configuration, a noise and interference estimator applied on the CSI-RS can provide the non-cooperating interference noise covariance matrix estimate {circumflex over (R)}for the transmitting stations (non-cooperating transmitting stations) outside the cooperating set.","For example, the non-cooperating interference noise covariance matrix estimate {circumflex over (R)}can be represented by Equation 2, shown below, where, y is a received signal on the CSI-RS, \u0125 is an estimated channel for the serving transmitting station using the CSI-RS, and ris the CSI-RS transmitted by the serving transmitting station. If the estimation is performed using the CSI-RS the estimated interference noise {circumflex over (R)}may include the desired interference noise from non-cooperative cells (or non-cooperating transmitting stations).\n\n{()()}\u2003\u2003[Equation 2]\n","In indirect non-cooperating noise and interference estimation, the non-cooperating interference noise covariance matrix estimate {circumflex over (R)}can be generated by the total interference noise covariance matrix {circumflex over (R)}(based on CRS) minus interference channel measurements (based on CSI-RS) for cooperating transmitting stations represented by Equation 3, where y is a received signal on the CRS, \u0125 is an estimated channel for the serving transmitting station using the CRS, r is the CRS transmitted by the serving transmitting station, and \u03bbis a power weighting factor for each cooperating transmitting station (or cooperating cell) and \u011dis a channel estimation for each cooperating transmitting station (or cooperating cell) where k is a positive integer representing each cooperating transmitting station (or cooperating cell).

First, the estimator can obtain a least square estimation of h on each RE where CSI-RS is transmitted represented by \u0125=y\/r, where r is a CSI-RS sequence of the serving transmitting station. The CSI-RS (or other RS) can be transmitted in each RB of the downlink subframe. Second, the estimator can filter the least square estimates hacross the RBs to obtain the final channel estimation \u0125. Filtering can be performed using a Wiener filter that can minimize the mean square error of an estimation. Filtering can exploit the phenomenon that the channel is usually correlated on the neighboring subcarriers. A cooperating transmitting station channel estimation gcan be performed in a similar way as the serving transmitting station channel estimation \u0125. In the cooperating transmitting station channel estimation, the estimator can apply a similar process to the estimation of g, but the CSI-RS of the other cooperating transmitting stations (or neighboring cells) can be used instead of the CSI-RS of the serving transmitting station to estimate g.","Indirect non-cooperating noise and interference estimation can use CSI-RS without muting of other REs in a RB, as illustrated in , or use CSI-RS with muting of the REs in the same time-frequency location in a RB occupied by the CSI-RS of other cooperating transmitting stations, as illustrated in . In indirect non-cooperating noise and interference estimation, RE muting () is not a mandatory requirement, but can be used to reduce interference on CSI-RS from cooperating cells and improve accuracy of the gchannel measurement.","A noise and interference estimator ( of ) in a user equipment (UE) for a coordinated multipoint (CoMP) system can include an estimating module, a cooperating interference measurement module, a power factor weighting module, and a summing module. The estimating module can estimate a total interference noise covariance matrix using cell-specific reference signals (CRS) and generate a cooperating channel matrix for each cooperating transmitting station in the CoMP system from a channel state information reference signal (CSI-RS). The cooperating interference measurement module can determine a cooperating interference channel measurement from each cooperating transmitting station. The cooperating interference measurement module can generate a conjugate transpose cooperating channel matrix and multiply each cooperating channel matrix by a conjugate transpose cooperating channel matrix to form a cooperating interference channel measurement. The power factor weighting module can receive a cooperating weighting factor for each cooperating interference channel measurement from each cooperating transmitting station. The cooperating weighting factor can compensate for a power difference between the CRS and CSI-RS. The summing module can sum each cooperating interference channel measurement to form a cooperating interference channel measurement sum and subtract the cooperating interference channel measurement sum from the total interference noise covariance matrix to form a non-cooperating interference noise covariance matrix. When the power factor weighting module is used, the cooperating interference measurement module can multiply the cooperating weighting factor by the cooperating interference channel measurement and the summing module can add each cooperating interference channel measurement with the cooperating weighting factor to form a cooperating interference channel measurement sum.","The noise and interference estimator ( of ) may be used to estimate the original channel \u0125 serving transmitting station in an OFDM transmission, the total interference noise covariance matrix {circumflex over (R)}(including cooperating eNBs) using CRS, the non-cooperating interference noise covariance matrix estimate {circumflex over (R)}with RE muting using CSI-RS and without RE muting, and channel matrices gfor each cooperating transmitting station. The channel estimation \u0125 and the non-cooperating interference noise covariance matrix estimate {circumflex over (R)}can be used as an input for a channel quality indicator (CQI) report, a preceding matrix indicator (PMI) report, a transmission rank indicator (RI) report, and other feedback reports for use in a CoMP environment.","Another example provides a method  for estimating noise and interference in a coordinated multipoint (CoMP) system at a mobile communication device, as shown in the flow chart in .
