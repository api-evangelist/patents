title: Device for determining changes in dimension due to temperature fluctuation
abstract: An apparatus for non-destructively testing the response of a specimen to temperature change. An embodiment temperature cycles a specimen, such as a wet mortar beam, dynamically measuring change in dimension and the temperature of the specimen during the cycle. Among other elements, the apparatus employs an accelerometer, a thermistor, a thermocouple, a temperature controller, linear variable differential transducers (LVDTs), an FFT device, a data logger and a heat tape controller. A typical cycle involves using liquid nitrogen to reduce the temperature in an insulated test chamber from ambient to less than −60° C. and returning to ambient by dispersing the nitrogen with a source of ambient air. Further, in select embodiments, the apparatus measures fundamental frequencies induced by a micro-hammer as measured transversely along a dimension of a specimen during the cooling-warming cycle. Also provided is a method for testing specimens using devices representative of embodiments of the present invention.

This patent and related ones are available for licensing. Contact Sharon Borland at 703 428-9112 or Phillip Stewart at 601 634-4113.","A serious problem associated with installing concrete in cold climates is deterioration caused by freezing and thawing, commonly referred to as frost damage. Several theories have been developed to explain frost damage but it is recognized that such damage only happens to moist concrete. Damage occurs when water inside concrete freezes, causing swelling and micro-cracking. Repeated cycles of freezing and thawing cause the initial cracks to grow and coalesce into larger cracks that eventually manifest themselves on the surface.","The current method of testing the resistance of concrete to frost damage is to subject concrete specimens to repeated cycles of freezing and thawing inside a cabinet specially designed for that purpose. Typically, the test specimens are cycled between 40\u00b0 F. and 0\u00b0 F. and back again in not less than two or more than five hours. The testing continues until the specimens have been subjected to 300 cycles or until they have failed (ASTM C 666). This is both time consuming and expensive.","When a concrete specimen is cooled much below 0\u00b0 C., certain transformations occur. The specimen shrinks initially, but at temperatures below 0\u00b0 C., it expands suddenly. Further cooling causes it to shrink again until cooled to a very low temperature where it expands once more. In general, as a specimen cools it will gradually stiffen causing it to vibrate at successively higher frequencies. At the onset of freezing when a specimen expands suddenly, it vibrates at a higher frequency than before it expanded. This may be due to ice forming in the pores, the concrete stiffening and manifesting this as a higher fundamental frequency of vibration.","Concrete, when frozen, is considered to be frost susceptible if it dilates and to be resistant to frost action if it does not dilate. Thus, a device that measures the change in length of concrete specimens as they are cooled would enable the relative freeze-thaw durability of concrete to be determined. This may be possible within as little as a single freeze-thaw cycle. If dilation occurs, the deterioration process has begun and the concrete will fail with additional freezing and thawing cycles. Further, initial dilation may not be visible as cracks, although the larger the initial dilation, the more frost susceptible is the concrete. However, it is possible that a specimen that dilates during a single freeze-thaw cycle can return to its original length. If this happens, one may conclude that no frost damage has occurred and that the specimen is durable. Thus, a device designed to monitor length changes throughout a freeze-thaw cycle would be beneficial in determining the susceptibility of various forms of concrete to frost damage. Further, a device that measures the fundamental frequency of vibration of the \u201cexcited\u201d specimen subjected to a cooling regimen as above provides another non-destructive means for detecting and correlating these cooling-warming cycles.","An apparatus is provided for dynamically determining changes in dimension of a specimen caused by temperature variation. An embodiment of the present invention comprises means for simultaneously subjecting at least three like a specimens to at least one cycle of cooling and warming; means for sensing and reporting temperature to enable control thereof, means for detecting and reporting change in at least one dimension of a first like specimen during the cycling; means for detecting and reporting the instantaneous temperature of a second like specimen during the cycling, means for impacting at least a third like specimen in order to cause vibration therein; and means for detecting and reporting at least the frequency of the vibration.","In select embodiments of the present invention, the means for subjecting comprises one or more base plates; at least an innermost and one outer enclosures; means for support disposed on the base plates, so as to hold the enclosures on the base plate; means for retaining specimens, the means for retaining disposed within at least one of the enclosures; means for insulating at least one of the enclosures; coolant; air; at least one programmable proportional temperature controller to control the amount of air and coolant provided to the air gap around the innermost enclosure; one or more thermistors, in operable communication with the controller and at least one of the specimens, held in the innermost enclosure; one or more needle valves in operable communication with the temperature controller; and one or more insulated lines in operable communication with the needle valves, the insulated line providing coolant from an external source, such as a liquid nitrogen bottle.","The means for support may comprise blocks at the corners of an outermost of the enclosures. The means for retaining may comprise one or more biased rods disposed at each of two opposing ends of the first like specimen, one or more rollers disposed beneath each of the first and second like specimens and a fixed support disposed beneath the third like specimen. The means for retaining may further comprise one or more tubes in which the biased rods are enclosed, the tube in operable communication with at least one of the enclosures.","The means for insulating may comprise one or more outer enclosures disposed to maintain one or more air gaps between at least an innermost of the enclosures and an outer one of the enclosures and insulation material disposed adjacent at least one inner surface of an outer one of the enclosures so as to form an air gap between the insulation and the innermost enclosure. Coolant such as liquid nitrogen may be used to control the temperature of the innermost enclosure.","In select embodiments of the present invention, the means for detecting and reporting change in dimension comprises one or more linear variable differential transducers (LVDTs) in contact with each biased rod. In select embodiments of the present invention, one or more data loggers are used to take the data from the LVDTs.","In select embodiments of the present invention, the biased rods are kept at or near ambient temperature by the use of one or more heat tape power supplies and heat tape wound around the tubes enclosing the biased rods.","In select embodiments of the present invention, means for measuring one or more fundamental frequencies of vibration of the third like specimens are provided. These means for measuring comprise: one or more micro-hammers disposed to contact the third like specimens at pre-specified times, one or more FFT devices to take data from the specimen and pass it to a data logger, and one or more accelerometers to provide data from the third like specimen to an FFT device.","In select embodiments of the present invention, the means for measuring temperature comprise: one or more thermocouples attached to the second like specimens, the output of the thermocouples fed to a data logger.","Also provided in an embodiment of the present invention is a method for measuring changes in dimension of a first specimen due to temperature fluctuation, the first specimen like each of a second and third specimen, comprising:","providing an apparatus comprising:\n\n","In select embodiments of the present invention, the method involves instrumenting a first specimen with a first control sensor comprising at least one thermistor for facilitating temperature control and a first detector mechanism comprising at least one linear variable differential transducer in operable communication one or more of the biased rods, instrumenting a second specimen with said second detector mechanism comprising at least one thermocouple, and instrumenting a third specimen with a third detector mechanism comprising at least one accelerometer for outputting data correlated with instantaneous frequency to an FFT device.","In select embodiments of the present invention, the method involves stimulating the third specimen via one or more micro-hammers striking the third specimen at pre-specified intervals to establish a fundamental frequency of response in the third specimen.","In select embodiments of the present invention, the method involves varying the temperature through at least one freeze-thaw cycle. In select embodiments of the present invention, the temperature is varied from ambient temperature to approximately \u221260\u00b0 C. and returned to ambient temperature over a pre-specified period via introducing a coolant to lower temperature and ambient air to raise temperature.","In select embodiments of the present invention, the method provides the specimens as mortar beams. In select embodiments of the present invention, the method provides the mortar beams as wet mortar beams.","An embodiment of the present invention provides an apparatus for non-destructively testing the response of a specimen to temperature change, such as a mortar beam susceptible to frost damage. An embodiment of the present invention comprises means for subjecting the specimen to at least one cycle of freezing and thawing, means for measuring a change in dimension of the specimen during the cycle, and means for measuring the temperature of the specimen during the cycle. Further, in select embodiments of the present invention, the apparatus measures fundamental frequencies induced by a micro-hammer as measured transversely along a dimension of the specimen during the cooling-warming cycle.","An embodiment of the present invention also provides a method of non-destructively testing the response of a specimen to temperature change, such as testing the resistance of a mortar beam to frost damage. An embodiment of the method comprises: subjecting three like specimens to at least one cycle of freezing and thawing, measuring a change in dimension of a first one of the specimens during the cycle; measuring the temperature of a second one of the specimens during the cycle; impacting one or more times a third one of the specimens to establish one or more resonant signals; and determining the frequency of the one or more resonant signals resultant from the impacts.","Refer to . In select embodiments of the present invention, the apparatus  includes a test chamber in the form of an external box  (in  shown as a cutaway to reveal internal components). The external box  may be constructed of any suitably robust material, such as plywood. The external box  is supported on a base plate  by blocks  placed at its four corners. The base plate  and the blocks  are made from any suitably robust material, such as aluminum. For purposes such as leveling or providing space under the base plate  for easily grasping the apparatus  for moving, adjustable feet  are threaded into the base plate . The inside walls, floor, and top cover of the external box  are lined with suitable insulation , such as extruded polystyrene. Inboard of the insulation  is an air gap  around an internal box  (in  shown as a cutaway to reveal internal components), made from any suitably robust material, such as aluminum, for housing a test specimen, such as a beam  constructed from mortar. The air gap  separates the internal box  from the insulation .","The internal box  is cooled by nitrogen gas provided from liquid nitrogen (LN)  that flows in the air gap  between the inner box  and the insulation  that lines the inside of the outer box . A programmable proportional temperature controller , such as an OMEGA\u2122, Model 2001 temperature controller, regulates the internal chamber temperature by sensing a thermistor  (location shown in ) placed beneath the beam  at its approximate center. The nitrogen  flows from ports in a finned evaporator (not shown separately) behind the box . Flow is controlled by a needle valve  in an insulated line (not shown separately) connected to a liquid nitrogen tank (not shown separately) and to the finned evaporator. Air  is used to control the flow of liquid nitrogen through the needle valve . The temperature controller  regulates the opening on the needle valve  to set a pre-specified cooling rate.","Length change measurements are made with linear variable differential transducers , such as TRANS-TEK Series 350 transducers, that monitor the movement of rods  (shown in ) contacting either end of the beam  under test and that protrude out from the external box . The rods , which run inside a metal tube  shown in , are lightly spring loaded, such as shown in  with coil springs , to follow the beam  as it contracts and expands. The tube  is wrapped with heat tape  (not shown in , but indicated functionally in ) powered by a heat tape power supply  to assure that the rods  remain near ambient temperature. Thus, the measurements recorded by the transducers  do not have to be adjusted for thermal movement of the rods . As added assurance, the rods  may be fabricated from an alloy of low thermal expansion, such as the nickel-iron alloy INVAR\u2122. The two transducers  are connected to a data logger (not shown in , but indicated functionally in ), such as an OMNIDATA\u2122 Model 824 data logger. They may be set to read every minute.","Three beams , , , e.g., concrete beams made from the same mortar mixture, may be placed inside the box  for each test. The beams , ,  are supported at approximately the quarter points of their length. The first beam  is the beam under test. It is placed on rollers  (as shown in ) in the middle of the internal box . The rollers  are constructed of a suitably robust material such as nylon.","The second beam , reference specimen A in , is instrumented with a thermocouple  (not shown in , but indicated functionally in ) at its center of mass. The second beam  is also placed on rollers  similar to that of the first beam  but at the back of the internal box . The rollers  are constructed of a suitably robust material such as nylon. The second beam  is instrumented to quantify the temperature of the other beams ,  used during testing.","A third beam , reference specimen B in , is placed on supports (not shown separately) at the front of the internal box . The supports are constructed of a suitably robust resilient material such as rubber. A solenoid-actuated micro-hammer  is disposed above the third beam . An accelerometer  (not shown in , but indicated functionally in ) is attached to one end of the third beam . The output from the accelerometer  is converted into a frequency response by a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) device  (not shown in , but indicated functionally in ), such as a model SA-77 RION\u2122 Signal Analyzer. The third beam  is used to measure the fundamental vibration frequency that would be experienced by the like first beam .","In operation, the contraction and expansion of the first beam  is recorded by continuously monitoring a dimension of the beam , such as the length of the beam , as it is cooled from ambient temperature to below \u221260\u00b0 C. and returned to ambient temperature. In addition, the fundamental vibration frequency of the beam  may be estimated during the cycle using a solenoid-actuated micro-hammer  to strike the like third beam  at pre-specified times.","Refer to . The relationship among major components of an embodiment of the present invention is displayed. Liquid nitrogen  is dispersed by a needle valve  in turn controlled by a controller  that uses the input from a thermistor  to maintain a pre-specified temperature profile.","The rods  () are maintained at a near-ambient temperature by heat provided by a heat tape power supply  to heat tape  wrapped about the immovable tube  in which the rods  are contained.","The micro-hammer  strikes the beam  (Ref. specimen B) to which an accelerometer  has been affixed at one end. The output of the accelerometer  is fed to an FFT device  and outputted to a data logger .","The test specimen (first beam)  is placed on rollers  between two biased rods  to each of which a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT)  is attached. The output of the LVDTs  is fed to a data logger .","The reference specimen A (second beam)  is fitted with a thermocouple  for taking temperature data as an estimate of the temperature of the test specimen (first beam) . The output of the thermocouple is fed to the data logger .","The ability of an embodiment of the present invention to accurately measure change in dimension was demonstrated with an aluminum alloy (6061-T6) of the same dimensions as a mortar beam  to be tested. Refer to  showing length-change curves for a cooling-heating cycle of an aluminum alloy beam (not shown separately). The two curves are linear with the exception of minor perturbations caused by the cooling system cycling. This demonstrates that the aluminum beam contracted and expanded linearly, the slope of the curves representing a measure of the thermal coefficient of the alloy. Although the cooling and warming curves did not exactly trace each other, this is inconsequential since measurements were obtained while the beam was changing temperature. Because the beam was not in thermal equilibrium, length change lagged temperature change. A manifestation of this lag is that the measured slope, 21.1\u00d710m\/\u00b0 C., does not quite match the value published for the alloy's established thermal coefficient of expansion, 23.0\u00d710m\/\u00b0 C. Lyman, T. (Ed.), 1, American Society for Metals, Metals Park, Ohio, 1961. For purposes of demonstration, the length-change line plotted nearly linear and the length change measurements returned to zero. The aluminum beam was tested three times and all three times it produced the same results.","Length changes were measured for wet and dry mortar beam specimens of approximate dimensions 12.7\u00d725.4\u00d7254 mm (0.5 in\u00d71.0 in.\u00d710 in.). Also measured was the change in response frequency of wet mortar as a function of temperature. Providing a relatively thin specimen (12.7 mm) assured temperature uniformity throughout the cross-section of the sample. Several calibrations prior to testing indicated the largest difference between the center and surface temperatures of 10\u00b0 C. This test recorded the contraction and expansion of the mortar beams as they froze and thawed. This was accomplished by continually monitoring the length of a beam  as it cooled from ambient temperature, i.e., 20\u00b0 C., to below \u221260\u00b0 C.","Refer to . The length change curve  for a \u201cwet\u201d mortar beam exhibited a pronounced hysteresis between cooling and warming and consisted of seven distinct regions, their endpoints identified by labels A through H. In region AB, on cooling between 20 and \u22125\u00b0 C., the wet mortar initially contracted linearly in the range of 9\u201315\u00d710m\/\u00b0 C., depending on the mortar. This compares favorably to published values for the thermal coefficient of expansion of mortar, 7\u201312\u00d710m\/\u00b0 C. A length-change curve  for an oven-dried mortar beam is also shown. The \u201cdry\u201d beam contracts linearly (as in curve ) at an average rate of 9\u00d710m\/\u00b0 C. down to \u221270\u00b0 C. and closely retraces (as in curve ) the contraction curve  back to ambient (20\u00b0 C.) temperature. Comparing the two curves ,  and the published values for coefficient of expansion, length changes in region AB for the \u201ccontrol\u201d curves are determined to be thermally induced.","In region BC, between approximately \u22125 and \u221220\u00b0 C., the wet mortar beam  expanded significantly. Some of this expansion may be caused by conversion of water to ice inside large capillary pores. The temperature at which ice first forms is considered the freezing point of the mortar. The expansion between \u22125 and \u221220\u00b0 C. is caused by water migrating from smaller pores to the bulk ice as well as the water freezing in the large capillaries. This accreting of ice in limited spaces causes expansive stress.","In region CD, most of the large capillary pores froze and water from the small pores continued to migrate to the locations of the bulk ice. This is equivalent to drying and is manifested as shrinkage. Thus, there were three processes occurring between approximately \u221220 and \u221240\u00b0 C.: thermal contraction of the matrix, shrinkage (contracting) due to drying within the small pores, and ice build up in the coarse pores (large capillaries). The net effect is contraction, though at a lower rate than at initiation.","In region DE, at approximately \u221240\u00b0 C., the wet mortar beam  expanded for a second time. This may be caused by water in the smaller pores freezing in place and generating hydraulic stress rather than migrating to the bulk ice.","On initiation of warming, as indicated by region EF, the wet mortar beam  again expanded, exhibiting significant expansion from approximately 60 to \u221220\u00b0 C. One might expect the beam to contract as ice in the smallest pores begins to melt and reduce in volume. However, the expansion of the mortar matrix in this region mimics that of region AB, i.e., the measured thermal coefficient is the same. A possible explanation for this expansion could be that both the un-melted ice in the coarse pores and the \u201ccement paste\u201d were thermally expanding, as they should as they warm, to counteract the decrease in volume of ice in the small pores. The net effect was the thermal expansion of the mortar matrix itself. It is also possible that the water that diffused from the small \u201cgel pores\u201d migrated back during thawing. It is not clear what mechanism was causing the mortar beam  to lengthen in this region, but it is clear that an embodiment of the present invention enables researchers to determine this in an efficient manner.","Melting of the ice in the larger pores causes the wet mortar to contract in the region FG. In this region, all of the small pores melted and reabsorbed water. The tensional force in the water in the small pores was reduced. Thus, the volume change of ice to water is the direct cause of the contraction measured between \u221220 and 0\u00b0 C.","At 0\u00b0 C. all ice had melted and normal thermal expansion predominated from 0 to 20\u00b0 C. It is significant to note that the wet mortar beam  did not return to its original length when warmed to ambient (20\u00b0 C.) temperature, exhibiting residual expansion that indicates permanent frost damage.","Thus, it can be stated that when concrete is cooled to temperatures below 0\u00b0 C., certain transformations occur. As noted above, the mortar beam specimen  shrunk initially, but at a certain temperature below 0\u00b0 C., it suddenly expanded. Further cooling caused it to shrink again until it cooled to a very low temperature, whereupon it expanded once more.  also shows a frequency response curve  of the change in frequency of the wet mortar beam  as a function of temperature. As expected, the wet mortar gradually stiffened as it cooled from 20 to 0\u00b0 C. and somewhat beyond. At the region BC where it suddenly expanded, the frequency sharply increased as well, as shown in the frequency response curve . This demonstrates that anomalies in the freezing process may be detected through frequency measurements and length changes correlated thereto. In this case, the wet mortar beam  exhibited a change in frequency response as it expanded while cooling over a certain temperature range. As can be seen from the frequency response curve , the frequency continued to increase until the specimen cooled to approximately \u221220\u00b0 C., mirroring the expansion in length. Between \u221220 and 40\u00b0 C., the specimen gradually increased in frequency, similar to the rate during initial cooling. From \u221240 to \u221270\u00b0 C., the specimen became stiffer, showing a scatter in the frequency response data. It is likely that ice forming within the small pores caused the scatter. Upon warming, the frequency response retraced the frequency response cooling curve  fairly well.","Accordingly, all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of this invention as defined in the following claims. In the claims, means-plus-function clauses are intended to cover the structures described herein as performing the recited function and not only structural equivalents, but also equivalent structures. Thus, although a nail and a screw may not be structural equivalents in that a nail employs a cylindrical surface to secure wooden parts together, whereas a screw employs a helical surface, in the environment of fastening wooden parts, a nail and a screw may be equivalent structures.","The abstract is provided to comply wit the rules requiring an abstract, which will allow a searcher to quickly ascertain the subject matter of the technical disclosure of any patent issued from this disclosure. 37 CFR \u00a7 1.72(b).
