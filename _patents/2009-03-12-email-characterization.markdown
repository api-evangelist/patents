title: Email characterization
abstract: Email users may feel overwhelmed with the abundance of emails they receive. Many current email management techniques require at least some manual intervention that may be time consuming and/or otherwise frustrating to a user. As provided herein, emails may be characterized based upon content of the email and domain classification data (e.g., a company name, business category, or a website name associated with the domain name of the sender). One or more viewing panels may be populated with the characterized emails. A viewing panel may present emails corresponding to a particular characterization (e.g., a shopping viewing panel may display emails characterized as shopping). To enhance characterization, rules used to characterize emails may learn from a user's actions. For example, a user may move an email from a shopping viewing panel to a travel viewing panel, thus altering the characterization of the email from shopping to travel.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Email users may feel overwhelmed by the amount of email they receive, and particularly by commercial emails that may come repeatedly from a sender. For example, an email user may sign up for weekly newsletters, social networking alerts, email purchase receipts, and\/or other emails. Many current email clients that host email viewing user interfaces may contribute to the overload of emails by presenting emails in an uncategorized linear manner (e.g., organize by date received). Some email clients may allow rules to be manually setup to provide some organization; however manual setup is generally time consuming and\/or otherwise frustrating to email users.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","A technique for characterizing emails is disclosed herein. Email content and a domain identifier may be extracted from an email. The domain identifier may be used to determine a domain classification. In one example, the domain identifier may be used to query a domain directory service for domain classification data (e.g., a company name, a business category, a site name, a domain name description, etc.) associated with the domain identifier. The email may be characterized based upon the extracted email content and the domain classification. In one example, a pattern matching rule set may be executed upon the extracted email content and\/or domain classification to determine a characterization which may be associated with the email. For example, an email may be characterized as \u201ctravel\u201d based upon extracted email content (e.g., a subject line comprising the text \u201ccruise\u201d) and a domain classification (e.g., \u201cTravel Shop\u201d company name, \u201cvacations\u201d business category, etc.).","A viewing panel having particular characterization related properties may be populated with an email based upon a characterization of the email. For example, a travel viewing panel may be populated with emails having a travel characteristic. Multiple viewing panels may be presented within a single environment. Respective viewing panels may display emails in a particular format based upon their characterization. For example, a travel email may be presented along with personal travel history, hot vacation suggestions, and\/or departure and arrival times highlighted within the travel email. Within a viewing panel, bulk user commands may be executed upon multiple emails based upon a variety of conditions (e.g., delete all email from a particular sender). A pattern matching rule set (e.g., rules that may be executed upon a domain classification and\/or extracted email content to determine a characterization) may be updated based upon user actions (e.g., dragging and dropping an email from a first viewing panel to a second viewing panel).","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects, advantages, and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.","The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident, however, that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are illustrated in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.","Email has become a prevalent means of communication. Unfortunately, the number of emails that a user receives can be overwhelming, and while there are some techniques for dealing with an (over)abundance of emails, these techniques require at least some manual intervention, that may be time consuming and\/or otherwise frustrating to a user. For example, rules may be developed by a user, certain words may be blacklisted, folders can be created into which emails can be manually placed, etc.","Accordingly, as provided herein, a technique for characterizing an email is disclosed. Among other things, a domain identifier of the email is consulted and a domain classification is determined therefrom. The email is then characterized based upon the domain classification, among other things. It will be appreciated that this has particular application to solicited emails (e.g., opt-in bulk email, social networking email, mailing list email, commercial email, etc.). That is, those emails that are received by a user as a result of some commercial or other type of activity that the user is involved in, such as sales confirmation emails, etc., where the user has some interest in the emails but may not open or read them for a certain period of time (as opposed to unsolicited \u201cspam\u201d emails to which the user is significantly disinterested).","One embodiment of characterizing an email is illustrated by an exemplary method  in . At , the method begins. At , email content and a domain identifier may be extracted from an email. This data may be extracted from a header, fields, email text, metadata, and\/other other data relating to the email. The extracted email content may comprise information, such as a sender name, a subject line and\/or message text, for example.","At , a domain classification may be determined based upon the domain identifier. The domain identifier may comprise information relating to the domain name originating the email. Domain identifier variations may be created from the domain identifier because the extracted domain identifier may not directly correspond to the actual domain name of the sender. For example, a third party may have sent the email on behalf of the actual entity originating the email. In another example, the domain identifier may reflect a variation of the actual domain name of the entity sending the email.","In one example of determining a domain classification, a domain directory service (e.g., a database, a web service, an open directory categorizing domain names with business information, etc.) may be queried with the domain identifier and\/or domain identifier variations to determine the domain classification. The domain classification may comprise a company name, a business category, a canonical site name, a domain name description, and\/or other information corresponding to the domain identifier (e.g., a registered domain name).","At , the email may be characterized based upon the extracted email content and the domain classification. For example, a pattern matching rule set (e.g., an algorithm configured to match domain classifications and email content against patterns) may be executed upon the domain classification and the extracted email content to determine a characterization which may be assigned to or otherwise associated with the email. It will be appreciated that one or more characterizations (e.g., subcharacterizations) may likewise be associated with an email. For example, a second pattern matching rule set may be executed upon the extracted email content to determine a subcharacterization which may be associated with the email. It will be appreciated that a pattern matching rule set may be updated (e.g. the pattern matching rule set may learn from a user's actions) based upon user input. For example, a user may execute a viewing panel email swap (e.g., dragging and dropping an email from a first viewing panel to a second viewing panel) in which a pattern matching rule set may be updated to reflect the user's specified characterization for the particular email and\/or sender that was swapped.","A viewing panel having particular characterization related properties with the email may be populated based upon the characterization. For example, a shopping viewing panel may be populated with an email characterized as shopping. It will be appreciated that an email within a particular viewing panel may be presented in a particular format based upon the characterization. For example, an email within a travel viewing panel may be presented with highlighted departure and arrival times within the email and\/or with additional travel information (e.g., a map) (where a different viewing panel would not have these same properties). It may be appreciated that entity extraction may also be performed upon an email to extract additional information for display within a viewing panel. For example, entity extract may be performed upon text of an email to extract contextual information (e.g., a street address, an order confirmation number, an itinerary, a coupon amount, shipping information, etc.). The contextual information may be presented in association with the email and\/or a particular viewing panel to provide an enriched view of the email for the particular context.","Within the viewing panel, one or more emails may be filtered based upon a filter. For example, all emails from a particular sender may be minimized. In another example, all emails outside of a particular date range (e.g., current month) may be minimized. Bulk user commands may be executed upon one or more emails within a viewing panel. For example, a user may delete all emails from a particular sender with a single click. At , the method ends.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","204","210","214","216","220"]},"The extraction component  may be configured to extract email content and a domain identifier  from an email . The domain classification component  may be configured to determine a domain classification based upon the domain identifier. The domain classification may comprise information related to the domain name from which the email was sent (e.g., business name of the sender, business category of the sender, website name of the sender, etc.). For example the domain classification component  may query a domain directory service  with the domain identifier to determine the domain classification. In another example the domain classification component  may be configured to create domain identifier variations based upon the domain identifier. The domain identifier and\/or domain identifier variations may be used to query the domain directory service  to determine the domain classification.","The characterization component  may be configured to characterize the email  based upon the extracted email content and the domain classification (e.g., email content and domain classification ). In one example, the characterization component  may be configured to execute a pattern matching rule set upon the domain classification and the extracted email content to determine the characterization which may be associated with the email . The pattern matching rule set may execute one or more pattern matching algorithms to match predefined patterns with the domain classification and the extracted email content. It will be appreciated that the characterization component  may be configured to characterize the email  with one or more characterizations (e.g., subcharacterizations).","The presentation component  may be configured to populate one or more viewing panels (e.g., set of viewing panels ) with characterized emails. For example, the presentation component  may populate a viewing panel having a particular characterization related property (e.g., a newsletter characterization viewing panel) with an email (e.g., a newsletter email) based upon a characterization (e.g., newsletter) of the email. The presentation component  may be configured to present a characterized email within a viewing panel in a particular format based upon a characterization of the email and\/or viewing panel. For example, an email within a shopping viewing panel may be presented with additional sales history and\/or coupons, whereas an email within a travel viewing panel may be presented with itinerary information and\/or a map.","The command execution component  may be configured to execute a bulk user command upon one or more emails within a viewing panel. For example, a user may delete all emails from a sender with a single user input (e.g., single click). In another example, a user may archive all emails from a sender with a single user input. In yet another example, one or more emails and\/or senders may be swapped from a first viewing panel to a target viewing panel, in this way a user may recharacterize the swapped emails\/senders to a characterization corresponding to the target viewing panel. The pattern matching rule set may be updated  based upon the swap. For example, patterns (e.g., predefined email content and\/or domain classification data) may be updated to reflect the recharacterization.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","302","306","304","304","306","1","308","2","310","312"]},"A domain classification  may be determined based upon the queried domain identifier . For example, the domain identifier  may correspond to domain ()  (e.g., a match in a domain name is determined). The domain classification  may be returned comprising the company name \u201cTom's book store\u201d, the business category \u201cShopping\u201d, the canonical site name \u201cTom's book store website\u201d, and\/or the domain name description \u201cBook seller\u201d. This information may be used to determine a characterization (e.g., Shopping) and\/or one or more subcharacterizations (e.g., Books) corresponding to the email from which the domain identifier  was extracted.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","402","404","402","406","402"]},"A domain classification component  may query a domain directory service  with the domain identifier  to determine a domain classification . For example, the domain name \u201cTombooks\u201d may be registered with the domain directory service . The registration may provide additional information regarding the domain name \u201cTombooks\u201d, such as a company name \u201cTom's book store\u201d, a business category \u201cShopping\u201d, a site name \u201cTom's book store website\u201d, and\/or a domain name description \u201cBook seller\u201d. The domain classification  may be determined based upon the additional information.","A characterization component  may execute a pattern matching rule set  (e.g., an algorithm configured to compare extracted email content and a domain classification with characterization information within an XML file) upon the email content  and\/or the domain classification  to determine a characterization and\/or subcharacterization (e.g., characterization data ). For example, the business category \u201cShopping\u201d may match a characterization of \u201cShopping\u201d. Furthermore, \u201cShopping order\u201d and \u201cBook store\u201d may be derived as subcharacterizations further describing the email . The characterization data  may be associated with the email .","The characterization component  may also be configured to perform entity extraction upon an email to extract additional information for display within a viewing panel. For example, entity extract may be performed upon text of an email to extract contextual information (e.g., a street address, an order confirmation number, an itinerary, coupon amounts, shipping information, etc.). The contextual information may be presented in association with the email and\/or a particular viewing panel to provide an enriched view of the email for the particular context.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","502","510","522","524","526","502","504","506","508"]},"The shopping viewing panel  may have particular characterization related properties relating to shopping. The shopping viewing panel  may present emails having a shopping characterization. For example, a first Tom's Books email  and a second Tom's Books email  may be presented under the Tom's Books company tab  within the shopping viewing panel  because the emails are characterized as shopping and are associated with the shopping company Tom's Books. The \u201c(2)\u201d next to the Tom's Books company tab  may indicate the number of emails associated with the shopping company Tom's books. Other emails having a shopping characterization, such as a first Jane's Clothing Store email , may be displayed within the shopping viewing panel . The first Jane's Clothing Store email  may be presented under a Jane's Clothing Store company tab .","The social viewing panel  may comprise emails having a social characterization. For example, the sender We Connect People may be characterized as social; therefore emails associated with We Connect People may be presented within the social viewing panel . The finance viewing panel  may comprise emails having a finance characterization. For example, the sender Bank may be characterized as financial; therefore emails associated with Bank may be presented within the finance viewing panel . The newsletters viewing panel  may comprise emails having a newsletters characterization. A minimize button  may be associated with the newsletters viewing panel . For example, a user may perform a bulk minimize upon emails associated with Healthy News. The Healthy News company tab  may be collapsed upon the emails associated with Healthy News (e.g., the Healthy News company tab  comprises 3 emails). It may be appreciated that a viewing panel may comprise one or more emails and\/or company tabs corresponding to senders that may not be visually presented due to filters, searching, minimizing, and\/or other constraints, for example.","The date filter  may be used to filter emails within one or more viewing panels based upon a date range (e.g., this week, this month, today, all). The search filter  may be used to filter emails within one or more viewing panels based upon a textual input. The create new characterization button  may be used to create a new characterization and\/or a viewing panel having the new characterization. This provides flexibility in characterizing emails. For example, if a new characterization and new characterization viewing panel is created, then an email and\/or sender may be swapped into the new characterization viewing panel. To adapt to the user's preference, a pattern matching rule set may be updated and\/or trained to characterize emails as the new characterization.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","602","604","606","604","606","608","610","610","612"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","702","704","706","706","101","101","710","101","712","704","710","101"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","802","804","812","804","804","806","808","810","812","812","814","816","814","820","818"]},"Still another embodiment involves a computer-readable medium comprising processor-executable instructions configured to implement one or more of the techniques presented herein.
