title: Method for remotely measuring fluctuations in the optical index of refraction of a medium
abstract: A method is provided for remotely measuring index of refraction fluctuations. From a first location, an optical beam is focused at a focal plane located at a second location in a medium of interest. As a result, a beam of energy is backscattered towards the first location. At the first location, a size of the backscattered beam is determined where the size is indicative of strength of fluctuations in the medium's index of refraction.

When a light source is activated, light propagates from the source at a velocity of 299,792,458 meters per second in a vacuum. Because the speed of light is regarded as a universal constant, the travel time of light is often used as a measurement of distance in terminology such as \u201clight year\u201d and \u201clight second\u201d. Light from a laser propagates in a single direction forming a beam and may be pulsed having a pulse duration as short as 10 femtoseconds. Such a pulsed beam has a physical length or extent in space. This physical length can be estimated as the pulse duration multiplied by the speed of light in vacuum. The length can be calculated exactly by multiplying by the speed of light in the medium; however, the speed of light in the medium may not be exactly known.","Measurement of the index of refraction of a light propagation medium is traditionally accomplished by collecting samples of the medium and using instruments such as an optical interferometer or refractometer to measure the index of refraction. Another approach involves measurement of quantities such as temperature, salinity, and pressure, and then using such quantities in analytical models to calculate the index of refraction. While various methods\/instruments (e.g., shadowgraphs and wavefront sensors) have been used to indicate the existence of index of refraction fluctuations, these methods\/instruments do not have the ability to remotely sense index of refraction fluctuations.","Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method for remotely measuring index of refraction fluctuations.","In accordance with the present invention, a method is provided for remotely measuring fluctuations in a medium's index of refraction. From a first location, a first beam of optical energy is focused at a focal plane located at a second location in a medium of interest. As a result, a second beam of optical energy is backscattered towards the first location. At the first location, a size of the second beam is determined where the size is indicative of strength of fluctuations in the medium's index of refraction.","The present invention is a novel method for remotely measuring index of refraction fluctuations in a light propagation medium. The present invention takes advantage of some basic principles governing the interaction of a laser beam with a medium. Briefly, when a laser beam is focused in a medium such as water or air, index of refraction variations or fluctuations within the medium can steer the beam, change the divergence of the beam, and break up the beam. Depending on the strength, scale, and range of the index of refraction fluctuations, the size of the beam at the intended focal point (or region) can be significantly larger than the diffraction limited spot size. To measure the size of the beam at the intended focal point, an image of the focused spot can be made at the source of the laser beam by using light that is backscattered from suspended particles and molecular fluctuations within the medium. The image formed is further increased in size as the backscattered light propagates back through the index of refraction fluctuations on the return path. The present invention uses this change in beam size in determining index of refraction fluctuations as will be described below.","In order to capture just a \u201csnapshot\u201d of the region of interest, a variety of well-known optical techniques can be employed. For example, light from the focal point can be isolated by using a pulsed laser beam whose \u201con\u201d time is short enough so that its extent in space is less than or equal to the depth of focus range. The \u201con\u201d time is the pulse duration, and the extent in space or length can be estimated by multiplying the pulse duration by the speed of light, c. By time gating the received signal to match the travel time of the light to and from the focal point, the light scattered within the focal volume is further isolated. Measurements of the size of the resulting image are processed in accordance with the present invention to produce a measure of the index of refraction fluctuations encountered during the forward and reverse (i.e., backscattered) propagation of the light beam.","Referring now to the drawings and more particularly to , a schematic view of a system used to remotely measure index of refraction fluctuations in accordance with the present invention is illustrated. At the heart of this system is a beam source and backscattering measurement system  used to both focus a light beam  at a focal plane  located a distance (or focal range) R from system  and measure the size of the backscattered beam image that arrives at system  along return beam path . Light beam  and return beam path  pass through a medium  (e.g., water, air, etc.) that is likely to experience index of refraction fluctuations. Medium  can be a single medium or multiple mediums (e.g., air and water) with a regular (e.g., flat) boundary between the two mediums. As would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, system  can be realized in a number of ways without departing from the scope of the present invention. By way of non-limiting example, one possible embodiment of system  will be described later herein.","For simplicity, the present invention will be explained for the case of a single focal range. However, it is to be understood that the method described herein can be extended for the measurement and use of data at multiple focal ranges where such multiple measurements could be made simultaneously or sequentially. Referring still to , a measurement of the beam size at the focal range R is an indirect measurement of the strength of index of refraction fluctuations in the propagation path between the output lens of system  and focal plane . Since observation of the beam at focal plane  by system  requires backscattering of the light by molecular and particulate scattering of the light and propagation back through the fluctuations along return beam path , the size of the beam image seen by system  increases further. If the outgoing beam nearly fills the output lens aperture of system , the irradiance seen by system 's detector can be approximated by autoconvolving the irradiance in focal plane . In any case, the size of the detected beam represents an indirect measurement of the strength of index of refraction fluctuations in the path between the output lens of system  and focal plane . System  provides the size of the detected beam to a processor  where the present invention's methods are used to relate the size of the image to the strength, location in range, and size of the index of refraction fluctuations.","As the strength of the fluctuations increases, the size of the detected beam increases. If I(x,y) is the irradiance measured in the detector plane with rectangular coordinates (x,y), a measure of beam size can be the mean radius of the beam given

A computer\/controller  provides control signals to a trigger  that, in turn, generates an electronic pulse used to trigger operation of a laser . For the illustrated embodiment, it will be assumed that laser  generates a linearly polarized light pulse with a single TEMspatial mode with good beam quality. In accordance with an additional control signal generated by computer , zoom optics  expand the diameter and adjust the convergence of the laser light beam to produce a focused spot of the desired diffraction limited size at a selected range R. The diameter of the light beam is selected to achieve the desired index of refraction measurement sensitivity over the selected range. The transmitted light beam further passes through a polarizing beamsplitter  that is configured to allow passage of the light beam. A quarter waveplate  converts the light into circularly polarized light. A lens  then focuses the transmitted light beam (referenced by arrowheads ) through medium  and onto particle and molecular density scatterers contained with the focal region  of beam . Light that is scattered backward (referenced by arrowheads ) is then collected by lens . To the extent that the polarization of the light is preserved in the scattering process, quarter waveplate  converts the returning backscattered light to linearly polarized light with a polarization that is rotated 90\u00b0 relative to the state of the polarization generated by laser . Backscattered light with the 90\u00b0 polarization rotation is deflected by beamsplitter  into imaging optics . Imaging optics  are configured by computer  to image the light through a shutter  and onto a detector array  with the desired magnification. A delay  controlled by computer  turns on shutter  to allow the passage of light that has traveled the requisite time to and from focal region . The open time for shutter  is set to pass light that is scattered within the focal range of region  and to block light that is scattered outside of the focal range. The image formed on detector array  is then provided to computer  where range and beam diameter are determined. Note that a number of elements of system  can be changed or modified without departing from the scope of the present invention.
