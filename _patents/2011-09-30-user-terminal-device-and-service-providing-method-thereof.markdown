Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to a user terminal device and a service providing method thereof, and more particularly, to a user terminal device for collectively providing services via a service hub corresponding to a particular organization, and a service providing method thereof.","2. Description of the Related Art","A user of a user terminal device, such as a smart phone, can access an external server such as application store, in order to utilize various application programs in addition to application programs installed to the user terminal device. More specifically, the user can download and use a free or paid application program.","Further, as users of user terminal devices are increasing, various-scale organizations such as businesses, schools, hospitals, public institutions, etc., can use a specific application program in common. Hence, users belonging to these types of organizations individually download and utilize the specific application program.","However, for a user who is not familiar with the user terminal device, downloading and installing the application program can be difficult. In addition, when there are multiple application programs commonly required, it can be burdensome to search for and download each of the application programs.","Thus, when there are the application programs commonly used by a particular organization, a technique for easily downloading and using the application programs from a server is needed.","Accordingly, the present disclosure has been provided to solve the above-mentioned and\/or other problems and disadvantages, and to provide at least the advantages described below.","An aspect of the present invention is to provide a user terminal device that receives a plurality of services via a service hub with respect to a certain organization and a service providing method thereof.","In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, a user terminal device is provided. The user terminal device includes a location calculation unit that calculates location information of the user terminal device; a storage unit that stores a service hub program; a display unit that displays an icon container including icons of application programs set with the service hub program; and a control unit that restricts usability of at least one of the application programs or the service hub program based on the location information and effective area information","In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a service providing method of a user terminal device is provided. The method includes calculating location information of the user terminal device; and restricting usability regarding at least one application program which is set for a service hub program or the service hub program, if the location information indicates that the user terminal device deviates from an effective area","In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a user terminal device is provided. The user terminal device includes an authentication manager that performs authentication by transmitting unique information of the user terminal device and user information to a server; a download manager that downloads a service hub program, a first list including application programs corresponding to the service hub program and a second list including icons of the application programs from the server; an icon generation manager that generates an icon container including the icons of the application programs in the first list according to the second list; a display controller that displays the icon container on a screen; and a location management manager that restricts usability regarding the service hub program or the application program based on location information of the user terminal device and effective area information","Various embodiments of the present invention are described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description, the matters defined in the description are provided to assist a comprehensive understanding of the present invention, and it is obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art that predetermined modifications or changes of the matters described herein can be made without departing from the scope of the invention. The same reference numbers are used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts. Further, detailed descriptions of well-known functions and structures incorporated herein may be omitted to avoid obscuring the subject matter of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"Referring to , a network system includes a plurality of user terminal devices -A through -An and -B through -Bm, a network , and a server . For example, the network  can be implemented using a general communication network or a wired\/wireless Internet network.","The user terminal devices are classified based on an organization of the user. That is, the user terminal devices are classified as the user terminal devices -A through -An belonging to an organization A, and the user terminal devices -B through -Bm belonging to an organization B. Further, the server  offers an adaptive application program for the user terminal devices belonging to the corresponding organization.","For example, a provider for operating the server  can enter into a contract with and receive a service request from a representative of the organization. Hence, the provider registers a service hub for the corresponding organization and configures an adaptive service hub program for the organization. The service hub program indicates a program provided and installed to the user terminal devices belonging to the organization in order to easily download, update, and manage one or more application programs set in the user terminal device for the corresponding organization.","When the organization A requests the service in , the server  receives various information, such as a list of users belonging to the organization A and user terminal devices of the users, and registers the service hub based on the information. The service hub program may be generated, for example, by altering detailed setup items such as a webpage skin, a menu, and an available application program setup, while sustaining a basic platform, or by newly designing an entire platform according to the request of the corresponding organization.","When the user terminal devices -A through -An of organization A access the server , the server  transmits the service hub program corresponding to organization A to the user terminal devices -A through -An.","Authentication can be performed before the service hub program is transmitted, using various well-known manners. For example, the user terminal device can transmit, to the server , user information (e.g., an IDentification (ID) and password) and unique information of the user terminal device (e.g., International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI), Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory Number (MSISDN), etc.). The user information can also be provided to the server  from an operator of the organization.","After receiving the user information and the unique information of the user terminal devices, the server  authenticates each user terminal device by comparing the received information with the information provided from the corresponding organization in advance. When completing authentication for a user terminal device, the server  transmits the service hub program to the user terminal device.","When the user terminal device downloads and installs the service hub program, an icon container is generated and displayed in a screen of the user terminal device. The icon container corresponds to the service hub, i.e., the service hub program. In addition, the service hub program itself may be referred to as a hub container.","After downloading and installing, when the user selects the icon container, a screen of the user terminal device displays icons of the application programs for the organization or the group (department, rank, gender, age, etc.) of the corresponding user in the organization. The corresponding application programs may be downloaded from the server  all together or selectively.","Additionally, a user terminal device may contain pre-loaded versions of the service hub program used by a corresponding organization and the application programs to be used by the service hub program may be sold to the corresponding organization. For example, in this case, the service hub program and the application programs may be installed already at the point of the release of the user terminal device.","Accordingly, the users of the organization A can collectively use various application programs to be used in the organization A by executing the service hub program provided from the server . Further, when there is an old version of a program, the program may be easily updated by the server .","When organization B does not make a separate contract with the server , the user terminal devices -B through -Bm of the organization B cannot receive the service hub program.","Additionally, the server  may limit the service use according to a location change or a state change of a user terminal device. That is, when the location of the user terminal device leaves an effective area, the availability of the service hub program installed to the user terminal device or at least one of the application programs provided for the service hub program and the user terminal device can be restricted.","A method for restricting the availability can be implemented in many different ways. For example, without intervention of the server , a user terminal device itself can determine whether or not to use the service hub program by obtaining and comparing its location information with effective area information. For the program determined as unavailable, the user terminal device can delete the corresponding icon displayed, or display the icon in the deactivated state. Alternatively, as normally displaying the icon, the user terminal device can display an error message while performing no operation when the icon is selected. The effective area information can be provided from the server , a plurality of effective areas can be defined, or the effective area information can be changed.","Alternatively, the server  can directly restrict the availability of the service hub program by comparing a location of the user terminal device and the effective area. That is, the server  can receive location information periodically, or in every case of a particular event, (e.g., when the user terminal device transits from a turn-off state to a turn-on state) from the user terminal device. In this case, unique information of the user terminal device can be received together with the location information. Upon locating the user terminal device, the server  determines whether the location is within the effective area, and does not take any action when the user terminal device is located within the effective area. However, when the user terminal device is outside the effective area, the server  can restrict the availability of the service hub program or at least one application program. More specifically, the server  can generate and send a list of unavailable programs to the user terminal device, or send availability information setting the availability or a command instructing to set the unavailable state. Accordingly, the user terminal device disables a particular application program or the service hub program.","As described above, the server  can restrict the service use according to the state change of the user terminal device. That is, when the state of the user terminal device or the user changes, e.g., when the user of the user terminal device is no longer a member of the organization, when the user loses the user terminal device, when the user transfers to another department, when the user takes time off, etc., the server  can delete the application programs or the service hub program adaptively set for the corresponding organization, or disable the application programs or the service hub program for a specific term.","The state change of the user can be received at the server  from the corresponding organization or the user. The server  can send a deletion instruction or a suspension instruction according to the received information or request. Accordingly, the corresponding user terminal device can delete or suspend the designated program. In this case, not only the program but also data generated in the execution of the corresponding program can be deleted or suspended.","Additionally, the server , which has all of information relating to the user terminal devices of the organization, can support a group service based on that information. That is, the server  can support a group mail service so that a group mail (or message) can be transferred between the user terminal devices. For example, when a user terminal device requests a group mail transmission, the server  sends the group mail for the service hub or a particular group of the service hub using pre-stored information. More specifically, the user of the user terminal device can send a message for a particular user or group using the user terminal device. The server  searches for a transmission target using pre-registered information and then sends a message to the searched target.","Additionally, the server  can send a notification message to the each user terminal device included in service hub or a group in the service hub. That is, the server  can directly input a message and notify the message to each user terminal device or groups terminal devices within the organization.","Further, the server  provides an organization address book of the organization, thereby supporting a service for users to inquire about other users, i.e., receive other users' information, in the organization\/group. When a user of the user terminal device selects an address book check service using the user terminal device, the user terminal device requests a user list or detailed information of the service hub from the server . According to the request, the server  sends the address book including phone numbers or e-mail information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"Referring to , a screen of a user terminal device  having a service hub program installed therein displays an icon container . The icon container , which is generated in accordance with the service hub program, includes icons of the application programs for the corresponding user terminal device  and the corresponding service hub program. For example, when the user selects the icon container , icons  through  included in the corresponding icon container  are displayed in the screen. While  illustrates six icons within the icon container , obviously, the number of the icons is not limited to six.","In , \u201cNew\u201d and \u201cUpdate\u201d are displayed in icons  and , indicating that the Minutes application of icon  is newly installed and that there is an update available for the Chatting application of icon . As such, when an icon is displayed, its display state can differ according to the state of the application program corresponding to the icon. In addition to New\u201d and \u201cUpdate\u201d, other appropriate indicators may be used. For example, when an application program of the latest version is normally installed, a word such as \u201cNormal\u201d or \u201cNo change\u201d may be displayed in one side of the corresponding icon. Alternatively, display states can be indicated without words, e.g., an abnormal state can be informed by flickering the icon or by changing a color, a location, a size, or a shape of the icon.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","1","100","100","1","100"]},"Referring to , the user terminal device includes a memory , a controller , and a display . The memory  stores a service hub program and application programs available in the user terminal device , and the display  displays an icon container generated according to an installation of the service hub program. When the displayed icon container is selected, the controller  controls the display  to display the icons of the application programs, e.g., as illustrated in .","The controller  can collectively or selectively download at least one application program from the server  by executing the service hub program stored to the memory . The service hub program can be initially installed to in the memory , or downloaded from the server  and installed later.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":"200"},"Referring to , the user terminal device includes the memory , the controller , the display , an input unit , and a communication unit . The communication unit  accesses the server  and downloads the service hub program and the application programs.","The input unit  is used to input information or commands. For example, the input unit  can be implemented using a touch screen integrally formed with the display , or using separate keypad.","When user information is input through the input unit , in order to authenticate the user terminal device, the controller  sends the user information and unique information of the user terminal device to the server  via the communication unit . When the authentication is accomplished, the controller  downloads the service hub program from the server  and installs it in the memory . Thereafter, the controller  can generate and control the display  to display an icon container corresponding to the service hub program, as described above regarding .","Additionally, the controller  may receive information regarding the application programs from the server , by executing the service hub program. That is, the controller  may download the application programs, a list of the application programs, or a list of the icons, via the communication unit . For example, when the service hub program is installed and executed, the controller  transmits various information, such as user information, unique information, and identification information of the service hub program, to the server , via the communication unit . Thereafter, the controller  receives a list of the application programs corresponding to the service hub program and a list of the icons of the application programs from the server .","Using the list of the icons, the controller  generates an icon container including icons for the application programs, and the icons for the application programs, and provide them to the display .","The list of the application programs includes the application programs designated for the organization and the group of the user of the user terminal device.","For example, when the service hub program is initially executed, the controller  receives the list of the application programs, downloads the application programs of the list from the server , and installs the programs in the memory .","Alternatively, even when a plurality of application programs to update or to newly install are registered for the service hub, the application programs or the update data can be downloaded all together. In this case, the execution screen of the service hub program displays a menu requesting the collective download or the collective update. When the user selects the collective download or the collective update, the corresponding operation is performed.","For example, the controller  checks the state of the existing application programs currently downloaded or installed on the user terminal device in order to determine whether the application programs include an application to update or install. Upon determining the application program to update or install, the controller  controls the display  to change the display state of the icon according to the state of the corresponding application program, as illustrated above in .","Accordingly, when an icon corresponding to an application program not installed is selected among the displayed icons, e.g., indicated as \u201cNew\u201d, the controller  downloads the corresponding application program from the server  and installs it to the memory .","Further, when the icon corresponding to the application program of the old version is selected among the displayed icons, .g., indicated as \u201cUpdate\u201d, the controller  may update the application program of the old version installed in the memory  by downloading a newer version or update data for the application program of the old version from the server .","Additionally, the controller  can be implemented such that the application program provided for the user terminal device is confirmed only by selecting the icon container displayed in the screen. That is, the user terminal device also offers a function, such as \u201cMenu\u201d, with which the user can confirm and select various functions. When the user selects the function \u201cMenu\u201d, all of the functions of the user terminal device can be displayed as a menu tree.","Although not illustrated in , a user terminal device can further include a location calculation unit for calculating its location information. The location calculation unit may calculate the location information using Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) information or utilize location information obtained over a 3G network. Alternatively, the location calculation unit may calculate the location information using a geomagnetic sensor of the user terminal device.","When the location of the user terminal device is known and the service hub program is initially executed, the controller  can register the location of the user terminal device by transmitting the current location information to the server . Thus, based on the registered location for the user terminal device, the server  can control whether to provide the service hub program and the application program to the user terminal device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":"120"},"Referring to , the controller  includes an authentication manager , a download manager , an icon generation manager , a display controller , and a state check manager . The authentication manager  performs an authentication process with the server  by sending various information such as unique information, user information, and location information of the user terminal device, to the server . Thereafter, the server  certifies whether the corresponding user, i.e., the user terminal device, is authorized to download the service hub program by checking the received information, determines whether the download is possible, and transmits the authentication result to the authentication manager  via the communication unit . According to the authentication result, the authentication manager  determines whether to download the service hub program.","When the authentication manager  determines to download the service hub program, the download manager  sends a transmission request for the service hub program to the server  via the communication unit , and then receives the service hub program from the server .","When the service hub program is received, installed, and executed at the user terminal device, the download manager  can request information of the application programs by transmitting various information, as described above, for specifying the user terminal device, to the server .","After authenticating the user terminal device, the server  sends a list of the application programs corresponding to the user terminal device and the service hub program, and a list of icons for the application programs, to the download manager .","The download manager  can protect the downloaded application program against the access from other programs, such as menu or file manager. That is, the user may not be able to access the application program provided by the service hub through functions such as the menu function or the file search function, and can access only through the service hub program. Accordingly, the download manager  can hide the above-mentioned application programs by preventing them from being displayed in the menu tree and excluding them from the search target in the search.","The download manager  is operated in the same way as a secure folder manager in the above description; however, a secure folder manager may be provided separately, irrespective of the operation of downloading. That is, the secure folder manager can secure information such as an application list and an icon received from the server , such that it is not exposed to outside. For example, such information may be stored in a hidden state.","In addition, a user may set or release a separate password for each application received through a service hub program. That is, a secure folder manager may add and display a separate menu for selecting a password setting function and a password releasing function in a service hub program menu. If a user selects the menu, an area for setting or releasing a password with respect to various applications is displayed. The user may set a password by inputting the password in an area corresponding to a desired application or may release a password setting of a desired application by selecting a password releasing button.","If a user selects an application encrypted with a password, a User Interface (UI) for requesting an input of the password is displayed on a screen. The user may use the corresponding application only when the password is accurately input on the UI. As such, security may be further strengthened as a password is set for each application.","A password may be set or released with respect to all of the applications or use of a service hub program instead of each application. That is, if a user selects an icon container, a UI for requesting an input of a password may be displayed on a screen. If a user inputs the password accurately, information regarding various applications corresponding to the relevant service hub program may be displayed. In addition, a password may be set or released by group. That is, a plurality of applications may be classified into groups and a password may be set or released with respect to each group.","Further, a route or a method to access an application received via a service hub program as described above may be unified. That is, applications may be configured such that operations such as icon display, application execution, application removal, etc., are only performed through a service hub program. In this case, a user may check information regarding applications received via a service hub program and select whether to execute an operation when an icon container is selected on a screen.","As described above, a service hub program may perform various processing to maintain security of various information received via the service hub program.","The icon generation manger  downloads icon data from the server  based on the received icon list. Thereafter, the icon generation manger  generates the icon container or the icon by managing the icon data. That is, the icon generation manger  generates the icon container including the icons for the application programs according to the received icon list.","The display controller  controls the display  to display the icon container in the screen. Therefore, when the icon container is selected, the display controller  controls the display  to display the icons of the icon container.","The state check manager  changes the display state of each icon in the icon container according to the current installation state of the application program of the first list. Accordingly, the user can easily confirm the state of the application program provided in the service hub. When the user selects the icon, the processing corresponding to the icon state is performed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0090","num":"0089"},"figref":"FIGS. 6 and 7"},"Referring to , the user terminal device  includes a memory , a controller , a display , and a location calculation unit . The memory , the controller , and the display  operate as described above in the embodiments illustrated in ,  and .","The location calculation unit  calculates a location information of the user terminal device. As described above, the location information can be calculated using GPS information, location information obtained from the 3G network, location coordinates calculated by a geomagnetic sensor module of the user terminal device, etc.","The controller  supports the LBS, based on the location information and the effective area information. That is, according to whether the location information falls outside of the effective area information, the availability of at least one of the application programs or the service hub program is limited, the authentication result is adjusted, or the location is registered. The LBS can be executed when the service hub operates only in a specific region requested by the corresponding organization, i.e., only in the effective area.","For example, when the location of the user terminal device is in the effective area, the controller  displays the icon container corresponding to the service hub program by normally executing the service hub program. Accordingly, when the corresponding icon container is selected, the controller  displays the icons of the icon container in the screen.","However, when the location of the user terminal device leaves the effective area, the controller  disables the service hub program or at least one application program. That is, when the service hub program is disabled, the controller  can delete the icon container from the screen or display the icon container as being in an unselectable state. Alternatively, even when the icon is selected, the controller  can merely restrict the icon display.","When the application program is disabled, the controller  can delete or display the icon in the unselectable state by disabling all or part of the application programs for the corresponding service hub.","The effective area information can be frequently set or changed in a webpage provided from the server , and a plurality of the effective areas can be set.","The authentication and\/or the use of only a particular application program of the multiple application programs may be restricted according to the location information. In this case, for the plurality of the effective areas as stated above, the authentication and\/or the use of the different application program may be restricted per effective area. For example, when the application programs for the service hub are a, a, a, b, b, c, and c, only a, a, and a can be used in the area A, only b and b can be used in the area B, and only c and c can be used in the area C.","The operations of the controller  based on the location information may be performed by the user terminal device itself, or controlled with the intervention of the server .","When the user terminal device itself provides the LBS, and when the service hub program is executed, the user terminal device receives the effective area information from the server . The effective area information may be received every time the service hub program is executed, when the effective area is changed after one reception in the initial execution, or on the periodic basis.","The controller  checks whether the user terminal device is located in the effective area by comparing the effective area information received from the server  with the location information. Therefore, when the user terminal device is in the effective area, the controller  supports the normal use of the service hub program and the application program, as described above. However, when the user terminal device is located outside of the effective area, the controller  limits the availability of the application program or the service hub program. That is, when a program is running, the controller  automatically terminates the execution of the corresponding program. Thereafter, when an execution request for the program of the limited availability is received, the controller  ignores the execution request. When the availability is limited, the display state of the icon container or the icon can be displayed in the inactivated state as aforementioned. In this case, when the available application program exists, the activated icon of the application program can be retained.","When the server  provides the LBS, the user terminal device can transmit its location information to the server  periodically or every time a particular event takes place. After receiving the location information, the server  determines whether the service is supportable by comparing the effective area information set by the organization with the location information. Thereafter, the server  transmits availability information so that the user terminal device can limit the availability according to the information, if necessary.","The availability information can set the application programs and the service hub program to the available state when the location of the user terminal device is located in the effective area, and set at least one of application programs and the service hub program to the unavailable state, when the location of the user terminal device is outside of the effective area. Further, the availability information can be in a list of the unavailable application programs including information relating to the forbidden application program outside the effective area among the application programs provided for the corresponding service hub.","The controller  limits the availability of the application programs of the list. Additionally, when all of the application programs are unavailable, the controller  may limit the availability of the service hub program itself.","The controller  may control the display  to display the icon or the icon container for the unavailable application program of the application programs, in an inactivated state.","As described above, when the service hub program is initially executed, the controller  sends and registers various information to the server . Using the received location information, the server  checks whether the corresponding user terminal device is located in the effective area. When the user terminal device is located in the effective area, the server  can transmit the service hub program or the application program. However, the authentication fails when the user terminal device is located outside of the effective area.","Further, the server  can consider time. That is, the server  may register the corresponding user terminal device only when the service hub program is executed during a preset time period, e.g., starting from the service hub registration, or the conclusion or validation of the contract with the organization.","Referring to , a user terminal device includes a memory , a controller , a display , an input unit , a communication unit , and a location calculation unit . As described in relation to , the communication unit  communicates with server  and can transmit and receive programs and data. The input unit  can receive various information and\/or commands from the user. Because the components illustrated in , except for the location calculation unit , are the same as those illustrated in , and operations of the components are the same as the components illustrated in , a repetitive description of these components are omitted.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0109","num":"0108"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8"],"b":"820"},"Referring to , the controller  of the user terminal device includes an authentication manager , a download manager , an icon generation manager , a display controller , a state check manager , a deletion manager , and a location management manager . The components of the controller  in , excluding the deletion manager  and the location management manager , are the same as those illustrated in the controller  of , and therefore, their descriptions shall be omitted.","The location management manager  provides the above-described LBS. In an alternative embodiment, the location management manager  of  may be deleted, or equipped and used together with the deletion manager  as illustrated in .","The deletion manager  can delete or disable the service hub program, at least one application program, and data according to the state change of the user or the user terminal device. For example, the deletion manager  can receive a list of programs to delete from the server  and then delete the application programs from the list application programs. The deletion manager  can request the list of the programs to delete to the server  every time the service hub program is executed, or can periodically receive the list of the programs to delete from the server  using a separate daemon program for checking whether to delete the program. The list of the programs to delete can be generated based on the application list provided from the user terminal device. That is, the deletion manager  sends the list of the applications installed in the user terminal device and the unique information and the user information to the server . The server  selects the application program to delete from the list of the applications installed in the user terminal device, and then sends the list to the user terminal device. Hence, the deletion manager  can delete the application program in the list.","Alternatively, the deletion manager  may transmit the terminal unique information or the user information to the server , and receive and delete the list of the application program to delete as determined from the server . For example, the deletion manager  may delete every application program corresponding to the service hub or the service hub program according to an instruction from the server . That is, a wipe-out can be requested from the server , when the state changes and may to jeopardize the security maintenance, e.g., when the user resigns or does not belong to the organization anymore, or when the user terminal device is lost. For the wipe-out request, the server  sends a deletion instruction for the service hub program or a deletion program for the all the application programs to the deletion manager . The deletion instruction may be referred to as a wipe-out instruction. The deletion manager  can check whether the wipe-out instruction is received from the server  every time the service hub program is executed, or may periodically check whether the wipe-out instruction is received, using a separate daemon program.","Upon receiving the wipe-out instruction, the deletion manager  deletes every program and data. Additionally, the deletion manager  may delete the icon container and\/or the icon display.","As described above, the deletion manager  may perform a kill function for individually deleting the application programs, or a wipe-out function for deleting all of the application programs or the service hub program and the data all together. The kill function and the wipe-out function can be applied separately or together. That is, the deletion manager  may include a kill manager for conducting the kill function and a wipe-out manager for conducting the wipe-out function. Accordingly, the security for the service can be maintained definitely.","While the kill function and the wipe-out function may be performed according to the request of the organization or the user for the server , they can also be performed based on location or the authentication failure of the user terminal device. That is, the kill or wipe-out function can be executed also when the user terminal device leaves an effective area over a preset time or fails the authentication. As a result, it is possible to present an unauthorized third party from using the hub service.","The operations of the deletion manager , i.e., the kill function and the wipe-out function can also be executed by the controller  as illustrated in , wherein the controller  receives a list of the application programs to delete or the wipe-out instruction from the server  via the communication unit . Hence, the program or the data stored to the memory  can be deleted.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0118","num":"0117"},"figref":"FIGS. 9 and 10"},"Referring to , when the user terminal device accesses the server, e.g., an application store, the user terminal device displays categories for the application programs. When the user selects a menu  \u201cEnterprise Hub\u201d, supporting the hub service, the user terminal device is connected to the server , which provides the hub service.","Using page data provided from the server , the user terminal device displays groups for distinguishing the organizations of which the service hub is registered. For example, in , the user terminal device displays the groups including \u201cMedicine\u201d, \u201cEducation\u201d, \u201cUniversity\u201d, etc.","When group  is selected, information  and  relating to the organization of the registered service hub among the organizations belonging to the group , are displayed. That is, in the \u201cMedicine\u201d field, an AA hospital and a BB hospital, which have contracted with the server  to receive the hub service, are displayed for the user selects his\/her organization.","When the user is a worker of the AA hospital and selects an AA hospital menu , the user terminal device displays a screen  downloading the service hub program for the AA hospital, as illustrated in the first image of . Specifically, the user obtains information of the service hub program, and requests the download by selecting a download menu .","After the download menu  is selected, the user terminal device displays a pop-up window  for inputting the user information. For example, an input window  and a keypad  can be displayed together with the pop-up window, as illustrated in . Alternatively, the user may input an ID and password in person using a touch pen on the pop-up window . This user information can be provided from the server  for the organization after the contract between the server  and the organization, or directly designated by an operator of the organization. The operator of the organization can notify the server  of the users belonging to the organization of the user information in via mail, email, a text message, a webpage, etc., or in person.","When the user information is input, the user terminal device performs authentication by transmitting the user information and unique information of the user terminal device to the server . When the authentication is successful, the download of the service hub program is initiated. For example, as illustrated in , during the download, a message indicating the downloading degree can be displayed on the user terminal device, and when the download is completed, the user terminal device can displays a message inquiring about whether to install the service hub program. When the user selects a menu  \u201cInstall\u201d, the service hub program is installed to the user terminal device and the user terminal device displays an icon container .","When the icon container  is selected, all of icons  in the icon container  are displayed. As described above, the display state of the icons  can be altered according to installation state and version information of the application program.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0126","num":"0125"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},"Referring to , the server includes a front server unit , a content server unit , and a main server unit . The content server unit  stores the service hub program and the application programs. The front server unit  manages authority of the application program for providing the service per enterprise and per business, and performs preprocessing functions such as initialization, authentication, and policy execution and management. The front server  routes the service to the content server unit  according to the service type, based on the contract. That is, when the user terminal device is connected, the front server unit  determines whether the user terminal device is pre-registered, and then provides the adaptive service hub program and the application programs to the user terminal device.","When the authentication is successful, i.e., the user terminal device is pre-registered, the main server unit  controls the front server unit  to transmit the service hub program corresponding to the user terminal device and the application programs corresponding to the service hub program and the user terminal device, from among the service hub programs and the application programs stored in the content server unit , to the user terminal device.","The setup of application programs can be performed by the main server unit . That is, the administrator of the server  or the organization operator who accesses with a server account assigned by the server  can access the main server unit , request generation of the service hub, and set the application programs.","The main server unit  generates the service hub when the service is requested, and sets the service hub program and the application program corresponding to the service hub. The main server unit  may allocate the server account to the organization which requests the service, and provide a server capacity so that the organization operator accessing with the server account directly can set and manage the service hub program and the application program. Alternatively, the main server unit  can adaptively generate the service hub program for the organization based on the information provided from the organization, and directly set the application programs to be provided to the users of the organization.","When the user terminal device receives the location information at the initial execution of the service hub program, the main server unit  can set the service hub program to be used in the user terminal device and the application program to be managed by the corresponding service hub program, using the location information and other unique information. That is, in the initial execution at the location of the organization A, the main server unit  can set the service hub program and the application program corresponding to the organization A.","Additionally, when load occurs in a particular user party, the main server unit  can establish a policy for limiting the access of the user terminal device belonging to the user party. Herein, the user party can be the organization itself of the user, or the group of the user in the organization. The group can be divided to the departments or the divisions of the organization structure, and may be divided based on other criteria, e.g., based on various criteria such as position, gender, age, marital status, blood type, etc. The main server unit  can limit the access based on other reasons than the load. That is, when the contract from a particular organization is not complied with, the service suspension is requested, or the organization is dissolved, the main server unit  can establish the policy for limiting the access for the user terminal device registered to the corresponding organization. When the user terminal device registered in the user party of the limited access attempts the access, the front server unit  ignores the attempt and does not allow the access according to various policies established by the main server unit .","When the load occurs in a particular service, the main server unit  may establish a policy for limiting the corresponding service. That is, when application programs for providing a group mail service and a train ticket reservation service are excessively executed and subject to the overload, the main server unit  can control not to execute the application programs supporting the corresponding services though they are selected, or does not support the server operation in association with the application programs. According to the service restriction policy established by the main server unit , the front server unit  can limit the service for each user terminal device.","Additionally, when the location of the user terminal device leaves the effective area, the main server unit  can disable the service hub program for the user terminal device or at least one application program for the service hub program. That is, the main server unit  can provide the LBS. According to the setup state of the main server unit , the front server unit  can generate the unavailable list or the availability information, and send it to the user terminal device.","When the state of the user terminal device changes, the main server unit  can set the kill function for deleting at least one of the application programs provided to the user terminal device, or the wipe-out function for deleting at least one of every application program provided to the user terminal device, the service hub program, and the data generated in every program execution all together. According to the set function, the front server unit  can send the kill instruction or the wipe-out instruction to the user terminal device . The state change can be received from the operator of the organization or the user online or offline. Such state changes can include a personal state change such as a job change, retirement, transfer, time-off of the user, etc., and the state change such as loss, breakdown, or replacement of the device.","The main server unit  can support various functions per service hub. For example, the main server unit  can calculate the service usage on the particular user basis and provide information of the service usage. That is, the information of the service usage can be provided directly to the user terminal device via the front server unit , or the main server unit  can provide the information of the service usage directly to the terminal of the organization operator. The information of the service usage can be information relating to the current download state, the frequency of use, the use time, and the use cycle of the service hub program or the application program per organization, i.e., per enterprise, per service group, or per user. The main server unit  defines various events as the indicator for obtaining the service usage. For example, the main server unit  can define the events such as download, execution, and execution end. In the service operation, the main server unit  detects the event occurrence according to the definition. Accordingly, the main server unit  calculates the information of the service usage by analyzing event logs, database, and server logs. Accordingly, the service usage and the task progress per user and per organization in the organization can be easily monitored in view of the administrator.","For example, the main server unit  can also support the group mail service. When the operator of the organization, the administrator of the server, or the user terminal device generates and requests to send group mail by designating a particular user party, the main server unit  can set to transmit messages to the user terminal devices corresponding to the corresponding user party using the pre-registered user information. The front server unit  transmits the corresponding group mail to the user terminal device set by the main server unit .","In addition, even when a notification message is generated, the main server unit  can set to send the notification message to the user terminal devices having the reception entitlement for the notification message. Accordingly, the front server unit  can send the notification message.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0139","num":"0138"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},"Referring to , the server includes a front server unit , a contents server unit , a main server unit , and an open server unit . The front server unit  includes an authentication manager , a service handler , an initialization manager , an access limiter , and a service limiter .","The authentication manager  performs the authentication by receiving the unique information of the device and the user information from the user terminal device. More specifically, the authentication manager  performs authentication by decoding and restoring the received information, comparing the information with the information provided from the organization, and determining whether the corresponding device is the device registered by the organization which requests the hub service. Therefore, when determining the registered device, the authentication manager  sends the authentication result to the user terminal device . While the authentication manager  can inquire the main server unit  about the information provided from the organization, the authentication manager  may fulfill the authentication by using the information stored to the open server unit  to reduce the load of the main server unit .","The service handler  manages the various services provided to the user terminal device. The service handler  can divides the service between different devices according to the type of the hub service. More specifically, when receiving the transmission request from the user terminal device that receives the authentication result, the service handler  transmits the service hub program corresponding to the user terminal device. The service hub program is adaptively generated for the service hub of the registered user terminal device. The service hub program can partially change some functions of the program, the webpage skin, and the available application programs in accordance with the nature of the organization, and other program basic structures can be the same.","More specifically, when the user terminal device accesses and is authenticated by the authentication manager , the service handler  routes the service hub program and the application program corresponding to the user terminal device from the contents server unit  to the user terminal device.","The initialization manager  performs the initialization when the service hub program is initially executed to access the user terminal device. That is, at the initial access of the user terminal device, the initialization manager  generates the application list and the icon list using the information registered to the open server unit  or the main server unit , and registers the terminal unique information, such as IMEI, received from the user terminal device, to the open server unit  or the main server unit .","When the name or the organization of the user changes or when the service hub changes, the open server unit  may detect this change using information of its open hub manager (not shown) and open user manager (not shown). and thus, re-register the user information or the terminal unique information. Through the initialization manager , the user can obtain the exact authority in real time regardless of the company or region and easily acquire the list of the services to receive. The terminal unique information, can be automatically registered to the server .","As for the user terminal device initially accessing, the initialization manager  can store the unique information of the terminal not exposed to the user by mapping the unique information and the user information, and provide the container list of the corresponding service hub based on basic data of the open server unit  synchronized with the main server unit .","When receiving the check request for the application program download or update, the service handler  generates the list of the application programs to newly download or to update and send the generated list to the user terminal device. Accordingly, upon receiving the download request or the update request for at least one application program of the list, the service handler  transmits the requested application program or update data to the user terminal device.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the service handler  may transmit the application programs of the application program list all at once, or when receiving the download request or the update request for at least one of the application programs of the application program list, the service handler  may transmit the at least one application program or the update data to the user terminal device.","It is not necessary that the application program list and icon list are generated by the initialization manager , and alternatively, the service handler  or the main server  can generate the application program list and icon list.","When at least one of various source information, such as user terminal device, organization, group, and application program setup state, changes, the application program list and icon list can be regenerated according to the change.","When a particular user party suffers from the load, the access limiter  limits the access of the user terminal device belonging to the user party. That is, when an error occurs during the hub service, the access limiter  can control and manage the service support on the organization basis, that is, on the enterprise basis or on the group basis. That is, an access limit policy establisher  of the main server unit  can make and execute an access limit policy by registering the service hub to control. When the access limit policy is executed, the access limiter  restricts the access of the user terminal corresponding to the control target according to the policy. Using the access limit policy, the overload or the error in the service of a particular enterprise can be addressed in real time, thus promptly preventing the error from spreading to other services. Accordingly, the use can be limited per organization or per group.","The front server unit  can include the service limiter  for limiting the service when the load occurs in a service limit specific service.","According to the service limit policy established by a service limit policy establisher  of the main server unit , when limiting the access of the system for the contents server unit , the service limiter  restricts the access and blocks the service. Hence, the use can be limited per particular service.","The content server unit  includes a container storage  and a content storage . The container storage  stores the service hub program corresponding to the hub service or the icon container information relating to the service hub program. The content storage  stores the application programs corresponding to the respective service hub programs and other content. The content can be classified into various categories based on their attributes.","For example, the content can be divided into common content, such as a financial application and a personnel matter application, indicating general content commonly used regardless of fields, industry content indicating content managed per specific industry field such as hospital, school, and enterprise, and special content indicating content developed and used for a particular enterprise. For example, the content can be divided and stored based on the fields such as electronics, chemistry, hospital, and school.","The content storage  stores a segment group list and content of the corresponding organization using a hub ID allocated to a service hub newly registered. Accordingly, when the user terminal device accesses the server, the content storage  can provide the stored content.","Although not illustrated in , the content server unit  may include a content generation manager, a service group and user manager, an authentication manager, etc. Accordingly, before providing the content, the content server unit  generates and provides the content corresponding to the user after the authentication. The list for providing the content can be provided from the front server unit  or the main server unit , and the content server unit  may generate the list using the user information by itself and provide the corresponding program.","The open server unit  independently manages the information for fast authentication per enterprise or per business. When the front server unit  requests various information for authentication, the open server unit  can provide basic information using an open hub manager (not shown) and an open user manager (not shown). The various information stored in the open server unit  can be synchronized with various data recorded to the main server unit , various data stored to the content server unit , and various data received via the front server unit .","More specifically, the open server unit  stores backup information of at least one of the unique information of the user terminal device, the user information of the user terminal device, the service hub program information provided for the user terminal device, and the application program information for the service hub program, and provides the backup information as sharing information. That is, when the main server unit  manages all of the information, the front server unit  requests the information from the main server unit  at each authentication. The main server unit  is subject to the load. Therefore, the open server unit  manages the backup information and provides the information when the authentication is conducted.","When the user terminal device initially receives the user information input by the user or the unique information of the terminal device, the open server unit  provides basic information for generating the icon container. In addition, the open server unit  can provide and share the enterprise information and the user information to and with an authorized external institution. An external institution such as application developer, can expose necessary information to develop applications required for the organizations, using open Application Programming Interface (API). Because the open server unit  can support the external institution to easily develop the applications, enhancement of the application program can be activated.","The main server unit  includes a hub manager , the access limit policy establisher , a service limit policy establisher , a location manager , a user information manager , and a service router . The hub manger  registers the service hub when the service is requested. The hub manager  may allocate the server account when an organization requesting the service intends to directly manage the service hub. That is, when the organization requesting the service is in a certain scale, the organization may have human resource capable of managing the service hub. In this case, the server account can be requested on the contract with the administrator of the server. Therefore, the operator of the organization can access its server account by inputting an ID and password in the webpage supported by the server. Thus, the operator can directly set the application program to use in the service hub of the organization, modify, add, and delete the information of the user or the user terminal device registered to the service hub, and set or utilize various services such as LBS, group mail service, and notification message service.","When the server account is allocated to the organization operator, a login page is displayed to the operator. That is, a page data for providing the login page to the operator of the organization is transmitted.","When the operator inputs identification information allocated to the organization in the login page, second page data for providing a management page adaptively generated for the organization is transmitted.","While the management page can be provided by the server administrator in the beginning, the organization operator can modify and edit the management page some time later. The management page displays various information. For example, the management page can provide a region for reading the list of the available application programs of the organization, a region for adding, modifying, and deleting the application program, a region for reading member information registered for the organization, a region for adding, modifying, and deleting the member information, a region for classifying the members, a region for selecting the application program to be used by the classified member group, etc.","The login page and the management page of a similar type can be provided to the organization operator and also to the server administrator. That is, in the contract with a small or medium-sized enterprise or an individual having insufficient human resources, the administrator of the server can manage the service hub according to the request. In this case, the hub manager  can provide the same management page even when the administrator of the server logs on.","The access limit policy establisher  makes the policy for limiting the access per organization or per group, and the service limit policy establisher  makes the policy for limiting the use per service. According to the policies established by the access limit policy establisher  and the service limit policy establisher , the access limiter  and the service limiter  of the front server unit  restrict the access and the service use of the terminal device.","The location manager  supports the location registration and the LBS. When the service hub program is initially executed in the user terminal device, the location manager  receives and registers the location information. Accordingly, the location information is referred to when the corresponding terminal device is authenticated or when the corresponding service hub program and application program are set.","When the location of the user terminal device leaves the effective area, the location manager  disables the service hub program or at least one application program for the service hub program with respect to the user terminal device. Herein, the effective area and the application program to be disabled can be changed by the request of the organization operator or the server administrator, or by the change of the user information. A plurality of effective areas can be defined, and different programs can be disabled in each effective area, as described above.","The user information manager  manages the information of the user or the user terminal device registered to the service hub. Specifically, the user information manager  can set the kill function and the wipe-out function according to the state change of the user terminal device or the user.","More specifically, the user information manager  can periodically check whether the state changes, based on the user information frequently or periodically transmitted from the administrator of the server or the operator of the organization, or based on the information transmitted from the user terminal device itself. Accordingly, when the state changes, the user information manager  sets the corresponding function and the front server unit  takes the corresponding action.","The service muter  mutes the service to adequately provide the user terminal device with the adaptive service hub program and application program for the user terminal device. Specifically, when the authentication manager  of the front server unit  performs the authentication and the service handler  routes the user information, the service router  sets the suitable service hub program and application programs. Accordingly, the service handler  can generate and send the list to the user terminal device.","As described above, the components of the server provide the service hub. In , the disposition of the components is divided for ease of understanding, not to limit the disposition. That is, the server illustrated in  may be explained with other components including an interface unit, a memory, and a controller.

In step S, the application programs are transmitted to the user terminal device, all together or selectively.","When an agreement is made in advance between the organization and the server, and the server and the user terminal device are of the same manufacturer or in a particular contract, the user terminal device sold to the organization may already include the service hub program and the application programs preloaded therein.","As such, when various application programs are installed, the user can use each application program using the service hub program, i.e., using the icon container. As described above, the application program is not hidden such that it is not displayed by a menu or file manager, but is revealed when the icon container is executed.","The user terminal device and the server provide various adaptive services to the service hub. That is, the user terminal device sends location information in step S, and based on the location information and the effective area information, the server determines whether the user terminal device leaves the effective area in step S. Thereafter, the server sends the availability information to the user terminal device in step S.","In step S, the user terminal device limits the availability of the programs based on the availability information.","In step S, when the state of the user or the user terminal device changes and the service use is to be limited, the server sends the kill instruction or the wipe-out instruction to the user terminal device in step S.

That is, the server blocks the access attempt of the user terminal device belonging to the access-limited organization or the organization of the unregistered service hub.","When permitting the access and receiving the transmission request for the service hub program in step S, the server determines, based on the service limit policy, whether to block the service in step S. In step S, when determining to provide the service, the server transmits the service hub program and the application programs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0223","num":"0222"},"figref":"FIG. 27"},"Referring to , a service hub is registered in step S, and the server sets the corresponding service hub program in step S. In step S, the server sets the application programs. Without the separate setting, all of the default application programs can be set for the corresponding service hub program, and instead, application programs selected by the server administrator or the organization operator may be set.","When the user terminal device accesses the server, the server provides the service hub program in step S, and provides the application programs in step S. Before providing these programs, the authentication can be performed.","When the load occurs in a particular user party or in the service use in step S, the server establishes the limit policy for the service or the user party of the load in step S. When the terminal device requesting the service or the terminal device belonging to the user party requests the access or the program download, the server blocks the attempt.","The server frequently or periodically checks whether the user terminal device leaves the effective area in step S, and thus limits the availability in step S.","The server may frequently or periodically check whether the state is changed in step S and delete the program and at least one of the content in step S. As such, the server provides various services to each user terminal device registered to the service hub and blocks the service use, if necessary, so that the users of the user terminal devices can easily utilize the device while maintaining the security.","Although the service hub program and the application program are described above, the provision for the service hub is not limited to the service hub program and the application program. That is, basic content such as general data can be provided per service hub and per service group.","The information of the organizations provided with the service hub may be shared with the authorized external institution so that the external institutions can develop the usable application programs for the service hub and the organizations and register them to the server. The server can store the registered program to the content server unit and the open server unit, and provide the program to the service hubs if necessary, thereby reinforcing the serviceability of the service hub. That is, the application program developer freely develops the application program using the various sharable information provided from the server and registers it to the server. The server allocates the ID to the registered application program and manages the application program. The server allocates the service hub ID to the organization requesting the service and registers the service hub. In particular, the server allocates the server space to the organization or the individual who intends to manage the service hub and allows the direct management. By contrast, the server may directly manage for the organization or the individual that wants the management agent.","As described above, the service provided from the server targets the organization such as enterprise. Accordingly, this service may be referred to as a Business to Business (B2B) service.","Additionally, while various terms including the service hub, the service hub program, and the icon container are used in the description above, these terms indicate the service for integrally managing and supporting the plurality of the services and may be expressed as other terms of the same meaning.","The service providing methods described above can also be stored to various recording media and implemented by program codes executed by a Central Processing Unit CPU of a user terminal device or a server.","More specifically, the codes for executing the above service providing methods can be stored to various recording media readable by the terminal or server, such as a Random Access Memory (RAM), a flash memory, a Read Only Memory (ROM), an Erasable Programmable ROM (EPROM), an Electronically Erasable and Programmable ROM (EEPROM), a register, a hard disc, a removable disc, a memory card, a Universal Serial Bus (USB) memory, and a CD-ROM.","Although certain embodiments of the present invention have been described in detail hereinabove, it should be clearly understood that many variations and\/or modifications of the basic inventive concepts herein taught which may appear to those skilled in the present art will still fall within the spirit and scope of the present invention, as defined in the appended claims and any equivalents thereof."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING","p":["The above and\/or other aspects, features, and advantages of certain embodiments of the present invention will become apparent and more readily appreciated from the following description, when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, of which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIGS. 3 through 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIGS. 9 and 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIGS. 11 and 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIGS. 15 through 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 21"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 22"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 23"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 24"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 25"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIGS. 26 and 27"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
