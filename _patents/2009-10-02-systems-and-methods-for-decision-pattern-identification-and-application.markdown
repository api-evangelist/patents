{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This disclosure relates generally to the field of software engineering.","A software engineering project requires many decisions to be made regarding the architecture of the software being constructed. Reuse of decisions that have been successfully implemented in another project, or in a different part of the same project, may reduce the amount of work necessary to complete a current project. Existing features for reuse, such as copy-paste and export-import, support manual application of prior decisions to the current project by a project architect. However, manual application of prior decisions may be time consuming and error prone, and does not provide context information and fine-grained control over the selection process.","An exemplary embodiment of a system for decision pattern identification and application in a software engineering project includes a decision pattern miner configured to locate decisions in a search space; a decision pattern generator configured to generate a decision pattern from the located decisions; a decision pattern repository configured to store the decision pattern; a decision pattern proposal maker configured to locate a decision pattern relevant to a decision space in the decision pattern repository; and a decision pattern propagator configured to propagate the decision pattern relevant to the decision space in the decision space.","An exemplary embodiment of a method for decision pattern identification and application locating decisions in a search space by a decision pattern miner; generating a decision pattern from the located decisions by a decision pattern generator; storing the decision pattern in a decision pattern repository; locating a decision pattern relevant to a decision space in the decision pattern repository by a decision pattern proposal maker; and propagating the decision pattern relevant to the decision space in the decision space by a decision pattern propagator.","An exemplary embodiment of a computer program product includes a computer readable storage medium containing computer code that, when executed by a computer, implements a method for decision pattern identification and application that includes locating decisions in a search space; generating a decision pattern from the located decisions; storing the decision pattern in a decision pattern repository; locating a decision pattern relevant to a decision space in the decision pattern repository; and propagating the decision pattern relevant to the decision space in the decision space.","Additional features are realized through the techniques of the present exemplary embodiment. Other embodiments are described in detail herein and are considered a part of what is claimed. For a better understanding of the features of the exemplary embodiment, refer to the description and to the drawings.","Embodiments of systems and methods for decision pattern identification and application are provided, with exemplary embodiments being discussed below in detail.","Every decision in a software engineering project has a set of available outcomes, or design alternatives, and a chosen outcome that is selected from the available outcomes. Some example decisions and their available may include: the type of message exchange pattern, which may be chosen from request-reply or one way; message exchange format and transport protocol, e.g., SOAP\/HTTP, SOAP\/JMS, or XML over RESTful HTTP; transactionality of BPEL invoke activity (join existing or create new one); choice of SOAP communication style, e.g., document\/literal or rpc\/encoded (illustrating decision dependency; assumes that SOAP was chosen as the message exchange format); and choice of SOAP engine, e.g., Axis2, Axis 1.x, Xfire, or proprietary engine in application servers (also illustrating decision dependency). A set of decisions and chosen outcomes that are known to work together may be referred to as a decision pattern. Decision patterns may be propagated to other parts of the same project, or to other projects. Decision patterns or combinations of decision patterns that are successfully applied in one or more prior projects, or in a different part of the same project, may be harvested and reused in a current project, also referred to as a decision space. Decision patterns may be identified in a search space, which may comprise a different project, or a different part of the same project as the current project, and stored for application to any area of the current project (decision space). This encourages homogeneous decision making across software projects, which may increase synergy effects while minimizing learning efforts and maintenance requirements. Stored decision patterns may include information regarding the outcome chosen to resolve a project issue, the project phase in which the decision was made, timestamp information, the role by which the decision was made, and justification for the chosen outcome, along with any assumptions and consequences of the outcome. Decision patterns regarding architecture elements are influenced by project-specific requirements; differing elements or projects may have differing requirements, necessitating involvement by a project architect, or decision maker, in the identification and application process so that fit-gap analysis and context mapping may be performed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","101","103","101","102","104","103","104","104","107","104","107","105","104","107","106"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 3","FIG. 4","FIG. 5"],"b":["200","201","101","202","104","203","107","104","204","203","107"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["300","301","101","102","101","101","102","302","102","102","303","302","101","102","304","303","103","107","305","103"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"196pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"generateDecisionPattern(list of outcomes listOfOutcomes)"]},{"entry":[{},"decision pattern pattern = \u201c\u201d"]},{"entry":[{},"foreach outcome outcome in listOfOutcomes do"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"182pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"add to pattern("]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"168pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"outcome.adIssue, outcome.chosenAlternative,"]},{"entry":[{},"outcome.justification, outcome.consequences,"]},{"entry":[{},"outcome.assumptions)"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"196pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"end foreach"]},{"entry":[{},"return pattern"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Various types of decision patterns may be defined and identified, including but not limited to the following eight types.
