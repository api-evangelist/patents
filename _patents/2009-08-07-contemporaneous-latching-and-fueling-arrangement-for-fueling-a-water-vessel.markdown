No. 12\/079,063, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,020,505 hereby incorporated by reference, entitled, \u201cProbe Receiver Device for Recovering Surface Water Vessels,\u201d filed Mar. 3, 2008. This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/268,655, filed May 19, 2009.","The following description was made in the performance of official duties by employees of the Department of the Navy, and, thus the claimed invention may be manufactured, used, licensed by or for the United States Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon.","The following description relates generally to a method and apparatus for fueling a surface water vessel, and in particular, an arrangement for the contemporaneous latching and fueling of a surface water vessel at a location that is remote from a parent ship.","The recovery of smaller surface water vessels, such as manned or unmanned surface water vessels (USVs), by larger parent ships is an emerging technology. Once recovered by the parent ship, servicing operations such as fueling may be performed. Typically, the recovery of a smaller vessel is accomplished by driving the smaller vessel alongside a stationary parent ship and lifted by davit into the ship. Alternatively, the smaller water vessel may be driven up a ramp into the larger ship.","Traditional methods of capturing smaller surface water vessels can cause damage to the hull of the smaller vessel. For example, some USVs weigh about 20,000 lbs and are made from materials such as aluminum. A capturing method that for example, requires the USV to be driven into a parent ship or be lifted and dropped onto the parent ship can cause damage to the aluminum hull, resulting in expensive repairs. The prior art does not teach a method and apparatus that captures the smaller vessel in a controlled manner away from direct contact with the parent ship in order to perform servicing operations such as fueling.","In one aspect, the invention is a fueling system for securing and fueling a water vessel at a floating station. In this aspect, the fueling system includes a parent ship for supplying fuel, and a fuel conduit having a first end and a second end. The fuel conduit is attached to the parent ship at the first end. The system further includes a floating station, remote from the parent ship. The second end of the fuel conduit is attached to the floating station for transporting fuel from the parent ship to the floating station. The floating station includes an opening for receiving a probe. In this aspect, the system further includes a water vessel with a probe, with the probe positioned within the opening of the floating station. The probe receives fuel from the parent ship via the fuel conduit and the floating station.","In another aspect, the invention is a latching and fueling arrangement for securing and fueling a water vessel. The latching and fueling arrangement includes a water vessel. The water vessel includes a vessel hull, an elongated probe having a probe head section. The elongated probe is attached to the vessel hull. In this aspect, the invention further includes a fueling block. The fueling block having an elongated opening for receiving the elongated probe, a clamping arrangement for latching the probe, and a displaceable fuel-feeding cylinder. In this aspect, when the elongated probe is latched in the elongated opening, the fuel-feeding cylinder is slidable into and out of the head section of the elongated probe.","In another aspect, the invention is a method of servicing a water vessel. The method includes the providing of a parent ship with a fuel supply. The method further includes providing a fueling block remote from the parent ship. In this aspect, the method further includes providing a fuel-feeding line from the parent ship to the fueling block, and directing the water vessel to the fueling block. The method further includes securing the water vessel to the fueling block by inserting a fuel-receiving probe into the fueling block.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A"],"b":["101","201","250","101","101","100","103","101","100","103","100","101","201","101","100","101","180","180","182","100"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A"],"b":["201","203","205","201","200","203","205","200","100","200","200","201","201","201","101","201"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A"],"b":["201","250","255","260","250","200","201","260","250","201","101","261","201","101","261","260","101","100","200","120","101","201"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B","FIG. 1B","FIG. 1B","FIGS. 1A"],"b":["101","201","200","250","260","200","250","210","210","250","210","200","200","100","101","212","260","210","1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A and 2B","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B","FIGS. 2A and 2B"],"b":["100","105","101","100","100","200","201","100","115","100","100","170","115","100"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 2C","b":["100","100","130","150","170","100","130","101","201","130"]},"The middle flow section , transmits fuel from the head section  to the connection base section .

The input device for initiating fueling may be remote to the water vessel  or the floating station , according to applicable embodiment of the invention. Upon initiation, fuel from the parent vessel  may be pumped to the fueling block  via the fuel port . Alternatively, fuel may be pumped to the fueling block  before an operator initiates the fueling of the water vessel . Because of the structural arrangement of the valve , in which the fuel-feeding openings  are blocked by the slidable cylindrical stopper , fuel is kept within the fueling block.","When the input device  sends the refueling command to the controller , the controller  actuates the second hydraulic cylinder , thereby retracting the arm , pulling the second cross-mount  towards the rear end  of the fueling block , as shown in . When the second cross-mount  moves toward the fueling block , the valve arrangement  travels in direction Xand enters into the head portion  of the probe  through the opening  in the cover . As the valve arrangement  enters the probe , the valve arrangement  continues to push back the contact cap  in the direction X. The contact cap  continues to move in the direction Xuntil resistance from the spring  and the separation ring  prevent any further motion, leaving the cap  in a receded position.","As shown in , when the contact cap  is in this receded position, the concave surface  of the fuel-feeding cylinder  maintains contact with the cap . However, because the push rod  is fixed and does not slide down with the contact cap , as the contact cap  slides into the receded position, the push rod  protrudes through the hole  in the cap . The push rod  then extends through the opening  at the top of the fuel-feeding cylinder . When the push rod  extends through the opening , the push rod  contacts the protrusion tip  of the cylindrical stopper , thereby pushing the cylindrical stopper  in the Xdirection. As shown in , when the stopper  is pushed back, the fuel-feeding openings  of the cylindrical fuel-feeding head  are unblocked, thereby allowing the fuel to flow through the one or more fuel-feeding openings  to the inside the probe . The fuel then flows from the head section  of the probe to the middle flow section  to the base section , and out of the probe . The fuel is then fed to the fuel collection device  via the hose  shown in .","When fueling is no longer desired, an operator may initiate the termination of fueling via the input device , which sends a termination signal to the controller . Alternatively, a sensing device  within the fuel collection device  may detect when the tank is full and send a termination signal to the controller . In response to a termination signal, the controller extends the cylinder arm , which moves the cross-mount  away from the rear end  of the fueling block . This motion moves the valve arrangement  in direction X, so that the valve exits the probe . While exiting the probe , the slidable cylindrical stopper  moves away from the push rod . This motion away from the push rod  combined with a force of spring , pushes the stopper  so that the stopper protrusion  protrudes through the opening  of the fuel-feeding cylinder . Thus the slidable cylindrical stopper  covers the fuel openings  thereby terminating the flow of fuel.","In the  arrangement, when fueling is completed, an operator may choose to keep the water vessel  attached to the floating vessel  via the probe . Thus, the water vessel  may be maintained for further servicing, or may be towed by the floating station . Alternatively, an operator may decide to release the floating vessel  from the floating station . Similarly, in the  arrangement, when fueling is completed, an operator may choose to keep the water vessel  attached to the parent ship  by means of the fueling block  and the swinging arms . Again, the water vessel  may be maintained for further servicing, or may be towed by the parent ship , or the water vessel  may be released.","The water vessel  is released from the fueling block  when the operator sends a release signal via the input device , which is transmitted to the controller . In response, the controller  extends cylinder arm , which causes the cross-mount  to move away from the rear end  of the fueling block . In response to the motion by the cross mount , the spheres  retract and release the probe , disconnecting the water vessel  from the floating station .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIGS. 1A-4D","FIG. 5"],"b":["500","500","510","250","250"]},"Step  is the providing of a fueling block , remote from the parent ship . As outlined above, the fueling block  may be positioned on the floating station , which may be a solid structure or an inflated structure, and may have any desired shape, such as for example, rectangular, oval; oblong, circular, or irregular. As shown in , the floating station  may have a substantially V-shaped entry area . The fueling block  may also be attached to the parent ship  by means of swinging arms .","Step  is the providing of a fuel-feeding line  from the parent ship  to the fueling block . The fuel-feeding line  may be equipped with one or more valves  for controlling the flow of fuel to the fueling block and to the water vessel . The valves  may lock off the flow of fuel in circumstances when the conduit  fails, thereby preventing undue spillage of fuel into the surrounding water. Step  is the directing of the water vessel  to the fueling block . As shown in , the water vessel  is directed generally in direction . Step  is the securing of the water vessel  to the fueling block  by inserting the probe  into the block . When the fueling block  is on a floating station , as outlined above, the floating station  may have a substantially V-shaped entry, which helps to direct the water vessel  so that the probe  aligns with the fueling block . This is particularly beneficial when the water vessel  is a USV. Additionally, the fueling block  may include a funnel shaped device  to guide the probe  into the block . The water vessel  is secured to the fueling block  when the probe  is locked therewithin. Once secured, the vessel  may be fueled, with fuel pumped from the parent vessel  to the water vessel . Alternatively, once secured the water vessel  may be towed or other servicing operations may commence.","What has been described and illustrated herein are preferred embodiments of the invention along with some variations.
