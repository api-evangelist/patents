The reactions are performed in solvents appropriate to the reagents and materials used are suitable for the transformations being effected. It is understood by one skilled in the art of organic synthesis that the functionality present in the molecule must be consistent with the chemical transformation proposed. This will, on occasion, necessitate judgment by the routineer as to the order of synthetic steps, protecting groups required, and deprotection conditions. Substituents on the starting materials may be incompatible with some of the reaction conditions required in some of the methods described, but alternative methods and substituents compatible with the reaction conditions will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art. The use of sulfur and oxygen protecting groups is well known for protecting thiol and alcohol groups against undesirable reactions during a synthetic procedure and many such protecting groups are known and described by, for example, Greene and Wuts, , Third Edition, John Wiley & Sons, New York (1999).","The chemical reactions described herein are generally disclosed in terms of their broadest application to the preparation of the compounds of this invention. Occasionally, the reactions may not be applicable as described to each compound included within the disclosed scope. The compounds for which this occurs will be readily recognized by one skilled in the art. In all such cases, either the reactions can be successfully performed by conventional modifications known to one skilled in the art, e.g., by appropriate protection of interfering groups, by changing to alternative conventional reagents, by routine modification of reaction conditions, and the like, or other reactions disclosed herein or otherwise conventional, will be applicable to the preparation of the corresponding compounds of this invention. In all preparative methods, all starting materials are known or readily prepared from known starting materials.","The compounds of Formulas (I) to (LVII) can be synthesized by one skilled in the art using conventional methods. Some of the parent prostaglandin compounds (i.e. prostaglandin compounds that do not contain a nitric oxide enhancing group) are commercially available or their synthesis has been reported in the scientific literature. The prostaglandin compounds that are substituted to contain a nitric oxide enhancing group linked to the prostaglandin compound through one or more sites such as oxygen, sulfur and\/or nitrogen via a bond or moiety that can be hydrolyzed, can be synthesized using conventional methods known to one skilled in the art. Known methods for linking the nitric oxide enhancing groups to compounds are described in WO 99\/64417, WO 94\/01422; EP 0 574 726 A1, EP 0 683 159 A1; and in 47: 2688-2693 (2004); 47: 1840-1846 (2004); 46: 3762-3765 (2003); 46: 747-754 (2003); 102: 1091-1134 (2002); 42: 1941-1950 (1999); 41: 5393-5401 (1998); 38: 4944-4949 (1995); 47 (II): 847-854 (1997); the disclosures of each of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. The methods of linking the nitric oxide enhancing group to compounds described in these references can be applied by one skilled in the art to produce any of the nitric oxide enhancing prostaglandin compounds described herein. The prostaglandin compounds of the invention comprising at least one nitric oxide enhancing group donate or transfer a biologically active form of nitrogen monoxide (i.e., nitric oxide).","Compounds contemplated for use in the invention, e.g., prostaglandin compounds that contain at least one nitric oxide enhancing group, linked through one or more sites such as oxygen (hydroxyl condensation), sulfur (sulfhydryl condensation) and\/or nitrogen, via a bond or moiety that is hydrolyzed, are, optionally, used in combination with nitric oxide enhancing compounds that release nitric oxide, increase endogeneous levels of nitric oxide or otherwise directly or indirectly deliver or transfer a biologically active form of nitrogen monoxide to a site of its intended activity, such as on a cell membrane in vivo.","Nitrogen monoxide can exist in three forms: NO\u2014 (nitroxyl), NO. (nitric oxide) and NO (nitrosonium). NO. is a highly reactive short-lived species that is potentially toxic to cells. This is critical because the pharmacological efficacy of NO depends upon the form in which it is delivered. In contrast to the nitric oxide radical (NO.), nitrosonium (NO) does not react with Oor O\u2014 species, and functionalities capable of transferring and\/or releasing NO and NO\u2014 are also resistant to decomposition in the presence of many redox metals. Consequently, administration of charged NO equivalents (positive and\/or negative) does not result in the generation of toxic by-products or the elimination of the active NO group.","The term \u201cnitric oxide\u201d encompasses uncharged nitric oxide (NO.) and charged nitrogen monoxide species, preferably charged nitrogen monoxide species, such as nitrosonium ion (NO) and nitroxyl ion (NO\u2014). The reactive form of nitric oxide can be provided by gaseous nitric oxide.

For sustained release administration, micro particle dosage forms comprising pure, crystalline, therapeutic agents. The therapeutic dosage forms of this aspect of the invention may be of any configuration suitable for sustained release.","Nanoparticle sustained release therapeutic dosage forms are preferably biodegradable and, optionally, bind to the vascular smooth muscle cells and enter those cells, primarily by endocytosis. The biodegradation of the nanoparticles occurs over time (e.g., 30 to 120 days; or 10 to 21 days) in prelysosomic vesicles and lysosomes. Larger microparticle therapeutic dosage forms of the invention release the therapeutic agents for subsequent target cell uptake with only a few of the smaller microparticles entering the cell by phagocytosis. A practitioner in the art will appreciate that the precise mechanism by which a target cell assimilates and metabolizes a dosage form of the invention depends on the morphology, physiology and metabolic processes of those cells. The size of the particle sustained release therapeutic dosage forms is also important with respect to the mode of cellular assimilation. For example, the smaller nanoparticles can flow with the interstitial fluid between cells and penetrate the infused tissue. The larger microparticles tend to be more easily trapped interstitially in the infused primary tissue, and thus are useful to deliver anti-proliferative therapeutic agents.","Particular sustained release dosage forms of the invention comprise biodegradable microparticles or nanoparticles. More particularly, biodegradable microparticles or nanoparticles are formed of a polymer containing matrix that biodegrades by random, nonenzymatic, hydrolytic scissioning to release therapeutic agent, thereby forming pores within the particulate structure.","The compounds and compositions of the invention can be formulated as pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms.
