Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to the field of distributed computing and in particular, to apparatus, systems, and methods to facilitate secure access to selected services during computations performed using hybrid public-private infrastructures.","2. Description of Related Art","The performance of computing applications may often be increased by distributing the computational workload across nodes in a cluster of computers. For example, the performance of compute intensive applications such as DNA sequencing, financial modeling, weather simulations, electronic design automation, etc. can be significantly improved by distributing the applications across nodes in computing clusters. The evolution of \u201cCloud computing services\u201d or \u201cpublic clouds\u201d, which provide on-demand access to computing capabilities over the Internet, is an attempt to increase efficiencies and scalability, while reducing the costs associated with large computing clusters.","\u201cCloud computing\u201d can refer to the use of a company's own computer cluster, but more often the term refers to the use of publicly available computing resources over the Internet through Web browser-based or client-side applications. Clouds or cloud infrastructures are typically made available on an on-demand basis. Cloud computing enables organizations to run applications on reliable, highly-available, and scalable software and hardware infrastructures referred to as clouds. Clouds may use virtualization or sophisticated systems management solutions to provide a flexible, fault tolerant, and highly available view of underlying resources so that dedicated hardware resources can be dynamically shared across several users instead of being assigned individually.","Cloud computing resources, which are often made available as virtual machines (and in some instances as physical machines), may be accessed using Application Programming Interfaces (\u201cAPIs\u201d) and self-service portals\u2014such as websites accessed using a web browser. Cloud infrastructure, which is offered by companies such as Amazon\u2122 EC2, Terremark\u2122, Rackspace\u2122, and Savvis\u2122 refers to the provision of Infrastructure as a Service (laaS) and permits fee-based on-demand access to the power of computing clusters and datacenters over the Internet. In some instances, organizations may use virtualization and convert their private data-centers into clouds as well. These are termed private clouds. As used herein, the term cloud can refer to both public and private clouds, which can be set-up as virtualized or physical compute clusters.","One drawback in running distributed computing applications on cloud infrastructures is the need for services used by applications to be available and accessible at runtime on the cloud infrastructure. Typical distributed computing applications may be composed of several components that may interact with each other as well as with services which, in some instances, can reside outside the core application.","In some instances, it may not be desirable for one or more services to reside on the cloud infrastructure. Security, performance, cost, difficulty in porting, legal issues, and\/or other business related concerns may make it difficult or impractical to migrate and\/or run some service components on the cloud infrastructure. Accordingly, some services may continue to be deployed or made available on a user's private infrastructure behind a firewall, while other parts of the distributed computing application may be run on public cloud infrastructure. In situations where such hybrid public-private infrastructures are desirable, difficulties arise when portions of the application running on the public cloud infrastructure request communication or interaction with services deployed on the private infrastructure. Because services deployed on private infrastructures are protected by firewalls they are not usually accessible to application portions running on the public cloud infrastructure. Accordingly, when applications are run on hybrid infrastructures, access to privately deployed services may involve making changes or exceptions to existing security policies that may be cumbersome to perform and can also increase vulnerabilities to the security of the private infrastructure.","Therefore, there is a need for apparatus, systems, and methods that facilitate secure, seamless, and transparent access to select services available in a private infrastructure to authorized applications running on a public cloud with minimal changes to the security policies of the private infrastructure.","Consistent with embodiments disclosed herein, apparatus, systems and methods for providing authorized applications running on a public cloud secure access to selected services running on a private infrastructure are presented. In some embodiments, a method for securely accessing services on a first infrastructure from a distributed computing application running on a second infrastructure comprises: instantiating a first proxy on the first infrastructure, wherein the first proxy is identified by a first network address and a first port number; instantiating a second proxy on the second infrastructure wherein the second proxy is identified by a second network address and port number; configuring the distributed application to access the at least one service using the second network address and port number; and establishing at least one secure tunnel between the first proxy and the second proxy, wherein: the second proxy sends access requests received from the distributed computing application to the first proxy over the secure tunnel using the first network address and port number, and the first proxy forwards the access request to the at least one service. In some embodiments, the first infrastructure may be a private infrastructure, while the second infrastructure may be a public cloud infrastructure.","Embodiments also relate to software, firmware, and program instructions created, stored, accessed, or modified by computers and\/or processors using computer-readable media or computer-readable memory. The methods described may be performed on various computing devices including distributed computing systems such as clouds.","These and other embodiments are further explained below with respect to the following figures.","In accordance with embodiments disclosed herein, apparatus, systems and methods for providing authorized applications running on a public cloud secure access to selected services running on a private infrastructure the deployment and management of distributed computing systems and are presented.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","120"]},"Private infrastructure  may include a private cloud running distributed application . Distributed application  may comprise several components -, - . . . -N. One or more of components -, - . . . -N may request access to a service. Services requested by the components may include database related services that facilitate component interaction with databases; licensing services to obtain licenses to run components; user authentication services to request access for users running an application; workflow-integration services; various remote services accessible over protocols like hypertext transfer protocol (\u201chttp\u201d) and remote method invocation (\u201crmi\u201d); etc. In general, services may comprise an application or group of applications that facilitate access to, or provide, functionality requested by a component.","In , the service is shown as Licensing Service . For ease of explanation,  and subsequent figures will be described in relation to Licensing Service . However, it should be noted that the techniques described herein are not restricted to exemplary Licensing Service  shown, but are also applicable to various other types of services with appropriate modifications as would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. One or more components  may interact with Licensing Service  to check out licenses. Licensing Service  may be an application available from third party vendors that facilitates the management of application licenses.","In some instances, a license to use an application may be node locked thereby associating the software with a specific machine and restricting application runs to the specified machine. In other instances, a pool of floating licenses may be allocated dynamically to users and a license may be checked-out when a user begins using some software on a machine and checked-in when the user finishes using the software. For example, a pool of 50 floating licenses for an application can support a large user community provided that no more than 50 users make simultaneous use of the licensed application.","Application licenses are often tied to a specific licensing service and the licenses often cannot be moved to a different licensing service running on a different machine or infrastructure. For example, a licensing service or license server that provides licenses to applications may be locked to a specific network MAC address, or may need to read a local USB encryption key. For example, one or more licenses requested by components  may be tied to Licensing Service .","Components  may request licenses from Licensing Service  using information in Configuration Metadata for Licensing Service , which may include the host name, host id, and\/or the network address and port number as well as other information for interacting with Licensing Service  such as any configuration information that may be specific to the implementation of the licensing service such as environment variables and\/or specific protocols [e.g.; http, Simple Object Access Protocol (\u201csoap\u201d), or remote method invocation], that may be required for interacting with the service along with accompanying request parameters. In general, information in Configuration Metadata for Licensing Service  may be used to permit components  to seamlessly interact with Licensing Service . Licensing Service  may use Service Information , which may include information pertaining to application licenses currently administered by the server, the number(s) of such licenses, the nature of the licenses (e.g.; are they floating or fixed), etc., and communicate with requesting components  to grant or deny licenses. In , both Licensing Service  and Distributed Application  are both running on Private Infrastructure  and behind Firewall . Therefore, for computations run entirely on private cloud infrastructures on one side of Firewall , such as distributed application , Firewall  is not involved when components  interact with Licensing Service . In general, Firewall  may not be involved when one or more components  communicate or interact with one or more services provided within Firewall , which protects Private Infrastructure .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["220","210","220","225","1","225","2","225","210","210","210","210","210"]},"In , exemplary Licensing Service  is shown as a service that runs on private infrastructure . As noted earlier, application licenses are often tied to a specific licensing service and the licenses often cannot be moved to a different licensing service running on a different machine or infrastructure. For example, a licensing service or license server that provides licenses to applications may be locked to a specific network MAC address, or may need to read a local USB encryption key. In such situations, it may not be practical to move the licensing service to the public cloud. For example, one or more licenses requested by components  may be tied to Licensing Service  and it may be impractical to move Licensing Service  because a local USB-device based encryption key is read by Licensing Service .","As shown in , Licensing Service  runs on Private Infrastructure , while Distributed Application  runs on Public Cloud , which is on the other side of Firewall . In general, a firewall is a device, or software, or some combination of hardware and software that permits or denies network communications between entities on different sides of the firewall based upon a set of rules. Firewall  may protect Private Infrastructure  from unauthorized access while permitting legitimate communications to pass. Firewall  may operate at one or more layers of the Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (\u201cTCP\/IP\u201d). For example, Firewall  may be comprise (i) a packet filter, which may work at the Network level of the TCP\/IP stack and inspect individual packets for conformance with its rule sets, and\/or (ii) an application filter, which may work at the Application level of the TCP\/IP stack and inspect traffic to determine if the traffic is associated with applications such as browsers, telnet, and\/or file transfer protocol (\u201cftp\u201d) traffic. Packets associated with permitted applications that match rules in firewall  may be allowed to pass while packets associated with other (non-permitted) applications are blocked. In principle, application firewalls can prevent all unwanted outside traffic from reaching protected machines in Private Infrastructure . Typically, firewalls allow connections on some ports, such as hypertext transfer protocol (\u201chttp\u201d) on Port , secure hypertext transfer protocol (\u201chttps\u201d) on port , etc., which relate to browser based Internet traffic.","For applications running on hybrid private-public infrastructures (as in shown , where Distributed Application  runs on Public Cloud  and Licensing Service  runs on Private Infrastructure ), Firewall  may prevent communication between Licensing Service  and Distributed Application . Therefore, in order to allow communication between Licensing Service  and Distributed Application , rule sets in Firewall  may need to be modified to permit such communication. The modification of rule sets in Firewall  increases the vulnerability of Private Infrastructure  to external threats and additionally creates impediments to the migration of applications to public clouds because of the overhead presented by additional network administration tasks related to configuration of the firewall.","One approach to permit communication between Licensing Service  and Distributed Application  through Firewall  involves the use of Virtual Private Network (\u201cVPN\u201d) Tunnel . VPN Tunnel . A virtual private network may use a public network, such as the Internet, to provide remote access to Private Infrastructure  through Firewall . To start a VPN session and create VPN tunnel  remote users who want access to resources, applications, and\/or services provided by Private Infrastructure  are authenticated. Upon successful authentication secure VPN tunnel  may be established between tunnel endpoints. Authentication to establish VPN Tunnel  between Distributed Application  on Public Cloud  and Licensing Service  on Private Infrastructure  may use passwords, digital certificates, keys, and\/or other cryptographic methods that permit automatic authentication without user intervention.","Data exchanged after successful authentication is secured using encryption technologies to prevent disclosure of private information to unauthorized parties. In general, upon successful access to Private Infrastructure  using VPN tunnel , Distributed Application  may act as if it was connected directly to the Private Infrastructure  without regard to the presence of Firewall . Once operational, VPN Tunnel  permits access to all network functionality found on Private Infrastructure , including access to network resources, services etc.","When Components  request licenses from Licensing Service  using information in Configuration Metadata for Licensing Service , the requests are conveyed through VPN tunnel  to Licensing Service , which either grants or denies a license. Information in Configuration Metadata for Licensing Service  may include information for interacting with Licensing Service  such as the host name, host id, and\/or the network address and port number for a machine running Licensing Service . In general, information in Configuration Metadata for Licensing Service  may be used to permit components  to seamlessly interact with Licensing Service  through VPN tunnel . Licensing Service  may use Service Information  and communicate with requesting components  to grant or deny licenses.","One drawback of using VPN tunnel  is that entire Private Infrastructure  may potentially be exposed when the VPN tunnel is active. Therefore, if security or authentication procedures associated with VPN tunnel  are compromised, there may be a substantial security risk to Private Infrastructure . These security risks may be mitigated somewhat by creating a special user class or group for public cloud applications such as Distributed Application  and limiting privileges available to the group. However, the creation of the special user group as well as establishing VPN access to Private Infrastructure  requires permission, intervention, and set up by a network administrator thereby preventing quick seamless deployment of applications on Public Cloud . Moreover, these procedures are repeated for each Public Cloud  on which applications are run. For example, for an application capable of being deployed on Amazon, Rackspace, and\/or Terremark in the VPN tunnel scenario, authentication procedures to establish VPN tunnel  are repeated for each cloud thereby impeding application deployment across multiple clouds.","Seamless deployment and running of applications on hybrid public-private infrastructures is facilitated when: (i) The service requested by the distributed application (such as the Licensing Service) is not changed as a consequence of deployment; (ii) The firewall configuration is not changed (assuming that well-known ports such as for secure hypertext transfer protocol (\u201chttps\u201d) are open); (iii) There are no changes to the core distributed application (iv) Services utilized by the distributed application are accessible without exposing the entire private infrastructure; (v) there are no impediments to interaction between the distributed application and the requested service and (v) the service requested is not made available to unauthorized applications and\/or users. The VPN tunnel solution does not provide seamless deployment and running of applications on hybrid infrastructures at least because of changes to the firewall configuration to allow VPN access and because VPN tunneling exposes the entire private infrastructure to the distributed application when the VPN tunnel is operational.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","300","210","300","300"]},"As shown in , Distributed Application  may run on public cloud . Distributed Application  may comprise components -, - . . . -N. In some embodiments, Distributed Application  may be a cloud-specific implementation of an infrastructure independent representation of a distributed application. In , exemplary Licensing Service  is shown as a service that runs on Private Infrastructure . As noted earlier, the use of Licensing Service  is exemplary and for descriptive purposes only. In general, one or more services running on Private Infrastructure  may interact with Distributed Application . As shown in , exemplary Licensing Service  runs on Private Infrastructure  on one side of Firewall , while Distributed Application  runs on Public Cloud , which is on the other side of Firewall .","In some embodiments, System  may comprise a System Manager or Management Server . For example, System Manager  may provide APIs for managing templates and modeling new applications. In one embodiment, System Manager  may provide a user console or browser interface to allow users to: model and import applications for deployment, upload application data, share one or more applications, invoke an application to run securely on a cloud infrastructure, and provide run time inputs for deploying applications. In some embodiments, System Manager  may be used to manage and deploy Distributed Application . In some embodiments, System Manager  may be used to provide information that may facilitate the configuration of Distributed Application  with Configuration Metadata for the Licensing Service . In some embodiments, System manager  may communicate with Cloud Coordinator\/Gateway  using secure communication interlinks. In some embodiments, System manager  may communicate with Cloud Coordinator\/Gateway  over an https based secure communication channel.","In some embodiments, Cloud Coordinator\/Gateway  may orchestrate application deployment, scaling, management and tear-down on a cloud such as Public Cloud . In some embodiments, system  may have multiple clouds (not shown) and one Cloud Coordinator\/Gateway  per cloud. In some embodiments, System Manager  may invoke and instruct Cloud Coordinator\/Gateway  for Public Cloud  to orchestrate the deployment of Distributed Application  on that cloud. For example, system manager  may pass an infrastructure independent application model to coordinator\/gateway  for Public Cloud , which may be one of Amazon, Rackspace, Terremark, etc. In some embodiments, coordinator\/gateway  may maintain a library of cloud specific implementations for primitives and composite interfaces for Public Cloud . When an application is to be deployed, coordinator\/gateway  can use the library to perform deployment and execution tasks for Public Cloud .","In some embodiments, Cloud Coordinator\/Gateway  may be used to initiate the configuration of Distributed Application  by setting up Configuration Metadata for the Licensing Service . In some embodiments, Cloud Coordinator\/Gateway  may initiate configuration Distributed Application  with Configuration Metadata for the Licensing Service  using information received from System manager  so that each node used by Distributed Application  can seamlessly interact with Licensing Service . Information in Configuration Metadata for the Licensing Service  may be used to permit Distributed Application  to interact seamlessly with Licensing Service .","In some embodiments, Cloud Coordinator\/Gateway  may also interact with Node Agent  to complete the application orchestration. In some embodiments, Cloud Coordinator\/Gateway  may also instantiate Cloud Proxy  with information gathered from the System manager  about the Licensing Service , and user information obtained through the Private Infrastructure Proxy . For example, upon instantiation Cloud Proxy  may establish Secure Tunnel  to Private Infrastructure Proxy  for secure and selective access to the Licensing Service . In some embodiments, Cloud Coordinator\/Gateway  may direct Node Agent  to monitor and report task status back to coordinator\/gateway  and perform other tasks. In some embodiments, Node Agent  may be a process that can set up a node to interact with Cloud Proxy  so that Components  can seamlessly interact with the Licensing Service  while running on that node. A node refers to a physical machine that is capable of running virtual machines. For example, Node Agent  may add information relating to Cloud Proxy  in Configuration Metadata for the Licensing Service  to permit communication between Components  in Distributed Application  and Cloud Proxy .","In some embodiments, Cloud Coordinator\/Gateway  may also interact with Cloud Proxy . Cloud Proxy  may take the form of a process that maintains trusted and secure communications with Private Infrastructure Proxy . In some embodiments, Private Infrastructure Proxy  may take the form of a virtual appliance. In general, a software appliance is a software application, which may be combined with an operating system so that the software can be run easily on industry standard hardware or virtual machines. A virtual appliance may be created when the installation of a software appliance on a virtual machine is packaged. Thus, a virtual appliance refers to a virtual machine image that can run on a virtualization platform. A virtual machine image may take the form of a filesystem image and may include an operating system and the software required to deliver functionality or services.","In some embodiments, Private Infrastructure Proxy  (which is behind firewall ) may initiate the establishment of Secure Tunnel  to Cloud Proxy  using the network address and port specified for Licensing Service . Secure Tunnel  may be mutually authenticated and may be initiated and established over well-known ports such as https (port number ), which are typically open, so that no changes are made to existing firewall policy. In some embodiments, by detailing a specific network address and port number for Licensing Service , Cloud Proxy  may access and interact with Licensing Service  over Secure Tunnel  but may not have access to other resources and\/or services on Private Infrastructure .","In some embodiments, the network address and port number for Licensing Service  may be entered by a user, or may be obtained from a file or script, during the set up of Private Infrastructure Proxy . Private Infrastructure Proxy  may also receive the network address and port number for Cloud Proxy  from the System Manager , and use the network address and port information to set up Secure Tunnel  between Private Infrastructure Proxy  and Cloud Proxy . For example, in some embodiments, the network address and port number for Licensing Service  may be read from a file, or entered by user during the initial configuration of Private Infrastructure Proxy .","In one embodiment, Cloud Coordinator\/Gateway  may use information received from System Manager  to direct Node Agent  to configure a node for communication\/interaction with Cloud Proxy . Node Agent  may store information to facilitate communication between a node and Cloud Proxy  in Configuration Metadata for the Licensing Service , which may then be used by components  in Distributed Application  to request access to Licensing Service  using Secure Tunnel  established between Cloud Proxy  and Private Infrastructure Proxy . In some embodiments, License Service 's network address and port information may not be directly exposed to System Manager , Cloud Coordinator\/Gateway , Node Agent  and\/or Cloud Proxy .","In some embodiments, System Manager , Cloud Coordinator\/Gateway , Node Agent , Cloud Proxy , and Private Infrastructure Proxy  may be functional modules of a service that automatically deploys and runs cloud-specific implementations obtained from an infrastructure independent representation of Distributed Application  on Public Cloud .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400","402"]},"Next, in step , a proxy for Private Infrastructure , such as Private Infrastructure Proxy , may be installed. In some embodiments, Private Infrastructure Proxy  may take the form of a virtual appliance. In step , Private Infrastructure Proxy  may be configured. For example, user information pertaining to users of Public Cloud  may be obtained. In some embodiments, the user information may pertain to a service that automatically deploys and runs cloud-specific implementations obtained from an infrastructure independent representation of Distributed Application  on Public Cloud . The user information may include a user name, password, as well any other information used to authenticate a user with the service and\/or with Public Cloud . In step , the configuration information obtained may be validated. For example, Private Infrastructure Proxy  may connect to System Manager  using https to determine if the user information obtained is valid. If the information is valid, (\u201cY\u201d in step ) then, the algorithm may proceeds to step , otherwise (\u201cN\u201d in step ) the algorithm may return to step .","In step , set up process  may obtain information about one or more services to be accessed in Private Infrastructure  as well as information pertaining to Cloud Proxy . The information obtained may include network address and port information for each service to be accessed in Private Infrastructure . For example, the network and port information for Licensing Service  may be obtained. The network address may be specified as a hostname and\/or IP address. For example, the network address for Licensing Service  may be specified as \u201clicense_server.local.mycompany.com\u201d and the port number for Licensing Service  may be specified as . Similarly, information for Cloud Proxy  may be specified, with network address as \u201clicense_proxy.osmosix.com\u201d and the port specified as port .","In step , upon successful mutual authentication between Private Infrastructure Proxy  and Cloud Proxy , Secure Tunnels  may be established from each service to the proxy on the public cloud. For example, Secure Tunnel  may be established from Private Infrastructure Proxy  to Cloud Proxy  across firewall . In some embodiments, a well-known port such as Port  (https) may be used to help establish Secure Tunnel(s) . For example, Private Infrastructure Proxy  may use https for mutual authentication with Cloud Proxy , and upon successful mutual authentication establish Secure Tunnel(s) and expose Licensing Service  running on license_server.local.mycompany.com:7000 securely and selectively to authenticated Cloud Proxy .","In step , upon successful mutual authentication, Cloud Proxy  may bind port  to its localhost. The term \u201clocalhost\u201d refers to the originating computer and is the standard hostname given to the address of the loopback network interface. When communicating with the loopback interface the local network interface hardware is bypassed but communication otherwise occurs in a manner identical to communication with other computers on a network. Next, in step , Cloud Proxy  may query System Manager  for user information to establish a trusted user list with permission to access Cloud Proxy port . The process may then terminate in step .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","500","500","502","505","220","210","330","220","330","340","220","320"]},"In step , Node Agent  checks if the communication channel to cloud proxy is already open. If the channel is open, then, method  may proceed to step . If not (\u201cN\u201d in step ), then, in some embodiments, in step , Node Agent  may set up a secure channel to Cloud Proxy  after mutual authentication. In step , Node Agent  may use the credentials of the current user during the mutual authentication process. Cloud Proxy  may then check if the current user is entitled to access the requested port. If the current user is entitled to access the requested port on Cloud Proxy , then Node Agent  may establish a secure channel between the localhost and the requested port on Cloud Proxy  and will bind the port to localhost. For example, Node Agent  may be able to access port  on license_proxy.osmosix.com as the current user. In the event that mutual authentication fails (not shown), the application launch will fail without the establishment of the secure channel. Upon authentication the secure communication channel is set up and method  may proceed to step .","In step , Node Agent  may launch Distributed Application  on Public Cloud  and Distributed Application  may commence running on the node(s). Next, in step , Distributed Application  may attempt communication with a service running on Private Infrastructure  using localhost and the specified port number. For example, Distributed Application  may attempt communication with Licensing Service  at localhost:port .","In step , the communication initiated by Distributed Application  is seamlessly and securely routed over the communication channel established earlier to Cloud Proxy . Upon receiving the communication, in step , Cloud Proxy  may send the communication over Secure Tunnel  to Private Infrastructure Proxy . For example, Cloud Proxy  may send the communication to \u201clicense_server.local.mycompany.com:7000\u201d, which represent the address and port number of Private Infrastructure Proxy .","Next, in step , Private Infrastructure Proxy  sends the communication to the selected service. For example, Private Infrastructure Proxy  may send the communication to Licensing Service . In step , the service on Private Infrastructure Proxy  may respond to the communication and the response is sent back to Distributed Application  through Private Infrastructure Proxy  and Cloud Proxy . For example, the grant or denial of a license by Licensing Service  may be sent to Private Infrastructure Proxy  and then over the Secure Tunnel  to Cloud Proxy  at license_proxy.osmosix.com: 7001 and then by Cloud Proxy  to Distributed Application . Steps - may be repeated during the running of Distributed Application . When Distributed Application  completes execution the secure communication channel between Distributed Application  and Cloud Proxy  may be torn down. In some embodiments, Node Agent  may tear down the secure communication channel between Distributed Application  and Cloud Proxy .","In some embodiments, there may be one or more cloud proxies  per cloud. The use of more than multiple cloud proxies  may increase scalability and allow load balancing between cloud proxies , in addition to providing fault-tolerance between cloud proxies. In some embodiments, multiple cloud proxies  may facilitate access to different types of services on different ports.","In other embodiments, there may be 1 cloud proxy  for multiple clouds. For example, in situation where a single cloud proxy  serves multiple clouds, a node agent  in one of the clouds served by cloud proxy  may obtain the IP address of cloud proxy  and establish Secure Tunnel  with cloud proxy . In some embodiments, cloud proxy  serving multiple clouds may be centrally managed. In some embodiments, the IP address of cloud proxy , which serves multiple clouds, may be public.","Although the exemplary embodiments shown discuss secure access to selected services during computations, where the selected services are deployed within private infrastructures, the disclosure is not restricted to the exemplary embodiments discussed. For example, persons of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that system , which includes private proxy  and cloud proxy , may be configured to provide secure access to select application services hosted on public network. For example, system  may be used to allow secure selective access to Licensing Service , or other application services running on a server that is publicly accessible over the Internet. However, access to the select application services available on the publicly accessible server may be provided securely and may be restricted to authorized distributed applications by using techniques described above.","Note that although the description above uses exemplary cloud infrastructures and exemplary services to describe possible implementations, alternate implementations are envisaged and the methods described could be extended to other cloud infrastructures as would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. Further, although various exemplary modules such as System Manager , Cloud Coordinator\/Gateway , Node Agent , Cloud Proxy , and Private Infrastructure Proxy  have been identified as performing certain functions, the descriptions of the above modules and their functions are exemplary only.","Various other configurations and distribution of functionality among modules are possible as would be apparent to one or ordinary skill in the art.
