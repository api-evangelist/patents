{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT","REFERENCE TO A MICROFICHE APPENDIX","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Not applicable.","Not applicable.","Not applicable.","Internet Protocol (IP) networks allow a collection of computers and other devices to be communicatively coupled to each other using a private address space. Internet Protocol networks utilize the Internet to facilitate the sharing of resources amongst devices. In order to enable communication between devices within private and public networks, Network Address Translation (NAT) may be employed to translate between addresses in the private address space and addresses in the public address space.","Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) is an example of an IP application that includes real-time communication features such as voice and video chatting among web browser. In order to discover and traverse NAT, current WebRTC architecture requires the web browsers to implement certain Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) network protocols and techniques such as Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) and Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN). STUN may allow a client to determine whether it is operating behind a NAT and to discover its public IP address that is allocated for User Datagram Protocol (UDP) connections to a remote host. Additionally, TURN may be an extension of STUN and may utilize intermediate nodes to serve as relays to allow communication between peers.","These protocols, however, may be inefficient in properly monitoring NAT behavior as they may not be supported by some networks, resulting in communication failures. For example, some firewalls may block STUN and UDP traffic for clients such as Skype and Google Talk. Additionally, the network protocols may not reuse web traffic generated by a browser for NAT discovery, thereby creating excess networking overhead. The dedicated STUN\/TURN servers may be single points of failure, and it may be difficult to extend them to support other NAT discovery mechanisms (e.g., a P2P rendezvous). Furthermore, the protocols introduce a connectivity layer that may not follow the web architecture, in which the STUN and TURN servers do not return hypertext even though they can be identified by URI schemes. Thus, there is a need for NAT discovery mechanisms that address one or more of the aforementioned issues within the Web architecture.","In one embodiment, the disclosure includes a method performed in a web browser, the method comprising dereferencing a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) comprising a web resource and a reflex tag, creating a request message comprising a request for the web resource and a reflex request corresponding to the reflex tag, wherein the reflex request is a request for address and port information from a web server comprising the web resource, encapsulating the request message in a transport message comprising an Internet Protocol (IP) address and a port of the web browser, transmitting the transport message to the web server, receiving a response message from the web server, wherein the response message comprises a second IP address and a second port number of the browser as seen by the web server, wherein the second IP address and the second port number is the requested address and port information, and wherein the response message further comprises at least a part of the web resource, and determining a characteristic of at least one Network Address Translation (NAT) device coupled between the web browser and the web server based on the second IP address and the second port number.","In another embodiment, the disclosure includes a method performed in a web server, the method comprising receiving a transport message, wherein the transport message is an encapsulated request message, wherein the request message comprises a request for a web resource and a reflex request corresponding to a reflex tag from a web browser, and wherein the transport message comprises an IP address and a port number generated by at least one NAT device for the web browser, in response to receiving the request for the web resource, retrieving the web resource, in response to receiving the reflex request, inserting the IP address and the port number in a response message, wherein the response message further comprises at least a part of the web resource, and transmitting the response message to the web browser.","In yet another embodiment, the disclosure includes a computer program product comprising computer executable instructions stored on a non-transitory computer readable medium such that when executed by a processor cause a web browser to dereference a hyperlink identifying a web resource with a reflex tag, create a request message comprising a request for the web resource and a reflex request corresponding to the reflex tag, wherein the reflex request is a request for address and port information from a web server comprising the web resource, and encapsulate the request message in a transport message comprising an IP address and a port of the web browser, send the transport message to the web server, acquire a response message from the web server, wherein the response message comprises a second IP address and a second port number of the browser as seen by the web server, wherein the second IP address and the second port number is the requested address and port information, and wherein the response message further comprises at least a part of the web resource, and determine a presence of and a type of at least one NAT device coupled between the web browser and the web server based on the second IP address and the second port number.","These and other features will be more clearly understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and claims.","It should be understood at the outset that, although an illustrative implementation of one or more embodiments are provided below, the disclosed systems and\/or methods may be implemented using any number of techniques, whether currently known or in existence. The disclosure should in no way be limited to the illustrative implementations, drawings, and techniques illustrated below, including the exemplary designs and implementations illustrated and described herein, but may be modified within the scope of the appended claims along with their full scope of equivalents.","Dereferencing a URI may refer to obtaining a resource identified by a specific URI. A URI dereference may represent a request from a web browser to a web server, which may be triggered by a mouse click or a keystroke as examples. Dereference protocols may comprise transaction, encryption (e.g., Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols), authentication, authorization, message integrity, and redirection of these protocols.","During a session, a web browser may visit tens to hundreds of URI links for a Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) page automatically or in response to user actions. An HTML page may comprise several different components, such as one or more embedded images, embedded JavaScript (JS), and HTML elements. The web browser may make multiple requests to receive and load all these components, which may each have a corresponding URI. The constant Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requests made by a browser may be related to the content of the page in displaying images and running code. The requests may also be for loading advertisements on a website or sending information to other tracking websites.","This process may be repeated each time a new web page is loaded. Links in an HTML page may point to different IP addresses, in which Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or UDP transports may be employed. NAT behaviors may be the same for TCP and UDP. NAT mapping and filtering behaviors for TCP are classified in Request for Comment (RFC) memorandum 5382, entitled \u201cNAT Behavioral Requirements for TCP\u201d, dated October 2008, which is incorporated herein by reference as if reproduced in its entirety. Similarly, NAT behavior for UDP is specified in RFC memorandum 4787, entitled \u201cNetwork Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP\u201d, dated January 2007, which is incorporated herein by reference as if reproduced in its entirety. Since a web browser is continuously updating through UDP and TCP requests, it may be beneficial to utilize HTTP traffic from a browser for discovering and monitoring NAT behaviors. This approach may circumvent potential issues with traditional STUN and TURN protocols, such as unsupported networks, firewalls, as well as overhead challenges.","Disclosed herein are systems, methods, apparatuses, and computer program products for monitoring NAT behaviors through URI dereferences in web browser-based communication. URI dereference protocols may be reused in order to simplify the NAT discovery process without dedicated STUN or TURN servers, which may allow NAT detection and monitoring to become almost free of byproducts when a user browses the web. This approach may be achieved by implementing a new NAT discovery protocol. A new protocol, sometimes referred to herein as embedded STUN (E-STUN), may simplify NAT monitoring by integrating the protocol within a variety of URI dereference protocols, e.g., comprising HTTP 1.1 and Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP). A tag may be embedded in a URI to trigger a request for IP address and port information, as seen by a receiving web server, to be embedded in a web resource request message. The request message may traverse a Network Address Translation device, which affects the IP address and port information seen by the web server. By reusing existing HTTP and XMPP protocols, E-STUN embedded traffic may be able to go past firewalls which may block conventional NAT traversal protocols. In addition, NAT behavior may be monitored without creating extra costs to a browser or server, in order to detect NAT mapping or filtering changes which may occur in response to an increase in load or update in policy.","E-STUN services may be advertised explicitly in hypertext for URI authority in page and individual URI schemes, using a variety of HTML version 5 (HTML5) semantic tag mechanisms, including microdata (HTML5), Resource Description Framework in attributes (RDFa), microformat, and HTML5 rel attribute. In another embodiment, E-STUN services may be advertised implicitly by returning addresses automatically during URI dereferences. Furthermore, the E-STUN services may be incorporated with a server mechanism and\/or a client mechanism to integrate the E-STUN protocol into the URI dereference process and monitor NAT behavior based on the data collected.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","110","120","130","140","150","130","130","110","112","110","114"]},"In an embodiment, a user may either invoke a URI link (e.g., corresponding to HTTP URI  or XMPP URI ) or the link may point to a resource that is automatically downloaded by the browser . The link may go through a URI dereference process, by which the browser may send some messages to the server (e.g., server 1  or server 2 ) identified by the URI in order to obtain some data back (e.g., HTML, XML). The HTPP URI  and XMPP URI  may comprise a web resource and a tag, sometimes referred to herein as a reflex tag, that is used to invoke an E-STUN protocol. Potential syntax for reflex tags is disclosed herein. A reflex tag embedded in a URI may indicate a request for obtaining a translated IP address, if any, provided by a NAT in order to determine NAT behavior as disclosed herein, in addition to the conventional dereference protocol. Furthermore, the web page  may comprise a NAT module , which may use a JavaScript Application Programming Interface (API) to obtain NAT information.","A web browser  may display web page  and may comprise a NAT monitor module  and URI dereference modules  and  for HTTP and XMPP, respectively. As used herein, the term \u201cmodule\u201d preceded by a descriptor may refer to computer program instructions used to perform the descriptor. For example, a NAT monitor module may refer to computer program instructions used to perform NAT monitoring. The computer program instructions may be executed by a general-purpose processor to perform the indicated descriptor or function. Steps sufficient to implement the modules referenced herein are described herein.","A URI, such as HTTP URI  or XMPP URI , may be invoked. Upon invocation, the URI dereference module  may create a request message, denoted as Q in various figures. The request message may be a conventional HTTP request message. If the invoked URI comprises a reflex tag, the reflex tag may signal to the URI dereference module  to embed NAT behavior request message or syntax, denoted as EQ, in the request message Q. The NAT behavior request message may sometimes be referred to as an E-STUN request message. The combined request message, denoted as Q\u2032, may be transported via a transport module  using the TCP or UDP protocol.","The transport module  may receive transport (TCP or UDP) packets from the web browser  and send the packets to a web server through the NAT device . The NAT device  may perform address and port mapping for request and response messages Q\u2032 and R\u2032. In another embodiment, the NAT device  may comprise a plurality of modules which are layered and conduct address translation. The NAT device  may not modify Q\u2032 or R\u2032 messages, except for the private browser IP address and port information for the web servers  and . (X0,Y0) may be a private IP address and port of the browser, which is unknown by a web server. Server 1  and server 2  may obtain translated browser IP addresses and port numbers, such as (X1,Y1) and (X2,Y2), respectively. The HTTP and XMPP servers  and , respectively, may receive requests from a web browser , with address and port information that has been translated by the NAT device .","After a URI dereference, a Q\u2032 request may reach a web server as directed by the URI. If the URI is an HTTP link, the request may go to HTTP server . If the URI is an XMPP link, the request may go to XMPP server . Each server may receive the request over a corresponding transport module  or  via TCP or UDP packets and may be directed by the address and port information provided by NAT device . The message may then be decoded by a reflex agent  or . The EQ portion of Q\u2032, which is the dereference message with embedded E-STUN, may be eliminated from the message, as denoted by Q=Q\u2032\u2212EQ. That is, the embedded message may be extracted in order to recover the regular message Q. The regular message Q may then be sent to an HTTP server  or an XMPP server .","During this task, the reflex agent  or  may record the reflex IP address from the public IP address from the NAT device . The aforementioned private IP address and port (X0,Y0) may be mapped by NAT device  to (X1,Y1) for HTTP server  or (X2,Y2) for XMPP server . The reflex agent  or  may not be aware of the mapping and may record the public IP address from the NAT device. When the conventional HTTP or XMPP processing is complete, the response R may be sent back to the reflex agent  or . The reflex agent  or  may then insert the (X1,Y1) or (X2,Y2) IP address and port information into a response message, denoted as R\u2032. The response message comprises a conventional server response message (e.g., containing data requested from the server) in which an IP address and port information as seen by the server is embedded into the conventional response. The conventional server response message is denoted as R, and the IP address and port information is denoted as ER.","The response message R\u2032 may then be sent from the web server(s) ( and\/or ) back to the web browser  through the NAT device , wherein the response message contains (X1,Y1) or (X2,Y2) information. The response message may be sent to the URI dereference module ( or  depending on whether the URI being dereferenced is HTTP or XMPP), which may take the response message and extract the IP address and port information from the message as denoted by R=R\u2032\u2212ER in . The ER information may contain the (X1,Y1) or (X2,Y2) IP address. The conventional response R may then be passed back to the web browser , e.g., for display. The NAT monitor module  may be employed to collect and analyze IP address and port information received from various servers, such as servers  and .","By embedding a new request message into a conventional URI request message, the web browser  may obtain information used to determine the presence and behavior of a NAT device. The dereference module  or  may send the (X1,Y1) or (X2,Y2) reflex IP address and port information to the NAT monitor module , which may collect multiple IP addresses from response messages from other web servers as well. Once the web browser  has collected enough IP addresses, the presence and type of NAT device may then be determined.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["300","300","301","312","301","302","304","306","302","304","306"]},"The length field  may further comprise a method field  and class field . Table 1 shows an example of binary values for the method and class sections in an E-STUN header. The method may signify the function of the transaction occurring, which may be a binding method.

The indication transaction may be a message sent from the client or the server and generates no response. The request\/response transaction may be where a client sends a request to a server, and the server returns a response. The response classes may be split into error and success responses to aid in quickly processing the E-STUN message.

The message attributes may be CHANGE-REQUEST, MAPPED-ADDRESS, and RESPONSE-ORIGIN. The CHANGE-REQUEST attribute may contain two flags to control the IP address and port used to send a response. The MAPPED-ADDRESS attribute may indicate a reflexive transport address of the client. It may comprise an 8-bit address family and a 16-bit port, followed by a fixed-length value representing the IP address. If the address family is IP version 4 (IPv4), the address may be 32 bits. If the address family is IP version 6 (IPv6), the address may be 128 bits. The RESPONSE-ORIGIN address may indicate the source IP address and port a binding response was sent from.","The E-STUN protocol may be embedded as a binary protocol or translated into another text format and embedded into HTTP or XMPP. For example, an E-STUN request and response may be embedded into URI dereference protocol (D) messages. A positive D response may contain either a success or error E-STUN response. A negative D response may contain an E-STUN error response. If D cannot return a positive response according to CHANGE-REQUEST, it may send a correlated E-STUN indication instead.","In order for a web browser to distinguish which links in a web page support the E-STUN protocol, it may be desirable for a corresponding server to advertise its E-STUN services. A server may advertise its E-STUN services implicitly by returning reflex addresses automatically during URI dereferences. For example, an HTTP response may contain a reflex address. In another embodiment, a server may advertise its E-STUN service explicitly through use of the following types of semantic tags: reflex, address, and port. A reflex tag, an address tag, and\/or a port tag may be attached to different links, wherein each tag may indicate a type of service the link will provide to the client.","Regarding reflex tags, the server receiving a reflex request corresponding to the reflex tag may return IP address and port information in a response. Regarding address tags, the server receiving a request corresponding to the address tag may send an E-STUN indication from a different IP address, which may be helpful in detecting certain NAT filtering behaviors. With a port tag, a server may send an E-STUN indication from the same IP address but a different port. By using one of these tags, the server may communicate with a web browser what E-STUN services are supported during a URI dereference. Reflex tags, address tags, and port tags may collectively be referred to as semantic tags herein.","The semantic tags may be embedded in HTML5 in a myriad of ways, comprising RDFa, microformats, HTML5 rel attribute, and HTML5 microdata. RDFa may add a set of attribute-level extensions to HTML for embedding metadata within web documents. Microformat may reuse existing HTML tags to communicate metadata and other attributes in a web page. The HTML5 rel attribute may be employed to indicate a relationship between a source and a destination link. Microdata may allow a website to attach semantic information to a regular hyperlink to convey additional information about the link to the browser. For illustrative purposes, microdata may be used in the E-STUN service descriptions disclosed herein as well as for its simplicity, consistency, and extensibility.","Semantic tags may be implemented at multiple levels in order to convey which services may be requested from a server. For example, a tag may be applied to an individual URI with a URI tag, to multiple links in a page with an HTML page tag, or to an entire website with a URI authority (domain) tag as follows:\n\n","The tags may be applied at different levels by using microdata. Tagging at the domain level may enable all the links in an entire website to be tagged. The following HTTP and XMPP examples in Table 2 may be used in order to tag a URI authority whose resources support the same E-STUN services. Two lines of code are displayed for both HTTP and XMPP, wherein a reflex tag is shown within the second line of code. For the HTTP example, reflex service may be provided to the browser whenever the URI is dereferenced. Since this is a top-level link pointing to the domain, then all of the links in the domain will be tagged as well and will provide the same service. For the XMPP example, the second line of code comprises both reflex and port tags. If the URI is dereferenced, the server may return the reflex address and send a message from a different port as indicated by the tags.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0045"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 2"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"An example of domain level tagging in HTTP and XMPP."},{"entry":"Domain Level Tagging"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["HTTP","(1) Without tag","<link href=\u201chttp:\/\/www.yahoo.com\u201d><\/link>"]},{"entry":["URI","(2) With tag","<link rel=\u201ce-stun\u201d itemscope itemtype=\u201creflex\u201d"]},{"entry":[{},{},"href=\u201chttp:\/\/www.yahoo.com\u201d><\/link>"]},{"entry":["XMPP","(1) Without tag","<link href=\u201cxmpp:john@gmail.com\u201d><\/link>"]},{"entry":["URI","(2) With tag","<link rel=\u201ce-stun\u201d itemscope itemtype=\u201creflex "]},{"entry":[{},{},"port\u201d"]},{"entry":[{},{},"href=\u201cxmpp:john@gmail.com\u201d><\/link>"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Resources in an HTML5 page supporting the same E-STUN services may be similarly tagged at the page level as seen in Table 3 below.

By embedding E-STUN in XMPP or HTML, the XMPP or HTML authentication may be reused without requiring any special login to the E-STUN server or other formalities.","In order for a client to be able to communicate with a server, it may be necessary to determine the type of NAT employed in between the two. Obtaining E-STUN indication messages from different servers\/ports may be important for differentiating between various NAT mapping and filtering behaviors. For example, one type of NAT may receive a message from a server only if an internal client has sent a message to that server before. If the server has never been contacted, the NAT may not allow the server to send a message to the client from outside the private network. In order to reveal if a NAT has this type of behavior, a server may be instructed to send a message back to a client to determine if the NAT allows it to do so. If the message is not sent, the NAT may control this behavior whereas if the message is sent, the NAT may allow the message to go through. These may be examples of two different NAT filtering behaviors, wherein the filtering behavior may determine how a NAT decides to let outside traffic in to a private network containing the client of interest.","In order to differentiate between the different NAT mapping and filtering behaviors, a client such as a web browser may collect all kinds of data from different servers with different properties. For example, a browser may collect the reflex IP address and other indication messages from one server, while the browser may not receive indication messages from another server. Once the browser has collected enough data, the browser may determine if there is a NAT and if so, what type of NAT is in use.","There may be two types of NAT behaviors, which may be classified according to RFC memorandums 4787 and 5382. The first type of behavior may be identified by how a NAT maps an internal IP address to an external IP address.  illustrates an embodiment of communication in a networked architecture  for determining NAT behavior. The architecture  may comprise a NAT monitor , NAT , server 1 , server 2 , and a plurality of reflex agents , , and . The NAT monitor  may be the same as the NAT monitor module  as described earlier (e.g., the NAT monitor  may be part of a web browser). The NAT  may be the same as the NAT device  described earlier. For the architecture , there may be any number of components in a NAT monitoring system. That is, there may be n IP addresses and m ports, wherein m\u2267n\u22671. Ports may be represented as Pij, in which i designates a specific address for i=1, 2, . . . , n, and j designates a specific port for j=1, 2, . . . , m. For illustrative purposes in the architecture, there may be two servers ( and ), wherein server 1  may have one address and two ports and server 2  may have one address and one port. Reflex agent  may be located at server 1, port 1 (S1,P11), reflex agent  may be located at server 1, port 2 (S1,P12), and reflex agent  may be located at server 2, port 1 (S2,P21). These reflex agents may be similar to the E-STUN agents  and  shown in .","The NAT monitor  may be a module inside a web browser, wherein (X0,Y0) may be the internal private IP address of the browser. The NAT monitor  may collect reflex public IP addresses from server 1  and server 2 , wherein some of the IP addresses may be collected from different ports such as P11, P12, and P21. The collected information from each of the servers may be represented as (X,Y) pairs, wherein X is the IP address and Y is the port. For example, (X11,Y11) may be collected from server 1, port 1 (S1,P11), (X12,Y12) may be collected from server 1, port 2 (S1,P12), and (X21,Y21) may be from server 2, port 1 (S2,P21). (X11\u2032,Y11\u2032) may be another instance of a reflex address and port information collected from (S1,P11). For example, this information may have been collected from the same server but in a different transaction that may have occurred at a different time.","(X11,Y11), (X11\u2032,Y11\u2032), (X12,Y12), and (X21,Y21) may be five data points (including the private IP address) collected by the NAT monitor  from the servers, and (X0,Y0) is the private IP address and port of a browser comprising the NAT monitor  and therefore known by the NAT monitor . The reflex IP addresses from the different servers and ports may be collected using the reflex tag in URI dereferences, wherein each server and all ports (Pij) are distinct (e.g., server 1\u2260server 2). These data points may be sufficient for the NAT monitor  to make a prediction of the NAT behavior according to Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) classification. Referring to , a method or process for determining behavior of a NAT, such as NAT , is as follows. First, the NAT monitor  may determine whether or not a NAT is present by checking if (X0,Y0), (X11,Y11), and (X21,Y21) are all equal to each other. If the internal and external IP addresses are all the same, then there may be no translation occurring, e.g., no NAT. If there are differences between the addresses, then the presence of a NAT may be confirmed, and the type of NAT mapping may be discovered with further analysis.","There may be four different classifications for how a NAT performs mapping, which may be endpoint-independent mapping (EIM), address-dependent mapping (ADM), address and port dependent mapping (APDM), and connection dependent mapping (CDM). To determine the classification, the NAT monitor  may check if (X11,Y11) is equal to (X21,Y21). If so, the NAT may employ EIM, in which the NAT reuses port mapping for subsequent packets sent from the same internal IP address and port to any external IP address and port. In EIM, the NAT may assign a fixed public address, wherein server 1 and server 2 may have the same IP address. If (X11,Y11) is not equal to (X21,Y21), the NAT may either use ADM or APDM. In order to distinguish between these mappings, the NAT monitor  may check if (X11,Y11) is equal to (X12,Y12). If the two data points are the same, then the NAT may utilize ADM, in which the NAT reuses the port mapping for subsequent packets sent from the same internal IP address and port to the same external IP address, regardless of the external port. If (X11,Y11) is not equal to (X12,Y12), then the NAT may either use APDM or CDM. The NAT monitor  may make a final distinction between the two by checking if (X11,Y11) is equal to (X11\u2032,Y11\u2032). If the data points are the same, then the NAT may utilize APDM, in which the NAT reuses the port mapping for subsequent packets sent from the same internal IP address and port to the same external IP address and port while the mapping is still active. If the data points are unequal, then the NAT may exhibit CDM, wherein a new mapping is allocated by the NAT for each connection.","From the method, a sufficient number of data points may be obtained to make an accurate prediction about a NAT and its mapping behavior. If there are not two servers, the presence of a NAT may still be determined. Similarly, if there are not different ports for a single server, the NAT monitor may at least detect if the mapping is EIM or not.

Referring to , a method or process for determining a filtering behavior of a NAT, such as NAT , is as follows. In this filtering method, the NAT monitor  may determine which server may or may not send messages through the NAT  back to the web browser. From this information, the NAT monitor  may make a prediction on what type of filtering behavior is employed by the NAT . There may be three types of filtering behavior as defined in, for example, RFC 4787 and RFC 5382. Three types of filtering behavior are endpoint-independent filtering (EIF), address-dependent filtering (ADF), and address and port dependent filtering (APDF). In the first step  of the filtering method, a web browser, such as browser , may send a URI dereference request Q\u2032 (embedded E-STUN message) to agent  and ask agent  to return an address\/port pair (X1,Y1). The browser may also ask agent  to facilitate return of a first indication (the first indication being a message) from a different port (e.g., P12) through use of a port tag, wherein the first indication includes the address\/port pair (X1,Y1). Further, the browser may also ask reflex agent  to facilitate return of a second indication from a different address (e.g., from server 2) as indicated through use of an address tag, wherein the second indication includes the address\/port pair (X1,Y1). In the second step , reflex agent  may return the address\/port pair (X1,Y1) in a URI dereference response R\u2032 (embedded E-STUN message) from port P11. These requests may be made depending on the advertised E-STUN service in order to determine if they may be completed successfully. In a third step , the reflex agent  may send the requested indication from port P12. The indication may include the address\/port pair (X1,Y1). In a fourth step , the server  may return the second indication from port P21. In order to facilitate the second indication, the use of the address tag may trigger server  to request that server  return the second indication. More specifically, reflex agent  may contact reflex agent  to ask or request reflex agent  to send the second indication to the web browser comprising the NAT monitor . The second indication may include the address\/port pair (X1,Y1), as indicated in the request from the reflex agent .","Depending on the type of NAT, the first and\/or second indications may not be received by the NAT monitor  within a predetermined timeout period. If the second indication is received by the NAT monitor  from reflex agent  within the timeout period, then the NAT behavior may be classified as EIF, which may indicate that the NAT forwards any packets destined to the internal address and port, regardless of the external IP address and port source. That is, in EIF behavior, sending packets from the internal side of the NAT  to any external IP address may be sufficient to allow any packets back to the internal endpoint. If the indication message has not been received within a timeout period from reflex agent , then the NAT monitor  may check if the message has been received within a timeout period from reflex agent . If so, the NAT behavior may be classified as ADF, which may indicate that the NAT may filter out packets from a server destined for the internal endpoint if packets have not been sent from the internal side to the external IP address previously (independently) of the port used by the external server). That is, in ADF behavior, it may be necessary for the internal endpoint to send packets first to a specific external endpoint's IP address before it may receive packets for that external endpoint. If the message has still not been received within a timeout period from reflex agent , then the NAT behavior may be classified as APDF, which may be similar to ADF, except that the external port may be relevant for filtering. That is, in APDF behavior, it may be necessary for the internal endpoint to send packets first to a specific external endpoint's IP address and port before it may receive packets from that external endpoint.","Table 7 below summarizes the method for determining NAT filtering behavior described above as follows.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0090","num":"0090"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00015","num":"00015"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 7"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Summary of method for determining NAT filtering behavior."},{"entry":"Determining NAT Filtering Behavior"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"7pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"210pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1","A web browser may send a URI dereference request to a reflex agent 531 "]},{"entry":[{},"and ask it to return a reflexive address (X1,Y1) and two indications from "]},{"entry":[{},"a different port and a different address."]},{"entry":["2","The reflex agent 531 may return the reflexive address and ask a second "]},{"entry":[{},"and third reflex agent (532 and 541) to send indications from a different "]},{"entry":[{},"port and address\/server."]},{"entry":["3","If an indication message is received within a timeout period from reflex "]},{"entry":[{},"agent 541, then the NAT filtering behavior is EIF."]},{"entry":["4","If the indication message is received within a timeout period from reflex "]},{"entry":[{},"agent 532, then the NAT filtering behavior is ADF."]},{"entry":["5","If the message has not been received within a timeout period from reflex "]},{"entry":[{},"agent 532, then the NAT filtering behavior is APDF."]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0091","num":"0091"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["600","600","630","640","650","630","632","634","636","650","652","654","630","120","640","130","650","140","150","600","601","632","232","602","634","630","603","636","604","636","605","636","606","607","636","640","608","652","609","640","650","652","146","156","100"]},"At step , the reflex agent  may obtain the public IP address (X1,Y1) from the NAT .

It is fundamental to the electrical engineering and software engineering arts that functionality that can be implemented by loading executable software into a computer can be converted to a hardware implementation by well-known design rules. Decisions between implementing a concept in software versus hardware typically hinge on considerations of stability of the design and numbers of units to be produced rather than any issues involved in translating from the software domain to the hardware domain. Generally, a design that is still subject to frequent change may be preferred to be implemented in software, because re-spinning a hardware implementation is more expensive than re-spinning a software design. Generally, a design that is stable that will be produced in large volume may be preferred to be implemented in hardware, for example in an ASIC, because for large production runs the hardware implementation may be less expensive than the software implementation. Often a design may be developed and tested in a software form and later transformed, by well-known design rules, to an equivalent hardware implementation in an application specific integrated circuit that hardwires the instructions of the software.
