{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTERESTS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention was made with Government support under Contract No. N00014-02-C-0402 awarded by the Office of Naval Research. The Government has certain rights in this invention.","This disclosure relates generally to systems and methods for detecting defects in aircraft wiring, and more particularly,.to systems and methods for detecting partial discharges or arcing in wiring or cables via fiber optics.","Wiring is a critical system in aircraft, shipboard, industry and home applications. Aircraft wiring integrity and safety related issues are known to be serious and have received a great deal of interest after the Swissair 111 and TWA 800 accidents. Also, electrical fires in industry account for a large portion of property loss, and electrical fires in the home are a significant portion of the fires occurring in the home that threaten life and damage property.","Aircraft wiring insulation is much thinner than that found in building wiring in order to reduce weight. This thin insulation deteriorates with age due to changes in chemical composition, vibration during flights, large temperature changes, and exposure to agents such as dust, salt, moisture and cleaning chemicals. This wiring is also exposed to other mechanical stresses during maintenance. The aforementioned effects will degrade the insulation, causing cracks and chafing. These insulation defects can cause arcing between wires or surrounding metals. Humidity together with salt and dust depositions can make the arc creation more probable.","The detection of aircraft wiring defects is primarily performed by visual inspection by maintenance personnel. This manual inspection is a slow process and its reliability is not satisfactory. Furthermore, as it requires twisting the wiring in order to visually check chafing, this visual inspection often causes more problems than it can identify.","There does exist test equipment on the market for wire and cable testing based on electrical measurements using Time Domain Reflectometry or Frequency Domain Reflectometry. The sensitivity of these methods is usually not satisfactory to detect all insulation damage.","General Dynamics of Redmond, Washington recently introduced a new test apparatus called the Micro-Energy Dielectric (MED) tool, as disclosed in U.S. patent application Publication No. US2002\/0130668. This device uses a high DC voltage to generate discharges or arcs at insulation defects in a cable bundle under test. If a fault exists between the wire under test in the cable and any other grounded wires in the cable that has a breakdown voltage less than the maximum test voltage applied, the full discharge of the available charge stored in the cable, i.e., not a partial discharge, will occur at the fault. The location of the discharge is then determined in several ways by measuring the electromagnetic (i.e., RF region) and acoustic signals the discharge generates. First, the MED tool measures high frequency voltage pulse edges generated by the discharge at one end of the cable and determines the location of the discharge; second, a Electromagnetic Locating Tool (EML) measures the radiated (i.e., outside the cable) electromagnetic signal (radio waves) with receivers having suitable antennae and calculates the location of the discharge based on the arrival times of the signals at the receivers; and lastly, an Ultrasonic Locating Tool (ULT) measures the acoustic noise (i.e., sound waves) and the electromagnetic edge the discharge generates and determines the distance to the arc by timing the difference in arrival times of the two signals.","Therefore, a need exists for techniques to detect defects in wiring or cables that can be performed by other than visual inspection and will not cause further degradation to the wire or cable under test.","Partial discharge (PD) testing is a sensitive, widely used method to characterize a condition of insulation materials. Partial discharges have much lower energy therefore degradation of the cable insulation material caused by the partial discharges during testing is negligible. In an embodiment of the present invention, fluorescent material-doped fiber optic cable(s) embedded in the wiring or cable is used to detect light generated during partial discharge activity or arcing. The fluorescent material-doped fiber optic cable collects this light and carries it to optical receivers, e.g., photomultipliers, at an end of the fluorescent-doped fiber optic cables embedded in the wiring.","According to an aspect of the present disclosure, a cable for detecting partial discharges is provided, the cable comprising a conductor for carrying electrical signals; at least one fluorescent optical fiber for detecting light generated by a partial discharge; and a first transparent layer surrounding the conductor for supporting the at least one fluorescent optical fiber generally parallel to the conductor.","According to another aspect, a system for detecting partial discharges comprises a cable comprising a conductor for carrying electrical signals; at least one fluorescent optical fiber for detecting light generated by a partial discharge; and a first insulation layer surrounding the conductor for supporting the at least one fluorescent optical fiber generally parallel to the conductor; a first optical receiver coupled to a first end of the cable for detecting light transmitted by the optical fiber by a partial discharge; a voltage source for inducing the partial discharge in the cable; and a processor for controlling operations of the voltage source and for determining if the first optical receiver has detected light.","According to a further aspect of the present disclosure, in a cable comprising a conductor for carrying electrical signals, at least one fluorescent optical fiber for detecting light generated by a partial discharge and a first insulation layer surrounding the conductor for supporting the at least one fluorescent optical fiber generally parallel to the conductor, a method for detecting partial discharges is provided. The method comprises the steps of applying a high voltage to the cable; and detecting light in the at least one fluorescent optical fiber generated by the partial discharge.","Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described hereinbelow with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description, well-known functions or constructions are not described in detail to avoid obscuring the invention in unnecessary detail. Throughout the figures, like reference numerals represent like elements.","The insulation condition of a wire, cable or cable bundle can be tested by partial discharge (PD) diagnostics or arcing. Electric discharges that do not completely bridge two electrodes or conductors in close proximity to each other are called partial discharges (PD). The magnitude of such discharges are usually small, the amount of charge transferred is in the range of ten to a few hundred Pico-Coulombs (pC). For a partial discharge test, a suitably high AC or DC voltage is applied to the conductors surrounding the insulation material under test. For cable diagnostics, the high voltage is applied between the wire under test (WUT) and the wires or shielding surrounding the wire under test. Alternatively, the high voltage is applied between the wire under test and a metal frame touching or potentially touching the wire under test, e.g., grounded metal structures. Alternatively, the discharge can be detected under normal current\/voltage operating conditions depending on the defect and energized system characteristics.","When partial discharge occurs, the discharge will generate high frequency electrical signals traveling along the cable, electromagnetic radiation out of the cable, sound waves and light. Depending on the gas atmosphere and pressure at the location of the partial discharge, the spectral distribution of the light generated by the partial discharge varies. For air at atmospheric pressures, the spectral range is primarily in the UV and visible region. Partial discharges can be detected by any of the above-mentioned effects.","For cables, the most frequently used partial discharge detection method is to detect the high frequency electrical signal the partial discharge generates and propagates along the cable. The primary limitation of this method is that the high frequency signal is attenuated as it propagates along the cable making the detection of partial discharge pulses less likely, depending on the magnitude of the partial discharge pulses and the length and high frequency attenuation of the cable. The cable can also collect high frequency electromagnetic noise from the environment and that signal is merged with the partial discharge signal. Frequently, it is not possible to separate the attenuated partial discharge signal from the noise, thus reducing the sensitivity of the partial discharge detection.","Partial discharges also produce light and therefore it is possible to detect partial discharges by measuring the light generated by it. The primary problem with this method is that, in the case of a cable, the partial discharge occurs in the insulating material and the light generated is absorbed in the cable. Even if the cable has a transparent insulation material and the light generated by the partial discharge pulses is not absorbed by any other material in or around the cable, the light is locally generated and has to be detected by directly monitoring the location of the partial discharge generation.","To solve the problem associated with collection of the light generated by a partial discharge along the whole length of a cable, the application of a fluorescent optical fiber is provided which is able to collect light along its whole length.","For optical fibers used for communication or other light transmission applications, light is coupled into the optical fiber at one end and the light leaves the optical fiber at the other end. A typical optical fiber includes a core made of a higher reflective index material than that of the cladding surrounding the core. The core and cladding form a reflective interface that causes light beamed into the core to reflect off the surface where the two materials meet back into the core by the process of total internal reflection. However, there is a limited angle, e.g., the acceptance angle, measured from the axis of the optical fiber from within it is possible to couple the light into the optical fiber. Such fibers are not suitable to collect light along their length.","Referring to , an optical fiber  with fluorescent doping material in its core  is illustrated. If the fluorescent doping material embedded into the fiber core material  is excited by a light with suitable wavelengths illuminating the optical fiber, part of the emitted light from the fluorescent doping material will fall within the acceptance angle of the optical fiber and such light can propagate along the fiber. As long as the wavelengths of the incident light \u03bbfall within the absorption spectrum of the fluorescent material, photons  are absorbed and reemitted isotropically in the core, at longer wavelengths \u03bb, i.e., the fluorescent light has longer wavelength than the light inducing the fluorescence. In this way, the fluorescent material in the core  can be illuminated by light rays coming from any incident angle, even through the side of the fiber, so that the orientation of the fiber axis relative to the discharge is no longer a constraint. It is preferable to utilize fluorescent doping materials that will not absorb the emitted light as it propagates along the fiber. This makes possible to detect partial discharge at a long distance away from its generation.","Exemplary fluorescent optical fibers are commercially available from Optectron Industries of Les Ulis Cedex, France.  illustrates the optical characteristics of these exemplary optical fibers.","To collect the light generated by the partial discharge activity, the partial discharge location must be visible by the fluorescent optical fiber. This can be achieved by surrounding the conductor wire with a material transparent (or partially transparent) for the light emitted by the partial discharge to be transmitted through. The fluorescent optical fibers are then embedded into the material surrounding the conductor wire. To be able to collect the light from the partial discharge, the excitation wavelength region of the fluorescent optical fiber must at least partially overlap with the wavelength region of the light generated by the partial discharge.","Referring to , a cable for detecting partial discharges is illustrated. The cable  includes a conductive wire or conductor  for carrying electrical signals, e.g., data signals, power signals, etc. At least one fluorescent optical fiber  is located adjacent to the conductor  throughout the length of the cable . The at least one fluorescent optical fiber  is embedded into a transparent or semitransparent layer  surrounding the conductor . The transparent layer  is preferably an insulator and is transparent or semitransparent in the excitation wavelength region of the fluorescent optical fiber. The transparent layer  must be transparent or semitransparent at the excitation wavelength of the fluorescent optical fiber to allow the light generated by the partial discharge to reach the fluorescent optical fiber . Optionally, additional optical fibers  may be supported in the transparent layer  for data communication. The cable  also includes a second insulation layer  surrounding the conductor  and transparent material  supporting the optical fibers , . The second insulation layer  is composed of insulation material to provide the required electrical insulation and to protect the cable. The insulation material for the second insulation layer  is preferably non-transparent to prevent any light from outside the cable  from entering the fluorescent optical fiber , however, depending on the application, if no disturbing light can reach the fluorescent optical fibers  in the excitation wavelength region of the fluorescent optical fibers , transparent material can also be used.","It is to be appreciated the fluorescent optical fiber  includes a core of a first index of refraction, i surrounded by cladding of a second index of refraction, i. By constructing the optical fiber with the core having a greater index of refraction than that of the cladding, light will propagate down the core by total internal reflection.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","402","408","1","410","1","406","400","408","2","404","410","2","404"]},"Another embodiment of a cable for detecting partial discharges is shown in . The cable  of  includes a conductive wire or conductor  for carrying electrical signals and a transparent insulation layer  for supporting a plurality of fluorescent optical fibers . In this embodiment, the transparent insulation layer  provides all the required electrical insulation and mechanical protection for the cable. Optionally, additional optical fibers  may be supported in the layer  for data communication.","Referring to , a hollow optical fiber or waveguide  can be employed in another embodiment of a cable  for detecting partial discharges wherein a conductive wire  resides inside the hollow optical fiber . A layer of non-transparent insulation  may surround the hollow optical fiber  to provide sufficient electrical insulation, mechanical protection and if required to prevent light generated outside the cable  from entering the optical fiber .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 3"],"b":["700","700","702","704","704","708","708","700","706","710","704"]},"In various embodiments, the fluorescent optical fiber can also be used in gas insulated transmission lines, transformers, switchgears or any other high voltage applications where light generated by a partial discharge or other discharge processes, requires distributed light sensing.","Partial discharge can be generated by any degradation in the insulation material (e.g. chafing, crack in the insulation material), but partial discharges are not always produced at the voltage level occurring in the wiring under operating conditions. In this case, the optical fibers around the cable can be used to monitor the integrity of the insulation. In this case, in normal operation, light is coupled into one or more fibers at one end of the fiber(s). The light intensity is measured at the other end of the fiber(s) with suitable optical detector(s). If damage occurs, it would result in increased or total attenuation of the conducted light intensity from one or more optical fibers. This increased attenuation can used to identify mechanical damage to the wire.","Since fluorescent optical fibers can be used to conduct light in the wavelengths regions not absorbed by the doping material, the fluorescent optical fibers in the cable can also be used for information transmission as it is widely used with non-fluorescent optical fibers. The absorption and fluorescent wavelength region of the fluorescent optical fibers has to be selected in a way to avoid overlap with the communication signal wavelength(s) (or vice versa). This way any interference can be eliminated between the communication signal and the light generated by the detected discharge activity. In this case, the partial discharge signal and the communication signal will appear at different wavelength at the end of the fiber(s) and can be detected by detectors sensitive either at the communication or the fluorescent wavelength respectively.","Referring to , an exemplary system and method for detecting partial discharges in a cable via optical fibers will be described.","The system  includes cable  which further includes conductor  for carrying electrical signals and at least one optical fiber for detecting partial discharges . An optical receiver , e.g., a photomultiplier, photodiode, is coupled to at least one end of the cable  for detecting light transmitted via the optical fiber  from a partial discharge. Optionally, a second optical receiver  is coupled to the other end of the optical fiber  and is employed in certain methods for detecting partial discharges which will be described below. The optical receivers ,  are coupled to a processor  for determining the presence and in certain embodiments the location of the partial discharge. The system further includes a voltage source  for applying a high voltage to the conductor  and an adjacent conductor  to induce partial discharges under testing conditions. In other implementations, the voltage source is not required, as the wire under test in normal operation mode will have suitable potential difference compared to its environment to induce partial discharges in case of insulation failure. Additionally, the system  includes a display  for displaying whether a partial discharge has occurred and the location of the partial discharge and an input\/output interface  for controlling the system .","Initially, the system  will apply a high voltage to the conductors ,  to induce a partial discharge (step ). While the high voltage is being applied, the at least one optical receiver  will be activated by the processor to detect any light generated in the optical fiber  (step ). In one embodiment of the method, the at least one optical detector  will detect a partial discharge, e.g., a short light pulse, has occurred in the cable  without indicating a location of the partial discharge (step ).","However, the location of the partial discharge may be calculated as shown in ) where x is the distance to the defect, L is the length of wire and t is the arrival time of the pulse at the end of the fiber.","In another embodiment of the method for detecting partial discharges, the optical receiver  will detect a light pulse indicative of a partial discharge and record a time of the pulse via processor  (step ). Similarly, optical receiver  will detect a light pulse indicative of the partial discharge and record a time of the pulse via processor  (step ). If the light pulse is detected at both ends of the cable, processor  can determine the exact location of the source of the light pulse (step ). For the location determination, the time difference between the arrival of the same light pulse to the two ends of the cable has to be measured, as shown in ). The speed of light propagation in the optical fiber and the length of the fiber must be known to calculate the location. The formulae shown in ) are then employed to calculate the location where x is the distance to defect; L is length of wire(and fiber); v is the speed of light propagation in the optical fiber; and t, t are the arrival times of the pulses to the fiber ends, t and t measured from an arbitrary starting moment as only their difference is used for location calculation.","In yet another embodiment, the optical receiver  detects a light pulse and records it time of arrival (step ). The optical receiver  then detects the light pulse reflected back from the other end of the optical fiber and measures the time the reflected pulse arrives (step ). The processor  then determines the location using the arrival times of the pulses, the length of the cable and speed of light propagation in the optical fiber (step ), as illustrated in ).","Embodiments of the present disclosure can be used to build wiring with both electrical and optical signal transmission capabilities as well as the ability to detect and diagnose wire\/cable defects. This wiring would provide enhanced signal transmission capabilities to applications ranging from aircraft wiring to home wiring with improved wiring defect diagnostics.","While the disclosure has been illustrated and described in typical embodiments, it is not intended to be limited to the details shown, since various modifications and substitutions can be made without departing in any way from the spirit of the present disclosure.
