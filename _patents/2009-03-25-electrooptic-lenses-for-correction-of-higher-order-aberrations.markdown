abstract: A lens is presented in which the lens includes a substrate and an electrode layer. The electrode layer is positioned upon the substrate. The electrode layer has radially alternating rings of electrodes and resistive material. When voltage is applied across two adjacent electrodes the profile of the electric field therebetween is linear. When voltage is applied to the rings of electrodes, the optical phase profile of the lens closely approximates the optical phase of ideal spherical aberration correction.

No. 12\/135,587 filed on Jun. 9, 2008 now abandoned and entitled \u201cAdjustable Correction for a Variety of Ambient Lighting Conditions\u201d.","This application claims priority from and incorporates by reference in its entirety U.S. Ser. No. 61\/039,181 filed on Mar. 25, 2008 and entitled \u201cElectro-Optic Lenses for Correction of Higher Order Aberrations.\u201d","This invention was made in whole or in part with government support under Contract Number FA7014-07-C-0013, awarded by the U.S. Air Force, Office of the Surgeon General (AF\/SG). The government may have certain rights in the invention.","A perfect lens focuses light to a single point on an optical axis of the lens. An aberration of the lens of an eye is a deviation from the perfect focusing of light due to a distortion of a wavefront of light as it passes through the eye having irregularities. The distortion of a wavefront of light may be referred to as an aberrated wavefront. Conventional aberrations of the eye consist of spherical de-focus and regular astigmatism (cylinder), which are correctable by conventional ophthalmic lenses. An eye may also have higher order aberrations, such as, spherical aberration, trefoil, irregular astigmatism, and coma. Each higher order aberration may be represented mathematically by a basis set of polynomials of degree three or more. For example, the aberrations of trefoil and coma are typically represented by third-order polynomials, while the aberration of spherical aberration is typically represented by fourth-order polynomials with respect to radius. With respect to azimuth angle, \u03b8, the aberration wavefront of spherical aberration is represented by a zero-order polynomial, which is constant for all azimuth angles at each radius. That is, the aberration wavefront of spherical aberration is rotationally symmetric, which makes this particular higher order aberration of special interest for further discussion here.","The aberration wavefronts of spherical aberrations of the eye are commonly described mathematically using a series of Zernike polynomials. The Zernike term, Z\u2218, for spherical aberration of the eye is typically of the form:\n\n\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwhere r is the normalized radial position within the pupil measured from the optical axis of the eye and a and b are constants. An alternate mathematical representation of spherical aberration, referred to as the \u2018Seidel representation\u2019, is of the form, ar. The Zernike term, ar, is referred to as the spherical aberration term and the Zernike term, br, is referred to as the quadratic spherical de-focusing term. Other mathematical representations of spherical aberration of the eye are known, depending on the basis set chosen.\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"A variety of approaches are typically used to correct spherical aberration of the eye. One approach exploits the aforementioned rotational symmetry of spherical aberration. In this approach, a lens for correcting spherical aberration is also rotationally symmetric. Such a lens may have a radially symmetric optical power or optical phase variation that is equal and opposite (or nearly so) to that of the aberrated eye. The lens effectively cancels the spherical aberration of the eye. The spherical aberration correction of a lens can be positive (for canceling a negative spherical aberration of the eye) or negative (for canceling a positive spherical aberration of the eye). Although a lens for correcting a fixed amount of spherical aberration is known, other problems arise.","It is shown in equation (1) and  that the amount of distortion (de-focus) of an image due to spherical aberration of an eye depends on the radius of its pupil. Thus, as the pupil changes in size (e.g., in response to a change in ambient light), the amount of spherical aberration affecting de-focus in the eye changes accordingly. This relationship is shown in , which show side views of the focusing of light by a lens  of an eye having differently sized openings or pupils.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIGS. 2-5"],"b":["95","50","60","70","55","65","75","55","75","65"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIGS. 3-5","FIGS. 3-5","FIG. 3","FIG. 4","FIGS. 3 and 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["95","90","85","80","90","50","60","70","55","65","75","85","55","65","80","55"]},"It may be observed that as the diameter of the pupil changes, e.g., with changing ambient light, the amount of the spherical aberration of the natural lens of the eye that is revealed is likewise changed. The amount of spherical aberration that is revealed in the eye typically affects the optical quality of the eye. It is also known that as the diameter of the pupil changes, other higher order aberrations of the eye, such as trefoil may affect image quality as well. While a conventional lens may correct for a fixed amount of spherical aberration and\/or other higher order aberrations, a fixed lens cannot provide the necessary correction for changing aberrations in the eye.","There is therefore a great need in the art for providing a lens for providing correction for higher order aberrations in the eye, such as spherical aberration, trefoil, irregular astigmatism, and coma, that change the phase correction profile in response to a change in ambient light or pupil diameter. Accordingly, there is now provided with this invention an improved lens for effectively overcoming the aforementioned difficulties and longstanding problems inherent in the art.","In an embodiment of the invention, a lens may include a substrate and an electrode layer. The electrode layer is positioned upon the substrate. The electrode layer has radially alternating rings of electrodes and resistive material. When voltage is applied across two adjacent electrodes the profile of the electric field therebetween is linear. When voltage is applied to the rings of electrodes, the optical phase profile of the lens closely approximates the optical phase of ideal spherical aberration correction.","In an embodiment of the invention, a lens for correcting spherical aberration may include a plurality of concentric electrode rings, wherein when voltage is applied to the electrode rings the optical phase profile between adjacent electrode rings closely approximates the optical phase profile of ideal spherical aberration correction.","In an embodiment of the invention, a lens may include a uniform electrode layer and a patterned electrode layer spaced from the uniform electrode layer. The patterned electrode layer may have concentric rings of electrodes and may be coated with a resistive material. Adjacent electrode rings are spaced by a distance that is substantially greater than the distance of the space between the electrode layers. When voltage is applied across the electrode layers the optical phase profile of the lens approximates the optical phase profile of ideal spherical aberration correction.","In an embodiment of the invention, a lens system may include a lens having an electro-active element, a sensor for sensing pupil size, a controller in operative communication with the sensor, and a plurality of pixelated electrodes electrically connected to the controller. The controller applies a first set of voltages to the plurality of pixelated electrodes corresponding to a first sensed pupil size and a second set of voltages to the plurality of pixelated electrodes corresponding to a second sensed pupil size. The application of voltage causes a change in the refractive index of the lens for correcting a higher order aberration of the eye corresponding to the sensed pupil size.","In an embodiment of the invention, a lens system may include a lens having an electro-active element, a sensor for sensing an amount of ambient light, a controller in operative communication with the sensor, and a plurality of pixelated electrodes electrically connected to the controller.

The application of voltage causes a change in the refractive index of the lens for correcting a higher order aberration of the eye corresponding to the sensed amount of ambient light.","The size of the pupil aperture that allows light to enter the eye affects the level of image distortion of an eye. The lenses described herein attempt to correct this aberration. Therefore, these lenses are dynamically changeable in response to the size of the pupil of the eye.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 6A","b":["100","106","108","102"]},"A lens system can include all of the components discussed herein, which can all be incorporated in a single lens, or alternatively, some of the components can be apart from the lens e.g., in a spectacle frame, a handheld device, or the user's apparel.","In one approach the sensor  senses a change in pupil size. In one approach, the sensor includes an imager in operative communication with a storage device and a processor. The imager is adapted for capturing images of the pupil over time. The images are typically stored in the storage device, although alternatively they may be sent directly as signals to the processor. The processor retrieves the images and compares contrast levels therebetween for identifying the dilation or constriction of the pupil over time. In another approach, the sensor includes a transmitter, a receiver, and a processor, all of which are operatively connected. The transmitter and the receiver are located internal or external to the eye. The transmitter transmits signals over time. The receiver receives the signals that reflect off of the iris of the eye (defining a moveable boundary of the pupil). The processor retrieves data associated with the reflected signals and calculates the trajectories of the reflected signal over time. The processor uses these trajectories to identify a change in the location of the iris over time. Accordingly, the processor identifies a dilation or constriction of the pupil over time. The sensor can transmit a report of this identification, e.g., via an input in the lens or in a spectacle frame that is not shown.","In various examples, the sensor  measures radius, diameter, circumference, surface area of an eye opening, azimuth angle or radius of an eyelid measured from the optical axis of the lens, direction of the optical axis of the eye, or any combination thereof, to determine the size of the pupil. In some cases, pupil size may be a measure of the overall opening of the lens of the eye to ambient light and includes a measure of squinting and\/or blinking of the eye lid.","In another approach the sensor  senses a change in ambient light. The sensor can be a photo-detector for detecting ambient light, such as a photovoltaic or photoconductive device. The sensor detects light internal or external to the eye.","In one example, the sensor  determines an exact value of the pupil size and\/or ambient light. In another example, the sensor  determines a relative value, for example, a degree or rate of change of the pupil size and\/or ambient light.","Alternatively or in addition to the aforementioned designs, the sensor  may include a physical, manual, or capacitive switch (e.g., which switches between \u2018on\u2019 and \u2018off\u2019 when a user touches the nose bridge).","The controller  is in operative communication with the sensor . When the sensor senses a change, an action is triggered in the controller. The sensor and controller typically communicate via a direct electrical connection (e.g. wire(s)) or a transmit\/receive device, such as an antenna or a micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) switch.","The electro-active region  includes, for example, two electrode layers that are spaced from each other with an electro-active material therebetween. The controller  is electrically connected to the two electrode layers. The controller may include drive electronics  and a power supply  such as a rechargeable battery. The controller applies voltage to each of the two electrode layers sufficient for forming an electric field thereacross and insufficient for the electrode layers to conduct with each other (i.e. short-circuiting). The controller preferably applies an alternating current (AC) to the electrode layers, but alternatively, may apply a direct current (DC).","In an embodiment of the invention not shown in the figures, a first of the two electrode layers is positioned on a first inner surface on a substrate layer of the lens. The second of the two electrode layers is typically formed on a second inner surface on a substrate layer of the lens positioned above or below the first electrode layer. The first electrode layer is typically a patterned electrode layer. The second electrode layer is typically a uniform conductive layer (e.g., not etched), which serves as a ground electrode. There is a gap between the first and second electrode layers. The gap contains an electro-active material. The electro-active material includes liquid crystalline materials such as nematic liquid crystal or, alternatively cholesteric liquid crystal. The electro-active material is preferably birefringent with the ability to alter refractive index by the application of an electric field. When the controller applies a voltages potential to the first and second electrode layers, an electric field is generated thereacross. This electrical field causes a change in the refractive index of the electro-active material, corresponding to an optical power or optical phase profile that is equal and opposite to that of an aberration wavefront of an eye. The lens effectively cancels aberrations of the eye.","The patterned electrode layer includes a plurality of patterned electrodes. Patterned electrodes are disconnected from each other and individually electrically connected to the controller. When the controller applies a series of voltages to the patterned electrodes a non-constant electric field pattern is generated across the lens. The electric field pattern causes a corresponding refractive index pattern across the lens, generating a corresponding optical phase profile.","Patterned electrodes may be shaped and arranged to generate an optical phase profile equal and opposite to that caused by the aberration wavefront of the eye. In one embodiment, shown in , the patterned electrodes are shaped as concentric electrode rings for cancelling the concentric (i.e., rotationally symmetric) spherical aberration of the eye. In another embodiment, shown in , the patterned electrodes are shaped as \u201cpixels\u201d or a discrete array of spot electrodes for canceling more complex radially asymmetric higher order aberration such as trefoil and coma.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 6B","FIG. 6A"],"b":["104","104"],"i":["a","a "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 6B","b":["182","104","114","116","116","114"],"i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIGS. 6C and 6D","FIG. 6A","FIG. 6B","FIG. 6C","FIG. 6D"],"b":["200","6","6"],"sup":"4","sub":"0 "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 6E","FIG. 6A","FIG. 6E","FIG. 6B","FIG. 6E","FIG. 6E","FIG. 6B","FIGS. 6B and 6E","FIGS. 7A and 7B"],"b":["104","104","104","104","104","104"],"i":["b","b ","a ","b ","b ","a "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIGS. 7A and 7B","FIG. 6A","FIGS. 6B and 6E","FIGS. 7A and 7B","FIG. 6A"]},"In both of the embodiments of , the lens portions include a substrate layer  and a patterned electrode layer .","The substrate layer  is an optically transparent structure forming at least an inner surface of the lens. The substrate layer may or may not have optical properties, e.g., providing additional (plus or minus) fixed optical power to the lens, e.g., by refraction or diffraction. For example, although the outer surfaces of the substrate layer are shown to have a flat topography, alternatively, these surfaces may have a curved or surface relief diffractive topography.","A uniform electrode layer (not shown) is typically formed on a second substrate layer opposite to the substrate layer of the patterned electrode layer. The two electrode layers are separated by a gap occupied by electro-active material. When voltage is applied across the electrode layers, the properties of the electro-active material are altered for altering the optical properties of the lens.","The lens portions of  differ by the composition of their patterned electrode layers .","In , the patterned electrode layer  includes a radially alternating arrangement of electrode rings and insulating rings .","The electrode rings are radially concentric. Thus, when different voltages are applied to the electrode rings, the electrode rings form a voltage pattern that changes symmetrically as a function of the radius of the lens.","The insulating rings  have a width and resistance sufficient for preventing the electrode rings from conducting with each other (i.e., short-circuiting). The width of each of the insulating rings is in a range of from approximately 1 \u03bcm to approximately 20 \u03bcm. The resistance of each of the insulating rings is in a range of from approximately 10Ohms per square to approximately 10Ohms per square. Other dimensions, resistance values, and\/or numbers of electrode rings and insulating rings may alternatively be used depending on the optical effects sought to be achieved.","The insulating properties of the insulating rings  cause voltages applied to the electrode rings to be significantly confined to the region occupied by the electrode rings. That is, voltage potentials across each of the electrode rings cannot dissipate beyond their boundary with the insulating rings. Accordingly, sharp gradients (i.e., discontinuities) in voltage occur at the boundaries of the electrode rings and the insulating rings. These gradients in voltage form an optical phase profile of the lens correction wavefront that likewise has sharp gradients at these boundaries.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 7C","FIG. 7A","FIG. 7C"],"b":["158","148"]},"The optical phase profile of the ideal correction  for spherical aberration the eye is a negation of the optical phase profile of the spherical aberration wavefront of the eye. The ideal correction is typically defined as a continuous and non-linear (i.e., curved) function, e.g., a fourth order polynomial such as \u2212ar+br. When applied to an eye having spherical aberration wavefront of, e.g., +ar\u2212br, a lens having the ideal correction should cancel the aberration wavefront to exactly zero.","The optical phase profile of the first correction  of the lens portion of  alternates between a constant value in the regions occupied by the electrode rings and a linear function in the regions between adjacent electrodes. Since the electrode rings are conductive (forming a local plateau of voltage potential) and the insulating rings are insulating (having an approximately linear voltage potential), the voltage profile and thus the corresponding optical phase profile across the lens resembles a stair-step function. The stair-step function voltage profile differs from the smooth curved function of the ideal correction .","The incline or slope of the stair-step voltage and phase profiles is increased as the distance between adjacent rings is decreased. That is, the smaller the spacing between adjacent electrode rings, the larger the gradient in voltage potential and optical phase there between. Accordingly, increasing the gap between electrode rings decreases the gradient in voltage potential, making the optical phase profile vary in a more gradual manner. The more gradual the incline of the optical phase profile, the more closely the profile will approximate the ideal correction .","However, the inherent structure of the lens portion of  prevents the electrode rings from being separated by more than a maximum distance. For example, typically the electrode rings are spaced by a distance that is less than or equal to the distance between the patterned electrode layer and the opposite uniform electrode layer. When the distance between the rings of the patterned electrode layer is increased beyond this distance, the constant voltage profile of the uniform electrode layer will dominate the voltage profile of the patterned electrode layer. When the voltage profile of the uniform electrode layer dominates, the voltage profile of the lens becomes constant and no longer approximates the curved ideal correction  for correcting spherical aberration.","To more closely or exactly match the ideal correction , an approach described in reference to  may be used.","In , the patterned electrode layer  includes the plurality of electrode rings rings overlaid with a resistive layer . The resistive layer is in electrical communication with the electrode rings ","The resistive layer  has a resistance that allows a voltage potential generated at the electrode rings to dissipate beyond the electrode rings. That is, the voltage applied to the electrode rings is not confined to the surface of the electrode rings themselves, but is conducted through the resistive layer. The resistive layer  of  has a greater resistance (or equivalently, a lesser conductivity) than the electrode rings of  (e.g., by a factor of at least 1000), but a significantly smaller resistance than the insulating rings  of  (e.g., by a factor of 1000). The resistance of the resistive layer  is in a range of from approximately 0.1 Mega-Ohms per square to approximately 100 Mega-Ohms per square. The resistance of the substrate layer  is greater than approximately 10Ohms per meter, and ideally infinite. The resistance of the electrode rings is less than approximately 200 Ohms per square. Other measures of resistance may be used depending on the optical effects sought to be achieved. The resistive layer typically has a high transparency, e.g., preferably greater than 90%, and is environmentally stable. In one example, the resistive layer may be composed of, e.g., a PEDOT material. In this example, the electrode rings may be composed of ITO, which has a lesser resistance than PEDOT materials. Other materials may be used. The thickness of the resistive layer and the electrode layer as a whole is, e.g., less than 200 nanometers (nm), and preferably less than 40 nm.","In a lens, when voltage is applied across the pattern electrode layer and the uniform electrode layer, the resistive layer shields the patterned voltage profile of the patterned electrode layer from the constant voltage profile of the opposite uniform electrode layer. Accordingly, the electrode rings of the patterned electrode layer of the lens portion of FIG. B may be separated by a greater distance than in  without experiencing substantially interfering voltage from the uniform electrode layer. For example, adjacent electrode rings in  may be separated by a distance that is greater than the distance between the patterned electrode layer and the uniform electrode layer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":["FIG. 7C","FIG. 7B","FIG. 7B","FIG. 7A"],"b":["160","160","148","158","160","148"]},"Although the second correction  closely matches the ideal correction  in the space between adjacent electrode rings, outside these regions, in the space occupied by the electrode rings themselves, the corrections may not match. Across the electrode rings, the voltage and therefore the optical phase profile is substantially constant (i.e., defined by a zero-order polynomial) and therefore different from the ideal correction (e.g., defined by a 4order polynomial). It may be appreciated that the narrower the electrode rings, the smaller the region having a constant optical phase profile. Therefore, the widths of the electrode rings of  are minimized to minimize the corresponding constant optical phase profile of the second correction  of . As described hereinabove, in one example, the width of each of the electrode rings of  is, e.g., less than 10 \u03bcm. When the widths of the electrode rings of  are minimized to these exemplified values, the constant portions of the second correction  of  are reduced to a negligible amount, for example, less than 10 \u03bcm. The difference between the constant portions of the optical phase profile of the second correction  and the curved incline of the optical phase profile of the ideal correction  is typically invisible to a user when viewed in a lens in an unmagnified state.","Experiments were conducted shining light at a wavelength of approximately 555 nm on an eye with peak photopic (bright light) spectral responsiveness. The experiments show that a lens built according to  may correct spherical aberration with root-mean-square (rms) values of approximately 1 \u03bcm. Typically, most eyes have spherical aberration less than or equal to 1 \u03bcm rms.","Computer programs are known in the art for calculating voltages and corresponding electric fields across a lens to generate a desired optical phase profile. Such programs include for example \u201cLorentz\u201d and \u201c2dimMOS\u201d. The relationships between voltages, electric fields, and optical phase profile may depend on the material properties of the electro-active material used in the lens, the spacing between the ground electrode layer and the patterned electrode layer in a stacked configuration of a lens and other design features of the lens.","The aforementioned description, describes primarily an electro-active lens designed for correcting spherical aberration. However, an eye may have higher order aberrations other than spherical aberration, e.g., including trefoil and coma. Typically, the eye has an aberrated wavefront that lacks the aforementioned radial symmetry attributed to spherical aberration. Such an eye requires a more general correction than is used for an eye having only spherical aberration. Additional high-order aberrations are commonly found in an eye, but at powers comparable to or less than typical powers of spherical aberration. Experiments have shown that visual acuity may be measurably improved by correcting as many of the high-order aberrations as possible.","Collectively, all higher order aberrations of the eye may form a complex and asymmetric distorted aberration wavefront. To correct this distorted aberration wavefront, a lens is needed having a comparably complex correction pattern in order to cancel any arbitrary aberrated wavefront.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":["FIG. 8A","FIG. 6A"]},"The patterned electrode layer has a plurality of pixelated electrodes . Pixelated electrodes may be an array of electrodes localized at different positions on a surface of the lens substrate. In contrast with the electrode rings of , which encircle a lens surface and are concentric with a common point, each of the pixelated electrodes of  has a different center point (e.g., the center of the electrode itself). The pixelated electrodes may be individually addressable electrodes arranged to accommodate a complex voltage pattern to generate an optical phase profile to negate that caused by any or all of the higher order aberrations of the eye. Since the optical phase profile needed for correcting an arbitrary aberrated wavefront is typically asymmetric pixelated electrodes are needed as opposed to symmetric electrode rings. The number of pixelated electrodes across the surface of a lens is in a range of from approximately 10 to approximately 500 and, preferably, in a range of from approximately 20 to approximately 100. Generally, the greater the number of pixelated electrodes, the more closely the corrective conjugate phase profile will resemble the aberrated phase profile. The pixelated electrodes may be squares of dimension, e.g., 10 \u03bcm. The distance between adjacent pixelated electrodes may be, e.g., 1 mm. The pixelated electrodes may be shaped as squares, circles, rectangles, or any other regular or irregular shape. In one embodiment, pixelated electrodes may be regularly spaced to form a grid. For example, pixelated electrodes may be shaped as squares and arranged in a Cartesian array (e.g., as shown in ) or hexagons arranged in a hexagonal array (not shown). In another embodiment (not shown), pixelated electrodes may be irregularly spaced. In one approach, pixelated electrodes may be randomly placed. The number of pixelated electrodes may be minimized to reduce the complexity of the electrical buss network that interconnects the pixelated electrodes to the controller.","In an embodiment not shown, each of the pixelated electrodes may be individually connected to a controller, e.g., via an electrical buss (not shown). The electrical busses are preferably transparent. The controller may apply a specific voltage to each pixelated electrode to collectively form a voltage pattern for altering the refractive index of the lens to cancel an individual user's aberrated wavefront. The refractive index of the lens may be changed to correct higher order aberrations due to different amounts of ambient light, pupil size, or other environmental parameter. Multiple voltage arrays may be stored in the controller to generate the appropriate correction profile for each such circumstance. Computer software may be used to convert the aberrated wavefront phase profile, as measured by a wavefront sensor, into the appropriate voltage array necessary for correction. The micro-controller chip may then retrieve the required voltages from its memory and multiplex the voltages to the pixelated electrodes.","In an alternative embodiment, each of the pixelated electrodes may be controlled using a matrix addressing scheme. In a \u201cpassive\u201d matrix addressing scheme, each of the pixelated electrodes is addressed by row and column buss lines. Pixelated electrodes are activated with a voltage when the appropriate row and column buss lines corresponding to that individual pixelated electrode are turned on. The controller applies voltage to the pixelated electrode matrix via a conventional progressive or interlaced row-column addressing scheme. This technology is well known in the field of liquid crystal displays. This embodiment may reduce the number of buss lines needed, e.g., compared with the aforementioned embodiment in which each pixelated electrodes is individually connected to the controller.","In yet another embodiment, referred to as \u201cactive\u201d matrix addressing, small transistor-based integrated circuits may be grown onto a back surface of the electrode layer for electrically communicating with each pixelated electrode. The controller applied voltages to a central transistorized circuit which modulates voltage individually for each pixelated electrode. Compared to \u201cpassive\u201d matrix addressing or individually connected pixelated electrodes, this embodiment more accurately controls the contrast ratios between pixelated electrodes to create a more precise correction to an arbitrary distorted wavefront.","The resistive layer  (e.g., described in reference to ) may coat the plurality of pixelated electrodes  to occupy the gaps formed therebetween. The resistive layer may shield the patterned electrode layer from the constant voltage profile of the uniform (e.g., ground) electrode layer disposed thereacross in a lens. Accordingly, the pixelated electrodes  may be spaced at relatively large distances, e.g., larger than the distance between the patterned electrode layer and the uniform electrode layer. As described above in reference to , when the distance between adjacent electrodes, e.g., pixelated electrodes , is increased, the voltage potential and corresponding optical phase profiles of the lens changes more gradually to more closely approximate ideal aberration correction. In one example, the optical phase profile of the lens may be programmed to approximate an arbitrary aberration, e.g., including one or more higher order aberrations such as spherical aberrations, trefoil, coma, or a combination thereof.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":["FIGS. 8B and 8C","FIG. 8A"]},"Two views are shown in  because, since the aberration is radially asymmetric, the ideal correction thereof is also radially asymmetric.

Accordingly, the sizes of the pixelated electrodes are minimized to reduce the deviation from the ideal corrections.","It may be appreciated that the Zernike (2,2) aberration is used as an example and that any other aberration having any degree of rotational asymmetry may have been similarly used. It may also be appreciated that the two different views of optical phase profiles are demonstrative of further possible variation of optical phase profile at each different view.","The change in pupil size and the change in ambient light are inversely (but not necessarily linearly) proportional. In one example, the amount of correction for the de-focusing effect of spherical aberration typically increases when the sensor senses an increase in pupil size. Accordingly, the degree of spherical aberration correction typically increases when the sensor senses a decrease in ambient light. For example, in photopic conditions (bright light conditions), the spherical aberration correction may be completely turned off (i.e., approximately zero correction\/power may be used). In scotopic conditions (extreme low light), the lens may provide full spherical aberration correction (i.e., maximum correction\/power may be necessary). In another example, the degree of spherical aberration correction decreases when the sensor senses a decrease in pupil size. Accordingly, the degree of spherical aberration correction decreases when the sensor senses an increase in ambient light.","Although the above example describes correcting changing spherical aberrations of the eye, it may be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the lens  of , e.g., using the pixelated electrodes  of , may correct any changing aberration, in general, e.g., including higher order aberrations. Some high-order aberrations may be present at small pupil diameters, and a constant correction may be appropriate. Other high-order aberrations, such as spherical aberration, may be dependent on the pupil diameter or on the level of accommodation of the eye and may require a dynamic correction that varies with light level and\/or accommodation level.","The higher order aberrations of the eye's optics may be measured by an aberrometer (i.e., a wavefront analyzer) for a plurality of pupil sizes (i.e., in a plurality of ambient lighting conditions) and\/or levels of accommodation. The aberrometer determines a plurality of different lens corrections, each predetermined to negate the measured higher order aberrations for one of the plurality of pupil sizes and\/or levels of accommodation. The aberrometer may provide this information to a controller program, which in turn determines a plurality of different values for voltages corresponding to the different pupil sizes, ambient lighting conditions and\/or levels of accommodation. The plurality of different voltages are stored in a memory of the controller. Instructions to apply these voltages to the electrode rings and\/or pixelated electrodes when the sensor senses the corresponding lighting condition are also stored in a memory of the controller. During operation of the lens, when the sensor senses a pupil size, an ambient lighting condition and\/or a level of accommodation, the controller retrieves from memory the voltage value(s) corresponding thereto or closest thereto. This voltage value is predetermined to correct the higher order aberrations due to the sensed data. The controller applies the voltages having the values retrieved from memory to the electrode rings and\/or pixelated electrodes of the lens. The applied voltages cause optical phase patterns or map to generate the lens correction for negating the measured higher order aberration for the pupil size, ambient lighting conditions and\/or levels of accommodation closest to the sensed data. Although the above example utilizes the method of using predetermined voltage values, more complex algorithms may be utilized to calculate the voltage levels for each unique profile required on a demand basis.","An embodiment of the invention not shown in the figures includes manufacturing the lens  of .

In one approach, a solid layer of conductive material may be deposited, e.g., by a sputtering process, on a surface of the substrate layer. The conductive layer may be etched, e.g., using a lithography process, leaving the desired shape and arrangement of patterned electrodes. For example, relatively thin rings (e.g., approximately 1% of the surface area) of the conductive material may be removed to form the electrode rings of , while relatively thick rings (e.g., approximately 99% of the surface area) of the conductive material may be removed to form the electrode rings of .

The insulating rings are formed by removing the conducting layer to expose underlying insulating substrate. The process may include, first coating the entire surface of the substrate layer with a thin conducting layer of ITO.

The fixed lens region extends radially to occupy the full view of the lens. Alternatively, the fixed lens region is spaced from at least a portion of the peripheral edge.

For example, when no voltage is applied to the electro-active region, the refractive index thereof matches the refractive index of the fixed lens region, and thus does not alter the optical properties thereof. The electro-active region  typically extends radially towards at least a portion of the peripheral edge of the lens or, alternatively, is spaced from the peripheral edge.","The lens  has a geometric center . The lens  has a fitting point . The fitting point of the lens is a reference point that represents the approximate location of the wearer's pupil when looking straight ahead through the lens. The fitting point is usually, but not always, located 2-5 mm vertically above the geometric center of the lens.

The progressive addition region provides a gradient of continuously increasing positive optical power that extends from a starting point  of a far distance viewing zone  (e.g., in the top-most half of the lens) of the lens to an ending point  of a near distance viewing zone  (e.g., in the lower portion of the lens) of the lens. This progression of optical power generally starts at approximately the fitting point of the lens and continues until the full add power is realized in the near distance viewing zone. Typically, the optical power then plateaus. Typically, the progressive addition region has a variable curvature surface on one or both outer surfaces of the lens (not shown) that is shaped to create this progression of optical power.","The lenses of  have regions  and , respectively, where the electro-active region  is in optical communication with at least a portion, and preferably most, of the progressive addition region . For example, the electro-active region is in optical communication with the far distance viewing zone  and the near distance viewing zone  of the progressive addition region.","The lenses of  have regions  and , respectively, where the electro-active region  is in optical communication with at least a portion, and preferably a small portion, of the progressive addition region .

The multi-focal optic is typically in optical communication with some, and preferably all, of the progressive addition region . The multi-focal optic provides optical power replacing, in part, power provided by the progressive addition region. By decreasing the power of the progressive addition region, the optical aberration associated therewith likewise decrease. The multi-focal optic may be an electro-active optic or a fixed optic.","The lens of  has a region  where the multi-focal optic is in optical communication with a portion, and preferably most, of the electro-active region . For example, the multi-focal optic is in optical communication with the far distance viewing zone  and the near distance viewing zone  of the progressive addition region.","The lens of  has a region  where the multi-focal optic is in optical communication with a portion, and preferably a small portion, of the electro-active region . For example, the multi-focal optic is in optical communication with only the far distance viewing zone  of the progressive addition region.","In an embodiment of the present invention (not shown in the figures) for correcting a spherical aberration of the eye, the fixed lens region may provide an optical power that varies (increasing or decreasing) radially from the center of the lens. In an example, a first region of the fixed lens region extending 3 mm from the center of the lens provides zero D of optical power, a second region of the fixed lens region extending from 3 mm to 4.5 mm from the center of the lens provides \u22121.00 D of optical power, and a third region of the fixed lens region extending from 4.5 mm to 6 mm from the center of the lens provides \u22122.00 D of optical power. The electro-active region is a flat continuous electrode layer. The electro-active region adds a uniform spherical power across the full field of the electro-active region. The combined varying optical power of the fixed lens region and the uniform spherical power of the electro-active region is provided to negate a spherical aberration in the eye. For example, when the pupil radius is less than 3 mm, and constricted to the first region, the electro-active region provides no spherical power. When the pupil radius is 4 mm (the pupil covers the first region and partially overlaps the second region) the uniform spherical power of the electro-active region is in a range of from zero D of the first region to \u22121.00 D of the second region, and preferably an average therebetween of \u22120.50 D. When the pupil radius is 5 mm (the pupil covers the first and second regions and partially overlaps the third region), the uniform spherical power of the electro-active region is in a range of from \u22121.00 D of the second region to \u22122.00 D of the third region, and preferably an average therebetween of \u22121.00 D. Although three regions and optical powers and specific dimensions thereof are described, alternatively any other number of regions, optical powers and dimensions (up to the maximum opening size of the pupil) may be used according to the present invention.","In another embodiment not shown in the figures, the lens of the present invention may be, for example, an intra-ocular lens, a corneal in-lay, a corneal on-lay, a contact lens, and\/or a spectacle lens. The correction region for higher order aberration is typically located along the optical axis of the lens. When the lens is a contact lens, intra-ocular lens, corneal in-lay or a corneal on-lay, the optical axis of the lens stays positioned with respect to the optical axis of the eye. Thus, the lens corrects higher order aberration of the eye regardless of the rotation of the eye.","However, in the aforementioned example, in which the lens of the present invention is a spectacle lens (i.e., the lens is set in a spectacle frame), the lens has a stationary optical axis. When the eye rotates with respect to the optical axis of the lens, the correction applied to the eye may be improper. To overcome this problem, in one approach, the spectacle frame includes a gaze detector (not shown) that detects the direction of a wearer's gaze. Since the electro-active region provides higher order aberration correction in the lens, when a user's gaze is directed outside of the electro-active region, the lens cannot provide proper higher order aberration correction. Thus, when the gaze detector detects a deviation of gaze direction away from the optical axis of the lens, the electro-active region of the lens is turned off. In another approach, the electro-active region may be extended (e.g., using pixelated electrodes) to provide moving higher order aberration correction across the lens. When a sensor senses movement in the direction of the user's gaze, a controller translates the voltages applied to the pixelated electrodes spatially across the lens to cause a new phase profile correction that remains centered with respect to the new direction of the user's gaze. In this approach, the lens provides accurate higher order aberration correction for a moving eye (i.e., for each of a plurality of different gaze directions). In one example, the gaze detector measures the direction of the user's gaze and sends the information to an integrated circuit (IC) chip (not shown) to control the voltages multiplexed to each of the pixelated electrodes. In order to accommodate a voltage pattern that translates across the lens, the number of pixelated electrodes and the size of the electro-active region may be increased, e.g., based on the range of gaze angles the lens accommodates.","It is noted that the lens of the present invention provides many benefits, one of which includes providing an alternative to using \u2018spherical equivalence\u2019 along with additional minus power, a leading approach in the current state of the art for reducing spherical aberration of the eye.","As shown in , de-focus due to spherical aberration of the eye typically increases (in absolute value) radially from the center of the eye. Thus, when using additional spherical power to negate spherical aberration near the peripheral edge of the pupil, the power of the lens correction is greater in absolute value than the ideal correction to negate spherical aberration near the center of the pupil. Applying the additional spherical power near the center of the pupil, where such correction is not needed, would cause unwanted distortion. Similarly, applying the smaller spherical aberration correction near the peripheral edge of the pupil would not correct the existing distortion of the eye attributed to spherical aberration. To mediate the different corrections needed to reduce distortions at different radii of the eye, conventional lenses use a spherical equivalent additional power that is typically halfway between 0 and the maximum power required to correct the spherical aberration at large pupil diameters.","Spherical equivalence is an approach in which a clinician prescribes a lens having a spherical power prescription that is greater or less than needed, in order to negate some distortion caused by non-spherical aberrations. This technique is typically used in contact lenses to correct for astigmatism. Some clinicians also apply this technique to eliminate distortion caused by spherical aberration when the pupil diameter is large. For example, if a patient has approximately \u2212\u00bd D of spherical aberration near the peripheral edge of the pupil and approximately zero D of spherical aberration near the center of the pupil, a spherically equivalent lens may provide an additional \u2212\u00bc D of sphere across the entire lens surface. The result is a lens that has too much spherical power near the center of the lens and too little spherical aberration correction near the peripheral edge of the lens.","Despite the problem of imprecise correction, spherically equivalent lenses may have some benefits. Compared with lenses that provide optimal correction only when the user's gaze is aligned with the optical axis of the lens, spherically equivalent lenses typically provide reasonable correction for an eye gazing in all directions. Another advantage is that spherically equivalent lenses have been shown in some cases to improve night vision, e.g., see references, Amos, J. F. (1987). , Butterworths; Hope, G. M. and M. I. Rubin (1984). \u201cNight myopia.\u201d Surv. Opthalmology 29: 129-136; Owens, D. A. and H. W. Leibowitz (1976). \u201cNight myopia: cause and a possible basis or amelioration.\u201d Am. J.

London, Butterworths.","A disadvantage of spherically equivalent lenses is that they provide more minus power than is needed for correction during photopic conditions when the pupil diameter is small. Thus, these lenses are usually prescribed strictly for night wear.","An advantage of lenses described according to the present invention is that, when using a hybrid lens, normal spherical de-focus may be corrected by a conventional lens portion, and spherical aberration at large pupil radii may be corrected by an electro-active lens portion activated during low-light conditions.","It is further noted that the lens of the present invention provides the additional benefit of correcting residual de-focus effects commonly uncorrected by conventional lenses. Conventional lenses are typically commercially available only at interval optical powers (e.g., at intervals of \u00bc D). Residual de-focus is a small optical power differential between a user's ideal correction and the closest commercially available optical power correction."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Specific embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the following drawings, wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIGS. 2-5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 6A","b":["100","102"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 6B","FIG. 6A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIGS. 6C and 6D","FIG. 6A","FIG. 6B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 6E","FIG. 6A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIGS. 7A and 7B","FIG. 6A","FIGS. 6B and 6E"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 7C","FIGS. 7A and 7B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 8A","FIG. 6A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIGS. 8B and 8C","FIG. 6A","FIG. 8A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 9A","FIG. 6A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 9B","FIG. 6A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIGS. 9C and 9D","FIGS. 9A and 9B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIGS. 9E and 9F","FIGS. 9C and 9D"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
