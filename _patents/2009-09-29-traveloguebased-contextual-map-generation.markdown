title: Travelogue-based contextual map generation
abstract: A map user interface control provides functionality for displaying a map in conjunction with the display of a Web page. The map control operates in combination with a location extraction component that analyzes the contents of the Web page to identify locations mentioned therein. Once the location extraction component has identified the locations mentioned in the Web page, a map is generated that encompasses the locations identified in the Web page. Once the map has been generated, the map control displays the map in conjunction with the display of the Web page. The map might include visual indicators corresponding to the locations mentioned in the Web page. The map might also include visual indicators corresponding to other locations near the locations identified in the Web page that have been identified using co-occurrence values generated through an analysis of a set of travelogues.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["When searching the World Wide Web (the \u201cWeb\u201d) for travel information, it is not uncommon for users to utilize multiple Web sites to locate sought-after information. For instance, it is not uncommon for a user to utilize a search engine to identify a Web site that contains interesting travel information for a location. After viewing the identified Web site, it is also not uncommon for the user to then navigate to a map Web site in order to view a map of the location. Navigation between multiple Web sites in this manner can be a frustrating and time consuming experience for users interested in quickly and easily locating travel information about a location along with a map of the location. It can also be difficult for users to locate information regarding other interesting sites near the location.","It is with respect to these and other considerations that the disclosure made herein is presented.","Concepts and technologies are disclosed herein for travelogue-based contextual map generation. Through an implementation of the concepts and technologies presented herein, locations mentioned within a Web page can be identified. A map can then be displayed in conjunction with a display of the Web page that encompasses the locations mentioned in the Web page. The displayed map can be displayed without any user intervention. In this way, a user can be presented with a map configured to the contextual content of a Web page without requiring the user to navigate away from the Web page to a site that provides maps.","According to one aspect, a map user interface control (\u201cmap control\u201d) is provided herein. The map control provides functionality for displaying a map in conjunction with the display of a Web page, such as within a Web browser application program. In various embodiments, program code may be embedded within a Web page that causes the map control to be instantiated when the Web page is rendered by the Web browser application program.","In various embodiments, the map control operates in conjunction with a location extraction component that analyzes the contents of the Web page to identify locations mentioned therein. The location extraction component might utilize a gazetteer containing location names in order to identify locations mentioned in the Website. For instance, a gazetteer might be utilized to identify possible name candidates, a classifier might then be utilized to identify location names from the name candidates, and ambiguity resolution might then be performed to distinguish between different locations having the same name.","Once the location extraction component has identified the locations mentioned in the Web page, a map is generated that encompasses the locations identified in the Web page. A map server might be utilized in embodiments to generate the map. Once the map has been generated, the map control displays the map in conjunction with the display of the Web page. For instance, if the Web page includes text, the map control might display the map in conjunction with the display of the text of the Web page. The names of the locations in the text might also be emphasized.","According to various embodiments, the map includes visual indicators corresponding to the locations identified in the Web page. According to yet other embodiments, the map might also include visual indicators corresponding to other locations near the locations identified in the Web page. To provide this functionality, a co-occurrence extraction component generates co-occurrence values for a set of travelogues. Each co-occurrence value is an integer value that specifies the number of times two locations are mentioned in the same travelogue for the entire set of travelogues. Travelogues are textual descriptions of a person's experience with a particular location. For instance, a person might travel to New York City and write a travelogue that describes their travel experience. In addition to a description of the person's travel experience with a particular location, a travelogue might also include a description of the person's experience with other, related locations.","Once the co-occurrence values have been generated, these values can be utilized to identify other locations near the locations mentioned in the Web page. In particular, the co-occurrence values are searched in order to identify those other locations that have non-zero co-occurrence values with respect to the locations identified in the Web page. The other locations having non-zero co-occurrence values with respect to the specified location can then be displayed on the map. In one embodiment, only those other locations having the highest co-occurrence values with respect to the locations identified in the Web page may be displayed.","It should be appreciated that the above-described subject matter might also be implemented as a computer-controlled apparatus, a computer process, a computing system, or as an article of manufacture such as a computer-readable storage medium. These and various other features will be apparent from a reading of the following Detailed Description and a review of the associated drawings.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description.
