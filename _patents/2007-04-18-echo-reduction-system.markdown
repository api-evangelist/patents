title: Echo reduction system
abstract: A system for reducing an echo and/or a residual echo in a microphone output signal includes an echo compensation filter configured to receive audio input signals and generate an estimated echo signal. A speech activity detector is configured to detect speech of a local speaker, and a combining circuit is configured to generate an echo compensated signal by subtracting the estimated echo signal from the microphone output signal. A residual echo reduction circuit is configured to suppress the residual echo in the echo compensated signal based on the detected speech activity, and output an echo suppressed output signal. The echo reduction system may reduce local background noise and residual echoes in a microphone output signal so that local speech may be transmitted free from undesirable signals.

Priority Claim","This application claims the benefit of priority from European Patent Application No. 06 009468.7, filed May 8, 2006, which is incorporated by reference.","2. Technical Field","This disclosure relates to echo reduction. In particular, this disclosure relates to echo reduction and suppression of residual echo signals in communication systems.","3. Related Art","Echo reduction or suppression may be needed in communication systems, such as hands-free sets and speech recognition systems. Communication systems may include a microphone that detects a desired signal, such as a speech signal from a user. However, the microphone may also detect undesirable signals, such as echoes produced by a loudspeaker in the audio environment.","Echoes may occur when signals transmitted by a remote party and received by a near-end are output by loudspeakers at the near end. Such signals may be detected by the near-end microphone and re-transmitted back to the remote party. Echoes may be annoying to the user and may result in a communication failure.","Echo suppression may be particularly difficult if the speaker is moving, such as when a driver is using a hands-free set and also steers a vehicle. In this situation, an impulse response of the \u201cloudspeaker-room-microphone\u201d (LRM) environment may be time-variant. Existing echo suppression systems may be unreliable and may not be particularly effective in a time-varying LRM environment. After application of echo suppression techniques, residual echoes may be present. The severity of the residual echoes may be increased by the large delay paths associated with mobile phone services. Accordingly, a need exists for an echo reduction system capable of reducing echoes and residual echoes.","A filter bank may separate a microphone output signal into sub-band microphone signals. An audio input filter bank may separate audio input signals into of sub-band audio signals. An echo compensation filter receives the audio input signals from each sub-band range and may generate a corresponding estimated echo signal. A speech activity detector may detect the speech of a local speaker by analyzing the power spectrum. The estimated echo signal may be subtracted from the microphone output signal to compensate for echoes. A residual echo reduction circuit may remove any residual echoes in the echo compensated signal based on speech activity.","Other systems, methods, features and advantages will be, or will become, apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following figures and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems, methods, features and advantages be included within this description, be within the scope of the invention, and be protected by the following claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["110","114","120","124","130","120","134","124","134"]},"The microphone  may detect undesirable signals, such as echo signals produced by the loudspeaker . Echoes may occur when signals transmitted by the remote communication party  are output by loudspeakers at the near end, and retransmitted via the microphone back to the remote communication party . Such echoes may occur in various speech recognition systems or speech dialog systems.","The microphone  may detect speech signals s(n) of the local speaker  as well as background noise signals b(n). The microphone  may further detect a \u201cloudspeaker-room-microphone\u201d (LRM) transfer signal d(n) based on an impulse response h(n) of a LRM environment or system . A microphone output signal y(n) may include contributions from the speech signal s(n), the background noise signal b(n) and the LRM transfer signal d(n). The term \u201cn\u201d may denote a discrete time index.","The echo reduction system  may provide echo compensation and residual echo suppression. Echo compensation may be performed by an adaptive echo compensation filtering system that may model the loudspeaker-room-microphone system transfer function using an impulse response. Such processing may be performed by dividing the signal spectrum into sub-bands and processing each sub-band separately.

The filter coefficients of the echo compensation filter  may model the impulse response in the sub-bands.

An estimated echo signal {circumflex over (D)}(e,n) in each sub-band may be obtained by processing the audio input sub-band signals X(e,n) with the impulse response \u0124(e,n) of the echo compensation filter .","The echo compensation filter  may include hardware and\/or software, and may include a digital signal processor (DSP). The DSP may execute instructions that delay an input signal one or more additional times, track frequency components of a signal, filter a signal, and\/or attenuate or boost an amplitude of a signal.

As shown by the waveform, the smoothed distance measure (n) does not respond or responds slightly to the speaker's movements. In particular, (n) may be below the threshold C=1. Panel C may show significant residual echo suppression while the speaker moves. During the period of time when double-talk exists, the smoothed distance measure (n) may indicate speech activity of the local speaker . As a result, the desired output signal \u015c(e,n) may show a correspondence with the simulated speech signal of the local speaker.","The logic, circuitry, and processing described above may be encoded in a computer-readable medium such as a CDROM, disk, flash memory, RAM or ROM, an electromagnetic signal, or other machine-readable medium as instructions for execution by a processor. Alternatively or additionally, the logic may be implemented as analog or digital logic using hardware, such as one or more integrated circuits (including amplifiers, adders, delays, and filters), or one or more processors executing amplification, adding, delaying, and filtering instructions; or in software in an application programming interface (API) or in a Dynamic Link Library (DLL), functions available in a shared memory, or defined as local or remote procedure calls; or as a combination of hardware and software.","The logic may be represented in (e.g., stored on or in) a computer-readable medium, machine-readable medium, propagated-signal medium, and\/or signal-bearing medium. The media may comprise any device that contains, stores, communicates, propagates, or transports executable instructions for use by or in connection with an instruction executable system, apparatus, or device. The machine-readable medium may selectively be, but is not limited to, an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, or infrared signal or a semiconductor system, apparatus, device, or propagation medium. A non-exhaustive list of examples of a machine-readable medium includes: a magnetic or optical disk, a volatile memory such as a Random Access Memory \u201cRAM,\u201d a Read-Only Memory \u201cROM,\u201d an Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (i.e., EPROM) or Flash memory, or an optical fiber. A machine-readable medium may also include a tangible medium upon which executable instructions are printed, as the logic may be electronically stored as an image or in another format (e.g., through an optical scan), then compiled, and\/or interpreted or otherwise processed. The processed medium may then be stored in a computer and\/or machine memory.","The systems may include additional or different logic and may be implemented in many ways. A controller may be implemented as a microprocessor, microcontroller, application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), discrete logic, or a combination of other types of circuits or logic. Similarly, memories may be DRAM, SRAM, Flash, or other types of memory. Parameters (e.g., conditions and thresholds), and other data structures may be separately stored and managed, may be incorporated into a single memory or database, or may be logically and physically organized in many different ways. Programs and instruction sets may be parts of a single program, separate programs, or distributed across several memories and processors.
