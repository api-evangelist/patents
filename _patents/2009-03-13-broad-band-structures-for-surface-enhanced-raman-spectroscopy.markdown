{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This invention has been made with Government support under Contract No. HR0011-09-3-0002, awarded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. The government has certain rights in the invention.","The present disclosure relates generally to broad band structures for surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy.","Raman spectroscopy is used to study the transitions between molecular energy states when monochromatic light interacts with molecules, which results in the energy of the light photons being shifted, or scattered. The energy shift provides information of the vibrational energy spacing in the molecular system. Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) enhances Raman scattering via molecules adsorbed on, for example, rough metal surfaces or metal nanoparticle aggregates. The Raman signal enhancement is typically related to the large electric fields generated near the metal surface due to localized surface plasmon resonance. However, the SERS signals strongly depend on the excitation light wavelength. To achieve a large Raman enhancement factor, the excitation light wavelength may be tuned in close proximity to the surface plasmon resonance of the metal nanoparticles.","Embodiments of the SERS structures disclosed herein enable systematic control of the plasmonic resonance of metal nanostructures over a broad electromagnetic spectrum (e.g., from near ultraviolet (UV) to near infrared (IR)). The variable plasmon resonances provide uniform SERS enhancement at many excitation wavelengths with a single device. As such, the structure(s) disclosed herein provide an advantage over structures including a single type of plasmonic resonance nanostructure, which tend to strongly depend upon the excitation wavelength used. Furthermore, it is believed that the broad band response of the SERS structures disclosed herein advantageously eliminates inefficient Raman responses at some wavelengths.","Referring now to ,  and  together, various embodiments of the broad band structure , \u2032, \u2033 are respectively shown. Each of the structures , \u2032, \u2033 includes a substrate  having a metal layer  established thereon. The substrate  is generally formed of any suitable material. In one embodiment, the substrate  is made of a dielectric material. Non-limiting examples of suitable substrate materials include insulators (e.g., glass, quartz, ceramic (e.g., alumina), etc.), polymeric material(s) (e.g., polycarbonates, polyamides, acrylics, etc.), or semiconductors (e.g., silicon, InP, GaAs, InAs, InGaAsP(where 0<x<1, 0<y<1)), silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates, or group III-V semiconductors on silicon on SOI substrates.","The metal layer  is generally selected from gold, silver, copper, aluminum, or various alloys and mixtures thereof. It is believed that gold may be particularly advantageous for enhancing the stability of the structure , \u2032, \u2033. The metal layer  may be deposited via any suitable method, including chemical vapor deposition (CVD), physical vapor deposition (PVD), atomic layer deposition (ALD), plating, or the like. The metal layer  may have any desirable thickness. In one embodiment, the thickness ranges from about 50 nm to about 100 nm. It may be desirable that the thickness be several tens of nanometers.","Each of the structures , \u2032, \u2033 also includes a dielectric material , which, during fabrication, is patterned and cured or etched to form a dielectric layer , , having a desirable shape and a varying thickness t. The shape may be any desirable shape which results in variable spacing between the metal layer  and two or more of the nanostructures  established on the dielectric layer , , . Non-limiting examples of such shapes include an arc (see ) or semi-spherical shape, a multi-step shape (see ), or a pyramid shape (see ). Other suitable shapes may be utilized, such as, for example, a triangular shape in which a surface of the dielectric layer (this embodiment is not shown) has a predetermined slope relative to a surface of metal layer .","It is to be understood that the thickness t of the dielectric layer , , may continuously vary along an entire length L of the layer , , (as shown in ), or may vary from one portion to another. In the latter embodiment, one portion of the dielectric layer , , may have a consistent thickness tacross part of the length L, while another portion has a different consistent thickness tacross another part of the length L (as shown in ). It is to be understood that in the embodiments shown in , even though the thickness t varies continuously, the thickness t may be the same at certain points along the length L. For example, when the dielectric layer has the pyramidal shape, the opposed sides S of the pyramid have the same varying thickness t.","Suitable dielectric materials  for forming the dielectric layer , , include insulating materials, such as SiO, SiN, glass, or insulating polymers. In some embodiments, the dielectric material  is curable. It is to be understood that the various methods for forming the different embodiments of the dielectric layer , , will be described further hereinbelow in reference to .","Nanostructures  are established on the dielectric layer , , . Suitable deposition techniques for establishing the nanostructures  include a Langmuir Blodgett method or a casting method.","Due to the varying thickness t of the dielectric layer , , , at least some of the deposited nanostructures  are positioned at different distances from the surface of the metal layer  in comparison with at least some other of the deposited nanostructures . Furthermore, at least some of the nanostructures  exhibit varying plasmonic resonances from at least some of the other nanostructures , due, at least in part to the varying distances of the respective nanostructures  from the metal layer . As such, the thickness t of the dielectric layer , , may be controlled to achieve desirable nanostructure  plasmonic resonance frequencies. In an embodiment, the desirable range of the varying thickness is from about 0 nm to about 2r nm, where \u201cr\u201d is the radius of the nanostructure . It is to be understood, however, that the upper end of the range may be larger than 2r or smaller than 2r, if desirable. The thickness used will depend, at least in part, on the desirable plasmonic resonances. For example, if metal nanoparticles are used having a 10 nm radius, the varying thickness of the dielectric layer  may range from about 0 nm to about 50 nm.","As a non-limiting example of the structure , \u2032, \u2033, silver nanoparticles  having diameters of about 40 nm are utilized, and the varying thickness of the dielectric layer  ranges from about 0 nm to about 40 nm or more. The corresponding plasmon frequencies in this non-limiting example are as follows: at 0 nm dielectric layer  thickness, the plasmon resonance of the particle(s)  ranges from 700 nm to 800 nm; at 10 nm dielectric layer  thickness, the plasmon resonance of the particle(s)  ranges from 500 nm to 600 nm; at 20 nm dielectric layer  thickness, the plasmon resonance of the particle(s)  is about 500 nm; and at a dielectric layer  thickness of 30 nm or more, the plasmon resonance of the particle(s)  ranges from 400 nm to 500 nm. Another non-limiting example of the structures , \u2032, \u2033 includes gold spherical nanoparticles  having diameters of 10 nm, and a silicon dioxide dielectric layer  with the varying thickness ranging from 0 nm to 100 nm.","As mentioned in the previous non-limiting examples, silver and gold are suitable materials for the nanostructures . Other non-limiting examples of suitable nanostructure materials are copper, aluminum, or alloys of any of the listed metals. The nanostructures  may be particles or have some other desirable configuration. Furthermore, the nanostructures  may have any desirable shape including spheres, cubes, polyhedral shapes, arbitrary shapes, or the like, as long as at least one dimension (e.g., the diameter in the case of particles) of the nanostructures  is on the nanoscale (i.e., ranging from about 1 nm to about 300 nm).","The structures , \u2032, \u2033 disclosed herein are suitable for use in standard Raman detection procedures. Generally, analyte molecules are distributed on the SERS structure , \u2032, \u2033 (i.e., over the nanostructures ) and are subsequently subjected to laser excitation of suitable wavelengths. The resulting signals are detected using known detectors.","Referring now to , an embodiment of the method for forming the structure  (different embodiments of which are shown in ) is depicted. More specifically,  illustrate the formation of an imprint mold , and  illustrate the formation of the structure  using the imprint mold .","As shown in , a plurality of spherical beads  are established on a substantially flat surface of a substrate . The substrate  may be any suitable material, such as silicon, glass, quartz, or any of the other materials listed for substrate . In one embodiment, the phrase \u201csubstantially flat\u201d, when used to describe the substrate  surface, means that the surface is planar and has a slope of zero. The substantially flat surface may, in some instances, have minor surface irregularities that do not interfere with the desirable layout of the spherical beads  thereon.","The spherical beads  are selected to have a predetermined size (e.g., diameter). It is to be understood that the size dictates the arc shape that is formed in the dielectric material . In a non-limiting example, the diameter of the spherical beads  ranges from about 50 nm to about 5 \u03bcm. In an embodiment, the spherical beads  are selected from polymeric or glass beads.","As shown in , the beads  are established on the substrate  such that they are close together in a relatively uniform manner. Establishing the beads  on the substrate  may be accomplished by first suspending the beads  in a suitable fluid (e.g., water or a suitable non-dissolving organic solvent), and then depositing (e.g., via casting, spin-coating, etc.) the suspension on the substrate . The fluid is then evaporated, and the beads  remain closely packed on the substrate .","Another substantially flat substrate , having a thin layer of adhesive material  thereon, is then pressed into the substrate  such that the adhesive material  contacts the beads . This is shown in . It is to be understood that any of the previously listed substrate materials are suitable for substrate , and that any desirable adhesive material  may be used. As non-limiting examples, an epoxy or a curable glue may be a suitable adhesive material . The thickness of the adhesive material  is substantial enough to adhere the beads  to the substrate  without flowing around the beads  or between adjacent beads . Generally, the thickness of the adhesive material  is smaller than the radius of the beads  used.","The adhesive material , which is in contact with the beads , is then cured to anchor the beads  to the substrate . The curing temperature will depend upon the adhesive material  selected, and is low enough to not deleteriously affect the beads . This forms the imprint mold , as shown in .","As shown in , the imprint mold  is used to pattern the dielectric material . The dielectric material  is established on the metal layer , which is established on the substrate . Materials for, thicknesses of, and methods for depositing such layer  and material  are described hereinabove in reference to .","At this point, the dielectric material  is a curable dielectric which has not yet been cured, and thus is readily conformable to the pattern defined by the beads  when the imprint mold  is pressed therein (see, e.g., ). It is to be understood that the imprint mold  may be pressed into and\/or through all or a portion of the depth of the dielectric material . The depth into and\/or through which the imprint mold  is pressed will depend upon the desired variable thickness t for the resulting dielectric layer . For example, if it is desirable that the variable thickness t dielectric layer be as thin as possible, the mold  may be pressed through the entire depth of the dielectric material .","While the imprint mold  is pressed to a desirable depth in the dielectric material , the material  is cured. Curing may be accomplished at a temperature suitable for the material  selected, and may be accomplished via thermal curing or UV curing. The pattern of the beads  is therefore transferred to the resulting dielectric layer . The mold  is then released, as shown in . The nanostructures  are deposited on the patterned dielectric layer via one of the methods described hereinabove. The resulting structure  is shown in . It is to be understood that the spherical bead imprint mold  may be used to form an arc shape or a semi-spherical shape. The resulting pattern in the dielectric layer depends, at least in part, on the width of the dielectric material  (not shown in , but would be extending into the paper), and the diameter of the beads  used.","Referring now to , another embodiment of the method for forming the structure  is depicted. While the dielectric layer is shown being formed in this embodiment, it is to be understood that the other patterned dielectric layers , may be formed via this method.","As shown in , the imprint mold  is utilized. However, rather than pressing the imprint mold  directly into the dielectric material  which ultimately forms the dielectric layer , the imprint mold  is pressed into a resist layer  that is established on the dielectric material . In this embodiment, the resist layer  is a curable polymer, such that it conforms to and may be set to the pattern of the imprint mold . Also in this embodiment, the dielectric material  may not be a curable dielectric material. This embodiment of the method increases the list of dielectric materials  that may be used to form the dielectric layer . As such, in this embodiment, the list of suitable material is not limited to curable dielectric materials.","As shown in , the imprint mold  is used to transfer the pattern to the resist layer . After the imprinting and curing processes are complete, a resist mask \u2032 is formed, as shown in . The cured resist layer having the pattern formed therein is a sacrificial etching mask \u2032 that is used to pattern the underlying dielectric material  in a subsequent etching process. In an embodiment, directional etching (such as reactive ion etching) may be used to further transfer the pattern into the dielectric material  (see ). As shown, the underlying dielectric material  is patterned to form the dielectric layer . Such an etching process may be utilized as long as the proper etching conditions may be selected. The residual resist mask \u2032, if any, is then removed via a suitable solve or another etchant.","The nanostructures  are deposited on the patterned dielectric layer via one of the methods described hereinabove. The resulting structure  is shown in .","Referring now to , an embodiment of the method for forming the structure \u2032 or \u2033 (embodiments of which are shown in , respectively) is depicted. As shown at reference numeral , the method includes forming an imprint mold.","When it is desirable to form the structure \u2032, the imprint mold includes a step shaped pattern. It is to be understood that the inverse of this imprint mold pattern is ultimately transferred to the dielectric material . This step shaped pattern may include any desirable number of steps, as long as at least one step has a thickness that is different from one other step. In this particular embodiment, an advanced lithography technique (e.g., focused ion beam (FIB) lithography, electron beam (e-beam) lithography) may be used to generate the desirable pattern in a suitable mold material. Suitable mold materials include, but are not limited to quartz, silicon, silicon nitride, glass, diamond-like material, etc.","It is to be understood that advanced lithography techniques may also be used to generate an imprint mold having another desirable shape, such as a triangular shape with a single slanted surface.","When it is desirable to form the structure \u2033, the imprint mold includes a pyramidal pattern. Such a pyramid pattern may be formed in a crystalline silicon substrate via anisotropic etching (e.g., a wet etching process). A square pattern is initially wet etched into the surface of the crystalline silicon substrate. As the etching process continues through a depth of the crystalline silicon substrate, the initially square pattern decreases until the pyramidal pattern is formed therein. For example, wet etching is selective toward the <100> surface of the crystalline silicon substrate, thereby enabling the square pattern to initially be formed therein. However, as etching continues, a <111> surface is reached, which slows down the etching and causes the pyramid shape (which is actually an inverted pyramid) to form.","The pyramid shape formed in the crystalline silicon substrate may be transferred to a mold material (e.g., a curable resist) by depositing the mold material on at least the etched portion of the crystalline silicon substrate. The mold material is then cured, which sets the pyramidal pattern into the mold material and forms the imprint mold.","As shown at reference numeral , after the desirable imprint mold is formed, it is pressed into the curable dielectric material  (which, as described above, is established on the metal layer  and the substrate ). By pressing the mold into the material , the inverse of the step shape pattern or the pyramidal pattern is transferred to the dielectric material . This material is then cured to form the dielectric layer , , as shown at reference numeral . The imprint mold is then released (see reference numeral ), and the nanostructures  are established on exposed surfaces of the dielectric layer , (see reference numeral ) using techniques previously described herein.","While several embodiments have been described in detail, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the disclosed embodiments may be modified. Therefore, the foregoing description is to be considered exemplary rather than limiting."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Features and advantages of embodiments of the present disclosure will become apparent by reference to the following detailed description and drawings, in which like reference numerals correspond to similar, though perhaps not identical, components.
