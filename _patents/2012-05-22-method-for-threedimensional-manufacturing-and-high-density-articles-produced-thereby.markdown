{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATION DATA","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION","Examples"],"p":["None.","None.","The present invention is in the field of three-dimensional printing of polymeric objects, and related processing methods.","The field of rapid prototyping involves the production of prototype polymeric articles and small quantities of functional polymeric parts, directly from computer-generated design data.","Two well-known methods for rapid prototyping include a selective laser sintering process and a liquid binder three dimensional printing process. These techniques are similar, to the extent that they both use layering techniques to build three-dimensional articles. Both methods form successive thin cross-sections of the desired article. The individual cross-sections are formed by bonding together adjacent grains of a granular, (i.e., particulate) material on a generally planar surface of a bed of the granular material. Each layer is bonded to a previously formed layer at the same time as the grains of each layer are bonded together to form the desired three-dimensional article. The laser-sintering and liquid binder techniques are advantageous because they create parts directly from computer-generated design data and can produce parts having complex geometries. Moreover, three dimensional printing may be quicker and less expensive than machining of prototype parts or production of cast or molded parts by conventional \u201chard\u201d or \u201csoft\u201d tooling techniques that can take from a few weeks to several months, depending on the complexity of the item. By contrast, the three dimensional printing process allows one to produce a demonstration prototype or in some instances, a usable part, within hours or days.","An extrusion-based layered deposition system (e.g., fused deposition modeling systems developed by Stratasys, Inc., Eden Prairie, Minn.) is typically used to build a 3D object from a CAD model in a layer-by-layer fashion by extruding a flowable build material, such as a thermoplastic material. The build material is extruded through a nozzle carried by an extrusion head, and is deposited as a sequence of roads on a base in an x-y plane. The extruded build material fuses to previously-deposited build material, and solidifies upon a drop in temperature. The position of the extrusion head relative to the base is then incremented along a z-axis (perpendicular to the x-y plane), and the process is then repeated to form a 3D object resembling the CAD model.","In many instances, it is desirable to be able to construct three-dimensional objects that are of high density or that offer sufficiently high radio-opacity to be able to provide application-satisfactory radioactive or electromagnetic radiation shielding.","It is likewise desirable in other applications to be able to produce articles or prototypes of relatively high density to be able to take advantage of higher density in applications where three dimensional printing is advantageous, scuh as for the production of prototypes or operative articles, particularly where dimensional stability, strength, reliability and manufacturing consistency are beneficial.","The present invention includes methods of three-dimensional printing as well as the high density and\/or radiopaque three-dimensional articles produced thereby.","Articles prepared in accordance with the method of the present invention may be used as production articles or as prototypes to be able to demonstrate the shielding characteristics of shaped articles in instances where production articles may later be produced by injection molding.","The method of the present invention may be carried out using FDM or SLS methods known and used in the art.","The fill-in material or materials that may be used in accordance with the present invention may be any filler material of sufficient density and\/or radio-opacity for the intended purpose of the rendered part or component from the three dimensional manufacturing process. Such filler materials include those selected from the group consisting of ferrous alloys (preferably stainless steel ferrous alloys), copper, bismuth compounds (e.g., oxides, subcarbonates, and oxychlorides), barium compounds (e.g., sulfates and titanates), tungsten and tungsten alloys, and boron compounds (e.g., those especially useful in neutron shielding); and any mixtures of the foregoing.","The polymers or polymer blends that may be used in the method of the present invention may include any such materials that are amendable for use in three dimensional printing, such as thermoset polymers, thermoplastic polymers and elastomeric polymers, as well as blends of such materials.","The processes through which the three dimensional printing method of the present invention may be carried out may include selective laser sintering (SLS) and fused deposition modeling (FDM) processes.","The uses and applications to which parts and articles of the present invention may be employed may include radiation shielding, such as the shielding of x-rays, gamma rays, neutrons and EMI\/RFI shielding.","Method with Polymer Composition Mixture Having a Particulate Phase and Based Upon Radio-Opacity of the Product","In general terms, the method of the present invention includes a method of additive manufacturing a three-dimensional object comprising sequentially depositing layers of a thermoplastic polymer composition mixture comprising a polymer phase and a particulate phase, the polymer phase comprising at least one thermoplastic polymer and the particulate phase comprising a radio-opaque material in sufficient quantity, such that the three-dimensional object rendered by the sequential deposition has a radio-opacity sufficient for the desired application which may be determined in advance of manufacture. This may be expressed in terms of radio-opacity or other shielding parameters, such as Hounsfield units.","The thermoplastic polymer(s) may comprise one or more semi-crystalline polymer(s) or one or more amorphous polymer(s).","The radio-opaque or shielding characteristic imparting material may be any material adapted to impart the desired radio-opacity or shielding characteristic and may be from the group consisting of tungsten, barium sulfate, ferrous alloys (preferably stainless steel alloys), copper, bismuth oxides, bismuth subcarbonates, bismuth oxychlorides, barium sulfates, barium titanates, and boron compounds.","Preferably, the radio-opaque or shielding material comprises tungsten in an amount in the range of from about 80 percent to about 97 percent by weight.","The present invention also includes a three-dimensional object manufactured in accordance with this method, or otherwise having the characteristics of an object so produced.","Method with Polymer Composition Mixture Having Metallic Particulate and Based Upon Specific Gravity of the Product","The method of the present invention also includes a method of additive manufacturing a three-dimensional object comprising sequentially depositing layers of a thermoplastic polymer composition mixture comprising a polymer phase and a particulate filler phase, the polymer phase comprising at least one thermoplastic polymer and the particulate filler phase being in sufficient quantity so as to render the three-dimensional object so formed to a specific gravity above 2.5, preferably having a specific gravity above 5.0, and most preferably having a specific gravity above 8.0.","The density-imparting filler material may be any density-imparting material, such as metallic or metalloid materials, and those materials selected from the group consisting of tungsten, barium sulfate, stainless steel alloys, copper, bismuth oxides, bismuth subcarbonates, bismuth oxychlorides, barium sulfates, barium
