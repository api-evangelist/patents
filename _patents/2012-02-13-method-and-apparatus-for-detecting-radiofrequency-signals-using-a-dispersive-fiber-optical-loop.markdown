{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["Governmental Interest\u2014The invention described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government.","Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to radio-frequency communications and, more particularly, to a method and apparatus for detecting radio-frequency signals using a dispersive fiber optical loop.","Typically, public radio-frequency (RF) communications are transmitted at a set frequency so that a receiver can tune to the particular frequency and receive the communications. In contrast, private communications are transmitted across multiple frequencies (e.g., using frequency hopping and\/or spread spectrum techniques). In some instances, these private communications need to be captured by unintended receivers, e.g., law enforcement agencies, military organizations and the like. However, difficulties arise when the communications are transmitted across various frequencies, i.e., frequency hopping is employed, in the form of short RF pulses each broadcast on a different frequency.","Without knowing the frequency hopping pattern, a receiver must attempt to capture all signals in the relevant band. Typically, all the signals within the band are digitized and then processed using a very high speed digital signal processing (DSP) system. Such high speed DSP systems are very costly to manufacture, operate and maintain. In some instances, the band of interest is divided into sub-bands and each sub-band is digitized and processed in a corresponding DSP. Such sub-band channelization enables many signals to be quickly processed in parallel using less expensive DSP circuits (i.e., lower speed circuits). However, even a channelized, broad band receiver is very expensive to manufacture, operate and maintain.","Recently, optical systems have found use in broad band signal processing wherein the received RF signals are used to modulate a light signal and the light signal is processed using optical signal processing. Such techniques, unfortunately, are prone to noise and system instability.","Therefore, there is a need in the art for an improved method and apparatus for detecting radio-frequency signals using optical techniques.","Embodiments of the present invention relate to an apparatus comprising a dispersive fiber optical loop for delaying a first and second sideband, relative to each other, of a laser modulated by a radio frequency signal to create a pair of pulses. A coupler taps a replica of the pair of pulses from the loop. An auto-correlation module, coupled to the coupler, correlates the replica of the pair of pulses with each other producing data points. Each transit around the loop produces an additional replica of the pair of pulses, with an augmented delay between them. A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) module performs an FFT on the data points to obtain a channelized frequency spectrum representing the radio frequency signal.","Another embodiment of the present invention is directed to a method modulating a light with a RF input signal, to produce a modulated light with a first and second sideband, generating a pulse from the modulated light, inputting the pulse into a dispersive fiber optical loop to generate a delay between the first and second sideband, relative to each other, tapping a plurality of time delayed replicas of the pulse from the loop, photo-detecting the time delayed replicas to generate a plurality of RF signal pairs, correlating the plurality of RF signal pairs by correlating each first signal in the pair with a second signal in the pair, generating and storing data points based on the correlating, performing a Fast Fourier Transform on the plurality of stored data points to generate a frequency spectrum.","Embodiments of the present invention comprise a method and apparatus for detecting radio-frequency signals using a dispersive fiber optical loop. Light from a laser is modulated using a received RF signal, which is comprised of multiple frequencies, producing two sidebands. The modulated light is converted into a pulse of light. The pulse circulates through the dispersive optical loop a finite number of times. The dispersive nature of the loop causes the pulse containing both sideband frequencies to propagate through the loop at different speeds for each sideband. As such, after one pass through the loop, there are two pulses each representing a different sideband. For every cycle the pulses take through the fiber, a replica pulse pair is \u201ctapped\u201d from the loop. The tapped pulse pair is photo-detected to create an RF signal; the sidebands in the pulse pair are correlated with each other within an RF mixer, filtered, and then digitized. Once the loop has run multiple times, a Fast Fourier transform (FFT) is performed on the accumulated digitized signals (data points) to generate a channelized frequency spectrum representing information carried by the received RF signals.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","104","106","108","110","112","114","116","118","120","122","123","128","100","130","132","134","100","102","136","102","102","104"]},"The RF input signal  may be received via a conventional RF front end (not shown) comprising, for example, an antenna, low noise amplifier and various filters. The choice of components and arrangement depends upon the nature of the signals that are to be processed. The selection of components and their arrangement is a design choice capable of being made by anyone with skill in the RF communication arts.","The optical modulator  frequency modulates light from the laser  with the RF input signal , creating an RF modulated light wave. According to an exemplary embodiment, the laser  is a continuous wave laser providing light of frequency f. Also according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the optical modulator is a Mach Zehnder modulator. The sidebands created by the optical modulator are separated from the light frequency by the frequencies of the RF signals. For example, if an RF input signal has a frequency of 1 GHz, sidebands would be located at f+1 GHz and f-1 GHz.","The optical gate switch  converts the modulated light into an optical pulse. Optionally, after the switch  and before entry into the loop at switch , a 1\u00d72 coupler is used to send the pulse signal  to another loop. Loops can be cascaded so that pulse signal  is multiplexed in the time domain to many copies of apparatus  for processing longer pulses. Alternatively, a 1\u00d7n switch is coupled to the gate switch  with each output of the 1\u00d7n switch connected a recirculating fiber loop of differing lengths, allowing an operator of apparatus  to select a desired bandwidth for the system.","Once the gate switch  generates an optical pulse , the pulse  enters the beginning portion of the fiber optic recirculating dispersion loop . In an exemplary embodiment, the fiber optical dispersion loop  is 10 km in length and is fabricated of the SMF-28\u00ae ULL fiber from Corning Incorporated of Corning, N.Y. The loop  is recirculating because the loop  enables the pulse  to circle around and re-enter the switch  to introduce a time delay caused by dispersive properties of the loop . Once the pulse  enters the switch , the switch  closes so further pulses cannot enter the loop  causing distortion and noise. A single pulse  enters the loop. This single pulse  comprises frequency components of both side bands. The dispersive nature of the loop causes each side band to propagate through the loop at a different speed. Consequently, a delay is created between the side bands that creates the two pulses separated by a delay, n \u0394t, where n is the number of times the pulse has circled the loop and \u0394t is the time delay formed during a cycle through the loop. According to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the gate switch  is coupled to a plurality of cascaded fiber optical loops (not shown) for processing longer pulses. In one embodiment, each of these loops is of a different length, determining the frequency band the loops can process.","The loop  comprises a coupler  that taps a replica of the pulse  for further processing, discussed below. In another embodiment of the present invention, the switch  and the coupler  are combined as a 2\u00d72 coupler, with a first input for the high contrast gate switch , a second input for the loop , a first output, to tap replica pulses and a second output coupled to the isolator .","The pulse signal  that remains suffers a signal loss (i.e., coupling loss), so it is coupled to an isolator  and an optical amplifier  in the loop . According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the optical amplifier  is an Erbium doped fiber amplifier. The optical amplifier  amplifies the pulse  to compensate for the coupling loss. Often, an optical amplifier  produces reflective pulses, thus the isolator  is coupled to the loop  prevents these reflections from causing interference in the loop . The fiber optical loop  is then coupled to an optical filter  at the laser  wavelength to filter any noise generated by the amplifier . The loop  is coupled to the isolator  for isolating any reflections from the switch . In an exemplary embodiment, a polarization rotator is inserted before the coupler  to maximize coupling efficiency. In addition, an optional second polarization rotator is used in the loop  to allow minimization of polarization dependent effects by not allowing devices in the loop to have polarization dependent loss or gain, i.e., the polarization rotators randomize the polarization of the light propagating in the loop .","The pulse  (which becomes a pulse pair while in the loop) travels around the loop multiple times, with a replica of the pulse  tapped out each time. Due to the dispersion in the fiber, one sideband of the pulse  travels slower than the other sideband. The difference in travel time is denoted by \u0394t, so each loop introduces an additive delay n\u0394t where n is the current loop iteration, between the sidebands in each successive pulse pair replica. Regular optical fiber causes the spreading apart of optical pulses, i.e., dispersion, by approximately wavelength \u03bb. For the nth pulse pair, the \u0394t between the two pulses will be n\u0394t, as discussed above, where",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":["\u0394","t"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},{"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":{"mi":"L","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":"S","mn":"0"}},"mi":"\u025b"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msubsup":[{"mi":"\u03bb","mn":["2","2"]},{"mi":"\u03bb","mn":["1","2"]}],"mo":"-"}},{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msubsup":[{"mi":"\u03bb","mn":"2","mrow":{"mo":"-","mn":"2"}},{"mi":"\u03bb","mn":"2","mrow":{"mo":"-","mn":"2"}}],"mo":"-"}}],"mo":"+"}}},"mo":"."}],"mo":"="}}}},"Here, L is the loop length, \u03bband \u03bbare the modulation sideband wavelengths and Sis a constant from the dispersion relation intrinsic to the optical fiber.

The photodetector  converts the optical pulse sidebands to a pair of RF pulses. The photo-detector  is coupled to an auto-correlation module . In one embodiment, auto-correlation module  comprises an optional RF amplifier  that amplifies the RF signal created by the photodetector , an RF mixing element  and an RF filter . For the npulse pair, the two pulse signals are represented as A cos(\u03c9t) and B cos(\u03c9(t+n\u0394t)+\u03c6, where A and B are the RF sideband signal amplitudes, \u03c9 is the angular frequency of the RF input signal and tis the time. In an exemplary embodiment, a portion of output power from the loop  before going to the photodetector  is used as a negative feedback control for a servo for altering amplification of the amplifier , preventing over and under amplification and compensating for drift in the loop .","The RF signals are sent to an RF mixing element  to multiply together each pulse pair. This is known as an auto-correlation function. In an exemplary embodiment, a square law detector is used as the RF mixing element . The RF mixing element  integrates many pulses over time. The pulse pairs are auto-correlated to help in finding the presence of repeating patterns and periodic signals in the RF input . An optional RF filter  filters the high band frequencies, i.e., a low pass filter, yielding just a baseband signal cos(\u03c9n\u0394t+\u03c6) and the DC signal. A DC block may be used to filter out the DC signal. The baseband signal is coupled to an ADC  such that each replicated pulse pair yields a data point for autocorrelation with a different delay between the sidebands. These points are stored in memory  as data points .","A controller  synchronizes the opening and closing of the gate switch , the switch  and the ADC  as well as routing to any additional loops mentioned in the optional configurations. The controller  comprises memory  and a processor , coupled to the memory . The memory  stores an FFT module  and data points . In an exemplary embodiment, the memory  may include one or more of the following: random access memory, read only memory, magneto-resistive read\/write memory, optical read\/write memory, cache memory, magnetic read\/write memory, and the like, as well as signal-bearing media, not including non-transitory signals such as carrier waves and the like.","The FFT module performs an FFT on the data points from the ADC  to generate a channelized frequency spectrum. In the present invention \u0394t is not constant and is dependent on the frequency of the RF input . The loop  enables the apparatus to create a linear dependency between the \u0394t and RF input  frequency. In this manner, the baseband signal cos(\u03c9n\u0394t+\u03c6) can be rewritten cos(\u03c9nC+\u03c6), where C is a constant dependent on the dispersion properties of the loop . The FFT module  converts data points  from the time domain to the frequency-squared domain, from which the frequency data is obtained using well known signal processing techniques.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","202","204","106","206","108","208"]},"At step , the sideband pulse replica pairs are photo-detected to generate RF signals and then correlated with each other at step . The two sidebands have a time delay between them due to the dispersion in the fiber optical loop. At step , data points are generated by the ADC  to digitize the auto-correlation. The digitized data points are stored at step  in memory . At step , the method determines whether N points have been stored. If N points have not been stored, the method returns to step  to tap more pulses from the loop . If N points have been stored, the FFT module  performs a FFT on the N points to generate a frequency domain spectrum at step . At step , it is determined whether a new pulse should enter the loop. If so, the method proceeds to step  of modulating light from a laser with an RF input. If there are no more pulses, the method ends at step .
