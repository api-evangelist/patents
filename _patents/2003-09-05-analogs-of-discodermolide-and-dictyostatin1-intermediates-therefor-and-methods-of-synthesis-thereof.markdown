No. 60\/408,503, filed Sep. 6, 2002 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/437,736 filed Jan. 2, 2003, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.","This invention was made with government support under grant CA 78039 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in this invention.","The present invention relates to analogs of discodermolide and dictyostatin-1, intermediates for the synthesis of such analogs and methods of synthesis of such intermediates and analogs.","References set forth herein may facilitate understanding of the present invention or the background of the present invention. Inclusion of a reference herein, however, is not intended to and does not constitute an admission that the reference is available as prior art with respect to the present invention.","The discovery and development of new chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer is currently of high importance. Some of the best currently available chemotherapeutic agents are natural products or natural product analogs. For example, Taxol (paclitaxel) is a natural product that is currently being used to treat patients with breast and ovarian cancer among others. A number of analogs of Taxol, including Taxotere (docetaxel), are also powerful anticancer agents.","Recently, the natural product (+)-discodermolide and its analogs have shown great promise as anticancer agents. Discodermolide has been shown to have a mechanism of action similar to Taxol but it is active against Taxol-resistant cell lines and it is more water soluble than Taxol. Accordingly, it may have a different and\/or broader spectrum of action than Taxol and be easier to formulate and administer. Like Taxol, discodermolide is difficult to synthesize. Some syntheses of discodermolide are described in the following papers: Nerenberg, J. B.; Hung, D. T.; Somers, P. K.; Schreiber, S. L.

Accordingly, assuring a sufficient supply of discodermolide is problematic. Simplified analogs that retain high anti-cancer activity but are easier to make are in urgent need.","Very recently, an unusual macrolactone natural product dictyostatin 1 has been isolated from two different sponges and a partial structure has been assigned as shown below. See Pettit, G. R.; Cichacz, Z. A. Isolation and structure of dictyostatin 1. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,430,053; 1995; Pettit, G. R.; Cichacz, Z. A.; Gao, F.; Boyd, M. R.; Schmidt, J. M.

Accordingly, dictyostatin 1 and its analogs show great promise as new anticancer agents.

The Z-diene moiety was introduced by a two-step procedure developed by Paterson and coworkers using a Nozaki-Hiyama reaction. See Paterson, I.; Schlapbach, A. Studies towards the total synthesis of the marine-derived immunosuppresant discodermolide: stereoselective synthesis of a C9\u2013C24 subunit. 1995, 498\u2013500. Addition of the aldehyde  and allyl bromide  to a suspension of CrClin THF produced an intermediate \u03b2-hydroxy silane (not shown), which upon treatment with NaH underwent syn elimination to generate the required Z-diene . Selective deprotection of the primary TBS group, iodination, and then treatment with triphenylphosphine gave the phosphonium salt  in good yield.","The first Wittig reaction of with  provided  (see ). DIBAL reductive cleavage of the acetal followed by Dess-Martin oxidation gave aldehyde . Likewise, aldehyde  was made from via . The second Wittig olefination was accomplished with  as an example and phosphonium salt  (). Tetrabutylammonium fluoride deprotection followed by carbamoylation using Ko\u00e7ovsky's method (See Ko\u00e7ovsky, P. Carbamates: a method of synthesis and some synthetic applications. 1986, 27 5521\u20135524) afforded the C19 carbamate-containing compound . The lactone was built from the methyl acetal in the left fragment by using aqueous 60% acetic acid in THF followed by Dess-Martin oxidation. Deprotected analog  containing a free C3 hydroxy group on the lactone was obtained by the removal of MOM group with 4N HCl followed by removal of the PMB protecting groups with DDQ oxidation. Two additional example compounds,  and , were prepared from the intermediate  by using appropriate conditions. All three of these analogs exhibited significant activity, as shown in  and Table 1. Surprisingly, the C3-MOM-protected analogs  and  showed better microtubule hypernucleation activities than the analog  with a free C3-hydroxy group. As can be seen in , discodermolide is superior to paclitaxel (taxol) in that it causes equivalent microtubule assembly at both lower concentrations and temperatures (the increase in absorbance caused by discodermolide occurs at a time point earlier than that caused by paclitaxel). Additionally, the polymer induced to form by discodermolide is more resistant to cold-induced disassembly than is the paclitaxel-induced polymer. Both analogs  ( () showed these more rapid polymer-inducing and cold-resistant properties, albeit at somewhat lower potencies (for example, higher concentrations of the analogs were necessary for these effects to be detected) than discodermolide. MOM ether lactone  was the most potent among these analogs.","Table 1 shows microtubule stabilizing, antiproliferative, and paclitaxel-displacing properties of \u2013. Again, the lactone, MOM ether  was more potent than the lactol  or free hydroxy  relatives. The cellular activity of  was good, showing a submicromolar 50% growth inhibitory (GI) concentration. This compound also showed considerable affinity for the paclitaxel binding site on tubulin.
