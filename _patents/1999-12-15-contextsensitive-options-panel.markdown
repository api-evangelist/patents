{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The present invention relates to Internet browsing and television viewing. More particularly, the invention relates to a system for integrating Internet browsing with television viewing.","The advent of the Internet has endeared millions of people to the idea of casually browsing for information on an endless number of topics. Until recently, browsing the Internet required the use of a conventional computer system properly configured with the necessary Internet-related operating system components and applications, such as a browser and e-mail program. Unfortunately, conventional computers are relatively expensive and require a fair amount of training before an individual can expertly explore the Internet.","Recent advances in technology have evolved into systems that allow Internet access over a television set with the addition of a relatively inexpensive Internet access terminal. One such Internet access terminal is the WEBTV Internet access terminal, developed and marketed by WEBTV Networks, Inc. of Mountain View, Calif. Such Internet access terminals provide users with an inexpensive and less complicated way to take advantage of the many features of the Internet. However, existing Internet access terminals suffer from several problems. For instance, the user experience is divided into a television experience of an Internet experience.","More specifically, the interface provided by existing Internet access terminals requires a user to switch between a television mode and an Internet mode. The user generally cannot simultaneously access features of both television viewing and Internet use. The only known attempt at integrating the television experience with the Internet experience is simply displaying, in a small window, the current television programming while the use is in an Internet mode. That solution falls short of ideal because the user may have access to Internet features while watching the television programming, but the user does not have simultaneous access to both television mode features and Internet mode features.","Another problem with existing systems is that if the user has browsed away from a home page or a start page, the user does not have easy access to the features made available by the access terminal. For instance, if a user has browsed away from a starting page having an e-mail button, and the user desires to review his e-mail, the user must return to the starting page or otherwise leave the current page. For the unsophisticated user, finding the way back to the starting page can be cumbersome or confusing.","A system for integrating the Internet browsing experience with the television viewing experience has eluded those skilled in the art. Thus, users cannot simultaneously access features associated with both television viewing and Internet browsing through current Internet access terminals.","The present invention provides a system and method for integrating conventional television viewing with Internet browsing and other Internet-related activities. In contrast to existing systems, the present invention allows a viewer to access both conventional television features and Internet-related features from a single convenient options panel. The options panel provides the user with a set of buttons that invokes features of both the television mode and the Internet mode. The options panel is selectively accessible at any time while either accessing the Internet or while viewing conventional television programming.","Briefly stated, the invention provides an options panel for selective use while interacting with a television set having an Internet access terminal. The options panel may have both persistent options and context options, e.g. in the form of buttons displayed on the options panel. The persistent buttons generally react in a common manner regardless of whether the user activates the button while interacting with the Internet or while viewing television. The context buttons react in a manner that reflects a current state of a main window. Certain context buttons invoke one set of features when the main window is in a first mode, such as an Internet mode. The context buttons, or their equivalents, invoke a different set of features when the main window is in a second mode, such as a television node.","In one aspect, the options panel is instantly available and may be selectively invoked by user action, such as by pressing a button on a remote control, the set-top box, or through voice-recognized commands, at any time during a session. When invoked, the options panel varies its choices based on the mode in which the access terminal is operating, for example, either in Internet mode or in television mode. In other words, based on the current mode, the options panel assigns pre-defined functionality to any context buttons on the options panel. Persistant buttons are assigned functions without regard to the current mode of operation of the access terminal.","In another aspect, triggering a context button may cause a second panel to become available. More particularly, triggering a context button on the options panel may result in a second level panel being displayed with a set of features based on the functionality currently assigned to the context button. Thus, two or more second level panels may be associated with the same context button on the options panel. The current mode of operation determines which of the two or more second level panels is displayed in response to triggering the context button.","In yet another aspect, the options panel provides a registration mechanisms, such as via an Application Programming Interface (API) call, through which applications may register themselves with the options panel. In that manner, the applications may provide one or more context buttons on the options panel that react to being triggered in different ways, depending on the current mode of operation of the access terminal.","The many advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the drawings.","One embodiment of an Internet access terminal  in accordance with the present invention is illustrated in FIG. . Terminal  includes a user interface  for displaying substantive content of the session (i.e., television programming or Internet content), and for selectively displaying various configuration and options panels. The terminal  is configured to operate in two modes, a television mode and an Internet mode. As used herein, the term \u201cInternet mode\u201d is not limited to browsing Web pages, and includes other computing activities, such an e-mail usage, chatting, reading newsgroups, executing an application, and so forth. As described in more detail below, the present invention allows the user to transition between each of the two modes with relatively little indication that there are distinct modes.","In one disclosed embodiment, the terminal  is preferably, but not necessarily, a WEBTV Internet access terminal. As shown in , the terminal  includes a control system in the form of an electronics unit, often referred to as a \u201cset-top box\u201d . Terminal  also includes a display in the form of a television set  connected to the set-top box . It should be understood that any display device capable of displaying graphical images, such as a computer monitor, could be used in place of the television . Alternatively, the set-top box  may be built into the television set  as an integral unit. The set-top box  is user-controllable by a selection devices, such as a remote control , integral control buttons. Although depicted as similar to a remote control for a television, the remote control  may also include an alphanumeric keyboard or the like to allow a user greater input capabilities.","As also shown in , the set-top box  receives commands from remote control  via an infrared (IR) communication link. Alternatively, any link that allows the remote control  to provide commands to the set-top box  is acceptable, such as an electro-magnetic wave at any frequency, hard wires, sound waves, or the like.","The terminal  uses the television set  as a display device for displaying the user interface . The set-top box  is coupled to the television set  by a video link . The video link  may be an RF, S-video, composite video, or other equivalent form of video link. Audio signals may also be modulated with the video signals, or provided to the television set  via a separate audio link (not shown).","The set-top box  includes hardware and software for receiving and decoding broadcast video signals , such as an NTSC, PAI, SECAM or other TV system video signals. The set-top box  also includes hardware and software to create the user interface , by which the user can access various Internet system network services, browse the Web, send E-mail, and otherwise access the Internet or control television viewing.","Terminal  may include a standard modem, an ISDN modem, an ADSL modem, satellite receiver, or other communications device. The terminal  connects to the Internet by way of the communications device. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the broadcast signal  and the Internet signals may me combined and transmitted over the same medium, such as over a broadband coaxial cable. The particular media over which the television and Internet signals are received is not important to the proper function of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00031","num":"00031"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["20","20","40","42","40","20","42","42","44","22","42","46","22","48","24","42","50","52","42","32","34"]},"A TV interface  is coupled to the ASIC  to receive broadcast signals, such as an NTSC signal, and provide corresponding electrical signals to the ASIC , thereby allowing video and audio data carried on the broadcast signal  to be presented to the viewer on the television set . More specifically, a TV interface  may digitize the incoming video signal, stored in RAM , so that the ASIC  and the CPU  can process the video signal before displaying it on the television set . The configuration enables the set-top box , for instance, to generate shared screen viewing where the broadcast video signal only occupies a portion of the screen. The remaining screen area thus can be used to display various user interface controls or data, such as video programming information.","Also coupled to the ASIC  is a read-only memory (ROM) , which stores program code for implementing operating system and application software to be executed by the set-top box . Note that the ROM  maybe a programmable ROM (PROM), or any form of erasable PROM (EPROM), or flash memory. An optional mass storage device  may be provided and coupled to the ASIC . The mass storage device  may be used to store software or data. The Mass storage device  can be any suitable medium for storing machine-executable instructions, such as magnetic disks, optical disks, or the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00034","num":"00034"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["12","22","10","12","82","10","10","82","84","82"]},"A button bar  at the bottom of the user interface  provides the user with easy access to items of interest associated with the current operating mode of the terminal . For example, by triggering the News button  the user is presented with news-related information in the display area . Other elements of the user interface  may include option buttons, such as a Web Search option button  and a Favorites option button , for accessing various functionality provided by the terminal . As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the use of the option buttons may take the user to several different pages or screens with which the user can interact. Often a user may become lost after switching through several different screens during a session. The present invention provides a mechanism which may be selectively invoked at any screen or at any time to provide the user with a familiar set of options.","As mentioned above, the terminal  may operate in either a full-screen configuration or a windowed configuration  is a simple screen display of the user interface  in the full-screen configuration. In the full-screen configuration, the main window  occupies the entire display of the television set . However, an option panel  is illustrated at the bottom of the screen display.","In accordance with the present invention, the options panel  may be invoked by a user command, such as by pressing a button on the remote control . Preferably, the options panel  is hidden from view until selectively invoked by the user. The options panel  may be selectively invoked by the user at any time and regardless of the content of the main window . For example, if the user has browsed the Internet to a point where the user is lost or unfamiliar with the page being displayed, or if the user is viewing television programming (such as the example illustrated in FIG. ), the user may invoke the options panel .","The options panel  includes several options, accessible via displayed buttons, that provide the user with access to the features of the terminal in a familiar manner. The options panel  includes persistent buttons and context buttons. The persistent buttons respond to being triggered in a similar manner regardless of the content of the main window . For example, the help button , when triggered, provides the user with an informative help screen to assist with the current task. Although the help screen launched may vary in content, the help button  is persistent. In contrast, context buttons respond when triggered in a manner that may be dependent upon the content of the main window . For example, triggering the Favorites button  while viewing television programming may result in a list of favorite television programs being displayed. However, triggering the Favorites button  while browsing the Internet may result in a list of favorites Internet sites being displayed.","The options panel  also includes a Back button  and a Forward button , which will be familiar to those skilled with Internet browsing software. In the television mode, the Back button  and Forward button  may be alternatively and optionally used to change channel selection. A Settings button  gives the user access to configuration settings related to be current mode of operation. A Go to button  allows the user to input a location identifier or address, such as a URL, and jump directly to a page or location of interest.","When invoked, the options panel  may query the system to identify the current operating mode of the terminal , i.e., either television mode or Internet mode, full-screen configuration or windowed, and so forth. Based on that determination, the options panel  may populate itself with a pre-defined set of persistent buttons, and with any context-sensitive buttons as defined in a setup configuration. The setup configuration may additionally identify the alternative action or features to be provided when triggered. When a button on the options panel  is triggered, the system may update the current operating mode of the terminal  and cause the options panel  to refresh its data. Alternatively, the options panel  may identify when a button is triggered and query the system for the current operating mode.","The options panel  may also provide access to one or more software objects that contain properties and methods to allow a page to change, query, or invoke elements of the options panel . For example, web developers may incorporate codes into a web page to allow the page, when visited, to invoke a method in an object to set the current context of the options panel . For instance, a Web-based Internet mail page may invoke an method in a software object representing a particular context button to alter a property of the context button to reflect the fact that the user is currently interacting with an e-mail service. Other examples will become apparent to those skilled in the art.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00042","num":"00042"},"figref":["FIGS. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["6","7","104","82","104","114","99","99","99","114","10"]},"Triggering the \u201cJake\u201d context button  on the second level panel  may, optionally, call another second level panel  () that allows the user to enter a password or personal identification number . Upon entering the password , the user is presented with an E-mail page  () that shows the e-mail activity for the identified user (Jake). From the E-mail page , the user may perform typical e-mail functions from a button bar , such as write new e-mail , administer e-mail addresses , or modify e-mail settings . It should be appreciated that the user interface elements illustrated in  allow the user to jump to Internet functionality, i.e. e-mail, directly from the full-screen configuration of television mode without having to return to a home page or other starting location.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00044","num":"00044"},"figref":["FIGS. 8 and 9","FIG. 9"],"b":["140","140","82","140","150","150","82","152","153","82","140"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00045","num":"00045"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["10","160","162","82","160","163","164"]},"Also illustrated in  is a Chat context button . In addition to its basic features and functionality, additional features or functionality may be provided to the set-top box  after installation by adding supplemental applications. For example, a chat program (not shown) may be incorporated into the set-top box  to allow users to electronically \u201cchat\u201d with other users via the Internet. The supplement applications may be stored locally, such as in ROM  or on mass storage . Alternatively, the applications may be run remotely, such as via a remote network connection over the phone line , the ISDN line , or the broadcast signal medium .","In accordance with another aspect of the invention, the options panel  provides the ability for supplemental applications to register with the system and provide an additional button, such as Chat button , on the options panel . During an initialization sequence, an API provided by the options panel  may be called to register the supplemental application. Registering the application may include identifying to the system what actions to take in response to identified modes of operation of the terminal . As discussed above, the options panel  may, in one embodiment, provide software objects that contain properties and methods for allowing an application to change, query, or invoke elements of the options panel . The supplemental application may call a method in a software object representing aspects of the options panel  to create a new button, such as the Chat button . The application may, in addition, register with the options panel  information defining what actions to take in response to triggering the new button. That information may associate particular actions, such as launching a chat program, with types or classes of content that may be presented in the main window  or with the current operating mode of the terminal . The information defining the actions to take may be contained within one or more files stored in association with the terminal . Thus, the options panel  may be dynamically modified to reflect supplemental applications, such as applications of interest to the user, or applications supplied by a service provider.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00048","num":"00048"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 11"],"b":["200","10","202","10","99","99","24","99","20","204"]},"At block , the current mode of operation of the system is determined. As mentioned above, the terminal  may be operating in either a television mode or in an Internet-related mode. At block , information is retrieved that defines the actions to be taken by the buttons to be displayed, and\/or their appearance\/position on the options panel . As mentioned above, the options panel  may include context buttons that react in a different manner depending upon the current mode of operation. After the relevant information for each button has been retrieved, the options panel  is displayed at block .","At decision block , the process awaits the selection of an option on the options panel . When a button is selected on the options panel, the action associated with the selected button is executed at block . When the action associated with the selected button is complete, the process returns to decision block  and awaits further user interaction. Alternatively, the process may return to block  if the action affects the current mode of operation.","If at decision block , an option has not been selected within a predetermined amount of time, or if the user has elected to hide the options panel , the process proceeds to block , where the options panel  is hidden. Processing returns from block  to decision block  which, again, awaits user interaction.","While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative constructions, certain illustrated embodiments thereof are shown in the drawings and have been described above in detail. It should be understood, however, that there is no intention to limit the invention to the specific forms disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, alternative constructions, and equivalents falling within the spirit and scope of the invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00014","num":"00014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00015","num":"00015"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00016","num":"00016"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00017","num":"00017"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00018","num":"00018"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00019","num":"00019"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00020","num":"00020"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00021","num":"00021"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00022","num":"00022"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00023","num":"00023"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00024","num":"00024"},"figref":"FIG. 11"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
