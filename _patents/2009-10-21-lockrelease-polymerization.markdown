title: Lock-release polymerization
abstract: Techniques are provided to independently control 3D shape and chemistry of rapidly produced colloids. A pre-polymer mixture including a monomer is made to flow into a channel with insular relief in a wall at a known location of the channel. A stimulus that polymerizes the pre-polymer mixture is directed onto the known location to form a structure locked in place at the known location by the insular relief. A pressure is applied to the channel that is sufficient to deflect the wall having the insular relief sufficiently to release a hydrogel particle comprising the structure.

The Government has certain rights in the invention.","Spherical colloidal particles are ubiquitous in drug delivery, in vivo and in vitro diagnostics, as well as additives in almost every industry (food, cosmetics, paints, etc). The ability of these particles to accurately interact with biological organisms, cells or molecules in a complex mixture or in vivo is useful in both basic research and clinical settings. The vast majority of particles used in suspension arrays are optically encoded latex microspheres with diameters between 0.3 and 10 microns (1 micron=10meters) that can be interrogated and decoded with laser-based flow cytometry (measurement of cell sized particles). Optical encoding is accomplished by swelling the spheres with fluorescent organic dyes with different emission spectra. While recent advances in the field of colloid synthesis have produced anisotropic (non-spherical) particles, the ability to rapidly control three dimensional (3D) size and shape and chemistry independently, has not been demonstrated.","Applicants have recognized a need to independently control 3D shape and chemistry of rapidly produced colloids. Techniques are provided to rapidly produce and use non-spherical colloidal particles with independently controlled 3D shape and size, and chemical properties.","In one set of embodiments, a method for synthesizing hydrogel particles includes flowing a pre-polymer mixture including a monomer into a channel with insular relief in a wall at a known location of the channel. A stimulus that polymerizes the pre-polymer mixture is directed onto the known location to form a structure locked in place at the known location by the insular relief. A pressure is applied to the channel that is sufficient to deflect the wall having the insular relief sufficiently to release a hydrogel particle comprising the structure.","As used herein, insular relief refers to variations in topography of channel wall, which are not both 1) aligned with direction of flow of structures through a channel and 2) uniform in height over a region in the channel where the structure is polymerized.","In another set of embodiments, an apparatus for synthesizing hydrogel particles comprises a body structure having formed therein a channel with insular relief in a wall of the channel at a known location along the channel. A wall at the known location deflects sufficiently at applied pressures above a threshold pressure to release a hydrogel particle polymerized at the known location.","In another set of embodiments, a hydrogel microparticle has an arbitrary 2D shape and relief in a third dimension, and includes multiple non-parallel patterned chemistries.","In another set of embodiments, a hydrogel microparticle has an arbitrary 2D shape and relief in a third dimension, comprising a first portion of the 2D shape and a different second portion of the 2D shape, wherein the first portion swells in response to a range of pH values and the second portion does not swell in response to the range of pH values.","Still other aspects, features, and advantages are readily apparent from the following detailed description, simply by illustrating a number of particular embodiments and implementations, including the best mode contemplated for carrying out the invention. The invention is also capable of other and different embodiments, and its several details can be modified in various obvious respects, all without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive.","A method and apparatus are described for producing and using hydrogel particles with independently controlled 3D size and shape and chemistry. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that some embodiments may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the illustrated embodiments.","Some embodiments are described below in the context of producing and using microparticles having at least one dimension no greater than 500 micrometers (\u03bcm, also called microns, 1 \u03bcm=10meters) with different fluorophores. However, the invention is not limited to this context. In other embodiments, the apparatus is used to produce larger particles or microparticles with different chemistries to detect or quantify or deliver substances to targets or add properties to articles of manufacture such as paints, cosmetics, food and medicine. Example targets include one or more of biological entities such as proteins, nucleic acids, cytokines, lipids, organelles, whole cells, enzymes, antibodies, pathogens such as bacteria, viruses and toxins including those that could be used as bio-terror threats, or any range of chemicals from polymers to small molecules.","As used herein a microparticle is a particle with at least one dimension in a range from about 0.1 micrometers (\u03bcm, also called microns, 1 \u03bcm=10meters) to about 500 microns. The dimensions of a particle size are characterized by a length greater than a width greater than a thickness. A hydrogel (also called aquagel) is a network of polymer chains that are water-insoluble. A polymer is a large molecule (macromolecule) composed of repeating structural units (called monomers) typically connected by covalent chemical bonds. Hydrogels are highly absorbent (they can contain over 99% water) and possess a degree of flexibility due to their significant water content.","Three dimensional (3D) and composite particles have potential uses for distinct advantages as sorting media, smart materials and building blocks for self-assembled structures with complex functionality, impacting fields in drug delivery, composition manufacture, tissue engineering, optics and electro-mechanics. Several methods for the preparation of 3D particles have been reported in previous researches. Some examples are multiphoton fabrication (Kawata et al., 412, p 697, 2001; and Lafratta et al., . Ed. 46, p 6238, 2007), off-wafer fabrication (Tao et al., 1, p 3153, 2006) and the PRINT method (Rolland et al., ., v127, p 10096, 2005). However, such current methodologies cannot synthesize 3D and composite particles on a large scale. Also, they suffer from constraints of morphology and functionality.","For example, multiphoton fabrication is a well-known method for synthesizing micro-scale (10meters) or nano-scale (10meters) 3D structures. Multiphoton fabrication provides unparalleled control of morphology in all dimensions. In spite of the advantage, this direct drawing technique is prohibitively time-consuming. To partially overcome this, it has been used to generate master molds for a soft-molding process. Then particles are fabricated in the molds by injecting a soft material. However, this method has not been used to generate multifunctional particles.","For higher throughput, 3D particles can be generated using a layer-by-layer process with photo resists, well known for fabricating solid state electronic circuitry and microfluidic devices. Unfortunately, the use of photo-resists is not ideal for many applications; the chemistries are extremely restricted, and the chemical patterning is limited to parallel layered motifs. Alternatively, 3D particles can be generated using the PRINT method, where particles are shaped using a 3D mold. However, the shapes of such molds are limited, and the process is not suitable for the synthesis of particles with different active chemical properties on different parts of the particle (called herein multiple patterned chemistries). There exist several other synthesis techniques that suffer from similar constraints on morphology and chemical functionality.","In some of the embodiments described below, a method called \u201cLock Release Lithography\u201d (LRL) allows for the high-throughput production of particles with complex 3D morphologies and composite particles with configurable chemistries, including multiple patterned chemistries. LRL utilizes a combination of channel topology, mask design, and pressure-induced channel deformation to form and release particles in a cycled fashion. Compared with previous techniques, LRL provides a much simpler means to synthesize patterned particles and also gives unprecedented control over 3D morphology, functionality, and composition. As shown in more detail below, LRL can be used to rapidly generate various 3D and complex, composite particles with a broad range of potential chemistries, interwoven or excluded, with incorporated entities including nucleic acids, proteins, living cells, quantum dots, beads and nanoparticles. Among other uses, this technology may provide a powerful means to mass-produce functional units for microfluidic operations, filtration systems, and tissue engineering constructs. In some embodiments, lock and release operations are performed with other stimulations that polymerize one or more monomers, such as thermal stimulation. For example, potassium persulfate can be used as a thermal free radical initiator.","LRL builds on \u201cStop Flow Lithography\u201d (SFL), described in Doyle I and Doyle II. SFL provides hydrogel particles and hydrogel microparticles with arbitrary 2D shapes and sizes and multiple patterned chemistries where the patterns are parallel, i.e., the borders between regions of different chemistry are parallel. LRL enables non-parallel patterned chemistries as well as 3D shapes.","System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["115","112"]},"According to some embodiments, the microfluidic device  includes a channel with one or more positive or negative insular relief features that lock a polymerized particle, and any precursor structures, into place. As used herein insular relief refers to variations in topography of one or more channel walls, which are not both 1) aligned with direction of flow of structures through a channel and 2) uniform in height over a region in the channel where the structure is polymerized. Examples of insular relief features are bumps and pits of any cross section on a wall of the channel. Examples of wall topographies that are not insular relief are rails in a channel wall aligned in direction of flow and constant in height, at least in a region in the channel where the structure is polymerized. When the particle is completed, the channel is deformed, preferably elastically, by increasing the pressure in the channel, until the particle is released from the relief features. Then an induced flow flushes out the polymerized particles. In some embodiments, the deformation exceeds an elastic limit and the channel ruptures, releasing the particles.","The system  includes a microfluidic device  having a selected hollow cross-sectional geometry forming a channel with at least one dimension less than 500 \u03bcm. The example microfluidic device  exhibits a rectangular cross section channel but a wide range of other cross section channel geometries can be employed in other embodiments. In some example embodiments, the microfluidic device channel width is characterized by an inner channel width of, e.g., between about 100 nanometers (nm, 1 nm=10meters) and about 1 millimeter (mm, 1 mm=10meters), with channel walls having a thickness of, e.g., between about 10 \u03bcm and 10 mm, and with a channel length of, e.g., between about 1 mm and 100 mm. The microfluidic device  is configured to accept a stream of a pre-polymer mixture  that is directed to the channel of the microfluidic device for passage through the device. The microfluidic device  is formed of any suitable material. In the example arrangement of  the microfluidic device is constructed of, e.g., polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) or other suitable material. It is advantageous for the material to be oxygen permeable to form a oxygenated layer, as described in more detail below. Therefore, in some embodiments, the microfluidic device is formed of another suitable oxygen-permeable material, such as Mylar, polyurethane, polyethelene, polychlorophene, mercapto ester-based resins, available, for example, as Norland 60, from NORLAND OPTICAL PRODUCTS, INC.\u2122 of New Brunswick, N.J., and porous TYGON\u2122 tubing from SAINT-GOBAIN PERFORMANCE PLASTICS\u2122 of Mickleton, N.J.","The pre-polymer mixture  can include a range of constituents. In an illustrated embodiment, at least one of the constituents is provided as a liquid-phase monomer that can be polymerized by photo-polymerization. In the example system of  the pre-polymer mixture includes a photo-polymerizable monomer and a photosensitive initiator species (also called a photo-initialization ingredient). One example of a suitable photo-polymerizable monomer is poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate, having a molecular weight in a range between about 50 and about 10000 (called PEG DA herein), with 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-phenyl-propan-1-one employed as the photosensitive initiator species. Other suitable polymerizable monomers include 1,1,1-tri(m ethyl propane triacrylate), 1,6-hexanediol diacrylate, and poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate, among others. Other suitable photoinitiators include DMPA or IRGACURE 184 (1-Hydroxy-cyclohexyl-phenyl-ketone), from CIBA SPECIALTY CHEMICALS\u2122 of Tarrytown, N.Y., among others. The monomer stream can also include other selected monomers such as PEG to increase porosity, as well as particles, beads, molecules, porogens, and other species to impart desired chemical and physical properties to the particles. The monomer stream  advantageously includes one or more liquid-phase components that enable passage of the stream through the channel of microfluidic device .","At one or more portions along the microfluidic device is provided stimulation for enabling the formation and polymerization of particles in the monomer stream. For the example of  in which the monomer stream includes a photo-polymerizable monomer PEGDA, at one or more selected points along the length of the microfluidic device  there is provided a source  of illumination  that is directed toward the microfluidic device . The walls of the microfluidic device are preferably substantially transparent to the wavelength of the illumination . Visible light, ultraviolet (UV) light, infrared (IR) light, or other wavelength of light can be employed as suited for a selected monomer species. For PEGDA, UV illumination is a suitable polymerizing stimulation.","The polymerizing stimulation is shaped in two dimensions in correspondence with desired particle 2D shapes. The formed particle thereby takes on the shape of the polymerizing stimulation. For example, interposed between the illumination source and the microfluidic device is provided one or more lithographic masks or other lithographic system for shaping the illumination. In the example of , there is provided a dark field lithographic mask  including one or more 2D shapes  desired for particles to be synthesized. As shown in  the mask can include a plurality of distinct 2D shapes or can include a number of replications of a single 2D shape. For polymerization thermal stimulation sources, the shape of the particle takes on the shape of the polymerizing thermal stimulation, which is often more diffuse and less precise than that provided by the shaped lithographic masks.","In the illustrated embodiment using light to photo polymerize at least one monomer of the pre-polymer mixture, a lens system  is interposed between the lithographic mask and the microfluidic device if desired for controlling magnification, focus, or other aspect of the illumination  directed through the mask. The illumination exits the lens system and is directed to the microfluidic device. In accordance with various embodiments, the illumination is temporally controlled to provide pulses of illumination of a selected duration. A shutter  or other mechanism for controlling the duration of illumination is advantageously provided in a suitable configuration with the lens system  and illumination source . The duration of each illumination pulse is set based on the flow rate of the stream, the polymerizing characteristics of the monomers in the stream, and the desired 2D shape and thickness of a particle. The flow rate of the monomer stream is also controlled, and can be stopped, in coordination with the temporal control of the illumination. The illumination pulses can be provided as a sequence of pulses, each of a selected duration, or as a single long-duration pulse, as prescribed for a given application.","Exposing a pre-polymer mixture in channels of microfluidic device  to a pulse of the shaped illumination  polymerizes mask-defined 2D shaped microstructure particles  (also called microstructures or polymerized microstructures or polymerized particles or hydrogel particles) directly in the stream of the pre-polymer mixture. The illumination exposure simultaneously defines the shapes of polymeric particles and polymerizes the shaped particles. This dual lithography and polymerization action occurs in the continuous phase of the stream; that is, the one or more liquid-phase constituents in the stream operate as a continuous phase of the stream and are themselves polymerized in some embodiments. Thus the polymerized particles resulting from the dual lithography-polymerization action include polymeric material from the continuous phase of the monomer laden stream in such embodiments.","As stated above, flow of the stream can be controlled in a coordinated manner with the illumination exposure to, in turn, control characteristics of the polymerization. The flow rate and exposure duration are preferably together selected such that there is sufficient dwell time of a given volume of the monomer stream at the site of illumination exposure for substantially full polymerization of mask-defined shaped particles in the stream through the full thickness of the channel. If desired, the stream flow can be substantially stopped in coordination with illumination pulse exposure. A high synthesis through-put, e.g., 100 particles per second and greater, can be achieved. The rate can be enhanced further with the inclusion of multiple illumination points along the length of the microfluidic device, in the manner described above, or by increasing the illumination area and the corresponding number of microstructure shapes projected to the increased area, or some combination.","According to embodiments of a LRL method that modifies SFL, the polymerized particle, or a polymerized precursor structure that is incorporated in the resultant particle, is both shaped in a third dimension and locked in place by the positive or negative insular relief on one or more walls of the channel in the device . A polymerized structure remains in place, even if the fluid flows past the structure, until the pressure in the channel is increased to deflect the walls of the channel sufficiently to release the structure by disengaging the features of the insular relief on the walls from the structure, as described in more detail below. The released structure, which may be the composite of several polymerization steps, as described in more detail below, is the particle  produced by LRL.","Once the particles  are released, the particles  advect through un-polymerized monomer stream or other liquid phase through the microfluidic device. A set  of such particles are schematically shown in  downstream of the lithography-polymerization point. The volume of un-polymerized liquid phase constituents remaining in the stream after the one or more lithography-polymerization steps operates to conduct the particles through and out of the microfluidic device . A reservoir  is provided for collecting the output stream , which includes a population  of particles. As can be recognized, if only one transparent mask shape is employed, then the particle population is homogeneous, and preferably is mono-disperse.","The synthesized particles are rinsed in the reservoir or, e.g., taken by pipette into another container for rinsing. For example, the stream including the particle population is taken by pipette from the reservoir into an eppendorf tube, suspended in a buffer with a surfactant to prohibit agglomeration, and centrifuged to retrieve the particles from the stream. The particle population can then be employed for a selected application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 1B","b":["102","102","150","160","162","170","180","182","170","151","160","170","152","162","150","160"]},"Apparatus","The microfluidic device  includes a microfluidic device body  in which is formed a microfluidic channel  which is connected to a particle collection reservoir . At a relief location  along the channel  one or more walls each include one or more insular relief features, collectively called insular relief. Each insular relief feature is either positive (extending from the wall into the flow through the channel, such as a bump or peg), or negative (receding deeper into the wall away from the flow through the channel, such as a pit). The polymerizing stimulation  (e.g., 2D shaped illumination ) from the polymerizing source  (e.g., illumination source , mask  and lens system ) also impinges into the channel  at or near the relief location . The portion of the microfluidic body  between the relief location  of the channel  and the nearest point outside the microfluidic device body  constitutes the walls of the channel  at the relief location .","In an example embodiment, the microfluidic device body  is made of poly-(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS). The channel  has positive relief features in the topography (e.g., posts protruding from the channel ceiling) at the relief location to lock in an array of particles that are formed by 75 milliseconds (ms, 1 ms=10-3 seconds) of UV exposure through a transparency mask using a standard fluorescence microscope. The 3D particle morphology is defined by a combination of the mask 2D shape features and the channel topography at the relief location. Locked onto the insular relief features, particles remain immobilized until a relatively high pressure (e.g., about 5 pounds per square inch, psi, 1 psi=6894.75 Newtons per square meter, also called a Pascal, Pa) is applied. The high pressure is applied to initiate flow of the fluid phases and deflect the channel walls beyond the point of particle release. Any pressure can be used that causes the particles to disengage from the insular relief can be used. Using the automated valve system , the flow is then stopped via pressure release, and the process is repeated; thus allowing the formation of 3D particles in an automated, semicontinuous manner. For more details about the automated valve system , see D. Dendukuri, S. S. Gu, D. C. Pregibon, T. A. Hatton and P. S. Doyle, Lab Chip, v7, pp 818-828, 2007, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein, except for terms defined to be inconsistent with the terms expressly defined herein. The ratio of pre-polymer mixture which is converted into particles to that which is used to flush out the channel between polymerization cycles can vary from about 1:3 to about 1:50. In one embodiment, the ratio is approximately 1:50.","An aspect of LRL is obtaining sufficient channel deformation to deflect the relief features outward enough to disengage the polymerized structures from the insular relief features and release the structure back into the flow. It is advantageous to produce elastic deformations so that the channel can be reused. For thin-walled PDMS channels, the deformation is determined by classical elasticity theory, given by Equation 1\n\n\u0394max\u22480.142\/()\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwhere h is channel height, \u0394hmax is maximum change in channel height, P is the pressure, W is the width of the channel, E is the Young's modulus of PDMS, and t is channel ceiling wall thickness. In agreement with theory, it was observed that particles with 20 micron tall locking structures were released at 5 psi in a 500 micron wide channel, which had a PDMS ceiling (top wall) thickness around 200 microns. For 1 mm wide channels, the equation reveals that 5 psi pressure could provide enough deflection to release 3D particles with relief features of heights up to about 250 microns. To exploit maximum channel deformation and ensure safe particle release, particles were polymerized near the channel inlet, where pressure P is greatest, channels widths were several times larger than the particle widths, and the height of the channel region near the outlet, downstream of the relief location was designed to be taller than the particles. In SFL and LRL, an oxygen lubrication layer of about 1 micron is maintained near channel surfaces to prevent adherence to the channel walls during polymerization and to reduce friction that slows flow through the channel.\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 2A","b":["200","220","222","223","228","220","230","232","240","242","244","246"]},"At or near the relief location, polymerizing stimulation  polymerizes a structure  that engages both the positive relief feature  and the negative relief feature .

Such rails do not prevent the polymerized structures from sliding along the channel in response to small pressures used to propel pre-polymer mixtures through the channel, and thus such rails fail to lock the structures in place at the relief location.

The typical optical resolution achieved in the experimental embodiments described herein was about one micron. Replicating 3D features on a channel wall is limited by the oxygen inhibition layer which is also about one micron thick in the current experiments. Smaller inhibition layers, and hence smaller replicated features, can be achieved by controlling the ambient oxygen concentration.

The disk structure is locked in place in the location  by insular relief (e.g., pegs on the floor or ceiling of channel , not shown).","Taking advantage of the locked structure, supplemental structures can be attached to the structure already formed in some embodiments. For example, at a second time, depicted in , after a different second pre-polymer mixture , with different chemistry, has flowed into channel  from inlet channel (as indicted by a flow arrow) and the flow has stopped (e.g., by closing valve ), a hollow square structure  is polymerized by different shaped polymerizing stimulation (e.g., a hollow square photo-mask). The first structure and supplemental structure are covalently linked if there is some overlap of the two shaped polymerizing stimulations, forming a composite particle . If there is no overlap of polymerizing stimulation, there can be effective mechanical linking in some embodiments, if the two shapes interlock, e.g., using a lock and key motif. When covalently or mechanically linked, the insular relief engaged with the locked structure is sufficient, in some embodiments, to hold the composite structure even if there is no additional relief to engage the supplemental structure. The composite structure is locked in place in the location  by insular relief (e.g., pegs on the floor or ceiling of channel , not shown) over the locked structure and, optionally, over the second structure. Thus, supplemental structure with chemistry 1 is covalently linked to chemistry 2 through mask overlap and UV exposure after fluidic exchange at low pressure. Note that the composite particle need not have a pattern of parallel chemistries. That is, the patterned chemistries can be non-parallel.","When the composite particle is completed with all desired supplemental structures, the pressure is increased to release the particle and flush it into the particle collection reservoir. For example, the composite particles are released by high pressure in both flows.  depicts high pressure in both flows and , indicated by flow arrows from each inlet channel and , respectively.

If there is no previous pre-polymer mixture, the next pre-polymer mixture is an initial pre-polymer mixture to be used at the earliest time. Any pre-polymer mixture may be made to flow into the channel. For example, liquid phase oligomer solution, or any pre-polymer mixture that includes ingredients that impart independently selected chemical properties, or detectability, or mechanical properties such as flexibility and beads and beams, or electrical properties such as conductivity, or magnetic properties, or some combination, is made to flow into the channel with insular relief. In several illustrated embodiments, the pre-polymer mixture includes monomers based on poly(ethylene glycol), as this material is bio-friendly, highly tunable, and can be functionalized with a variety of biomolecules, for example by including acrylic acid in the mixture.","Any channel with insular relief on one or more walls may be used to receive the flow. For example, one or more positive or negative relief features are formed on ceiling or floor or both of the channel for each of one or more one-dimensional or two-dimensional arrays of particles. The insular relief features are formed on portions of the one or more walls where at least one wall, e.g., the ceiling, will deflect in response to a threshold pressure an amount that exceeds the height of the relief feature so that an engaged structure can be released. Thus one or more walls at the location of the relief elastically deflect sufficiently under pressures above a threshold pressure to release a hydrogel particle polymerized at the location.","In step , the flow is stopped, e.g., by closing the three-way valve , to prevent polymerized material from smearing in the direction of flow. In some embodiments, in which such smearing is negligible or desirable, step  is omitted.","In step , the mixture is subjected to polymerizing stimulation in the next 2D shape. If there is no previous 2D shape, then the next shape refers to an initial 2D shape. For example, the mixture is illuminated with illumination shaped with a 2D mask.","In step , it is determined whether there is another component to add to the particle, e.g., another supplemental structure to link to the already formed structure or structures. If so, control passes back to step  to flow the corresponding next pre-polymer mixture for the next component into the channel.","If there is no other supplemental structure to be added to the particle, then in step , the pressure in the channel is increased above a threshold deflection pressure.

In a preferred embodiment, the threshold deflection pressure is a pressure above which at last one portion of the wall is deflected enough to release all particles engaged with all features of the vertical relief.","In step , the particles in the channel are flushed into a particle collection reservoir. For example, after all the particles have moved beyond the relief location, at least a slight pressure is maintained, which is sufficient to move the synthesized particles through the channel. The pressure is maintained for a time sufficient for the synthesized particles to leave the channel and enter the particle collection reservoir.","Particles","A variety of 3D particles were synthesized with unique mask shapes and channel topographies.  is a collage of micrograph images that illustrate hydrogel microparticles with 3D shape, according to various embodiments. DIC image  (with scale bar  representing 200 microns) and scanning electron micrograph (SEM) image  (with scale bar  representing 50 microns) depict square particles  in side and plan view with 10 micron high pillars . These particles were fabricated using a 20 micron high channel with a 10 micron negative dot pattern on its ceiling in the relief location and a square photo mask during polymerization.","DIC image  (with scale bar  representing 100 microns) and SEM images  (with scale bar  representing 50 microns) and  (with scale bar  representing 10 microns) depict square particles  with 1 micron high line-space patterns  having individual ridges  about 3.5 microns wide and spaced apart about 3.5 microns for a 7 micron cycle distance (pitch). These particles were synthesized using a 30 micron high channel with negative line-space patterns on its floor in the relief location and a square photo-mask during polymerization. The very fine 3.5 micron line-space patterns (with 7 micron pitch) demonstrate the capacity of the method to produce particles with precisely defined linear features. These troughs could be oriented with the particle edges or made to be oblique by simply rotating the square mask with respect to the channel.","DIC image  (with scale bar  representing 100 microns) and SEM image  (with scale bar  representing 50 microns) depict table-like 3D particles with 1 micron high line-space patterns on the top and 30 micron high supports on the bottom. These particles were fabricated using a 30 micron high channel with one micron negative line-patterns on the ceiling and two 30 micron deep negative lines on the floor in the relief location and a round photo-mask during polymerization. These particles could not be made by rails, because the orientation of the supports on the bottom is perpendicular to the orientation of the lines on the top. These particles demonstrate that both channel floor and ceiling topographies could be used to dictate morphology. These table-like structures also show large relief support features on one side and a highly resolved 5 micron line-space pattern on the other, demonstrating the ability to combine coarse and fine features into particle topography.","SEM image  (with scale bar  representing 50 microns) depicts micro-cups with 30 micron deep voids. These particles were fabricated using a 60 micron high channel with a positive dot pattern on its ceiling, one dot for each particle, in the relief location. A round photo mask was used for each particle during polymerization. Such positive relief topographies can be used to generate dishes and cups\u2014particles with voids that could be filled with active components or cells.","DIC images  (with scale bar  representing 100 microns) and  (with scale bar  representing 200 microns) depict variants using the 30 micron high channels with the same kinds of topographies of negative line-space and dots on their ceiling in the relief location, but different ring and cross masks during polymerization.","Morphologies generated with LRL can be even more complex, depending on the mold used to generate the channel relief features, and the mask used to polymerize the structures. Molds generated using standard lithography can be multi-tiered, rounded, or slanted. Virtually any channel topography, i.e., relief, can be achieved using multi-photon fabrication. The transparency masks used to generate particles can have virtually any two-dimensional shape, can be grayscale to provide variability in height along particles, and can be used in conjugation with interference masks to give finely tuned micro-porous structures.","An advantageous feature of LRL is that the release time is controllable. Because particle release occurs at a threshold pressure (related to deformation), pressures below threshold can be used, in various embodiments, to exchange the monomer or other component of a pre-polymer mixture without releasing the particles. This allows the subsequent addition of new chemistries in the same or supplemental structures. As such, LRL can be used efficiently to generate composite particles with multiple precisely positioned chemistries.","As shown in , a multi-inlet channel is filled with pre-polymer mixture expressing chemistry #1 and a locked 3D structure  is polymerized. Then, by adjusting the pressures of the inlet streams (but keeping the inlet pressures below about 1 psi, well below the threshold pressure of 5 psi), a second pre-polymer mixture expressing chemistry #2 replaces the first pre-polymer mixture without displacing the locked particle structure . A unique mask is used with the second pre-polymer mixture expressing chemistry #2 to polymerize a supplemental structure  with chemistry #2 that is covalently linked to the locked structure  via overlap. Finally, a high pressure flow (e.g., about 10 psi) above the threshold pressure (e.g., about 5 psi) is used to release the composite particle .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"figref":["FIG. 6A","FIG. 6B","FIG. 6C"],"b":["610","620","630"]},"To demonstrate the synthesis of composite particles with two chemistries, two different pre-polymer mixtures were used, both with poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEG-DA) monomer and one with a fluorescent monomer (rhodamine-acrylate, orange) to easily distinguish the chemistries via fluorescence after polymerization. Negative-relief locks were used to synthesize intricate particles with interior features and borders.  with scale bar  representing 50 microns, depicts a particle  comprising a first chemistry (without fluorescent monomer) in a dark structure and a second chemistry in a light structure due to fluorescence. The second chemistry forms a pattern that simulates two trees with triangular foliage in a frame, called \u201cautumn trees\u201d herein for convenience, because the fluorescence appear orange in color renderings. The six locks at the four corners of the frame and the two tree trunks appear brighter than the rest of the fluorescent region since they are thicker by virtue of the negative relief. In this embodiment there are no locks in the black structure. Thus, the black structure is polymerized after the locked fluorescent structure, so that the locked fluorescent structure can hold the linked black structure in place.  with scale bar  representing 100 microns, depicts five particles .","In other embodiments, similar approaches are applied to any number of unique chemistries. Shown in  with scale bar  representing 50 microns is particle  formed by applying three chemistries. The third pre-polymer mixture to represent chemistry #3 includes green fluorescent beads evident at light spots  in fluorescent micrograph  of . The particles were synthesized using the third pre-polymer mixture of PEG-DA monomer stream with 500 nm wavelength (green) fluorescent beads. In this case, the sequence of polymerization is PEG-DA with fluorescent rhodamine-acrylate, then PEG-DA with fluorescent beads, and lastly PEG-DA with no fluorescent entities. The mask for this last chemistry caused partial overlap with the whole particle to covalently bind to the first formed structures. This particle  is called \u201cspring trees\u201d herein for convenience, because the fluorescence beads polymerized in the triangular foliage appear green in color renderings.","Due to lag times associated with fluidic exchange and mask alignment, the throughput for composite particles depends on how many different pre-polymer mixtures with corresponding different chemistries are applied. As the number of different chemistries incorporated into a particle increases, the throughput decreases. When two chemistries are used, about a thousand composite particles with dimensions of 50 microns were generated per hour. This can be expedited using dynamic mask systems known to those skilled in the art.","The overlap regions of multifunctional particles can be designed to provide interwoven chemistries or excluded chemistries, depending on the pore size of the initial material and the size of entities included in subsequent pre-polymer mixtures. When the pore size is large enough for molecules of a pre-polymer mixture to leech in, the result is an interwoven blend of the two or more chemistries. However, when one or more entities included in the later pre-polymer mixture are larger than the pore size of the existing structure, those entities are excluded from the overlap region, resulting in a segregation of chemistries. Examples of interwoven and excluded chemistries are shown in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":["FIG. 7A","FIG. 7F"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":"FIG. 7A","b":["710","711","712","710"]},"The second chemistry was PEG with the addition of rhodamine-acrylate and 50 nm beads that fluoresce in the green portion of the optical spectrum. The second structure , has a non-overlapping portion expressing both orange and green fluorescence, and an overlapping portion expressing only the orange fluorescence, including less fluorescence at spots where the positive relief causes the particle to be thinner and fluoresce less. As can be seen, the fluorescent monomer penetrated the initial gel structure and was incorporated in the overlap region while the colloidal beads were excluded. The green beads are examples of excluded chemistries during polymerization of the overlap region.","The ability to spatially arrange multiple chemistries in LRL was exploited to prepare particles with diverse functionalities.  includes fluorescent micrograph  with scale bar  representing 50 microns, and DIC inset , outlined for clarity.  also includes inset . DIC inset  shows a DNA detector particle with eight distinct probe regions. The interior region and four wings were synthesized with a first chemistry that included DNA probe #1, while the other four wings were synthesize with a second chemistry that included DNA probe #2. The particles were incubated with target #1 (which was labeled with green fluorescence, FITC) or both targets (target #2 was labeled with red fluorescence, Cy3), at 10 nanoMoles (nM, 1 nM=10Moles) at 37\u00b0 C. for 30 min. Fluorescent image  shows the particle  after incubation with target #1 (green) only. Only four wings are fluorescent, all green in color rendering. Inset  shows a similar particle after incubation with both targets #1 and #2. The green wings are dim and the red wings  are highlighted to appear bright. The fluorescence images confirm that the target oligomers hybridize only with their complementary probe regions.","LRL was also used to generate particles with opposing chemistries\u2014specifically particles with swelling and non-swelling structures. Swelling chemistries were achieved using PEG\/acrylic acid monomer blends which are well-known to be responsive to changes in pH. For example, swelling portions of the 2D shapes were made using pre-polymer solutions of 15% (v\/v) acrylic acid (POLYSCIENCES), 15% (v\/v) PEG-DA (700), 30% (v\/v) poly(ethylene glycol)(200) (PEG, SIGMA ALDRICH), 5% (v\/v) Darocur 1173 and 35% (v\/v) 1\u00d7TE. A particular blend used in the example embodiment is described in more detail in a later section. Particles were fabricated with a cross-shaped support using one pre-polymer mixture, and pH-responsive, fluorescent fins using a different pre-polymer mixture between each arm of the cross. The fins were locked in place by four positive relief posts that thin the structure and decrease the fluorescence.  depicts a fluorescent micrograph  with scale bar  representing 100 microns, of the swelling fins particle . The particle includes a dark support structure with no fluorescence. The fin structure is formed around four positive relief locks that lead to spots of less fluorescence. The fin structure includes bright edges indicating negative relief in the relief location of the channel ceiling where the particles are polymerized.","In acidic conditions (pH about 3), these particles keep their original, primarily 2D, shape as depicted in . In neutral to alkaline conditions (pH about 8), the fins bloom to form a 3D flower-like structure as depicted in  and .  depicts a fluorescent micrograph  with scale bar  representing 100 microns, of a particle  with swelling fins in neutral to alkaline conditions, fins outlined. The particle includes a dark support structure with no fluorescence. The fin structure includes spots of less fluorescence and bright edges as in particle . The swelling and bending of the fins is apparent from the outline of the fins structure .  depicts a fluorescent micrograph  with scale bar  representing 100 microns, of several particles  with swelling fins in neutral to alkaline conditions.","Particles with various encapsulated entities that are organized in complex hierarchies have also been synthesized. Particles with overlapping zig-zag-shaped chemistries were synthesized.  includes fluorescent micrograph  with scale bar  representing 100 microns, and DIC inset , outlined for clarity, of an overlapping zig-zag particle  fabricated as two overlapping structures, using offset zig-zag masks during separate polymerizations. Three positive relief posts  locking the first zig-zag polymerized are indicated by circles  imposed on the DIC inset. Chemistry of a first pre-polymer mixture included a pure PEG DA monomer with a pore size expected to be about 1 nm and 2 micron fluorescent beads (FITC, green) to form a first structure of the particle. Chemistry of a second pre-polymer mixture included a pure PEG DA monomer with a pore size expected to be about 1 nm and 5 nm fluorescent protein (streptavidin-phycorytherin, red) to form a second structure of the particle. The first chemistry is indicated in fluorescent micrograph  as bright dots , where fluorescence from the distinct green beads is evident. The second chemistry is indicated in fluorescent micrograph  as bright areas of fluorescence excluded from the first structure, that appear orange in color renderings.","This process can be used to encapsulate many different entities, including living cells, stimulating agents, organelles, one or more bioactive molecules such as therapeutic drugs, antibodies, receptors, proteins, nucleic acids, or nutrients, among others, with precise control over position. This precise positional control has implications for applications in tissue engineering. Compared to other hydrogel particle-based approaches to engineering tissue constructs, these techniques prepare more precise and intricate building blocks in a scalable and highly homogeneous manner.","Example Materials and Methods.","All of the particles shown in , , and  through  were made using solutions of 5% by volume (v\/v) DAROCUR 1173 (from SIGMA ALDRICH\u2122 St. Louis, Mo.) as photo-initiator, 35% (v\/v) IX TE buffer and 60% (v\/v) poly(ethylene glycol) (molecular weight 700) diacrylate (PEG-DA 700, from POLYSCIENCES INC.\u2122 of Warrington, Pa.). TE is a common buffer solution that consists of Tris (pH buffer) and EDTA (chelating agent) and is often used to prevent the degradation of nucleic acids by limiting the efficacy of nucleases. 100\u00d7 TE is obtained from EMD CHEMICALS INC.\u2122 of San Diego, Calif. and then diluted to 1\u00d7 with distilled water.","For particles depicted in , twenty base pair oligonucleotide probes, #1 (5\u2032-ATA GCA GAT CAG CAG CCA GA-3\u2032) and #2 (5\u2032-CAC TAT GCG CAG GTT CTC AT-3\u2032) were purchased from INTEGRATED DNA TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\u2122 of Coralville, Iowa with Acrydite modifications and mixed into the monomers for a final concentration of 50 micro-Moles (\u03bcM, 1 \u03bcM=10Moles). To distinguish between chemistries for multifunctional particles, 5% (v\/v) food color was added into selected pre-polymer mixtures.","For particles depicted in  through , pre-polymer mixtures for swelling fin structures included solutions of 15% (v\/v) acrylic acid (from POLYSCIENCES INC.), 15% (v\/v) PEG-DA (700), 30% (v\/v) poly(ethylene glycol)(200) (PEG 200, from SIGMA ALDRICH), 5% (v\/v) DAROCUR 1173 and 35% (v\/v) 1\u00d7 TE.","For structures depicted in  and  with encapsulated entities, the pre-polymer mixture included solutions comprising 30% (v\/v) PEG-DA (700), 3.5% (v\/v) DAROCUR 1173, 59.5% (v\/v) 1\u00d7 TE buffer, 5% (v\/v) Tween 20 (SIGMA ALDRICH) with either: 2% (v\/v) orange fluorescent protein (streptavidin-phycorytherin, from INVITROGEN\u2122 of Carlsbad, Calif.); or 5% (v\/v) 2 micron green fluorescent beads (FITC, from POLYSCIENCES INC.) in 5% (v\/v) DAROCUR 1173, 30% (v\/v) 1\u00d7 TE buffer and 60% (v\/v) PEG-DA.","Solutions, 0.01% wt, of the fluorescent methacryloxyethyl thiocarbamoyl rhodamine B (from POLYSCIENCES INC.) in PEG-DA were used to fluorescently label the hydrogel in  through .","Microfludic devices were fabricated by pouring polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, Sylgard 184, from DOW CORNING CORPORATION\u2122 of Midland Mich.) on a silicon wafer containing positive-relief channels patterned in SU-8 photoresist (STANFORD MICROFLUIDICS FOUNDRY\u2122 of Stanford, Calif.). The devices were 1,000 microns wide channels with varying heights (20, 30 or 60 microns) and various negative or positive relief (10 or 30 microns tall) on their ceilings. These devices were placed on PDMS-coated glass slides or plasma sealed to patterned PDMS surfaces after placing thin sacrificial layers of PDMS on the channel alone and on the region of the PDMS surfaces which sits right under the channel. Sacrificial layers ensure that the pre-polymer mixture or polymerized structure, e.g., the oligomer, was only exposed to the PDMS surfaces. The devices were mounted on an inverted microscope (Axiovert 200, CARL ZEISS MEDITEC, INC.\u2122 of Dublin, Calif.). A reservoir was cut in the PDMS to collect the particles; and an inlet hole was punched in PDMS to supply pre-polymer mixture under pressure to the microfluidic device.","The formation of the microparticles was visualized using a charge-coupled-device (CCD) camera (KPM1A, from HITACHI AMERICA, LTD\u2122 of Tarrytown, N.Y.). Images were captured and processed using National Institutes of Health (NIH) Image software or a digital camera (D200, from NIKON INC.\u2122 Melville, N.Y.) and Nikon Capture software.","Pressure was provided by a compressed-air source to drive flow inside the microfluidic channels. To generate controlled pressure in the range of 0 to 15 psi, a compressed air source (about 40 psi) in the laboratory was first connected to either a T3510 I\/P transducer (from MARSH BELLOFRAM\u2122 Group of Companies of Newell, W.Va.) or a Type 100 LR manual pressure regulator (CONTROLAIR INC.\u2122 of Amherst, N.H.). Downstream of the transducer\/regulator, a 3-way solenoid valve (from BURKERT FLUID CONTROL SYSTEMS\u2122 of Irvine, Calif.) was used to switch rapidly between atmospheric pressure (stop) and the input pressure (flow). The output from the 3-way valve was connected to the microfluidic device using Tygon tubing connected to a 10 milliliter (ml, 1 ml=10liters) pipette tip (from BioSciences from LIFESPAN\u2122 of Seattle, Wash.)). The pipette tip was filled with the desired fluid and inserted into the inlet hole punched in the microfluidic device.","The transducer, 3-way valve and shutter were all controlled by a computer using scripts written in Labview 8.1 (NATIONAL INSTRUMENTS CORPORATION\u2122 of Austin, Tex.). The 3-way valve was controlled using a 1024-HLS digital I\/O board (MEASUREMENT COMPUTING CORPORATION\u2122 of Norton, Mass.) and a relay to the computer. The transducer and the shutter were controlled using serial connections to the computer.","Photo-masks were designed in AUTOCAD 2005 and printed using a high-resolution printer at CAD ART SERVICES, INC.\u2122 of Bandon, Oreg. The mask was then inserted into the field-stop of the microscope. A 100 Watt (W) HBO mercury lamp served as the source of UV light. A filter set that allowed wide UV excitation (11000v2: UV, from CHROMA TECHNOLOGY CORP\u2122 of Rockingham Vt.) was used to select light of the desired wavelength and a VS25 shutter system (from UNIBLITZ\u2122 of Vincent Associates of Rochester, N.Y.) driven by a computer-controlled VMM-D1 shutter driver provided specified pulses of UV light. Typical exposure times used were 30 to 100 ms; and pressures ranged from 0.05 to 15 psi.","Example Applications","As shown above, lock-release polymerization, including LRL, can be used to rapidly generate various 3D and complex, composite particles with a broad range of potential parallel and non-parallel chemistries, interwoven or excluded, with incorporated entities including nucleic acids, proteins, living cells, quantum dots, beads and nanoparticles, among other species. The new hydrogel particles presented here surpass the limitations of existing colloidal materials used in a variety of industries. Among other uses, this technology may provide a powerful means to mass-produce functional units for microfluidic operations, filtration systems, and tissue engineering constructs. Furthermore, these 3D and composite particles promise distinct advantages as sorting media, smart materials and building blocks for self-assembled structures with complex functionality, impacting fields in drug delivery, composition manufacture, tissue engineering, optics and electro-mechanics. The new hydrogel particles can be used in drug delivery and diagnostic applications in the biomedical field. They can also be used to improve material properties of food, cosmetics, paints, and any other product which currently uses colloid technology. The colloids can also be used for basic research purposes to increase understanding of the role of mechanical properties in colloidal self-assembly and interactions, among other uses.","Extensions and Alternatives","In the foregoing specification, the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments thereof.
