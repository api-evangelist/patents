The orientation of shared mobile computing device  may be detected and measured by the gyrometer. If the orientation of shared mobile computing device  has changed significantly, In particular embodiments, upon detecting that there is a significant change in the orientation of shared mobile computing device , either by itself or in combination with other types of sensor indications, shared mobile computing device  may determine that it is being shared.","In particular embodiments, shared mobile computing device  may have a light sensor. When shared mobile computing device  is stored in a user's pocket or case, it is relatively dark around shared mobile computing device . On the other hand, when the user brings shared mobile computing device  out of his pocket, it may be relatively bright around shared mobile computing device , especially during day time or in well-lit areas. The sensor data supplied by the light sensor may be analyzed to detect when a significant change in the ambient light level around shared mobile computing device  occurs. In particular embodiments, upon detecting that there is a significant increase in the ambient light level around shared mobile computing device , either by itself or in combination with other types of sensor indications, shared mobile computing device  may determine that it is being shared.","In particular embodiments, shared mobile computing device  may have a proximity sensor. The sensor data supplied by the proximity sensor may be analyzed to detect when shared mobile computing device  is in close proximity to a specific object, such as the user's hand. For example, mobile device  may have an infrared LED (light-emitting diode)  (i.e., proximity sensor) placed on its back side. When the user holds such a mobile device in his hand, the palm of the user's hand may cover infrared LED . As a result, infrared LED  may detect when the user's hand is in close proximity to mobile device . In particular embodiments, upon detecting that shared mobile computing device  is in close proximity to the user's hand, either by itself or in combination with other types of sensor indications, shared mobile computing device  may determine that it is being shared.","A shared mobile computing device  may have any number of sensors of various types, and these sensors may supply different types of sensor data. Different combinations of the individual types of sensor data may be used together to detect and estimate a user's current intention with respect to shared mobile computing device  (e.g., whether the user really means to take shared mobile computing device  out of his pocket and use it). Sometimes, using multiple types of sensor data in combination may yield a more accurate, and thus better, estimation of the user's intention with respect to shared mobile computing device  at a given time than only using a single type of sensor data. Nevertheless, it is possible to estimate the user's intention using a single type of sensor data (e.g., touch-sensor data).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","200","200","280","200","200","280","280","200","280","280","200","280","280","280","280","280","280","270"]},"Of course, shared mobile computing device  is merely an example.

In particular embodiments, each screen or display of the user interface may be implemented as a web page. Thus, the device user may interact with the application through a series of screens or displays (i.e., a series of web pages). In particular embodiments, operating system  is GOOGLE'S ANDROID mobile technology platform.","With ANDROID, there is a JAVA package called \u201candroid.webkit,\u201d which provides various tools for browsing the web. Among the \u201candroid.webkit\u201d package, there is a Java class called \u201candroid.webkit.WebView\u201d, which implements a View for displaying web pages. This class uses the WebKit rendering engine to display web pages and includes methods to navigate forward and backward through a history, zoom in, zoom out, perform text searches, and so on. In particular embodiments, an application user interface  may utilize Android's WebView application programming interface (API) to display each web page of the user interface in a View implemented by the \u201candroid.webkit.WebView\u201d class. Thus, in particular embodiments, software  may include any number of web views , each for displaying one or more web pages that implement the user interface of an application.","During the execution of an application, the device user may interact with the application through its user interface. For example, the user may provide inputs to the application in various displays (e.g., web pages). Outputs of the application may be presented to the user in various displays (e.g., web pages) as well. In particular embodiments, when the user provides an input to the application through a specific display (e.g., a specific web page), an event (e.g., an input event) may be generated by, for example, a web view  or application user interfaces . Each input event may be forwarded to application functions , or application functions  may listen for input events thus generated. When application functions  receive an input event, the appropriate software module in application functions  may be invoked to process the event. In addition, specific functionalities provided by operating system  and\/or hardware (e.g., as described in -B) may also be invoked. For example, if the event is generated as a result of the user pushing a button to take a photo with shared mobile computing device , a corresponding image processing module may be invoked to convert the raw image data into an image file (e.g., JPG or GIF) and store the image file in the storage  of shared mobile computing device . As another example, if the event is generated as a result of the user selecting an icon to compose an instant message, the corresponding short message service (SMS) module may be invoked to enable the user to compose and send the message.","In particular embodiments, when an output of the application is ready to be presented to the user, an event (e.g., an output event) may be generated by, for example, a software module in application functions  or operating system . Each output event may be forwarded to application user interfaces , or application user interfaces  may listen for output events thus generated. When application user interfaces  receive an output event, it may construct a web view  to display a web page representing or containing the output. For example, in response to the user selecting an icon to compose an instant message, an output may be constructed that includes a text field that allows the user to input the message. This output may be presented to the user as a web page and displayed to the user in a web view  so that the user may type into the text field the message to be sent.","The user interface of an application may be implemented using a suitable programming language (e.g., HTML, JAVASCRIPT, JAVA). More specifically, in particular embodiments, each web page that implements a screen or display of the user interface may be implemented using a suitable programming language.
