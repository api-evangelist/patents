abstract: Preferred embodiment flexible and on wafer hybrid plasma semiconductor devices have at least one active solid state semiconductor region; and a plasma generated in proximity to the active solid state semiconductor region(s). Doped solid state semiconductor regions are in a thin flexible solid state substrate, and a flexible non conducting material defining a microcavity adjacent the semiconductor regions. The flexible non conducting material is bonded to the thin flexible solid state substrate, and at least one electrode is arranged with respect to said flexible substrate to generate a plasma in said microcavity, where the plasma will influence or perform a semiconducting function in cooperation with said solid state semiconductor regions. A preferred on-wafer device is formed on a single side of a silicon on insulator wafer and defines the collector (plasma cavity), emitter and base regions on a common side, which provides a simplified and easy to manufacture structure. A preferred embodiment array of flexible hybrid plasma transistors of the invention is an n+pn PBJT fabricated between two flexible sheets. One or both of the flexible sheets is transparent.

No. 61\/365,429, which was filed Jul. 19, 2010.","This invention was made with government support under Grant No. FA-9550-07-1-0003 awarded by the United States Air Force Office of Scientific Research. The government has certain rights in the invention.","Fields of the invention include microplasma and macroplasma generation. Applications of the invention include semiconductor devices, optoelectronics, photonics, microelectronics, and plasma electronics.","Modern electronics rely on solid state materials and solid state semiconductors, in particular. However, plasma-based electronic devices assumed a significant role in communications and display systems in the first half of the 20century. Vacuum tubes were previously used to amplify and switch signals, but have been largely replaced by solid state devices. Vacuum tubes continue, however, to be employed in specialized applications such as in the final amplifier of high power radio transmitters.","Macroplasma devices have also been used in older communications and display systems. One example is the plasma electron tube (such as the OA, OB, OC, and OD series of rare gas-plasma voltage regulators) that was widely incorporated into audio equipment as well as the power supplies of RF transmitters and receivers. Other examples include plasma switches and the 866A and 872 mercury plasma high voltage rectifiers that found application in early RF transmitters. Another example is the Nixie tube, a neon plasma based device that was an essential component of alphanumeric displays for a number of decades in the twentieth century.","Subsequent applications of plasmas to electronics or displays have often required imposing external voltages or magnetic fields so as to influence the electromagnetic field distribution in the plasma. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,765,073 discloses a field controlled plasma discharge display element serving as a light source element in plasma discharge electrostatic printers. The display element includes a pair of discharge electrodes and a third electrode positioned external and proximate to the discharge electrodes for the purpose of generating a control electric field. This control electric field is able to vary the intensity of the plasma discharge and its spatial distribution by distorting the shape of the discharge electric field. In this and other similar devices, a degree of control over the properties of a plasma is exerted by an auxiliary device or structure, where \u201cauxiliary\u201d indicates that the added device or structure is not required for sustenance of the plasma. Soclof U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,399 summarizes typical prior devices that inject electrons into vacuum with a reverse-biased pn junction, and subsequently accelerate and collect the electrons with an anode.","Most commercially available displays are rigid and somewhat fragile. Despite these limitations, large displays such as flat panel TVs having screen sizes as large as >60\u2033 have proven to be extremely successful. It is expected and would be desirable for the next generation of displays to be required to be lightweight (e.g., <100 g\/ft), manufacturable by inexpensive processes at sizes of 10 mand above (to full \u201cwall size\u201d) and, if possible, flexible. Existing large area LED displays are certainly bright but the cost is exorbitant (>$1 k per ft2) and such displays are certainly not flexible.","Preferred embodiments include flexible and on wafer hybrid plasma semiconductor devices that have at least one active solid state semiconductor to region; and a plasma generated in proximity to the active solid state semiconductor region(s). In preferred embodiment, doped solid state semiconductor regions are in a thin flexible solid state substrate, and a flexible non conducting material defining a microcavity adjacent the semiconductor regions. The flexible non conducting material is bonded to the thin flexible solid state substrate, and at least one electrode is arranged with respect to said flexible substrate to generate a plasma in said microcavity, where the plasma will influence or perform a semiconducting function in cooperation with said solid state semiconductor regions. A preferred on-wafer device is formed on a single side of a silicon on insulator wafer and defines the collector (plasma cavity), emitter and base regions on a common side, which provides a simplified and easy to manufacture structure.","A preferred embodiment array of flexible hybrid plasma transistors of the invention is an n+pn PBJT fabricated between two flexible sheets. One or both of the flexible sheets is transparent. The overall array structure is planar, and the planarized structure is sealed between the two flexible sheets. Visible or ultraviolet light is emitted during operation by plasma collectors in the array. In preferred embodiments, individual PBJTs in the array serve as sub-pixels of a full-color display.","This invention provides flexible hybrid plasma transistors and displays that can provide ultra-large area displays and can be manufactured inexpensively. The substrate in the present invention is a flexible material such as plastic, permitting a finished display able to conform to various irregular surfaces. Displays of the invention can be at least partially transparent. Flexible hybrid plasma transistor arrays of the invention are also ideal for gas processing and gas sensor applications.","In preferred embodiment arrays and displays, a plasma transistor, such as a bipolar junction transistor (PBJT), is produced using a flexible substrate. In exemplary embodiments, the emitter and base of the transistor are, together, only \u02dc15 \u03bcm in thickness (i.e., less than one-thousandth of an inch) and very flexible. A preferred manufacture process is a lift-off-process that begins with silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers. Preferred fabrication processes are inexpensive and ideal for transferring the transistor emitter and base, fabricated in a semiconductor, e.g., Si, to a plastic substrate or other flexible substrate.","A preferred embodiment array of flexible hybrid plasma transistors of the invention is an n+pn PBJT fabricated between two flexible sheets. One or both of the flexible sheets is transparent. The overall array structure is planar, and the planarized structure is sealed between the two flexible sheets. Visible or ultraviolet light is emitted during operation by plasma collectors in the array. In preferred embodiments, individual PBJTs in the array serve as sub-pixels of a full-color display.","The invention provides flexible combination semiconductor and plasma devices, including transistors and phototransistors. Devices of the to invention are referred to as hybrid plasma-semiconductor devices, in which a plasma, preferably a microplasma, cooperates with conventional solid state semiconductor device regions to influence or perform a semiconducting function, such as that provided by a transistor. The plasma can perform or influence electronic or photonic semiconducting functions. The invention provides a family of hybrid plasma electronic\/photonic devices having properties believed to be previously unavailable. In flexible transistor devices of the invention, a low temperature, glow discharge is integral to the hybrid transistor. Example preferred devices include hybrid BJT and MOSFET devices.","A preferred embodiment flexible hybrid plasma semiconductor device has at least one active solid state semiconductor region; and a plasma generated in proximity to the active solid state semiconductor region(s).","Preferred embodiments of the invention will now be discussed with respect to the drawings. The drawings include schematic representations that will be understood by artisans in view of the general knowledge in the art of the description that follows. Features can be exaggerated in the drawings for emphasis, and features can not be to scale. Artisans will recognize broader aspects of the invention from the description of the preferred embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","12","14","13","12","16","16","17","18","20","14","22","24"],"sub":["2","2","2","3 ","3","4"]},"Rather than sealing the window directly to the anode, a \u201cstandoff\u201d dielectric layer can also be deposited onto the anode layer and patterned so as to allow gas to move freely from one plasma collector cavity to another within an array of the PBJT devices of . Operation of the device of  involves evacuation of the plasma collector cavity, introducing the desired gas, vapor, or mixture thereof at the proper pressure, and applying voltages of the proper magnitude to the emitter-base and collector-emitter junctions. Typically, a DC or time-varying voltage of approximately 0.1 to 10 V is applied to the base-emitter junction whereas the collector-emitter junction normally requires a voltage >100 V, and is dependent upon the dimensions of the collector plasma, the gas or vapor, and its pressure.","Although not shown in  the sidewalls of the plasma collector cavity, as well as the interior surface of the window, can be coated with a thin film of red, green, or blue phosphor for display applications. The thickness of the phosphor film on the cavity sidewalls will likely be different from that on the window in order to maximize the light exiting the collector cavity. Prior to depositing the phosphor, it is desirable to deposit a dielectric film or a thin stack of films, onto the cavity sidewalls in order to inhibit the diffusion of organic vapors from the flexible substrate (which may be a polymer) into the collector plasma.","Arrays of  devices can readily be fabricated by microfabrication processes that are well-known to the integrated circuit and MEMs communities. , for example, illustrate in detail the fabrication of a device in accordance with  but based upon polycrystalline Si rather than a single crystal semiconductor as in . In  a flexible, non-conducting substrate  is provided. In  a polysilicon emitter layer  is formed on the substrate . The emitter layer  is patterned in . In , a base layer  is deposited and patterned in . In  dielectric  is deposited. In  anode metal  is deposited in a pattern. In , the dielectric  is patterned to complete the device, which can permit circuit interconnection and provide a microcavity opening  that can support plasmas generation.","Another embodiment of the invention is a laterally doped PBJT, which is formed such that the entire device is contained within the device layer of a typical silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer, and the typical npn stack progresses horizontally, along the surface of the wafer. This device also lends itself readily to flexible applications. Formation of such a device is illustrated in .","In  a silicon on insulator wafer  including a handle wafer  a silicon dioxide layer  and a p-type silicon layer  is provided. Trenches  are etched into the device layer  to accommodate subsequent predeposition and diffusion steps in . In , a thermal predeposition and drive are performed, doping the silicon with an n-type dopant  in areas around the trenches . An oxidation in  forms silicon dioxide layer  over the entire top of the structure. Metal contacts are deposited, allowing electrical contact to each of the three active regions (the emitter , base and collector ) in . Subsequent steps can be conducted to form either on-wafer or off-wafer flexible devices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIGS. 9H-9I","FIG. 9H","FIG. 9H","FIG. 9I","FIG. 9I"],"b":["70","56","60","70","72","74"]},"Flexible device fabrication changes after . As shown in , wafer is bonded to a flexible, metallized substrate , and in , the handle wafer  is removed.  illustrates a complete device after a cavity  is etched between the p-type base and the n-type collector and a flexible cover  is bonded to the device layer sealing a plasma medium in the cavity , where plasma  can be generated. Of importance for the flexible devices, is the fact that thin membranes of silicon (such as the device layer) are, in fact, very flexible, granting flexibility to the entire finished device, so long as the substrate and cover are sufficiently flexible as well. The on-wafer devices allow the entire device to be fabricated on one side of a SOI wafer, with fewer processing steps and more robustness than previous designs. The addition of a through-wafer via allows for rapid gas exchange, should a particular application demand it (simple gas circulation for cooling purposes is one example). This design, due to its dimensions, lends itself readily to operation in pressures nearing and even above atmospheric pressure. The increased capability for cooling would make this device suitable for high-power switching, where power dissipation has traditionally been a problem.","The flexible devices in  allow the entire device to be fabricated on the device layer of a SOI wafer, which can be removed from the handle layer, and bonded to a flexible substrate, resulting in a flexible finished product. The ability to switch light-emitting plasmas on and off with relatively low voltages, combined with the flexibility of these devices, allows for the possibility of flexible displays.","An example process consistent with the on-wafer design begins with an SOI wafer having a 15 \u03bcm thick p-Si layer, a 2 \u03bcm thick buried oxide film, and a 375 \u03bcm thick \u201chandle\u201d Si layer. A flexible support (substrate) can also be used to replace the handle layer, and can form a cavity on the other side. Such a flexible layer can be a plastic (such as PET), Kapton, polyimide, or a similar flexible material. In other processes, inkjet printing or screen printing with Si nanoparticle inks is conducted on flexible substrates to form devices having similar electrode patterns.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIGS. 10A-10C","FIG. 10C","FIG. 10B"],"b":["80","82","82","84","80","88","86","90","92","92"]},"To form the anode, metal may be deposited onto a glass substrate and regions opened up in the metal (via lithographic techniques) to allow a window above the device for light transmission and optionally allow for the incorporation of annular ballast resistor. After the metal is removed a thin film resistor is deposited. The anode piece is then aligned and placed on top of the mesa structure separated by a photosensitive polymer layer. This technique is easily transferrable to make an array of mesa based PBJT devices by adapting appropriate photomasks during fabrication.","Another embodiment is the mesa structure PBJT based on an epitaxial III-V wafer where the base and emitter regions are grown and then attached to a flexible substrate. Metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) forms multiple layers of GaAs and\/or AlGaAs with composition and layouts that match device requirements. Each formed p-n junction made of GaAs and\/or AlGaAs is separated by a sacrificial AlAs layer which is later selectively eliminated by inserting into hydrofluoric acid, thereby releasing large collection of p-n junctions, with size being defined before releasing. The released p-n junctions can be transferred and printed to a flexible substrate using deterministic assembly procedure reported by others See, Meitl, M. A. et al. \u201cTransfer printing by kinetic control of adhesion to an elastomeric stamp\u201d Nature Mater. 5, 33-38 (2006); Yoon, J. et al., \u201cUltrathin silicon solar microcells for semitransparent, mechanically flexible and microconcentrator module design\u201d Nature Mater. 7, 907-915 (2008). A large array of devices can be easily formed in this way. The anode piece is later fabricated and aligned on top of the mesa structure in a similar fashion as in the aforementioned embodiment for silicon mesa PBJT.","Arrays of devices as illustrated are well-suited for the fabrication of high resolution, full color displays. The transistors are also amenable to gas phase sensors requiring the modulation of a plasma into which an impurity has been introduced. Fluorescence diagnostics of such plasmas will enable the detection of toxic or environmentally \u201cunfriendly\u201d gases or vapors in air samples, for example. Excimer laser ablation and patterning techniques can also be used to fabricate the devices on flexible, low cost substrates having surface areas of at least 1 m.","While specific embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it should be understood that other modifications, substitutions and alternatives are apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. Such modifications, substitutions and alternatives can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, which should be determined from the appended claims.","Various features of the invention are set forth in the appended claims."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A-9B","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIGS. 9C-9L"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIGS. 10A-10C"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
