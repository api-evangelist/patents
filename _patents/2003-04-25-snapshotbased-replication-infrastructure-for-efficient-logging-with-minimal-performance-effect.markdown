title: Snapshot-based replication infrastructure for efficient logging with minimal performance effect
abstract: A method, system, computer system, and computer program product to provide an infrastructure for replicating data across multiple nodes in a network. Changes to data are written to each of a set of mirrored copies of a log on one node. When a storage area containing a portion of one of the mirrored copies of the log becomes full, the storage area is disassociated from the set of mirrored copies. After detaching the storage area, changes are no longer written to the storage area, thereby providing a stable image of that portion of the log data. Log data stored in the storage area are replicated from the storage area to another node. By replicating from a separate detached storage area, log data are replicated without disturbing the disk heads writing changes to each of the set of mirrored copies of the log.

For businesses which increasingly depend on such information for their day-to-day operations, improving the accessibility and usability of data and preventing or quickly recovering from unexpected downtime caused by data loss or corruption are of paramount importance. After the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon on Sep. 11, 2001, disaster recovery has received heightened emphasis in the business-critical resource planning process, and replication of business critical information has become a top priority. As business data grows, replication of the business data consumes increasing amounts of time of information technology workers, as well as bandwidth on production servers. Replication infrastructures can become very complex to construct and manage.","To increase data accessibility and usability and to minimize the impact of data corruption and loss, a number of techniques have been developed and implemented. One such technique involves the creation of one or more \u201cmirror\u201d copies of data.","Mirrored data is typically generated by duplicating data and update operations (e.g., write operations) from a primary data storage area to a mirror or \u201creplicated\u201d storage area in real time as updates are made to primary data. Such duplication may be performed by software (e.g., a volume manager, operating system, file system, etc.) or hardware (e.g., a storage device controller). The mirrored data may then be used to facilitate failover recovery, load balancing, and\/or to generate frozen images (e.g., snapshots) used in performing various on-host and off-host processing functions (e.g., backups, data analysis, etc.). A snapshot is typically generated by \u201cdetaching\u201d a mirror being updated in real time so that it is no longer updated. Detaching the mirror involves halting transactions being applied to the primary data storage area and to the mirror for a very brief time period to allow existing transactions to complete. A snapshot is then taken, which serves as a frozen or \u201cpoint-in-time\u201d image and provides a logically consistent copy of the primary data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":["FIGS. 1A-1C","FIG. 1A"],"b":["110","100","120","120","104","110","104","120","122","104","120","124","104","110","112","122","124"]},"A snapshot of data can then be made by \u201cdetaching,\u201d or \u201csplitting,\u201d a mirror of the data so that the mirror is no longer being updated.  shows storage environment  after detaching mirror B. Detached mirror (snapshot) B serves as a snapshot of data  as it appeared at the point in time that mirror B was detached. When another update A is made to data , a corresponding update B is made to mirror A. However, no update is made to detached mirror (snapshot) B. Instead, a pointer to the data changed in update A is retained in a data change log , which tracks changes in primary data with respect to detached mirror (snapshot) B.","In a typical data storage system, resynchronization allows snapshots to be refreshed and re-used rather than discarded. A snapshot such as snapshot B can be quickly re-associated with the primary data which it previously mirrored in a process sometimes referred to as a \u201csnapback.\u201d Updates made to the primary volume while the snapshot was unavailable for update are tracked using data change log . When the snapshot is \u201cre-attached\u201d to again serve as a mirror, only the updates that were missed are applied to re-synchronize the snapshot with the primary data. For example, if the storage device storing detached mirror (snapshot) B will be again used to serve as a mirror for production data, an update applying the change made in update A would be applied to snapshot B before other updates are made.","In , mirrors (e.g., mirror A and detached mirror B) are used to facilitate failover recovery and provide consistent access to a frozen image of primary data . Following a failure of storage area  after which data  is no longer accessible, mirror A residing on mirror data storage area  may be used in place of primary data  to ensure the availability of data stored within storage environment . Updates (e.g., update ) are subsequently performed on mirror A with no corresponding updates being done on data  (which is inaccessible due to failure) or detached mirror  (which is being maintained as a read-only, point-in-time image of primary data ).","While the failover recovery technique may be used to provide access to both point-in-time and real-time or \u201clive\u201d images of primary data following the failure of an associated storage area, it requires the creation and maintenance of at least one duplicate mirror of primary data. Conventional storage environments may include additional mirrors to avoid dependency on a single data mirror in the event of such a failure, thereby increasing the amount of resources necessary to provide such functionality. Consequently, using mirrors for failover and disaster recovery has some undesirable characteristics.","While snapshot technology enables point-in-time images of data to be maintained on a single node, replicating the data to different nodes for disaster recovery purposes introduces another level of complexity. Storage space must be managed at multiple sites, and large amounts of data must be transferred across a network without disrupting the business activities of the organization or degrading performance of business-critical systems. Complex storage configurations on one node require corresponding complex storage configurations on replication nodes.","What is needed is a system that efficiently replicates data shared by multiple nodes without degrading the performance of the application writing the data.","A method, system, application programming interface, computer system and computer program product to provide an infrastructure for replicating data across multiple nodes in a network. Changes to data are written to a log, wherein the log comprises a set of mirrored copies of log data on one node. Each change is written to each mirrored copy of the log. When a storage area containing a portion of one of the mirrored copies of the log becomes full, the storage area is \u201cdetached,\u201d or disassociated, from the set of mirrored copies. After detaching the storage area, changes are no longer written to the storage area, thereby providing a stable image of that portion of the log data. Log data stored in the storage area are then replicated from the storage area to another node. By replicating from a separate detached storage area, log data are replicated without disturbing the disk heads writing changes to each of the set of mirrored copies of the log.","When the replication is complete, the storage area can be added back to store the set of mirrored copies, or the storage area can be added to a free pool from which storage resources are obtained as needed. As a complete mirrored copy of the log is replicated, storage areas are recycled from the free pool and\/or reused as storage devices within the mirrors to ensure continuous logging of changes to data.","This form of replication enables log data to be read from a stable copy of the log dedicated to providing log data for reading. Log data are written to a copy of the log dedicated to receiving continuous updates to log data. The head positions on the logging disks are not disturbed because reads do not intermingle with writes. This approach provides ideal logging conditions that tolerate minimal, if any, delays to access data and achieve sequential input\/output (I\/O) accesses on data logging. Snapshot technology can be used to minimize I\/O delays in the application, and including snapshot functionality in a replication appliance can produce an efficient, shared and scalable data replication engine.","The use of the same reference symbols in different drawings indicates similar or identical items.","For a thorough understanding of the subject invention, refer to the following Detailed Description, including the appended Claims, in connection with the above-described Drawings. Although the present invention is described in connection with several embodiments, the invention is not intended to be limited to the specific forms set forth herein. On the contrary, it is intended to cover such alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as can be reasonably included within the scope of the invention as defined by the appended Claims.","In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the invention can be practiced without these specific details.","References in the specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d or \u201can embodiment\u201d means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the invention. The appearances of the phrase \u201cin one embodiment\u201d in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment, nor are separate or alternative embodiments mutually exclusive of other embodiments. Moreover, various features are described which may be exhibited by some embodiments and not by others. Similarly, various requirements are described which may be requirements for some embodiments but not other embodiments.","The present invention efficiently replicates logs of changes to data shared by nodes in a multi-node environment. Very efficient logging and snapshots are integrated with a replication appliance capable of replicating file level, block level, and\/or disk level copies of data. The replication infrastructure, combined with storage area management functionality, centralizes replication services in a Storage Area Network.","In a mirroring environment such as that described in , often a log is used to track changes made to data to facilitate recovery in the event of a system failure. This log identifies regions of data that are being updated as the update occurs. If a system failure occurs during the update, the log identifies regions that were being changed so that only those regions can be synchronized to restore consistency between the mirrored copies of data. It is not necessary to make a complete copy of the data to synchronize the mirrored copies of the data. When the given update is successfully completed, the log can be cleared, indicating that those regions are no longer targeted for update.","Rather than replicating a complete set of mirrored data to each node during a given replication cycle, typically an initial set of data is replicated to each node, and thereafter, only data corresponding to entries in the log are replicated. To maintain consistency of the mirrored copies, changes to the data are written to the log in the same order on each node. To replicate the log, a replication program reads the log to identify the data to be replicated, and then replicates the data from one node to another.","This form of replication, which intermingles reads and writes to the log, disturbs the head positions on the logging disks. If a large number of changes to data are being made, this form of replication can result in head thrashing and significant delays in production application I\/O accesses.","Ideal logging conditions tolerate minimal, if any, delays to access data and achieve sequential I\/O accesses on data logging. Snapshot technology can be used to minimize I\/O delays in the application, and including snapshot functionality in a replication appliance can produce an efficient, shared and scalable data replication engine.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","210","210","210","240","210","210","210","240","212","212","212","210","210","210"]},"Replication appliance  resides in a storage area network . In the embodiment shown, replication appliance  uses replication hosts A and B to replicate data to replication sites . One of skill in the art will understand that replication hosts are not necessary to operation of the invention, and that replication appliance  may directly replicate data to replication sites . Replication appliance , operating with or without replication hosts A and B, can be considered to be a replication module, means, or instructions.","One of skill in the art will understand that three-way mirrored volume  is only an example embodiment of the log stored as a set of mirrored copies. The log may have only two mirrors, or the log may have more than three mirrors. Preferably, the log has at least three mirrors, as shown in three-way mirrored volume  mirrors M, M, and M. Three mirrors allow one mirror to serve as the primary copy of the data, a second mirror to store a duplicate of the primary data for purposes of reliability, and the third mirror to be detached and used for replication.","The third mirror M is constructed from several storage areas, including storage areas SA, SA, SA, and SA, which correspond to physical disk spindles in one embodiment. The storage areas are obtained to form mirror M from a free pool , with additional storage areas, such as storage areas SA, SA, SA, and SA in free pool  remaining unused. As indicated by the \u201crecycle\u201d arrow between three-way mirrored volume  and free pool , storage areas can be recycled to be used as storage for a portion of the mirror used for replicating data.","After becoming full, storage area SA is detached from the set of storage areas in mirror M to form snap disk . Detaching a storage area, as described with reference to  above, includes discontinuing writes of subsequent changes to the storage area and disassociating the storage area from the set of mirrored copies of the data. Detaching a storage area avoids disturbance of further log write activity by allowing data to be read from the detached storage area for replicating the data in the storage area, rather than from the set of mirrored copies of the data. Disk head thrashing is eliminated and application I\/O delays are minimized. The functionality for detaching a storage area can be described as a detaching or disassociating module, means, or instructions, and may be part of three-way mirrored volume  and\/or controlled by replication appliance .","After being detached, snap disk  is not updated as subsequent updates to mirror M are made. Snap disk  serves as a stable copy of data on three-way mirrored volume  from which log data can be replicated. As logging to mirror M proceeds, other storage areas of mirror M, such as storage areas SA, SA, and SA, can be detached one by one, holding the contents for replication.","As shown by the arrows in mirrors M and M, data are written to each mirrored copy from beginning to end in sequential order. Similarly, in mirror , storage areas SA through SA are sequentially written, with each storage area becoming full before data are written to the next storage area.","When logging completes one full cycle such that a complete copy of the mirror, in this case M, is made, the detached storage area, here snap disk , is checked to determine whether all of its contents have been successfully sent to remote replication sites . If the contents have been successfully replicated, then the detached storage area SA is attached back to its original logical offset in the three-way mirrored volume . Mirrored log writes continue as parallel writes to three mirrors. The functionality for re-attaching a detached storage area can be described as an adding module, means or instructions.","If some of the contents of snap disk  are still pending completion of replication, another storage area is chosen from free pool  to attach to the position previously occupied by storage area SA in three-way mirrored volume . This approach enables logging to be resumed as quickly as possible to three mirrors, without the application having to wait for log entries to be cleared and without a fear of overwriting log entries. The functionality for adding a storage area from the free pool can be described as an adding module, means or instructions.","Storage areas continue recycling to free pool  as their contents are entirely replicated to remote sites. Storage areas can then be returned to a mirror to store mirrored copies of log data until logging again fills the storage area. The size of free pool  is governed by the parity between the rate of data transfer to remote replication sites  and the rate of I\/O generation by hosts A, B, and C sharing replication appliance .","In one embodiment, replication appliance  is a commercially available product, such as VERITAS SAN-box (block server) produced by Veritas Software Corporation of Mountain View, Calif. In this embodiment, replication appliance  exports a single device node (not shown) to hosts A, B and C as a logging device. A single replication appliance shared among several production hosts reduces management overhead and associated costs.","Production hosts A, B, and C use the exported device for sending I\/O to remote replication sites . Replication appliance  accesses snap disk  via connection  and three-way mirrored volume  via connection  and provides pointers to the data to be replicated to replication hosts A and B.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["310","320","310","310"]},"If the storage area currently being written in the replication mirror is full at \u201cStorage Area Full\u201d decision point , control proceeds to \u201cDisassociate Storage Area from Set of Mirrored Copies\u201d step . In this step, the storage area is disassociated from the set of mirrored copies so that subsequent writes to the log are not written to the storage area. This disassociation and discontinuance of writing data to this copy of the log is also referred to as \u201cdetaching\u201d a portion of the mirror from the log. Control then proceeds to \u201cReplicate Data from Disassociated Storage Area\u201d step , where data from the disassociated storage area provide a stable copy of the log that can be replicated to other nodes.","When replication is complete, control proceeds from \u201cReplicate Data from Disassociated Storage Area\u201d step  to \u201cEntire Mirror Replicated\u201d decision point . If the entire mirror has been replicated, including the storage area just detached for replication, control proceeds to \u201cReturn Storage Area to Active Mirror\u201d step , where the storage area is attached back to its original logical offset in the mirrored log, such as SA in three-way mirrored volume  of .","If the contents of the entire mirror have not been replicated at \u201cEntire Mirror Replicated\u201d decision point , control proceeds to \u201cObtain Storage Area from Free Pool to Store Data in Mirrored Log\u201d step . This new storage area is used to log data, for example, when the data from storage area SA have not completed replication and storage area SA becomes full and replication of the data completes. Log data can continue to be written to three mirrors using the new storage area while storage area SA continues to be replicated.","Any object, such as a file, volume or disk, can be replicated by replication appliance . The object type information can be stored in a control section of the I\/O packet followed by data to be replicated, as defined in a log entry definition. In one embodiment, replication appliance  exports a logging device as a fiber channel\/SCSI device. In this embodiment, logging provides very low latency storage due to the undisturbed flow of writes that would otherwise occur in conventional logging devices. By careful use of such features as mirroring and striping, where data are spread across several disks, in the logging device, very high bandwidth storage can be achieved in a multi-host environment in which the hosts share data.","By deploying the replication infrastructure  at the remote sites, such as at replication sites , a transparent mechanism of replication can be achieved and numerous host cycles can be saved. During file level replication in a clustering environment, remote replication sites  can deploy a clustering file system product to apply file-level changes at the remote replication sites .","Using the present invention, replication technologies scattered among products can be consolidated to provide a single point of replication for a variety of objects such as files, disks, and volumes. Re-use of available component technologies enables high performance, scalable, shared appliances to be created for complex environments.","Replication of data logs using snapshots can be implemented in a multi-node environment using a variety of computer systems and networks.
