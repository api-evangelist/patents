Cross reference is also made to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/172,347 entitled \u201cHybrid Biologic-Synthetic Bioabsorbable Scaffolds\u201d which was filed on Jun. 14, 2002, which is assigned to the same assignee as the present application, and which is hereby incorporated by reference.","Articular cartilage is a type of hyaline cartilage that lines the surfaces of the opposing bones in a diarthrodial joint (e.g. knee, hip, shoulder, etc.). Articular cartilage provides a near-frictionless articulation between the bones, while also functioning to absorb and transmit the compressive and shear forces encountered in the joint. Further, since the tissue associated with articular cartilage is aneural, these load absorbing and transmitting functions occur in a painless fashion in a healthy joint.","Fibrocartilage is found in diarthrodial joints, symphyseal joints, intervertebral discs, articular discs, as inclusions in certain tendons that wrap around a pulley, and at insertion sites of ligaments and tendons into bone. Made of a mixture of collagen type I and type II fibers, fibrocartilage can also be damaged, causing pain in the affected joint. It is understood for purposes of this application that the term \u201ccartilage\u201d includes articular cartilage and fibrocartilage.","When cartilage tissue is no longer healthy it can cause debilitating pain in the joint. For example, articular cartilage health can be affected by disease, aging, or trauma, all of which primarily involve a breakdown of the matrix consisting of a dense network of proteoglycan aggregates, collagen fibers, and other smaller matrix proteins. Tissue cells are unable to induce an adequate healing response because they are unable to migrate, being enclosed in lacunae surrounded by a dense matrix. Further, since the tissue is avascular, initiation of healing by circulating cells is limited. Similarly, damage or degeneration of knee fibrocartilage i.e. the menisci, is a common occurrence. A damaged or degenerated meniscus has little ability to heal or repair itself because the pathology frequently occurs in the avascular part of the tissue.","Several articular cartilage repair strategies have been attempted in the past. These include surgical techniques such as microfracturing or performing abrasion arthroplasty on the bone bed to gain vascular access, and hence, stimulate extrinsic repair in the defective region. The long-term outcome of these techniques, however, has been known to result in mechanically inferior fibrocartilagenous tissue.","Another surgical technique is mosaicplasty or osteochondral autograft transfer system (OATS). In this case, cylindrical plugs of healthy articular cartilage from a low-load bearing region of the knee are taken and transplanted into the defective region. This technique, however, can result in excessive donor-site morbidity and associated pain. Additionally, surgeons have reported that the gaps between the round transplants are frequently filled with fibrocartilage which can eventually erode away, thus potentially compromising the integrity of repair throughout the affected area.","The only FDA-approved cartilage treatment product in the market involves autologous chondrocyte implantation (CartiCel\u2122). Autologous chondrocyte implantation involves performing an initial biopsy of healthy cartilage from the patient, isolating the cells from the tissue, expanding the cells in vitro by passaging them in culture, and then reintroducing the cells into the defective area. The cells are retained within the defect by applying a periosteal tissue patch over the defect, suturing the edges of the patch to the host tissue, and then sealing with fibrin glue. The efficacy of this expensive procedure, however, has recently been put into question by studies that have shown that only a few of the injected cells are retained within the defect and that they may not significantly contribute to the repair process. The healing observed is similar to that observed with microfracture or abrasion of the bone bed, suggesting that it is the preparation of the bone bed and not the introduction of the cells that facilitates the healing process.","Tissue engineering strategies for healing cartilage are being investigated by several academic and commercial teams and show some promise. One approach primarily involves using a carrier or a scaffold to deliver cells or stimulants to the defect site. The scaffold material can be a purified biologic polymer in the form of a porous scaffold or a gel (purified collagens, glycoproteins, proteoglycans, polysaccharides, or the like in various combinations) or porous scaffolds of synthetic biodegradable polymers (PLA, PGA, PDO, PCL, or the like, in various combinations). Several challenges remain with this approach, however. Some of these challenges include retention of the active stimulant at the defect site, inability to control the rate of release of the stimulant (resulting in tissue necrosis due to overdose), and cytotoxicity of the cells due to the degradation by-products of the synthetic polymers.","In another technique, various collagen scaffolds have been used to provide a scaffold for repair and regeneration of damaged cartilage tissue. U.S. Pat. No. 6,042,610 to ReGen Biologics, hereby incorporated by reference, discloses the use of a device to regenerate meniscal fibrocartilage. The disclosed device comprises a bioabsorbable material made at least in part from purified collagen and glycosaminoglycans (GAG). Purified collagen and glycosaminoglycans are colyophilized to create a foam and then cross-linked to form the device. The device can be used to provide augmentation for a damaged meniscus. Related U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,735,903, 5,479,033, 5,306,311, 5,007,934, and 4,880,429 also disclose a meniscal augmentation device for establishing a scaffold adapted for ingrowth of meniscal fibrochondrocyts.","It is also known to use naturally occurring extracellular matrices (ECMs) to provide a scaffold for tissue repair and regeneration. One such ECM is small intestine submucosa (SIS). SIS has been described as a natural biomaterial used to repair, support, and stabilize a wide variety of anatomical defects and traumatic injuries. See, for example, Cook\u00ae Online New Release provided by Cook Biotech at \u201cwww.cookgroup.com\u201d. The SIS material is reported to be a naturally-occurring collageneous matrix derived from porcine small intestinal submucosa that models the qualities of its host when implanted in human soft tissues. Further, it is taught that the SIS material provides a natural matrix with a three-dimensional structure and biochemical composition that attracts host cells and supports tissue remodeling. SIS products, such as Oasis material and Surgisis material, are commercially available from Cook Biotech, Bloomington, Ind.","An SIS product referred to as RESTORE Orthobiologic Implant is available from DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. in Warsaw, Indiana. The DePuy product is described for use during rotator cuff surgery, and is provided as a resorbable framework that allows the rotator cuff tendon to regenerate itself. The RESTORE Implant is derived from porcine small intestine submucosa that has been cleaned, disinfected, and sterilized. Small intestine submucosa (SIS) has been described as a naturally-occurring ECM composed primarily of collagenous proteins. Other biological molecules, such as growth factors, glycosaminoglycans, etc., have also been identified in SIS. See Hodde et al., Tissue Eng. 2(3): 209-217 (1996); Voytik-Harbin et al., J. Cell Biochem., 67:478-491 (1997); McPherson and Badylak, Tissue Eng., 4(1): 75-83 (1998); Hodde et al., Endothelium, 8(1):11-24 (2001); Hodde and Hiles, Wounds, 13(5): 195-201 (2001); Hurst and Bonner, J. Biomater. Sci. Polym. Ed., 12(11) 1267-1279 (2001); Hodde et al., Biomaterial, 23(8): 1841-1848 (2002); and Hodde, Tissue Eng., 8(2): 295-308 (2002), all of which are incorporated by reference herein. During seven years of preclinical testing in animals, there were no incidences of infection transmission from the implant to the host, and the SIS material has not decreased the systemic activity of the immune system. See Allman et al., Transplant, 17(11): 1631-1640 (2001); Allman et al., Tissue Eng., 8(1): 53-62 (2002).","Whilesmall intestine submucosa is available, other sources of submucosa are known to be effective for tissue remodeling. These sources include, but are not limited to, stomach, bladder, alimentary, respiratory, or genital submucosa, or liver basement membrane. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,171,344, 6,099,567, and 5,554,389, hereby incorporated by reference. Further, while SIS is most often porcine derived, it is known that these various submucosa materials may be derived from non-porcine sources, including bovine and ovine sources. Additionally, other collageneous matrices are known, for example lamina propria and stratum compactum.","For the purposes of this invention, it is within the definition of a naturally occurring ECM to clean, delaminate, and\/or comminute the ECM, or even to cross-link the collagen fibers within the ECM. It is also within the definition of naturally occurring ECM to fully or partially remove one or more sub-components of the naturally occurring ECM. However, it is not within the definition of a naturally occurring ECM to extract and purify the natural collagen or other components or sub-components of the ECM and reform a matrix material from the purified natural collagen or other components or sub-components of the ECM. Thus, while reference is made to SIS, it is understood that other naturally occurring ECMs are within the scope of this invention. Thus, in this application, the terms \u201cnaturally occurring extracellular matrix\u201d or \u201cnaturally occurring ECM\u201d are intended to refer to extracellular matrix material that has been cleaned, disinfected, sterilized, and optionally cross-linked. The terms \u201cnaturally occurring ECM\u201d and \u201cnaturally occurring extracellular matrix\u201d are also intended to include foam material made from naturally occurring ECM as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/195,354 entitled \u201cPorous Extracellular Matrix Scaffold and Method\u201d, the toughened material made from naturally occurring ECM as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/195,795 entitled \u201cMeniscus Regeneration Device and Method\u201d, and the hardened material made from naturally occurring ECM as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/195,719 entitled \u201cDevices from Naturally Occurring Biologically Derived Materials\u201d, all filed concurrently herewith and incorporated by reference.","The following patents, hereby incorporated by reference, disclose the use of ECMs for the regeneration and repair of various tissues: U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,379,710; 6,334,872; 6,187,039; 6,176,880; 6,126,686; 6,099,567; 6,096,347; 5,997,575; 5,993,844; 5,968,096; 5,955,110; 5,922,028; 5,885,619; 5,788,625; 5,733,337; 5,762,966; 5,755,791; 5,753,267; 5,711,969; 5,645,860; 5,641,518; 5,554,389; 5,516,533; 5,460,962; 5,445,833; 5,372,821; 5,352,463; 5,281,422; and 5,275,826.","It is also known to promote cartilage growth using glycosaminoglycans (GAG), such as hyaluronic acid (HA), dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfates, keratin sulfate, etc. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,251,876 and 6,288,043, hereby incorporated by reference. GAGs are naturally found mostly in the extracellular matrix and on the cell surface as proteoglycans. These macromolecules are secreted by cells and play a role in both signal transduction and storage of some growth factors. In addition to the biological functions, the viscoelastic properties of GAGs provide a mechanical function by providing lubrication within a joint, to decrease friction. Hyaluronic acid is a natural component of the extracellular matrix of most cartilage tissues. HA is a linear polymer made up of repeating GAG disaccharide units of Dglucuronic acid and N-acetylglycosamine in \u03b2(1-3)and \u03b2(1-4) linkages. Illustratively HA can have a molecular weight ranging from about 300,000 kDa to about 6,000,000 kDa and can be uncrosslinked, naturally crosslinked, or crosslinked using mechanical, chemical, or enzymatic methods. The effect of treating extrasynovial tendons with HA and chemically modified HA has also been studied with reference to tendon gliding resistance and tendon adhesions to surrounding tissue after repair. Momose, Amadio, Sun, Chunfeng Zhao, Zobitz, Harrington and An, \u201cSurface Modification of Extrasynovial Tendon by Chemically Modified Hyaluronic Acid Coating,\u201d J. Biomed. Mater. Res. 59: 219-224 (2002).","It has been found that the combination of SIS and HA produces a synergistic effect in cartilage repair. Healing rates and\/or quantity of healing is better than the healing expected from additive effects of SIS and HA alone. Additionally, it has been found that retention of the HA at the defect site is not problematic when used with an ECM scaffold, and co-administration of the ECM and HA does not require the HA to be crosslinked to the ECM material. Thus, the present invention provides methods for the repair of damaged or diseased cartilagenous tissue, wherein an ECM material and HA are co-administered to the cartilagenous tissue defect.","In addition to HA, GAGs such as dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate and keratan sulfate are also expected to be usable with the present invention. As used herein, \u201cbiological lubricant\u201d is used to identify the aforementioned materials and others such as synovial fluid and components thereof, including mucinous glycoproteins (for example lubricin), tribonectins, articular cartilage superficial zone proteins, surface-active phospholipids, and lubricating glycoproteins I, II; vitronectin; and rooster comb hyaluronate (e.g. commercially available HEALON\u00ae, (Pharmacia Corporation, Peapack, New Jersey), for example, and mixtures thereof. Such materials serve both biological and mechanical functions: they play a biological role in directly and indirectly influencing cellular behavior by being involved in signal transduction alone or in conjunction with other extracellular matrix components such as growth factors, glycoproteins, collagens etc., and a mechanical role in providing lubrication. The use of the expression \u201cbiological lubricant\u201d is intended to encompass materials that provide some biological function (influencing cellular behavior), some mechanical function (lubrication), both of these functions, and mixtures of such materials.","It is believed that some commercially-available biological lubricants can be used in the practice of the present invention. Examples of such commercially-available lubricants include: ARTHREASE\u2122 high molecular weight sodium hyaluronate, available in Europe from DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. of Warsaw, Ind.; SYNVISC\u00ae Hylan G-F 20, manufactured by Biomatrix, Inc., of Ridgefield, N.J. and distributed by Wyeth-Ayerst Pharmaceuticals of Philadelphia, Pa.; and HYLAGAN\u00ae sodium hyaluronate, available from Sanofi-Synthelabo, Inc., of New York, N.Y. The expressions \u201cHA\u201d, \u201cGAG\u201d and \u201cbiological lubricant\u201d are intended to encompass these materials unless otherwise expressly excluded. It should be understood that there may be other salts of hyaluronic acid that may be used in the present invention, and the expressions \u201cHA\u201d, \u201cGAG\u201d and \u201cbiological lubricant\u201d should be understood to encompass such salts unless expressly excluded.","In one embodiment of the present invention, a method is provided wherein a scaffold, for example made from an ECM material, is implanted into the defect. The defect may be in a meniscus or other articular cartilage. The biological lubricant, which can be a GAG or HA for example, is administered separately, either at the time of surgery or via injection subsequent to closure of the incision. Optionally, a series of additional injections may be administered over a period of time. In either case, the injection may be made intra-articularly.","In another embodiment, a method is provided wherein a scaffold, for example an ECM material, and the biological lubricant are administered to the defect together. The ECM material may be saturated with the biological lubricant at the time of surgery. Alternatively, the ECM material may be saturated with the biological lubricant at the time of manufacture, and may be packaged together. Optionally, a series of additional injections may be administered in this method as well.","Other methods are provided for administering ECM implant and a biological lubricant. The biological lubricant can be physically or chemically crosslinked to the ECM implant at the time of manufacture. Illustratively, the biological lubricant can be dried on the ECM implant at manufacture. The biological lubricant and the ECM material can be co-lyophilized. The biological lubricant can be covalently bonded to the ECM material. Finally, combinations of the above methods may be used; for example, an implant of covalently bonded ECM and biological lubricant can be implanted and additional intra-articular injections of the same or different biological lubricants can be made at surgery, post-operatively, or both at surgery and postoperatively.","In still another embodiment, an implantable device is provided comprising an ECM material saturated with a biological lubricant.","While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments thereof have been shown by way of example in the drawings and will herein be described in detail. It should be understood, however, that there is no intent to limit the invention to the particular forms disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.","Referring to , it will be seen that a tibial platform  below the condyles  of a knee support a meniscus  from which an illustrative defective portion  is removed to leave a wedge-shaped space . In the removal process, the surgeon will often leave an outer rim  of the meniscus. The meniscus provides a large surface of articulation between the otherwise incongruent surfaces of the tibia platform or plateau and the femur condyles (such indicated at ). The meniscus serves to reduce contact stresses and wear in the knee joint.","The portion  removed from the structure shown in  includes a portion of the original meniscus which was within the avascular zone, particularly the radially inner portion, and may include a portion of the original meniscus which was within the vascular zone.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIGS. 3 and 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["16","18","20","16","18","22","24","22","24","26","26","16"]},"Device  may be inserted, for example, in arthroscopic surgery through portals provided in the outer anterior surface of the knee opening into the knee cavity between the condyles  and the tibial platform . However, any surgical procedure to insert a device into damaged cartilage is within the scope of the present invention. As shown, the upper cover  of the device  will serve as a bearing surface for the condyle  disposed thereabove and be subjected to the compression and stress forces involved in articulation of the knee. The condyle will move upon the upper surface of the cover . The device  will serve as a cushion or pillow for handling the compression load provided by the knee.","Turning to ,  and , it will be seen that an illustrative device is somewhat diagrammatically illustrated. The illustrative device  includes an upper panel  and a lower panel  defining a wedge-shaped device having a base portion  and an apex portion .  suggests that the device may include a formed wedge-shaped cavity  (illustrated in phantom) and that the device may be folded about a fold line  to provide a device such as indicated at  in . While the  device  suggests an open wedge-shaped design, the device  in  suggests that, between the upper and lower panels ,  a mass of biological material may be disposed. In , a plurality of tacks  are shown attached to one of the two panels of the device to be used for securing the device to surrounding tissue in the knee. The panels ,  may be trimmed to the desired wedge shape.","Panels ,  are made from an ECM, illustratively SIS. In one embodiment, a plurality of layers of a naturally occurring ECM such as SIS may be layered together to form panels , . Optionally, the panels may be toughened, to better withstand the forces within the joint. Copending U.S. application Ser. No. 10\/195,795 entitled \u201cMeniscus Regeneration Device and Method\u201d, already incorporated by reference, teaches methods for toughening the panels. The mass of biological material may comprise, for example, comminuted ECM, fibrin, platelet rich plasma (PRP), blood clot, or some combination thereof.","Referring now to , there are shown devices similar to those shown in , except that device  need not be wedge shaped. Device  comprises panels  and , with a pillow  of biological material shaped to fill the void in meniscus  left after a partial meniscectomy, as illustrated in . The pillow is placed between panels  and . In the illustrative embodiment, pillow  is smaller than panels  and , and wing portions  of panels  and  extend beyond pillow .","As shown in , device  may be provided with barbed darts  extending from wings . A needle or similar device would be used to push the barbed darts  into or through the meniscus to secure device  to the meniscus. Barbed darts may be made of any biocompatable material sufficiently rigid to secure device  to the meniscus. Barbed darts  may be provided integrally with device  or may be added by the surgeon prior to insertion of the device.","The device  illustrated in  is similar to the device shown in , except that instead of barbed darts, the device of  is provided with sutures . The device of  may be affixed to the meniscus in a manner similar to that of the device of . A needle or similar device would be used to push the sutures  through the meniscus. As illustrated in , the sutures may be tied together on the outside of the meniscus to form knots  that secure device  in place.","While in the various embodiments discussed herein, tacks and sutures have been shown for anchoring the devices, it will be appreciated that the devices may be anchored by any other method at the choice of the surgeon.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIGS. 11 and 12","FIG. 11","FIG. 11"],"b":["210","210","212","216","218","212","212","220","222","220","222","220","224","218","224","222","212"]},"The cartilage repair device  also includes a plug . The plug  is secured to the anchor . Specifically, the plug  is secured to the upper surface of the head portion  of the anchor . The plug  allows for communication across the removed portion (i.e., the portion of the native cartilage  from which the damaged or diseased cartilage has been removed) and the adjacent healthy cartilage. As such, the plug  functions as a chondrogenic growth-supporting matrix for promoting a positive cellular response in an effort to achieve articular cartilage regeneration.","The anchor  of the cartilage repair device  may be constructed of numerous types of synthetic or naturally occurring materials. For example, the anchor  may be constructed with a bioabsorbable polymer. Examples of such polymers include: polyesters of [alpha]-hydroxycarboxylic acids, such as poly(L-lactide) (PLLA), polyglycolide (PGA); poly-p-dioxanone (PDO); polycaprolactone (PCL); and any other bioresorbable and biocompatible polymer, co-polymer or mixture of polymers or co-polymers that are commonly used in the construction of prosthetic implants. Moreover, the anchor  may be constructed with a naturally occurring material such as a naturally occurring ECM (e.g., SIS). In such a case, the head portion  and body portion  of the anchor  may be configured as monolithic structures formed from naturally occurring ECM which is cured to be rigid and hardened to facilitate attachment to the bone . As such, it should be appreciated that the ECM material from which the anchor  is fabricated is cured to produce a structure which possesses the necessary hardness and toughness to allow the anchor  to be driven into bone tissue (i.e., the subchondral bone ). See U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/195,719 entitled \u201cDevices from Naturally Occurring Biologically Derived Materials\u201d, already incorporated by reference. It should be understood that the material selected for the anchor  may also comprise mixtures or composites of materials. For example, the anchor  could comprise both a polymer and ECM material.","As mentioned above, the plug , which is fixed to the anchor , functions as a chondrogenic growth-supporting matrix for promoting vascular invasion and cellular proliferation in an effort to achieve articular cartilage regeneration. A central body  of the plug  is configured as a porous structure constructed from a naturally occurring ECM material such as SIS. When anchored to a defective area of cartilage, cells can migrate into and proliferate within the plug , biodegrade the plug  while, at the same time, synthesize new and healthy tissue to heal the defective area. The plug  may be made out of comminuted and\/or lyophilized naturally occurring ECM (e.g. SIS) with the desired porosity and material density. Specifically, the material density and\/or porosity of the plug  may be varied to control cell migration and proliferation. The cells can migrate from adjacent tissue or from synovial fluid. The ECM from which the plug  is constructed also may be formed to have a structural rigidity sufficient to withstand the compression and shear stress to which the cartilage  is subjected. As such, the ECM from which the plug  is constructed to have the structural rigidity necessary to bear the forces associated with the other bone.","One particularly useful material for fabricating the plug  is a porous scaffold or \u201cfoam\u201d composed of naturally occurring ECM. For example, the plug  may be constructed from a porous SIS foam. In such a manner, both the material density and the pore size of the foam plug  may be varied to fit the needs of a given plug design. Such foams may be fabricated by lyophilizing (i.e., freeze-drying) comminuted ECM (i.e., SIS) suspended in water. The material density and pore size of the resultant foam may be varied by controlling, among other things, the rate of freezing of the comminuted SIS suspension and\/or the amount of water or moisture content in the comminuted SIS at the on-set of the freezing process. See U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/195,347 entitled \u201cCartilage Repair Apparatus and Method\u201d and Ser.

The cartilage repair device  is somewhat similar to the cartilage repair device . As such, the same reference numerals are used in  to identify components which have previously been discussed, with additional discussion thereof being unwarranted. The cartilage repair device  includes an anchor  which is used in lieu of the anchor  described in regard to . In particular, in the embodiment shown in , the plug  is positioned in an osteochondral defect  without the use of a bottom-mounted anchor (i.e., the anchor  of ). Similarly to as described above, the plug  is constructed out of comminuted and lyophilized naturally occurring ECM (e.g., SIS) having a desired porosity and material density.","The plug  is retained in the hole formed in the cartilage  and protected from in vivo forces by an annular shaped anchor . The anchor  may be provided in many different configurations which allow it to be press fit or otherwise anchored into the subchondral bone . For example, as shown in , the anchor  may be \u201cbottle cap\u201d-shaped so as to allow the anchor  to be press fit or otherwise secured into an annular groove  formed in the subchondral bone . The groove may be formed and the anchor may be shaped as described and shown in Patent Cooperation Treaty publication WO 01\/39694 A2, published Jun. 7, 2001 entitled \u201cFixation Technology,\u201d the complete disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein. Alternatively, the anchor  may be mechanically secured to the subchondral bone  by use of adhesive or other types of anchoring structures (e.g., barbs).","The anchor  of the cartilage repair device  may be constructed from numerous types of synthetic or naturally occurring materials. For example, the anchor  may be constructed with a bioabsorbable polymer such as PLLA, PGA, PDO, PCL, or any other such bioabsorbable polymer which is commonly used in the construction of prosthetic implants. Moreover, the anchor  may be constructed from a naturally occurring material such as a naturally occurring ECM (e.g., SIS) that is cured or otherwise fabricated to be rigid and hardened to facilitate attachment to the bone in the same manner as described above in regard to the anchor  and\/or the plug  of .","In embodiments when the anchor  is constructed from ECM, one or more laminated or non-laminated sheets of the same or different ECM may be utilized. The sheets may surround the plug  on three sides, as shown in , or perhaps all four sides. Alternatively, the anchor may be constructed from formed (e.g., dried and machined) comminuted ECM material. In either configuration, the ECM material may be perforated and may be cured in a similar manner to as described above in regard to the anchor  or the plug .","The ECM device illustratively may be provided fresh, frozen, or lyophilized. In one embodiment, the device is saturated with HA prior to packaging. The HA may be crosslinked to the ECM device, illustratively mechanically, chemically, or enzymatically. In one embodiment, the HA is crosslinked to the articulation surface of the device (for example panel  of the device illustrated in  or plug  of ).","Copending U.S. patent application Nos. 10\/195,795 and 10\/195,347 entitled \u201cMeniscus Regeneration Device and Method\u201d and \u201cCartilage Repair Apparatus and Method\u201d, filed concurrently and hereby incorporated by reference, disclose various additional devices for repairing damaged or diseased cartilage. Each of the devices is made in whole or part from an ECM material, illustratively SIS. In some embodiments, the SIS material is provided fresh, frozen, or lyophilized. Illustratively, as disclosed in these copending applications, depending upon the application, the SIS material may be laminated, foamed, comminuted, hardened, and\/or toughened. Any of the devices disclosed in U.S. patent application Nos. 10\/195,795 and 10\/195,347, are suitable for use with the present invention. Devices with other configurations are also within the scope of this invention. Other forms of SIS may also be used within the scope of this invention. For example, the SIS may be powdered and optionally formed into a gel, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,352,463. It is believed that the ECM devices provide a tissue growth-supporting matrix for promoting vascular invasion and cellular migration.","It is expected that the teachings of the present invention may also be advantageously combined with the teachings of the following U.S. Patent Applications filed concurrently herewith and which are incorporated by reference herein: 10\/195,719 entitled \u201cDevices from Naturally Occurring Biologically Derived Materials\u201d; 10\/195,344 entitled \u201cUnitary Surgical Device and Method\u201d; 10\/195,341 entitled \u201cHybrid Biologic\/Synthetic Porous Extracellular Matrix Scaffolds\u201d; 10\/195,354 entitled \u201cPorous Extracellular Matrix Scaffold and Method\u201d; and U.S. patent application Ser.

For example, bioactive agents, biologically-derived agents, cells, biocompatible polymers, biocompatible inorganic material and\/or combinations thereof may be mixed with the biological lubricant.","\u201cBioactive agents\u201d include one or more of the following: chemotactic agents; therapeutic agents (e.g. antibiotics, steroidal and non-steroidal analgesics and anti-inflammatories, anti-rejection agents such as immunosuppressants and anti-cancer drugs); various proteins (e.g. short chain peptides, bone morphogenic proteins, glycoprotein and lipoprotein); cell attachment mediators; biologically active ligands; integrin binding sequence; ligands; various growth and\/or differentiation agents (e.g. epidermal growth factor, IGF-I, IGF-II, TGF-\u03b2, I-III, growth and differentiation factors, vascular endothelial growth factors, fibroblast growth factors, platelet derived growth factors, insulin derived growth factor and transforming growth factors, parathyroid hormone, parathyroid hormone related peptide, bFGF; TGF superfamily factors; BMP-2; BMP-4; BMP-6; BMP-12; sonic hedgehog; GDF5; GDF6; GDF8; PDGF); small molecules that affect the upregulation of specific growth factors; tenascin-C; hyaluronic acid; chondroitin sulfate; fibronectin; decorin; thromboelastin; thrombin-derived peptides; heparin-binding domains; heparin; heparan sulfate; DNA fragments; and DNA plasmids. If other such substances have therapeutic value in the orthopaedic field, it is anticipated that at least some of these substances will have use in the present invention, and such substances should be included in the meaning of \u201cbioactive agent\u201d and \u201cbioactive agents\u201d unless expressly limited otherwise.","\u201cBiologically derived agents\u201d include one or more of the following: bone (autograft, allograft, and xenograft) and derivates of bone; cartilage (autograft, allograft, and xenograft), including, for example, meniscal tissue, and derivatives; ligament (autograft, allograft, and xenograft) and derivatives; derivatives of intestinal tissue (autograft, allograft, and xenograft), including for example submucosa; derivatives of stomach tissue (autograft, allograft, and xenograft), including for example submucosa; derivatives of bladder tissue (autograft, allograft, and xenograft), including for example submucosa; derivatives of alimentary tissue (autograft, allograft, and xenograft), including for example submucosa; derivatives of respiratory tissue (autograft, allograft, and xenograft), including for example submucosa; derivatives of genital tissue (autograft, allograft, and xenograft), including for example submucosa; derivatives of liver tissue (autograft, allograft, and xenograft), including for example liver basement membrane; derivatives of skin tissue; platelet rich plasma (PRP), platelet poor plasma, bone marrow aspirate, demineralized bone matrix, insulin derived growth factor, whole blood, fibrin and blood clot. Purified ECM and other collagen sources are also intended to be included within \u201cbiologically derived agents.\u201d If other such substances have therapeutic value in the orthopaedic field, it is anticipated that at least some of these substances will have use in the present invention, and such substances should be included in the meaning of \u201cbiologically-derived agent\u201d and \u201cbiologically-derived agents\u201d unless expressly limited otherwise.","\u201cBiologically derived agents\u201d also include bioremodelable collageneous tissue matrices. The expressions \u201cbioremodelable collagenous tissue matrix\u201d and \u201cnaturally occurring bioremodelable collageneous tissue matrix\u201d include matrices derived from native tissue selected from the group consisting of skin, artery, vein, pericardium, heart valve, dura mater, ligament, bone, cartilage, bladder, liver, stomach, fascia and intestine, tendon, whatever the source. Although \u201cnaturally occurring bioremodelable collageneous tissue matrix\u201d is intended to refer to matrix material that has been cleaned, processed, sterilized, and optionally crosslinked, it is not within the definition of a naturally occurring bioremodelable collageneous tissue matrix to purify the natural fibers and reform a matrix material from purified natural fibers. The term \u201cbioremodelable collageneous tissue matrices\u201d includes \u201cextracellular matrices\u201d within its definition.","It is understood and intended that there is substantial overlap between \u201cbioremodelable collageneous tissue matrices\u201d and \u201cextracellular matrices\u201d; the different expressions are used in this specification and claims to ensure complete coverage of the invention. It is believed that the teachings of the present invention will be useful for materials falling with both definitions.","\u201cCells\u201d include one or more of the following: chondrocytes; fibrochondrocytes; osteocytes; osteoblasts; osteoclasts; synoviocytes; bone marrow cells; mesenchymal cells; stromal cells; stem cells; embryonic stem cells; precursor cells derived from adipose tissue; peripheral blood progenitor cells; stem cells isolated from adult tissue; genetically transformed cells; a combination of chondrocytes and other cells; a combination of osteocytes and other cells; a combination of synoviocytes and other cells; a combination of bone marrow cells and other cells; a combination of mesenchymal cells and other cells; a combination of stromal cells and other cells; a combination of stem cells and other cells; a combination of embryonic stem cells and other cells; a combination of precursor cells isolated from adult tissue and other cells; a combination of peripheral blood progenitor cells and other cells; a combination of stem cells isolated from adult tissue and other cells; and a combination of genetically transformed cells and other cells.

Illustratively, in one example of embodiments that are to be seeded with living cells such as chondrocytes, a sterilized implant may be subsequently seeded with living cells and packaged in an appropriate medium for the cell type used. For example, a cell culture medium comprising Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM) can be used with standard additives such as non-essential amino acids, glucose, ascorbic acid, sodium pyrovate, fungicides, antibiotics, etc., in concentrations deemed appropriate for cell type, shipping conditions, etc.","\u201cBiocompatible polymers\u201d is intended to include both synthetic polymers and biopolymers (e.g. collagen). Examples of biocompatible polymers include: polyesters of [alpha]-hydroxycarboxylic acids, such as poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) and polyglycolide (PGA); poly-p-dioxanone (PDO); polycaprolactone (PCL); polyvinyl alchohol (PVA); polyethylene oxide (PEO); polymers disclosed in U.S Pat. Nos. 6,333,029 and 6,355,699; and any other bioresorbable and biocompatible polymer, co-polymer or mixture of polymers or co-polymers that are utilized in the construction of prosthetic implants. In addition, as new biocompatible, bioresorbable materials are developed, it is expected that at least some of them will be useful materials from which orthopaedic devices may be made. It should be understood that the above materials are identified by way of example only, and the present invention is not limited to any particular material unless expressly called for in the claims.","\u201cBiocompatible inorganic materials\u201d include materials such as hydroxyapatite, all calcium phosphates, alpha-tricalcium phosphate, beta-tricalcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, barium carbonate, calcium sulfate, barium sulfate, polymorphs of calcium phosphate, sintered and non-sintered ceramic particles, and combinations of such materials. If other such substances have therapeutic value in the orthopaedic field, it is anticipated that at least some of these substances will have use in the present invention, and such substances should be included in the meaning of \u201cbiocompatible inorganic material\u201d and \u201cbiocompatible inorganic materials\u201d unless expressly limited otherwise.","It is expected that various combinations of bioactive agents, biologically derived agents, cells, biological lubricants, biocompatible inorganic materials, biocompatible polymers can be used with the scaffolds and methods of the present invention.","It is expected that standard disinfection and sterilization techniques may be used with the products of the present invention.","A meniscus is prepared as shown in . An SIS device as shown in  is inserted into the space created by the meniscectomy and secured by suturing with 5-0 nylon sutures to the surrounding meniscal tissue. The incisions are closed and 2 ml of a solution of 1% sodium hyaluronate, of molecular weight between 2.4 and 3.6 million Daltons (the commercially-available ARTHREASE\u2122 high molecular weight sodium hyaluronate) is injected into the knee joint cavity adjacent to the SIS device. After 3 weeks, 95% or more regeneration of the meniscal defect was seen in two out of three dogs. Moreover, the cartilage is mature and is similar in appearance to natural tissue.","In contrast, use of ARTHREASE\u2122 injections alone, without the SIS implant, resulted in no tissue regeneration within the meniscal defect in three out of three dogs. Use of an SIS implant alone, without ARTHREASE\u2122 injections, resulted in approximately 80% tissue regeneration in one dog and less than 50% regeneration in two of three dogs in this group.","A meniscus is prepared and a device inserted, as in Example 1. The incision is closed and HA (the commercially-available ARTHREASE\u2122 high molecular weight sodium hyaluronate of EXAMPLE 1) is injected as in Example 1. Additional injections are provided two weeks and four weeks post-op. It is understood that other protocols for a series of injections may be used.","A meniscus is prepared as in Example 1. An SIS device as shown in  is placed in an HA solution (the commercially-available ARTHREASE\u2122 high molecular weight sodium hyaluronate of EXAMPLE 1), and the HA is allowed to saturate the device. The device is then inserted, as discussed in Example 1. Optional additional injections are provided two weeks and four weeks post-op.","A meniscus is prepared as in Example 1. An SIS device as shown in  is obtained, wherein the device had been saturated in HA (the commercially-available ARTHREASE high molecular weight sodium hyaluronate of EXAMPLE 1) and lyophilized prior to packaging. The device is rehydrated in sterile saline or water and implanted as in Example 1.","Some commercial sodium hyaluronate solutions have a higher concentration of sodium hyaluronate. For example, Pharmacia Corporation of Peapack, N.J. identifies three different concentrations of sodium hyaluronate in its HEALON\u00ae line of products: 1% sodium hyaluronate, 1.4% sodium hyaluronate and 2.3% sodium hyaluronate for ophthalmologic use.","A cartilage defect is repaired with a device as shown in . HA is applied post-operatively to the repaired defect. When compared to cartilage defects repaired without HA, the repaired tissue is expected to be more mature, with a whiter, more hyaline-like appearance. Also, it is expected that the repaired tissue that is treated with a combination device and HA will show evidence of less severe degradative changes than is seen in the non-HA treated animals.","Although the examples all relate to use of HA salts, it is expected that other biological lubricants will provide similar benefits. It should be understood that the nature of the biological lubricant and the means of administering the biological lubricant can affect the quality of lubrication provided and can also affect the biological effects observed. For example, although a biological lubricant such as HA can be cross-linked to the matrix and still provide adequate lubrication, some GAG sulfates (e.g. chondroitin sulfate) can be expected to be less effective, or ineffective, as a lubricant if cross-linked or co-lyophilized with the underlying matrix, yet still be used for its biological effects. For some biological lubricants, it will be desirable to provide the biological lubricant in a fluidized form to maximize lubrication. In addition, different materials identified as falling within the definition of biological lubricants can be expected to have different efficacies as lubricants and different biological efficacies. Of the identified biological lubricants, those sharing properties (e.g. viscosity) similar to those of HA may provide greater clinical benefit as lubricants. Of the identified biological lubricants, those decreasing the coefficient of friction between the implant and healthy cartilage, compared to the case without the lubricant, are expected to be beneficial, and particularly those biological lubricants providing a reduced coefficient of friction for an extended period time. Other of the identified biological lubricants may provide greater clinical benefit as biologic agents. It should also be understood that materials identified as biological lubricants and the means of administering the material may be combined in various ways to take advantage of the properties of each and to maximize the clinical benefits of administering the various materials.","Although the invention has been described in detail with reference to certain preferred embodiments, variations and modifications exist within the scope and spirit of the invention as described and defined in the following claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","EXAMPLE 1","EXAMPLE 2","EXAMPLE 3","EXAMPLE 4","EXAMPLE 5"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["4","4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 12"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
