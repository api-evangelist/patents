No. 07\/967,644 filed on Oct. 28, 1992, now abandoned.","This invention concerns a digital, electrical computer and a data processing system, and methods involving the same, applied to the financial fields of securities, real estate, and taxation. More particularly, this invention relates to a computer system for supporting a financial innovation involving the securitization of property by its decomposition into at least two components. One component can be an estate for years component and a second component can be a remainder interest. The computer system computes the respective values and investment characteristics of the components, and produces documentation thereof, to facilitate financial transactions involving the separate components.","A. Description of the Prior Art","During the last recession, a far greater number of businesses failed than would normally have been expected. Bankruptcies, financial defaults, and foreclosures on property also increased, and bad real estate loans caused an atypically large number of lenders to collapse. If there were obvious ways to increase investment return under conditions of economic stress, most likely those ways would have been uncovered long ago.","Consider real estate, for example. Commercial real estate market activity was at or near a standstill for several years around the start of this decade, beginning in the last recession and continuing for more than a year past the end of the recession. Although excess development of commercial space received great attention in the financial press, there was also a drastic reduction in capital available for real estate equity investment and finance.","Real estate equity capital declined as pension funds reduced or ended commitments of new equity capital to real estate capital markets. Capital for real estate finance declined correspondingly as savings and loan institutions withdrew from commercial real estate lending. Of even greater significance, real estate lending practices of insurance companies and commercial banks came under greater regulatory scrutiny in response to increased loan defaults in the early 1990s, which led to a tightening of standards for real estate loans and a reduction in flexibility on loan terms.","Property values fell, and investors were uncertain of how far values had fallen because so few sales of commercial property were occurring.","The problem was not a lack of potential investors. Although the pension funds had withdrawn from the markets, the core group of real estate developers and professionals involved in the markets before the pension funds entered were still committed to the real estate business and were still willing to commit capital to acquire and control real estate for business investment purposes.","Nor was the problem a lack of potential financing. Despite some withdrawal by savings and loan institutions, insurance companies were still available to provide financing for sound commercial real estate developments. However, there were at least two key constraints on loan commitments by insurance companies that had the practical effect of restricting the amount of available financing.","One key constraint was the emergence of a more strict regulatory environment that restricted the maturities of most loans that insurance companies were willing to make to no more than ten (10) years. This conflicted with the dictates of tax considerations for taxable investors, which suggested that the terms of loans should be at least fifteen (15) years, and preferably twenty (20) years or more.","A second key constraint was that, due to high nationwide vacancy rates in commercial properties, insurance companies were making real estate loans primarily on property that was almost fully leased to tenants that were unlikely to default on their leases. Thus, credit ratings of the tenants were a prime consideration in deciding whether loans should be made.","In fact, insurance companies usually viewed real estate loans as financings of existing tenant leases. Accordingly, lenders usually insisted that property owners assign the rent payments to the lenders to provide additional assurance that loan payments would be made, and lenders also insisted that the rent assignments totally amortize the loans. (The primary reason that most offered mortgages were for no more than ten years was that, in the high-vacancy rental environment existing at that time, most leases ran for no more than ten years.) Furthermore, the lenders could frequently have viewed their legal claims on the tenants' rental payments as perhaps more important than their claims on the property, because in a market with excess space, a claim on vacant space was not particularly valuable.","In other words, during this period of excess rental capacity, financing necessary to sustain the level of liquidity historically experienced by the real estate markets was not available from financial institutions on acceptable terms and conditions.","The result was market \u201cgridlock\u201d and a dearth of real estate transactions until the current economic expansion led to a nationwide increase in demand for rental space and a corresponding decrease in vacancy rates.","Similar troubles have been features of the real estate market at low points in the real estate cycle at various times in the history of the market. Despite great economic pressure to improve the situation, a more efficient technology for real estate finance in an economic environment of excess rental capacity and weak economic activity has not surfaced.","In response to the above, a new financial product has been developed based on the concept that property value consists of separately valuable property rights that can be worth more when sold separately. In a manner of speaking, the whole can be less than the sum of its parts.","With the development of a new financial product, a need has arisen for new machines and processes to use in bringing the product to market and sustaining it. These machines and processes are the subject of the present invention.","A. Real and Personal Property","As an example, in the case of property that is customarily leased by corporations, leased and unleased property have different investment characteristics. Ownership of leased property is a fixed-income asset with investment characteristics that depend upon lease covenants, the market for corporate debt, and the lessees' credit ratings. By contrast, ownership of unleased property is a speculative asset having investment characteristics that depend on the spot rental market for that type of property. Thus it is possible to split ownership of this type of property into at least two components, at least one of which is a fixed-income asset.","Consider real estate, for example, which can be divided into an estate for years and a remainder interest. Lenders can purchase the estate for years outright instead of writing a commercial mortgage on the whole property. Alternatively, a special purpose entity can be established to purchase the estate for years, and the lenders can purchase ownership or equity interests in the entity. Similarly, the other component\u2014the remainder interest\u2014can be purchased by real estate investors (or, again, the remainder interest can be purchased by a special purpose entity in which the real estate investors purchase equity or ownership interests) in lieu of the standard investment approach, in which the investor would purchase all rights to the property using some funds from a commercial loan. Examples of such special purpose entities include, but are not limited to, trusts, limited partnerships, and limited liability companies. The term of the estate for years can be determined by the parameters that describe the property, in particular by the remaining lengths of the terms of the existing leases.","For purposes of this summary of the invention, in those cases in which a special purpose entity is created to hold a component, for example, such as the estate for years or remainder interest, an equity interest in the component is intended to refer to an equity interest in the special purpose entity.","If the property is fully leased (or is almost fully leased), and the leases will not expire until after the estate for years has expired, then the estate for years has the investment characteristics of a fixed-income asset rather than of property. Under these circumstances, at least for real estate, insurance companies are allowed by regulators to treat the estate for years as a fixed-income investment, and to compute its value accordingly. In other words, the insurance companies value the estate for years based on cash flow characteristics of the leases and credit ratings of the tenants, and not based on the value of real estate or the risk in the real estate markets.","Due to an interplay of values for the property components and the needs of respective purchasers, including tax needs, it is frequently possible to sell the components of the property separately for more than the price that the property as a whole would command.","From the perspective of an investor who acquires the remainder interest, a purchaser of the estate for years has accepted an assignment of the lease payments for the term of the estate for years in return for financing the acquisition of the property by the remainder interest purchaser. From this perspective, the amount of financing provided is equal to the purchase price of the estate for years, the lease payments during the estate for years term completely amortize the financing, and the length of the financing term equals the term of the estate for years.","Unlike traditional mortgage finance, shorter financing terms (less than fifteen years) are not a problem under this structure for the remainder interest investor, because: (1) during the estate for years term, the investor does not incur any tax liabilities; and (2) taking possession of the property upon expiration of the estate for years is not a taxable event for the investor. In other words, the investor does not have any tax liability until there is an obligation to pay taxes on rent payments received after taking possession of the property at the expiration of the estate for years, and those rental payments provide the cash to meet the taxes due on those payments. Therefore, the estate for years term is irrelevant to the remainder interest investor, except insofar as the term determines the amount of financing the estate for years purchaser provides (the longer the estate for years term, the greater the amount of financing). In addition, upon expiration of the estate for years, the remainder interest investor owns the property outright (i.e., without any debt).","From the perspective of a financier, this financing product has no claim on the a property investor (i.e., the remainder interest investor), but the strongest possible direct claim on the tenants, because the financier is the owner of record during the estate for years term. In other words, this financing product is more efficient than a commercial mortgage at matching the legal recourse claims in event of default with the asset that is actually being financed: tenant promises to pay future rent. The estate for years term can be as long as the existing leases are committed to run - - - typically ten years or less, although sometimes longer in the case of property that is fully leased for long terms. However, investor preferences may dictate an estate for years term that is significantly shorter than the longest lease term, and technical considerations may suggest an estate for years term that is slightly longer than the longest lease term.","In addition, ownership can be structured so that the transaction creates the estate for years and the remainder interest, in order to create the most favorable tax consequences for the financier and the property investor.","It is frequently the case that special purpose entities with one or more limited liability equity interests created to hold one or more components can enhance the value of equity interest(s) in the components. An opportunity for value enhancement can arise because direct ownership of an equity interest in tangible property can expose the owner to potentially unlimited legal liability as a result of events involving the property, whereas component ownership via an equity interest in the entity is a limited liability equity interest in the component. In other words, a special purpose entity with one or more limited liability equity interests can transform one or more components of a property into limited liability components, i.e., components with one or more limited liability equity interests. Thus market-based component valuation, in the case in which a component is held by an entity, involves both valuation of the investment characteristics of a component and the effect of the entity on the investment characteristics of the component.","Any additional tax liability created by existence of a special purpose entity that contains one or more components of a property detracts from the investment returns that flow from the property to investors in the components, resulting in a reduction in the market values of the relevant components. The loss of value is most significant in the case of United States federal tax liabilities, since United States federal tax rates are usually higher than corresponding state and local taxes. Thus an appropriate entity for purposes of holding estate for years and remainder interests is an entity that does not incur additional tax liabilities, at least at the United States federal tax level. A pass-through entity for United States federal tax purposes is an example of such an entity. An example of such a pass-through entity is a grantor trust.","Since an entity that holds one or more component interests in a property is not expected to retain significant amounts of income, another appropriate type of entity is an entity that is allowed a United States federal tax deduction for distributions to holders of equity interests in the entity.","In cases in which an entity holds one or more components of a property, the entity can be used to modify investment characteristics of the components without modifying underlying leases on the property. For example, put or call options on some equity interests in the entity can be inserted into the organizational document of the entity. In the case of fixed-income components, these can be used to add features that are sometimes found in United States government bonds and corporate bonds without approaching lessees to renegotiate the leases.","It is not necessary for a component to be purchased in its entirety by one investor. A component can be divided into shares so that investors can purchase fractional interests in the component. In those cases in which there is a special purpose entity for the component, fractional interests in the component can be created by dividing the equity interest in the entity into shares with equal equity participation rights. This accords prospective investors the investment option of purchasing fractional interests in the component simply by purchasing fewer than the entire number of shares in the equity interest.","More generally, multiple classes of shares with various equity participation rights in the entity can be created, according investors the investment option of purchasing more general types of equity interests in the component.","More particularly, an investor can purchase an equity interest in a component that is less than the entire equity interest in the component. In the case wherein the entire equity interest in the component is divided into fractional interests, each fractional interest is valued by multiplying the valuation of the component by the fraction represented by the fractional interest. In the case wherein the entire equity interest in the component is divided into more general types of equity interests, the equity interests may be valued by more general market-based techniques, such as by regarding an individual equity interest as a separate temporal component if the investment characteristics of the equity interest are those of a temporal component and valuing each such interest by the methodology introduced herein for valuing components. If one of these equity interests is then further subdivided into fractional subinterests, then each fractional subinterest is valued by multiplying the valuation of the entire equity interest by the fraction represented by the fractional subinterest.","An example of more general equity interests in remainder components occurs in cases in which insurance is available to protect remainder component investors against the risk of a decline in property value below some specified value at some specified future time or time interval close to the expiration date of the estate for years term. Such insurance, known as residual value insurance, implies that the minimum possible return over the estate for years term for remainder component investors is greater than \u2212100% so long as the insurer remains solvent, and that the value of the minimum possible investment return for the remainder component over the estate for years term is equal to the return value that will transform the remainder component purchase price into the insured minimum future property value. The existence of residual value insurance implies that the remainder component can in turn be decomposed into at least two types of equity interests, including a preferred equity interest that receives most or all of the protection of the residual value insurance and a residual equity interest that receives little or none of the protection of the residual value insurance.","The preferred equity interest may be viewed for investment purposes as a zero-coupon fixed-income asset, possibly with a bonus feature of an equity participation on the upside, with a bond term approximately equal to the estate for years term and a credit rating equal to the credit rating of the insurer. Accordingly, the preferred equity interest will be of interest primarily to fixed-income investors and the residual equity interest will be of interest primarily to equity investors. Such preferred\/residual decompositions of remainder interests carve additional fixed-income assets out of property that are essentially independent of the fixed-income assets represented by the estate for years components.","In cases in which there is an entity for a component, the purchase by investors of less-than-entire interests in the component may be facilitated by the division of the equity interest in the entity into one more classes of shares. If there is a single class of shares in the entity, then a purchase of shares in the entity is equivalent to the purchase of a fractional economic interest in the component.","Although it is expected that entities associated with components will be special purpose entities established to facilitate specific transactions, more general entities not designed for specific transactions may be appropriate in some circumstances. For example, this could occur in order to avoid duplicative costs associated with creating multiple separate entities in situations wherein multiple equity interests with the appropriate investment characteristics can be created with fewer entities.","As in the case of special purpose entities with limited liability components, a more general entity for a component can affect both the extent of liability exposure on the part of investors in that component and also the degree of control investors in that component and possibly also investors in other components of the property as well have over the property in event of lessee default during the estate for years term. Thus market-based component valuation in the case wherein any component is held by an entity involves valuation of the investment characteristics of the component, including any effect of any entity on the investment characteristics of the component. So for example, a component that is a lease or leases packaged in an entity (e.g., a limited liability component) can have a different valuation than a naked lease or leases - - - more particularly, this is likely to be the case if more than one of the components is a limited liability component.","There can also be cases in which there is an entity for an equity interest in a component, which can be either in lieu of or in addition to an entity for the entire component. For example, in the case of publicly traded equity interests in a component, nominal ownership of the equity interest could be held by an investor's brokerage firm, or the equity interest could be in the form of depository receipts for shares in a component such as American Depository Receipts for shares whose registered ownership resides offshore, with no material impact from an investor's perspective on the investment characteristics of the equity interest. More generally, in cases in which an entity for an equity interest has no material effect on investment return, risk, or liquidity characteristics of the equity interest, and no material effect on the degree of investor control potentially available to an investor, the existence of the entity will have no effect on valuation of the equity interest.","In this way, there can be a concatenated sequence of entities for an equity interest. Such a functional sequence can be regarded for investment analysis and descriptive purposes as a single entity.","The effect of such a concatenated sequence on valuation of a component can be analyzed by successively valuing the impact of each entity in the sequence, starting with the entity that is legally closest to the property and working successively towards the entity that is legally closest to the investor.","In the case of real estate, the purchase price of the estate for years component alone, or a material interest therein, will almost never be large enough to cover the sale price of the property and the cost of component separation. This implies that a market-based valuation and sale of the remainder component, or a material interest therein, is an essential factor in the implementation of component separation. In the case of tangible personal property, the purchase price of the estate for years component also will almost never not be large enough to cover the sale price of the property and the cost of component separation, except in those cases wherein the property can reasonably be expected to reach the end of its useful economic life during the estate for years term.","B. Tax-exempt Finance","Separating property into at least two components along a time dimension (e.g., into an estate for years and a remainder interest) can also be used to enhance the investment value of tax-exempt securities such as tax-exempt general obligation bonds, tax-exempt industrial revenue bonds, and tax-exempt leases. This separation can be applied either to individual securities or to pools of tax-exempt securities. Value enhancement can be achieved in two ways: (1) cash flow streams from the components can appeal to investors who would be interested in the entire cash flow stream of the original asset, and (2) the combined tax shelter benefits that accompany the components can be greater than the tax shelter benefits associated with the original asset. Both effects are significant, though in some situations, the tax effect will be the more dramatic of the two.","Unlike the example of taxable leased property discussed above, for the tax-exempt property example, both components can be viewed as fixed-income securities. One would expect that these fixed-income securities would be valued by investors in the marketplace by comparison with other fixed-income securities.","For tax-exempt securities, to effect a successful change in cash flow benefits from splitting the property or asset into components, one can proceed indirectly in separating the asset into components. Rather than directly separating ownership of the tax-exempt security itself, it is better to create an entity to hold the tax-exempt security, and then to separate one or more of the equity interests in the entity along the time dimension into estate for years and remainder components.","From a legal perspective, creating tax-exempt components can be accomplished within the framework of a general or special purpose entity, examples of which include general and limited partnerships and mutual funds. However, to create limited-liability components, smooth the cash flow streams, and avoid an imposition of unusual bookkeeping requirements on fixed-income investors, an entity with one or more limited liability equity interests is the preferred format, with some limited liability equity interests as the assets that are subject to component separation. To enhance marketability of the components, and to facilitate investor valuation of the components by comparison with alternative fixed-income investments available in the marketplace, the entity may alter the frequency of cash flows to holders of equity interests from schedules of the original assets (e.g., the original assets could generate monthly cash flows, and the components could generate semiannual cash flows).","In general, component separation will produce two effects: (1) the estate for years components will generate more tax deductions than are necessary to shelter the cash flows of this component from taxes; and (2) the remainder interest component will generate fewer tax deductions than are necessary to shelter the cash flows of this component from taxes (the tax obligations associated with the remainder component will still be lower than those associated with a conventional taxable fixed-income security). It is also possible that, in some situations, purchasers of taxable securities may view remainder interests as taxable securities and value those interests more highly than investors in tax-exempt securities.","The same component separation technology can be applied to separate the following fixed-income assets along the time dimension into components: a taxable fixed-income security, a portfolio of taxable fixed-income securities, a portfolio of taxable and tax-exempt fixed-income securities. More generally, the same component separation technology can be applied to any asset or portfolio of assets that is either ratable as if it were a fixed-income security (possibly of investment grade), where the term \u201cratable\u201d refers in general to fixed-income ratings assigned by widely recognized investment rating agencies such as Standard and Poor's and Moody's Investors Service, or classifiable for regulatory purposes as a fixed-income security (possibly of investment grade) by a major regulatory agency for financial institutions or institutional investors, e.g., National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) investment classifications assigned by the NAIC Securities Valuation Office or the offices of individual state insurance commissioners. However, in general the maximum incremental tax benefits that can be generated are smaller than in the case of tax-exempt fixed-income securities.","The combined investment value of the tax deductions generated by the various components may be greater than, equal to, or lower than the tax deductions associated with the original tax-exempt or taxable asset (s). Since creating an entity to hold the original securities requires a diversion of a portion of the asset cash flow stream to pay administrative expenses associated with maintenance of the entity, component separation of securities is likely to be of interest only when the combined value of tax deductions generated by the components exceeds tax deductions associated with the original asset (s).","In general, determining a schedule of economic benefits associated with various equity interests in the entity, valuing the tax deductions associated with the components, and pricing of the components as fixed-income securities, are computation-intensive procedures.","C. Automated Support","To efficiently offer the above-described financial products, it would be best to use automated means to do computing and data processing, i.e., machine, manufacture, and process applied to supporting the proper structuring and pricing of the components. Efficiency also dictates a need to use automated means to incorporate the computational output in generating financial documents associated with a separated purchase transaction.","Therefore, the invention has an object providing a machine, manufacture, and process for providing applied to financial analytical data automation, including pricing data, for the decomposition of property.","A further object of the invention is to provide the same applied to supporting a new financing product that is based on providing financing of preferably fifteen years or less, while also allowing taxable investors to avoid tax problems encountered with typical mortgage financing.","Another object of the invention is to provide the same applied to calculating financial particulars of the property based on the concept that the source of property value is property rights that can be split and separately valued.","Another object of the invention is to provide the same applied to using the financial particulars in efficiently tailoring financial documents to support transactions involving property components.","Another object of the present invention is to provide the same applied to real estate as the property.","Still another object of the invention is to provide the same applied to supporting the decomposition of real estate into an estate for years and a remainder interest, particularly for computing the price, including tax, of these components.","Still another object of the invention is to provide the same to computing the after-tax yield for the estate for years and the equivalent pretax yield that would be required to obtain the same after-tax return from a bond.","Yet another object of the present invention is to provide the same applied to equity interests in entities that hold tax-exempt securities or pools of tax-exempt securities as the property.","Yet another object of the invention is to provide the same applied to supporting the decomposition of equity interests in entities that hold tax-exempt securities or pools of tax-exempt securities into estate for years and remainder interests, particularly for computing the price, including tax, of these components.","Still another object of the invention is to provide the same applied to analyzing the returns offered based on certain assumptions to inform potential investors of the range of outcomes as they relate to certain inputs.","Still another object of the invention is to provide the same applied to generating data so that comparisons can be made to alternative investment opportunities.","These and other objects are addressed by a digital computer having a logic means for controlling electrical signal processing and modification. The logic means can be completely hard wired or it can be programmable so that one or more computer programs can run on the digital computer. Preferably an embodiment includes a computer program running on a programmable digital computer system to provide financial analytical data concerning decomposed property. The computer system is connected to receive information representing a description of the characteristics of the property from a data input means, such as a keyboard. The computer system also outputs computed data and documentation to an output means and saves the output financial analysis to a memory system. The computer system also has a second means for automatically controlling the digital computer to produce financial documents from the financial analysis and model documents stored in the memory system.","The computer system uses as input data information obtained from a variety of sources, including The Wall Street Journal tabulation of daily Treasury bond interest rates, insurance company weekly publications that list private placement debt risk premia, the property offering documents, and the property lease documents. For applications to tax-exempt finance, the computer system also uses tax-exempt bond finance interest rates tabulated and published daily by such sources as Telerate Systems.","With this information, it is possible to compute the-following: (1) the optimal choice of the estate for years term to maximize profitability of the components; (2) whether risk characteristics of either component are appropriate for inclusion in a prospective investor's portfolio; and if so, (3) whether an expected return justifies the system-determined purchase price.","A. Financial Innovation",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["2","4","2","2","6","2","8","10"]},"The term of separation usually coincides with the remaining term on the existing tenant lease, and is almost never longer than the shortest remaining tenant lease term. The estate for years component can, therefore, be viewed as a fixed-income asset, but tax considerations may dictate whether the remainder component is viewed as a pure equity asset or as a mixture of pure equity and fixed-income.","When component separation takes place, Subject Property  is sold to the Financial Intermediary , and two trusts may be established to acquire actual titles to the respective components. For example, the estate for years can be a term of years interest. In the case of real estate as the property, one trust is issued a deed to the term of years interest by the property seller and the other trust is issued a deed to the remainder interest by the property seller. In the case of tangible personal property as the property, one trust is issued a bill of sale for the term of years interest by the property seller and the other trust is issued a bill of sale for the remainder interest by the property seller.","Any existing property debt is retired at, or prior to, the time of acquisition. An obligation of any trustee of the trust for the Estate for Years  is to preserve title to the estate for years and to prevent any property encumbrances from being established during the separation term.","If there is an estate for years trust, it has a term beneficial interest, and if there is a remainder interest trust it has a remainder beneficial interest. The term beneficiary has all rights and obligations of estate for years ownership during the trust term except a right to encumber the property or petition a court to terminate or dissolve the estate for years\/remainder interest structure. A remainder beneficiary enjoys no rights or benefits until the term interest expires, and then enjoys all rights and benefits of the fee simple title.","In this case, the term beneficial interest becomes the (fixed-income) estate for years component, and the remainder beneficial interest becomes the remainder component.","The components are both viewed as personal property for legal purposes. Ownership of either component can be transferred without affecting the legal status or investment characteristics of the Subject Property  or the other component. Similarly, while legal judgments against the owner of either component can create a lien against that component, such judgments cannot create a lien against the Subject Property  or the other component.","For tax purposes (usually for United States tax purposes), the holder of the estate for years component (or an equity interest therein) is usually entitled to amortize the acquisition cost (e.g., purchase price) of the estate for years component (or the acquisition cost of the equity interest therein) over the portion of the estate for years term remaining after acquisition of the estate for years component (or the equity interest therein).","Alternatively, the estate for years holder may be entitled to both depreciation and amortization deductions. In this case however, the value of the deductions is interleaved, not additive. That is, although the combined deduction would be greater than the amortization deduction alone, the combined deduction would be smaller than the sum of the amortization and depreciation deductions.","As an additional alternative, in some cases in which there is a single entity for both the estate for years and remainder components, the estate for years holder may be entitled to cost recovery in the form of depreciation of the temporally decomposed property in lieu of amortization of the estate for years purchase price. These situations usually involve tangible personal property and leases with terms that are longer than the statutory cost recovery period for that type of property, in which cost recovery via depreciation is faster for the estate for years investor than cost recovery via amortization of the estate for years price over the lease term.","Whichever cost recovery deduction schedule is claimed by the estate for years holder, the tax treatment of the estate for years will be different from the treatment claimed by the holder of conventional taxable debt, because for tax purposes, the estate for years is an income-producing asset rather than a debt instrument.","If the estate for years component holder is a corporate investor, then the tax write-offs accruing from component separation are available to offset taxes on either passive or operating income.","Separation is facilitated if the lease(s) is triple-net, i.e., during the trust term, the lease(s) obligates the tenant to the estate for years component holder for property management and maintenance, payment of taxes, and property insurance. Thus, absent a default by a tenant, the rights and obligations of the estate for years component holder involve the right to receive scheduled net rental payments, while the benefits of property occupancy belong to the tenant. The only claim of the estate for years component holder on any property asset is a contingent one, in event of a tenant default.","In a tenant default, the estate for years component holder has recourse against the tenant as prescribed by property law and the lease covenants. This recourse against both tenant financial assets and the remaining portion of term property occupancy rights is the subject of traditional principles of property law. The availability of tax write-offs accruing from component separation continues unaffected by a tenant default event.","The default risk associated with the estate for years is identical to the default risk associated with tenant general obligation debt. The expected value of the combined estate for years default claims compares favorably with the claims available to the holders of tenant unsubordinated debentures.","Leased and unleased property have different investment characteristics. The nature of this difference can be illustrated by considering the extreme cases of two unleveraged general purpose single-tenant properties of similar size, location, and architecture, one perpetually leased on a triple-net basis to an investment-grade tenant, the other momentarily unleased.","In the case of the perpetually leased property, all future rental cash flows are determined. Absent tenant default, there will be no future rental negotiations. Thus, there are no present values that fluctuate with changes in the spot market for comparable space, implying that the value of this property does not depend on the real estate market. Property value in this case depends solely on the contracted values of future net cash flows, tenant credit risk, and long-term interest rates. In other words, this asset has the investment characteristics of tenant debt.","By contrast, all future rentals from the unleased property are as yet undetermined, and the present value of these rentals fluctuates with expectations about the future evolution of the spot rental market. In short, this asset is a pure real estate equity investment, with no fixed-income component.","Typical institutional-grade property is not well represented by either extreme. Such property is usually fully leased or almost-fully leased for a reasonable period of time, with arrangements for tenant occupancy beyond that period open to future negotiation. As in the case of perpetually leased property, existing leases have the investment characteristics of fixed-income assets, whereas the speculative risk dimensions investors associate with equity real estate are due entirely to the remaining rights in the property asset: the right to future rental opportunities after existing leases expire.","By securitizing net-leased property to separate ownership of current leases from ownership of future leases, the net-leased property is decomposed into estate for years and pure equity remainder components. The estate for years components are appropriate for investors interested in traditional fixed-income investments, while the pure equity remainders are appropriate for real estate investors, speculators, and tax-exempt institutions interested in acquiring portfolio diversification benefits of real estate at a fraction of the cost for all components of the real estate.","The separation of property into components can create major tax benefits if property is properly securitized and the components are sold to independent investors in a simultaneous three-way transaction.","As part of the undivided property, most of the lease cash flows are taxable income, while as a stand-alone asset, most of the lease cash flows are tax-exempt. This suggests a change in the appropriate buyers for lease income streams. As part of whole property, lease income produces the greatest after-tax benefit for tax-exempt institutions; whereas, packaged as stand-alone assets with incremental tax deductions, taxable institutions are natural investors.","The present value of the incremental tax deductions generated during the estate for years term by separation of ownership into components is an enhancement to property value. This implies that the combined market values of securitized components should be greater than the value of unsecuritized property. The tax deductions themselves can also be viewed as a fixed-income asset, which can be valued by fixed-income techniques. Alternatively, the combined value of incremental tax deductions and the lease income stream can be valued by fixed-income techniques as a single fixed-income package.","From a tax perspective, the estate for years is an income-producing asset; from the return\/risk perspective, it is an asset-backed bond. Unlike commercial mortgages, the default claims generated by the estate for years have recourse against financial assets held by the entities who have obligated themselves to make the cash flow payments.","The example herein involves a single-tenant property; the case of multitenant property component separation is slightly more complicated if the lease terms of tenants vary. Because the estate for years must have the characteristics of a fixed income asset, it may be that a credit enhancing instrument such as an insurance policy against tenant default will have to be created to wrap around the lease agreements to achieve the characteristics of a marketable fixed income asset. The use of such an enhancement may broaden the application of the separation process in both single-tenant and multitenant property by creating investment-grade estate for years fixed-income components in properties without investment-grade tenants. Alternatively, there may be cases of properties with below-investment-grade tenants in which it is not cost-effective to reduce the default risk of the estate for years components with credit enhancement insurance. In these cases, equity interests in the estate for years components will be ratable as fixed-income securities, for example, that are below investment-grade, where the term \u201cratable\u201d refers throughout this investment description to fixed-income ratings assigned by widely recognized investment rating agencies such as Standard and Poor's and Moody's Investors Service, or classifiable for regulatory purposes as fixed-income securities, for example, that are below investment-grade, by a major regulatory agency for financial institutions or institutional investors, e.g., National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) investment classifications assigned by the NAIC Securities Valuation Office or the offices of individual state insurance commissioners.","In the case of single-tenant property, the estate for years default risk is determined by the tenant credit rating. Thus, the estate for years default risk is identical to the default risk of tenant debentures. In the event of tenant default, the estate for years owner has the same claim on tenant financial assets as holders of tenant debentures, so long as the tenant does not declare bankruptcy.","In tenant bankruptcy, the estate for years holder has a combination of claims with combined values that can be shown to exceed the expected recovery rate on defaulted corporate debentures, as determined by average prices on publicly traded debentures immediately after default and by asset recovery rates subsequent to defaults on unsubordinated general obligation debt.","In other words, estate for years default risk is the same as default risk on general obligation tenant debt, but in default the loss risk is less. This can be reflected in pricing the component, as illustrated below.","One possibility is to generate an investment-grade estate for years component (e.g., a component such that at least one certificate evidencing ownership or beneficial ownership of the component, a fractional interest therein, or an equity interest therein, is an investment-grade security), for example, with between four percent (4%) and six and one half percent (6-\u00bd%) after-tax yields under current property market conditions. This is an after-tax premium of between 20 and 170 basis points over corporate debentures of comparable credit risk. Alternatively, this represents an approximate pre-tax equivalent premium of between 25 and 230 basis points for taxable buyers in a 36% marginal tax bracket.","These premia can be expected to erode slowly as the markets for the property components develop. Sellers will learn to value each component separately in arriving at property valuation. (To value each component, one could use separate computer systems to compute such valuation for each component separately. In effect, this approach is the invention disclosed herein divided into two computer systems, one for each component. Such an approach is viewed as an equivalent to the present invention.) In any case, eventually multiple bidders for estate for years interests will drive estate for years yield premia down to double or single-digit basis points. However, by placing the estate for years interests privately, dissemination of this embodiment of the investment technology may lag.","In short, when viewed as a financial asset, unleveraged commercial property is a portfolio comprised of at least two components with different investment characteristics: a fixed-income asset essentially consisting of all ownership rights while existing leases are in place, and a pure equity component essentially consisting of all ownership rights after existing leases expire.","B. Computer System","The present invention is directed to a computer system for manipulating digital electrical signals to produce an illustration of a decomposition of property into separately valued components. The computer system includes a digital electrical computer controlled by a processor. A first logic means controls the processor in manipulating digital electrical signals representing input data to the computer, the input data characterizing at least two components decomposed from the property. The manipulating includes transforming the digital electrical signals into modified digital electrical signals representing respective values for each of the components, the values being computed to reflect taxation for the components. Input means is electrically coupled to the computer and operable for converting the input data (which can be entered manually) into the digital electrical signals and communicating the digital electrical signals to the computer. Output means is electrically coupled to receive the modified digital electrical signals from the computer and to convert the modified digital electrical signals representing the respective values into an illustration of the computed respective prices.","The computer system can additionally include a second logic means for controlling the processor in further manipulating the electrical signals, the further manipulating producing at least one financial document for one of the components, the financial document being constructed in response to electrical signals representing preexisting text and stored in memory accessed by said computer and in response to said modified digital electrical signals representing the respective values.","The computer system can be used in cooperation with one or more computer systems in respective locations to either recompute the computations (i.e., signal processing) discussed above or do supplemental computations (i.e., signal processing) as discussed below.","The property can be any property or divisible property right. Preferably, the property is real estate, but in another preferred embodiment, the property is a tax-exempt security.","More particularly, with reference to , the hardware, input, and output of a Computer System  according to the present invention are shown. The System  includes a Digital Computer , such as an IBM-compatible personal computer with a DOS operating system. Digital Computer  preferably has a model 486 central processor or a 386 central processor with a math coprocessor. Digital Computer  is operably linked to a Keyboard , for receiving Input Data  (described more particularly below with regard to ) and converting it into electrical signals. Digital Computer  also is operably linked to output means, such as a Monitor  and a Printer  (such as a dot-matrix or laser printer) for outputting Financial Analysis Output  (described more particularly below with regard to Specimen ) and Processed Component Financial Documents  (described more particularly below with regard to Specimens  and ).","Digital Computer  is additionally operably linked to Memory System , comprising a means for storing Logic Means , such as a diskette or a hard disk, and a means for communicating the Logic Means  to the Digital Computer , such as a disk drive. Logic Means  can be a LOTUS  (Version 2.01 or higher) computer program, which is used to produce Specimen , though as described subsequently, a program dedicated to the purposes of this invention would be preferable.","When loaded and running on Digital Computer , Logic Means  controls the Computer System  transforming the electrical signals from Keyboard  into electrical signals associated with constructing files  (or records, if so desired) and of Financial Analysis Output . Storing a plurality of data files  would be appropriate, for example, for analyzing different separated purchase transactions or for analyzing how one or more changes in Input Data  influence the Financial Analysis Output .","Memory System  also stores a Word Processing Program , such as Word Perfect 5.1. Word Processing Program  is useful for constructing and editing text files to be printed via Printer  as Processed Component Financial Documents .","Preferably, one text file includes a Stored Model Financial Document For the Estate For Years , for example, an organizational document (e.g., for an entity for the estate for years real estate component such that certificates evidencing equity interest in the entity are securities, as exemplified in Specimen ) or a disclosure document for securities law purposes for the securitized estate for years real estate component (e.g., for an equity interest in the securitized estate for years real estate component, as exemplified in Specimen ). Another text file includes Stored Model Financial Document For Remainder Component , for example, an organizational document e.g., for an entity for the remainder real estate component such that certificates evidencing equity interest in the entity are securities, as exemplified in Specimen ) or a disclosure document for securities law purposes for the securitized remainder real estate component (e.g., for an equity interest in the securitized remainder real estate component, as exemplified in Specimen ). Still another text file includes Stored Other Financial Documents , detailed subsequently herein.","It is to be explicitly understood that other implementations of the present invention, say, those using a different kind of digital computer, analogous hardware, multiple computer systems, comparable input and output, a computer program or programs written in a different language, or a hardwired system replacing the computer program, are entirely acceptable and equivalent to the present invention. Also the invention can be implemented by hardwired logic in a handheld calculator. When software is loaded into, and running, a programmable computer, the software sets what in effect are many, many \u201cswitches,\u201d and the result can be considered a new computer machine, with logic formed from the set switches. Instead of setting the switches, an equivalent would be to hardwire the same or equivalent circuitry. Therefore, whether a configurable device is configured to the requirements of the present invention, or a device is constructed from scratch solely for meeting the requirements of the present invention, is a distinction without a difference from an electrical signal processing standpoint. All these embodiments are different species of the present invention that are within the contemplated scope of the present invention.","Logic Means ","Focusing more particularly on Logic Means , it should be recognized that System  is intended for a specific purpose, for operation under certain assumptions, to compute the values of components decomposed from property, and to provide documentation thereof; System  involves certain Input Data  and Financial Analysis Output , each of which is discussed below in greater detail.","1. Purpose","The Logic Means , in conjunction with the rest of System , is intended to facilitate financial transactions involving the separate components of property, preferably commercial real estate in a separated purchase transaction. For a separated purchase transaction to take place, the sum of the prices the two investors agree to pay for their respective components should theoretically be at least equal to a price at which the owner is willing to sell the property.","Logic Means  partially automates financial considerations that take into account the different investment characteristics of the two components. This facilitates or reduces the cost for, carving a property value into respective values, which can be treated as prices, for the estate for years and the remainder interest. In addition, Logic Means , in conjunction with Digital Computer , calculates various financial parameters to assist prospective purchasers in deciding whether the components are suitable as investments at the respective sale prices.","Logic Means , in conjunction with Digital Computer , calculates throughout the estate for years the values and tax bases of the separate components so that the sale and purchase of each component may take place privately or through a financial exchange established to provide liquidity in a market in which none presently exists.","Further, Logic Means , in conjunction with Digital Computer , provides accounting support to the estate for years investor by computing, on both annual and quarterly bases, the tax deductions generated by the property and the estate for years. These deductions may be used by the estate for years investor to reduce taxes on income produced by the estate for years and in certain other taxable operations. Because these deductions affect the basis of the remainder interest upon expiration of the estate for years, the accounting support set forth is also necessary for the remainder interest.","Logic Means  can also be used in conjunction with Word Processing Program  to efficiently incorporate Financial Analysis Output  into Financial Documents  (and to edit and revise the stored Model Financial Documents  and  for each separate purchase transaction) for each of the components.","2. Assumptions","The Logic Means  is intended to support the separated purchase transaction of real estate in which the estate for years has a definite and specified term, and in which the property is leased for rent prior to, or coincident with, the separated purchase transaction. For the estate for years to be an asset with fixed-income investment characteristics, the term of the estate for years is normally no longer than the shortest term remaining on the lease(s). That is, the estate for years entitles the holder to the right to receive the net cash flows from the existing leases until the end of the term. Furthermore, the risk of default on the scheduled cash flow(s) is determined by either the lowest-rated tenant credit risk or the value-weighted average credit risk of the tenants, with the former the norm.","It is assumed in this embodiment that ownership of the components is structured so that, after the separated purchase transaction, the purchaser(s) of the estate for years is (are) entitled to amortize the estate for years purchase price for tax purposes and also over the estate for years term. Additionally, it is assumed that any depreciation deductions are to be taken by the estate for years purchaser(s). Finally, it is assumed in this embodiment that the entire investment return on any preferred equity interest in the remainder component is insured via residual insurance, that the preferred equity interest does not have any participatory interest in the investment return on the remainder component other than the insured return, and that none of the residual value insurance is left over to insure the return on the residual equity interest in the remainder component. This implies that the preferred interest is a ratable fixed-income asset and that it is usually an investment-grade fixed-income asset in cases in which the residual value insurer has an investment grade credit rating.","In addition, it is assumed in this embodiment that the cost of the residual value insurance is payable in the form of a single up- front insurance premium at the time the property is separated into components. Other embodiments can incorporate general schedules and amounts of residual value insurance premium payments over the estate for years term. Still other embodiments can provide for the possibility that creation of a preferred interest in a remainder component, the purchase of residual value insurance for the preferred interest, or both the creation of a preferred interest in a remainder component and the purchase of residual value insurance for the preferred interest, can occur as one or more events subsequent to separation of the property into estate for years and remainder interests. These and yet other embodiments can also allow for the cost of possible interim financing for the remainder interest prior to the time the residual value insurance takes effect.","3. Pricing the Estate for Years","Under the above assumptions, the risk and return characteristics of the estate for years are those of a fixed-income asset. This implies that prospective investors will price the estate for years as a fixed-income investment, i.e., prospective purchasers will value the estate for years relative to comparable investments available in the bond market at the time of the separated purchase transaction.","Specifically, prospective purchasers of the estate for years will look at the available yield on Treasury securities of comparable cash flow characteristics for a comparable average life, add a risk premium based on the average credit risk of the tenants and, under present market conditions, probably add an additional premium due to the illiquidity of the investment. The sum of the appropriate Treasury rate plus the risk and the illiquidity premiums is a typical fixed income market discount rate for the estate for years.","4. Input Data ","Generally, in order to value the estate for years as a fixed-income investment, a schedule of net cash flows during the estate for years term is determined. Typically, this will comprise a stream of scheduled monthly net rental payments. If the estate for years does not begin on the first day of a month and terminate on the last day of a calendar month, net rental payments could also include fractional monthly rental payments for the first and last months of the estate for years term. In addition, the date of the split purchase transaction, and the date that the estate for years terminates, are also entered as Input Data .","Estate for years valuation also includes the appropriate discount rate for the estate for years. But instead of inputting this number directly, the Logic Means  prompts a request (as Input Data ) for the appropriate annualized Treasury bond interest rate for bonds of an equivalent average life to the estate for years, plus an appropriate risk \/illiquidity premium, as discussed above.","To compute the remainder interest purchase price, the property sale price, together with any extra expenses (i.e., fees and commissions) arising in the securitization of the real estate components, are also entered as Input Data .","To estimate the depreciation and amortization deductions to which the estate for years purchaser is entitled, the Logic Means  assumes that the percentage of the property purchase price represented by land is not depreciable, but that the remaining portion of the purchase price is depreciable, as prescribed by the tax code. Thus, the Logic Means  requires the user to enter the percentage of property value that is not depreciable and the amounts and depreciation schedules for the remaining portions of the purchase price.","To project the after-tax cash flows of the estate for years investor, and hence this investor's projected after-tax income rate, the Logic Means  also uses the projected tax bracket schedule of the estate for years investor as Input Data .","To calculate the implied purchase price of the property for the remainder interest buyer at the time the estate for years expires, the Logic Means  further uses an implied risk-free opportunity cost of capital for the remainder interest buyer, typically though not necessarily the zero-coupon risk-free Treasury rate for the estate for years term, as Input Data .","5. Elements of the Financial Analysis Output","Elements of the Financial Analysis Output  of Logic Means  include (1) a representation of the price for the estate for years component, and (2) a representation of the price for the remainder interest component. The price an estate for years investor is willing to pay can be computed from the net rental cash flows, the interest rates in the bond markets, and the credit ratings of the tenants. The Logic Means  discounts the sequence of net rental payments scheduled during the estate for years term at the required estate for years discount rate to determine an appropriate purchase price for the estate for years. The price a remainder interest investor must pay is computed as the difference between: (1) the sum of the property asking price plus the costs and fees associated with separating the components, and (2) the estate for years valuation. This formula follows because between them the purchasers of the components must come up with the property asking price together with any extra expenses associated with creating the components. If these prices are acceptable to prospective component purchasers, then a separated purchase transaction of the real estate interests can be consummated.","6. Additional Output","In one embodiment of the invention, Logic Means  can have Compute Present Value of Enhancement , which computes the present value of the enhancement in property value due to component separation. This value is computed as the difference between the present value of the estate for years after-tax cash flows, and the after-tax cash flows the estate for years would generate if the estate for years were still a part of undivided property and subject to the same tax deductions available to the owner of undivided property. The discount rate used to compute this present value is the after-tax income yield rate for both sets of cash flows.","Logic Means  outputs the present value of the enhancement in two forms: expressed as a dollar amount, and expressed as a percentage of the gross property sale price.","The present value of the enhancement must be greater than the cost of extra fees and commissions due to securitization, in order for component separation to be a value-enhancing process.","Value enhancement is a rough measure of the attractiveness of component separation in each prospective transaction. However, it is not used directly in pricing components, nor in preparing documentation describing investment characteristics of the components.","7. Computer Screens and Logic","A preferred embodiment of this invention would involve a stand alone computer and a computer program (Logic Means ) stored on a hard disk (of Memory System ) of a 486 Personal computer (Digital Computer ). Unlike a hardwired equivalent embodiment, a programmable Computer System  is more readily adaptable to produce whatever output a user of Computer System  may desire with respect to a prospective separated purchase transaction. The preferred programming language is structured BASIC, although C, Fortran, or any other language with mathematical formulaic capabilities is acceptable. The operating version of the computer program for users should be in compiled code.","The Logic Means  includes Shell , which permits the option of accessing Word Processing Program  or a Title Screen  of a data processing system. Title Screen  informs the user of the name and ownership of the Logic Means , notice of any copyrights or patents that involve the invention, etc.","The Title Screen  leads to a Menu  screen created by Computer System  to query the user as to whether the user wants to retrieve one of the Data Files  stored from a previous run of the Logic Means  that the user saved in Memory System  or to create a new data file to become a new one of the stored Data Files . If the user makes a menu selection indicating that the Logic Means  should retrieve one of the stored Data Files , the Logic Means  asks on a Retrieve Stored Data File Screen  for the name and directory of the selected Data File . Block  performs the function of recalling the appropriate one of Data File .","Otherwise, the user can make a menu selection at Block  to create a New Data File . Regardless of which of these selections is made, Logic Means  displays a Data Form  like Screen  of Specimen , which will either have blank spaces to receive Input Data  to fill in the Data Form or will already be completed as a stored Data File . Specimen , Screen , herein is a representation of a completed data form. This representation, which is illustrative only, involves 10-year leases and a certain pattern of rents, and as such, it is a limited illustration of the capabilities of the invention discussed herein. Also, a portion of the Financial Analysis Output  is presented in Screen  and Screen  of Specimen , which is a simplification over the use of a dedicated program to generate the Financial Analysis Output  after all of the Input Data  has been entered.","The Logic Means  has an Input\/Edit Data Form  screen adapted to receive Input Data  from the user by manual operation of Keyboard . Thereby, the user is able to enter or edit a column of rents until all payments have been entered. The user is also able to edit data on the data form, as is discussed more particularly below. Editing a data form recalled from Data File  efficiently enables recomputing similar data without having to enter data all anew. Instructions informing the user of which keys perform the functions can appear at the top or bottom of the screen. After the user is satisfied that all information solicited in the data form has been entered correctly, the user enters a command to enable Data Processing . The Logic Means , in conjunction with Digital Computer , calculates the output parameters indicated in  to produce a new Data Form as Financial Analysis Output  in FIG. .","The Logic Means  also provides options to Print  the Financial Analysis Output  and to Store  the Financial Analysis Output  as a Data File . The user makes a selection at Blocks  and  by pressing an appropriate key on Keyboard .","The Logic Means  returns to the Main Menu  to either repeat the aforesaid sequence or to quit  to the Shell . The action of pressing an exit key at any point in the sequence, if this feature is used, should bring up a fail-safe screen requesting the user to confirm the exit instruction by pressing another designated key, or cancel the exit instruction by pressing any other key.","From Shell , the user can alternatively enter a selection to call up the Word Processing Program . Word Processing Program  can access the Stored Model Estate For Years Financial Document  or the Stored Model Remainder Component Financial Document  or other financial documents to modify the selected document to include information computed from Process Data . This information can include the expected returns under various performance scenarios, the price, and various quantitative descriptions of risk, e.g., prices under various scenarios. Process Data  can be contained entirely within one computer or can encompass a group of at least two computers that communicate electronically. Thus, computations of the expected returns under the various performance scenarios can take place entirely within one computer or can take place within a group of computers that communicate computations and\/or data on the expected returns under the various investment scenarios electronically within the group. Similarly, computations of the prices under the various performance scenarios can take place entirely within one computer or can take place within a group of computers that communicate computations and\/or data on the prices under the various investment scenarios electronically within the group.","Edit  involves editing any of the stored model documents of Block , Block , and Block , particularly to incorporate information from a Stored Data File . Print Document  permits printing the modified selected document at Printer  as one of the Processed Component Financial Documents . Store Document  permits storing the modified selected document via Memory System . Quit to Word Processing Program  inquires whether the user prefers to return to Word Processing Program  to repeat a loop defined thereby, or to go to the Shell .","Other Stored Model Financial Document  represents other financial documentation required to successfully place the securitized components. For each component, these include at least one securities document, e.g., one or more of the following group: an organizational document for an entity such that a certificate evidencing an ownership or equity interest in the entity is a security, a security evidencing an ownership or equity interest in such an entity, and a disclosure document for securities law purposes, such as an offering memorandum, prospectus, or term sheet, which would normally include some or all of the following.\n\n","A portion of the Financial Analysis Output  is presented in Screens - of Specimen , which is a simplification over the use of a dedicated program to generate the Financial Analysis Output  after all of the Input Data  has been entered.","Turning now to , the input and computational logic of a preferred embodiment of Logic Means  is detailed. The logic of Input Date A  receives entry of the date on which a separated purchase transaction is to take place, and Input Date B  receives entry of the expiration date for the estate for years. The transaction date and the estate for years expiration date should be entered as numbers, i.e., the number of the month, the number of the day, so that the length of the period between the two dates can be easily computed in Compute Estate For Years Term . Block  computes the number of whole and fractional months in the estate for years term, both as an output and for use elsewhere in the logic in computing discounted presented values and the schedules of annual and quarterly depreciation and amortization deductions, as discussed subsequently.","Usually, the end of the estate for years term will be on the last day of a calendar month, and the transaction date will be on the first or last day of a calendar month. Thus Block  stores the number of days in any fractional calendar month at the beginning or end of the term, if any, separately from, and in addition to, the length of the term (i.e., Block  keeps the number of days in beginning and end fractional calendar months separate from each other). By subtracting the separated purchase date from the expiration date of the estate for years, the Logic Means  can be used to compute the length of the estate for years term (e.g., \u201c10 years\u201d, \u201c9 years 8 months\u201d, or \u201c9 years 10 months 11 days\u201d).","The Logic Means  also includes Input Treasury Bond Yield Rates  and Input Rental Income Risk Rates  for respectively receiving entry of the Treasury bond yield curve and the rental risk premium curve as a function of the yield curve. The output of Block , which is only slightly sensitive to changes in position on the yield curve, is used interactively to select the appropriate Treasury bond rate and rental income risk premium.","The data entered in Blocks  and  are used in Compute Rental Income Rate , which adds the data to compute the rental income yield rate, which is the discount rate used to value the pretax net rental payment cash flows. Rather than treating the value as an input, the Logic Means  has the user input the corresponding Treasury bond yield rate and the rental income risk premium appropriate for the tenant credit ratings. The rental income yield rate is computed in Block  as the sum of the Treasury bond yield rate and the rental risk premium.","The Logic Means  also has Tax Bracket  for receiving input data representing the tax bracket of the estate for years purchaser. The estate for years purchaser will usually be a taxable investor, in order to take advantage of the tax deductions associated with ownership of the estate for years asset. The Logic Means  computes the after-tax income yield rate, (i.e., the marginal after-tax interest rate the estate for years investor receives on income from senior debentures of the same default risk as the estate for years) in Block . The computation is the product of the pretax interest rate on those debentures (obtained from Block ) multiplied by one minus the tax bracket of the estate for years purchaser (obtained from Block ).","Input Gross Rental Payment , which is applicable for non-triple net leases, receives the projected gross rental payment. Input Property-Related Ownership Costs , which is also applicable for non-triple net leases, receives the projected ownership costs. Input Wrap Insurance Costs  is actually a part of Input Block  in the case of non-triple net leases, but is broken out and made a separate input in the case of triple-net leases that are not bondable. This is the schedule of insurance payments for the wrap insurance policies needed to upgrade a non-bondable triple-net lease to bondable status.","Compute Scheduled Net Rental Payments  receives the data input in Blocks , , and  to compute net rental payments during the estate for years term, as mentioned above. However, for triple-net leases, Block  can be an input of net rental payments, with Blocks  and  unnecessary, and Block  optional or unnecessary: (1) unnecessary in the case of bondable triple-net leases; and (2) optional for other triple-net leases, depending on whether or not insurance to upgrade the triple-net lease to bondable status is cost-effective. If the user selects to enter the monthly rental payments manually, the Logic Means presents Screen  with the aforementioned two columns: a list of the calendar months in the estate for years term (beginning with the month that includes the transaction date, and ending with the month that includes the expiration date of the estate for years security) on the left, and corresponding spaces for rental payments on the right. Alternatively, in the (typically occurring) cases of leases which have constant net rental payments, or for which the term can be divided into a small number of subterms during each of which the net rental payments are constant, the various net rents and the periods to which they apply may be entered in lieu of a month-by-month net rent schedule.","The data input in Block  is used in Compute Estate for Years Purchase Price . The estate for years purchase price, which is implied by the rental income yield rate, is the discounted present value of the net scheduled rental payments, valued at the rental income yield rate computed in Block . If the transaction date is the first day of a calendar month, and the estate for years term consists of a whole number of months, then Formula 1 gives this value. \n\n\nwhere r=the annual rental income yield rate, and N=the number of months in the estate for years term.\n","The data input for Block  together with the output of Block  is used in Block  to compute the weighted average life, half life, and duration, for the Estate for Years. One or more of these values\u2014the weighted average is currently the preferred choice\u2014is typically used by investors to determine which value on the Treasury yield curve is the most suitable choice for input through Block . Because these values only vary by relatively small amounts as the inputs from Blocks  and  are varied, rough estimates of the correct place on the yield curve can be used for these inputs, with the output of Block  then used iteratively to correct the original estimates; alternatively, the iterative loop can be omitted, and instead performed manually by the user to select among candidate yield curve values and converge interactively to the appropriate place on the yield curve based upon the output of Block . If the manual mode is employed, one, two or at most three, iterations will be required to converge to the correct yield curve value.","The Logic Means  additionally has Input Property Valuation  for receiving input data representing a property valuation of the real estate; Input Extra Fees  is for receiving input data representing fees and expenses incurred in structuring the separated purchase transaction. The securitization and separation of a property into components often entails greater costs than a traditional real estate sale. Those investing in the components are willing to pay the additional cost because, after a split purchase, the combined values of the two components is greater than the value of the real estate before the purchase as shown in , due to additional tax deductions available after the real estate interests have been divided.","The gross property sale price is computed in Property Sale Price  as the sum of the value of the undivided property (from Block ) and the incremental expenses required to split the real estate into components (from Block ). Expenses beyond those required in a conventional real estate transaction are considered here.","Compute Cap Rate  computes a rather crude indicator of the return on the investment. The cap rate is computed by dividing the total first year rent (from Block ) by the gross property sale price of the undivided property (from Block ).","Remainder Interest Purchase Price  computes the remainder interest purchase price as whatever amount in addition to the estate for years purchase price is required to put together the price required to purchase the real estate. This value is computed by subtracting the estate for years purchase price (from Block ) from the gross property sale price (from Block ).","Remainder Interest Implied Annual Return  computes the remainder interest component implied annual return, which is the annualized return the remainder interest investor will have earned if the value of the property when the estate for years expires is determined by multiplying Input Future Remainder Value  by Input Property Valuation . Input Future Remainder Value  is the expected remainder value at the end of the estate for years term, expressed as percentage of Input Property Valuation . In the case of institutional grade real estate, the input value received by Input Future Remainder Value  will frequently be close or equal to 100%, reflecting the frequently applicable assumption that the value of the decomposed property is expected to change little or not at all across the estate for years term.","This interest rate is the only unknown quantity in Formula 2, which is set forth below.","(2) Expected Property Valuation=(Remainder Component Purchase Price)\n\n","Input Rental Area  is for receiving data input representing the rentable area in the real estate. This data is used in Remainder Price Per Square Foot  to compute the remainder price per square foot, which is computed by dividing the remainder interest purchase price (from Block ) by the number of rentable square feet in the property (from Block ).","Input Zero-Coupon Risk-Free Rate  is for receiving data input representing the zero-coupon risk-free rate. Then, in Block , the price per square foot that the remainder interest buyer is paying at the time the remainder interest matures into full ownership of the property is computed as equaling the amount to which the remainder price per square foot increases when it accrues interest at the zero-coupon risk-free rate. Formula 3 is used to compute this value.","(3) Price\/Sq. Ft.=(Remainder Price\/Sq. Ft.) (1+zero-coupon risk-free rate)(1+(N\/12\u2212[N\/12])(zero-coupon risk-free rate))","where N=number of months in the estate for years term, and [N\/12] =the largest integer that is less than or equal to N\/12.","Although this is the correct formula for a comparison of remainder interest prices at the beginning and end of the estate for years term in an arbitrage-free market, the remainder interest investor may find it more instructive to transforming this equation into a capital budgeting relation by substituting the remainder interest investor's opportunity cost of equity or debt capital for the risk-free rate.","Percentage of Property Value Not Depreciable  is for receiving input data representing a percentage of property value represented, in the case of real estate, by the land. If a conservative cost recovery position is taken by the estate for years investor and only amortization is claimed as a tax deduction, which is the likeliest scenario at the current time, then this input is unnecessary. If depreciation as well as amortization is claimed by the estate for years holder, then this value is used in Block  to compute the schedule of depreciation and amortization tax deductions, together with the resulting adjustments to the estate for years tax basis. These must be computed very carefully because if both deductions are claimed then the deductions are not completely independent of each other, and because the interaction is complex and subtle.","Under present tax law, during the estate for years term, the estate for years is entitled at least to a deduction computed by straight line amortization of the estate for years acquisition cost, and possibly depreciation deductions as well, with reductions in each end-of-year tax basis computed in accordance with established tax accounting principles.","After computing the values of these annual deductions, the investor allocates fractions of the deductions to each tax quarter as instructed in the present tax code (e.g., if the first year is the entire calendar year, one quarter of each deduction is allocated to each quarter), and the tax basis is reduced accordingly on a quarterly basis.","The quarter-by-quarter amortization and depreciation deductions, and the corresponding quarterly adjustments to the estate for years tax basis, will be entered into a preformatted table. This table will be available for viewing on the Monitor , can be stored with the other output data if saved in Data File  by the user of Computer System , and can be printed at Printer  if the user presses a designated key on the Keyboard . (It should be noted that this invention uses the tax code, whatever it may require, in decomposing the real estate into separate components; the invention of the computer system and methods involving it of course do not depend upon the present tax laws.)","Block  computes quarterly tax payments by subtracting the quarterly tax deductions from the quarterly net rental payments, and multiplying the result by the tax bracket of the estate for years investor. This is output since it is part of the accounting support for the estate for years investor.","Typically, tax payments are made by institutional investors four times per year, in the middle of months 1, 4, 7, and 10. The after-tax income component yield, which is computed in Block , is the after-tax yield to the estate for years buyer, and is the internal rate of return on the after-tax net rental cash flows. For rental payments made at the beginning of each month, it is preferred to divide the year into twenty-four (24) semi-monthly periods with cash flows at the beginning of each period. With this approach, the pretax rents are the cash flows in the odd-numbered periods (i.e., periods , , , . . . , , ), while the tax payments are the cash flows in periods , , ,  (in the other even-numbered periods, the cash flows are treated as being equal to zero).","An alternative is to simplify the calculation conceptually for the estate for years holder by assuming that tax deductions occur with the same frequency as the cash flows (typically, on a monthly basis), and matching the occurrence of the tax deductions with the corresponding cash flows. In this case, for computational purposes the year will be divided into the same number of periods as the expected frequency of cash flows\u2014typically, twelve periods, or monthly.","In Pretax Income Component Yield , the pretax income component yield is computed as the pretax interest rate that the estate for years buyer would have to receive if the estate for years were a bond, in order to be left with the same amount of after-tax income that results from owning the estate for years. This number is computed by dividing the after-tax income component yield (from Block ) by one minus the tax bracket of the estate for years investor (from Block ).","If the estate for years purchaser is a taxable investor, this number will be larger than the rental income yield rate of Block . This occurs because the estate for years is an income-producing asset rather than a bond, and hence income from the estate for years is subject to different tax regulations than income from a bond.","Block  computes the equivalent after-tax estate for years value by discounting the after-tax net rental payments at the after-tax income yield rate. This is the discount rate that would be applied to the after-tax cash flows if the estate for years were a bond.","Block  may compute other measures of the estate for years value by discounting different components of the after-tax cash flows at different discount rates that reflect the different risk characteristics of those components (e.g., discounting the pretax cash flows, tax payments, and tax deductions at rates that reflect the different degrees of certainty that they will be realized as projected at the time of component separation).","In cases in which the remainder component is to be decomposed into a preferred fixed-income interest and a residual equity interest, Input Credit Risk Premium Curve receives the credit risk premium curve of the insurer for the preferred interest. Input Extra Months to Retire Preferred  receives the amount of time beyond the estate for years term, if any, that the residual equity interest investor has to refinance or sell the property and pay off the preferred interest holder. Average Life  computes the expected life of the preferred interest in the remainder component by adding the estate for years term to the value received by Input Extra Months to Retire Preferred , which equals the average life of the preferred interest since the preferred interest is a zero-coupon bond. Preferred Interest Annual Return  selects the Treasury bond yield rate from Input Data  and corresponding insurance credit risk premium from Input Data  corresponding to the preferred equity interest average life, and computes the preferred interest annual return by adding the Treasury bond yield rate to the insurance credit risk premium.","Input Insured Property Value  receives the insured value for the property at a date specified by the residual value insurance (e.g., at maturity of the preferred interest), expressed as a percentage of Input Property Valuation . Preferred Interest Purchase Price  converts the insured value for the property to a nominal amount by multiplying Input  and Input  together, and then computes the preferred interest purchase price by discounting the insured property value at maturity of the preferred interest back to the date of the temporal decomposition by the equation:","(4) Preferred Interest Purchase Price=Insured Property Value\/((1+y)(1+(M\/12\u2212[M\/12])y)","where y=preferred interest annual return, and M=number of months in the expected life of the preferred interest.","The cost of decomposing the remainder component into preferred and residual interests is computed in Residual Interest Purchase Price  as the sum of the cost of residual value insurance from Input Insurance Policy Premium  and any additional associated up-front fees from Input Additional Up-Front Fees , such as the costs of obtaining a credit rating for the preferred interest and of generating financial disclosure documents for the preferred and residual interests. Residual Interest Purchase Price  then computes the residual interest purchase price from the equation that the sum of the preferred interest and residual interest purchase prices is equal to the sum of the purchase price of the remainder component from Remainder Interest Purchase Price  and the cost of decomposing the remainder component into the preferred and residual interests. This is a linear equation in which the only unknown quantity is the purchase price of the residual interest, which implies that the equation can be solved for the residual interest purchase price as follows:","(5) Residual Interest Purchase Price=Remainder Component Purchase Price+Residual Value Insurance Policy Premium+Additional Up-Front Fees\u2212Preferred Interest Purchase Price","In some exceptional cases, it may be desirable to use a fraction of the residual value insurance to insure the return on the preferred interest, reserving the remaining fraction of the residual value insurance to insure a portion of the return on the residual interest. This can lower the investment risk associated with the residual interest, enhancing the marketability of the residual interest by sacrificing some residual interest leverage. In such cases, the expression on the right side of Equation (4) for the preferred interest purchase price must be modified as follows: the right side of the equation must be multiplied by the fraction that represents the portion of residual value insurance that is allocated to insurance for the preferred interest return. Equation (5) still provides the solution for the residual interest purchase price in terms of the preferred interest purchase price.","Input Exit Fees  receives the expected future cost of liquidating or refinancing the remainder interest in order to raise the funds required to retire the preferred interest, which cost is expressed as a percentage of the expected property valuation at maturity computed in Block .","Residual Interest Annual Return  computes the expected annual return on the residual interest over the expected life of the preferred\/residual decomposition. This interest rate is the only unknown quantity in the following equation:","(6) Expected Residual Interest Valuation at Maturity=(Residual Interest Purchase Price) (1+z)(1+(M\/12\u2212[M\/12])z)","where Expected Residual Interest Valuation at Maturity is the value obtained by subtracting the sum of the preferred interest valuation at maturity and the expected nominal amount of exit fees from the expected property valuation at maturity from Block , z= residual interest annual return, and M= number of months in the expected life of the preferred interest. The preferred interest valuation at maturity equals the value of the portion of the minimum property value specified by the residual value insurance that is allocated to the preferred interest, which portion usually is equal to the entire amount of the specified minimum property value. The expected nominal amount of exit fees is obtained by multiplying the percentage value from Input Exit Fees  by the nominal value of the expected property valuation at maturity.","Remainder-to-Residual Ratio  divides the remainder interest valuation by the residual interest valuation. This represents the factor by which the amount of equity risk capital required to complete the acquisition and decomposition of the property is reduced via the use of residual value insurance to carve a fixed-income preferred interest out of the remainder component.","Residual Leverage Ratio  computes the factor by which leverage for the equity investor is increased (for the case of the scenario specified by the input values) by carving a preferred fixed-income interest out of the remainder component. This is computed by the following equation:","(7) Residual Leverage Ratio=(Remainder-to-Residual Ratio) (Expected Residual Valuation at Maturity\/Expected Property Valuation)","where Remainder-to-Residual Ratio is obtained from Block , Expected Residual Valuation at Maturity is obtained from Block , and Expected Property Valuation is obtained from Block .","In Blocks  and , the residual interest annual return and the residual leverage ratio are computed net of fees associated with raising the funds required to retire the preferred interest. This is a financially conservative approach to the computation of these values and differs from the approach frequently taken in disclosure documents, which is to compute returns and leverage ratios based on asset values before imposition of any back-end liquidation or refinancing fees. It is important to note that the alternative values for the residual annual return and residual leverage ratio before imposition of back-end fees are also generated by this software, by setting Input Exit Fees  equal to zero.","By contrast, the incorporation of an assumed exit fee at the end of the estate for years term in Remainder Interest Implied Annual Return  and the expected property valuation input to Residual Leverage Ratio  is usually inappropriate in the case of a remainder interest that is not leveraged or decomposed into components, since in this case the remainder interest holder usually does not face an automatic need to refinance the property at the end of the estate for years term. In cases in which the remainder holder is expected to face such a need, expected exit fees can be subtracted from Input Future Remainder Value  either before or after data entry. This modification will flow through automatically to make appropriate modifications for expected remainder holder exit fees to the calculations for Remainder Interest Implied Annual Return  and Residual Leverage Ratio .","Insured Value Per Unit Area  computes the insured value of the property per unit area of rentable space by multiplying the property valuation from Input Property Valuation  by the insured value for the property from Input Insured Property Value  (as specified at maturity of the preferred interest by the residual value insurance and expressed as a percentage of Input Property Valuation ) and dividing the resulting product by the rentable area of the property, usually in square feet, received from Input Rental Area .","In using Computer System  and the Financial Analysis Output , the user of Computer System  can construct financial documents by using a Word Processing Program  to revise such documents as those in Specimen  and Specimen  and the Stored Other Financial Document .

Specimen  illustrates both modes of expression for System  input and output.","To simplify the language in what follows, the remaining discussion will refer to \u201csecurities\u201d in the singular only, i.e., \u201csecurity;\u201d however, it will be understood that the discussion applies both to single-security portfolios and multiple security portfolios held by the partnership. Where possible, the discussion will simply refer to the security as the \u201cpartnership portfolio.\u201d Similarly, the term \u201cinvestor,\u201d when applied to the holders of estate for years and remainder components, is intended to refer to both the singular and plural cases.","The logic of Input Data  receives a schedule of interest rates for AAA publicly traded general obligation municipal bonds of annual maturities from one to thirty-five years. This serves as the analogue of the yield curve for the tax-exempt bond market, i.e., the basis for pricing all other tax-exempt securities, and this input is used by each pricing calculation herein. Input Data  receives a schedule of additional interest investors expect for holding a type of tax-exempt portfolio held by a limited partnership. Block  roughly estimates a remaining average life of the partnership portfolio, selects the corresponding AAA general obligation rate and risk premium, and adds them to obtain the current yield required by the fixed-income market for the partnership portfolio.","Input Data  receives the schedule of payments expected from the partnership portfolio. This will usually be in the form of a file specifying payment values and dates. However, in some cases an alternate description may be appropriate. For example, in the case of a single-security portfolio with constant debt service, the specification of principal value, frequency of payments, and amortization term constitutes a description from which, together with the yield rate from Input Data , a schedule of debt service payments may be reconstructed.","Using data received by Input Data Blocks  and , Block  extracts a schedule of remaining cash flows expected from the partnership portfolio, and computes a present value by discounting the cash flows at the rate received from Block . Based on this present value, an improved estimate of the average life of the portfolio is computed by Block .","Block  uses this improved estimate iteratively to recompute the current portfolio yield, and the recomputed portfolio yield is used by Blocks  and  to recompute the portfolio value and average life, respectively. As discussed earlier, average life is relatively insensitive to changes in the discount rate, so one or two iterations is almost always sufficient to obtain consistent output values that will not change with additional iterations.","This linked iteration is used four more times in the logic of Logic Means : in the calculations of discount rate, and the price, and the average lives of the estate for years and the remainder. The other examples are virtually identical, and will not be discussed separately.","Box  receives a percentage of the partnership that will be separated into estate for years and remainder components, and Box  computes a complementary value of the partnership that will not be separated into components. It is possible that several partnership interests will be separated into components, and that various estate for years components will have distinct terms; however, typically there will be only one partnership interest that will be separated into components, and it will be the entire limited partnership interest. Consequently, the \u201cterm\u201d of the estate for years is clear because usually there is only one estate for years. However, the invention is intended to include the more general case of multiple component separations as well.","The choice of partnership percentage that will be separated into components as an input is arbitrary, at least in the case in which one component is separated into components. It is equally acceptable to input the partnership percentage that will not be separated into components, and to output the percentage of the partnership that will be separated into components.","Block  receives the schedule of partnership cash flows that will be received after the date the components are separated and decomposes the cash flows into interest and repayment of principal portions, using the original interest rate at which the security was issued (from Input Data ). These distinctions are important in valuing the components because, under current federal tax law, only the interest portion of each payment is automatically tax-exempt; the repayment of principal portion is sheltered from federal taxation only to the extent that cost recovery deductions generated by the security are available to the security holder(s).","It will frequently be the case that the original tax-exempt interest rate received by Input Data  equals the current tax-exempt yield rate computed by Block . One natural way for this to occur is if the tax-exempt security in the partnership portfolio is created at the same time as the estate for years and remainder components. In this case, the embodiment of the invention defined herein will generate documentation for the tax-exempt security as well as documentation for the estate for years and remainder components.","Block  multiplies the payment schedules for interest and repayment of principal by the percentage of the partnership that will be separated into components to compute schedules for interest payments and repayment of principal payments that will be split between the components.","The length of the estate for years term received by Input Data  is used by Blocks  and  to split the schedules of interest and repayment of principal payments into schedules of payments that will be received by the estate for years investor and the remainder investor, respectively.","Block  receives the schedule of risk premium values for a security of the type represented by the estate for years. The estate for years risk premium schedule is related to the partnership portfolio risk premium schedule, but may differ due to different investor perceptions of risk in the two types of investments. While credit risk for the estate for years is the same as credit risk for the partnership portfolio, liquidity risk may be different. The liquidity risk will be increased if the estate for years is viewed as more difficult to sell prior to maturity than the partnership portfolio, as will be the case before this product is well-established in the fixed-income marketplace. But the liquidity risk will also lessen because the average life of the estate for years is shorter than the average life of the partnership portfolio. The combined effect on liquidity risk as perceived by investors is difficult to predict, and may have to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.","The estate for years risk premium may also contain a component due to perceived tax risk, i.e., the risk that not all of the predicted incremental tax benefits associated with the estate for years will be received by the estate for years investor. This risk may be substantial in some cases, and nonexistent in others. For example, if the estate for years component carries insurance against loss of economic benefits due to a change in the tax laws, the estate for years investor would not be expected to demand additional return for tax risk, because this investor is not exposed to any risk of economic loss as a consequence of this risk dimension.","For marketing purposes, the estate for years component may disburse cash payments according to a different schedule than the partnership portfolio. For example, the partnership portfolio may receive payments monthly, or at irregular intervals (e.g., if the portfolio contains several securities), whereas the estate for years makes disbursements semiannually. Input Data  receives the frequency of estate for years cash disbursements, and Input Data  receives the tax-exempt interest rate the general partner(s) guarantee to accrue on warehoused payments from the partnership portfolio, usually from a tax-exempt money market fund.","Block  computes the cash payment schedule of the estate for years component. Each payment is computed by adding together the portion of the partnership portfolio disbursements warehoused for the estate for years investor since the last disbursement, and adding to that the interest accrued on the warehoused payments.","Block  computes the estate for years yield rate as in the case of the partnership portfolio yield rate (cf. Block ).","Block  computes the estate for years purchase price by discounting the cash flows from Block . In general, this computation is an interactive process. First, Block  discounts the aftertax estate for years cash flows at the estate for years yield rate computed by Block . This discounts all of the interest portions of the cash flows, but assumes that repayment of principal portions are reduced by tax payments before discounting, where tax payments are computed using the projected tax rates from Input Data .","Next a schedule of estate for years amortization deductions is computed in Block , a present value of amortization deductions is computed by Block , and an updated iterate for the estate for years purchase price is computed by summing the output of Blocks  and . Then the loop is repeated as shown in FIG. (B), until the computed value of the estate for years purchase price ceases to change significantly with additional iterations.","The projected tax schedule of the estate for years purchaser received from Input Data  is essential to the valuation of amortization of tax deductions in Block . If the estate for years purchaser were assumed to be a tax-exempt investor, the present value of the tax deductions would be zero. This reveals an important point: as with conventional tax-exempt securities, the estate for years component is worth more to a taxable investor than to a tax-exempt investor. Furthermore, as the tax bracket of the estate for years investor increases, so does the value of the estate for years component.","Typically, the projected tax rate schedule received from Input Data  will consist of a single tax rate, and some implementations of Logic Means  will make this simplification.","It is not always necessary to compute the value of the estate for years component iteratively. If the cash flows from the partnership portfolio are sufficiently regular, for example if debt service payments do not vary and are made at regular intervals (e.g., as is the case for a single-security partnership portfolio with constant debt service payments, and possibly a balloon payment at maturity), then computation of the estate for years purchase price in Block  is made via an analytic formula without Block  and without iterative computations.","The output of Block  shows the value of applying the innovation to tax-exempt securities. The estate for years component generates amortization deductions to shelter a portion of the cash flows received by the estate for years component from taxes. However, because the partnership portfolio is tax-exempt, portions of the cash flows attributed to interest are already tax-exempt. For cases in which tax-exempt interest represents a sufficiently large part of estate for years cash flow, estate for years amortization deductions will be greater than needed to shelter the repayment of principal portions of estate for years cash flows from taxes. These excess amortization deductions can be used to reduce taxes on disbursements from (other) taxable investments, which implies that the estate for years value is greater than the value of the estate for years cash flows alone.","The incremental value represented by excess amortization deductions is computed in Block , which subtracts the value of the tax-exempt estate for years cash flows computed in Block  from the estate for years purchase price computed in Block . Block  reveals the business\/economic value created by the application of component separation to tax-exempt securities. This invention is not tied to any particular amortization or cost recovery schedule for the estate for years, as long as the contribution of the present value of tax deductions generated by the estate for years component enhances the estate for years value relative to its value as a schedule of tax-exempt cash flows.","Block  computes the implied yield on the estate for years component based on cash flow alone. This is an important safety check on the validity of the estate for years amortization deductions, because under current tax law deductions are invalid if they create an asset with negative or zero expected investment return. Because the estate for years is a fixed-income asset, implied yield to maturity based on cash flow alone equals expected investment return. Thus the output of Block  must be greater than zero for the prices computed by the invention to be valid.","Block  computes the average life, half life, and duration of the estate for years using the full schedule of estate for years cash flows plus projected tax savings. This output is used in the iterative calculation of the estate for years yield rate as in the previous examples of this process.","Computation of the remainder component price entails a complication not present in computing the estate for years price, due to the fact that is a zero-coupon security, i.e., due to the fact that no cash flow is generated during the estate for years term. Consequently, the tax basis of the remainder component will never be large enough to tax shelter all of the return of principal payments received by the remainder, so that a portion of the cash flows received by the remainder investor is subject to federal taxation.","This implies that the remainder component can be valued in at least two ways: (1) as a tax-exempt security, on the basis of its aftertax cash flows; or (2) a conventional taxable security, valued on the basis of its pretax cash flows. In case (1), the projected tax rate schedule of the purchaser affects the computation of the purchase price, whereas in case (2), the purchase price computation is independent of the tax bracket of the purchaser. Logic Means  computes the remainder value as a tax-exempt security in Block , and the remainder value as a taxable security in Block . Logic Means  selects the larger value in Block , and outputs a recommendation as to the appropriate marketing strategy, i.e., whether to market the remainder as a tax-exempt fixed-income security or a taxable fixed-income security.","As a longer term zero-coupon investment, the regularity or irregularity of remainder cash flows has little to do with asset marketability. Because there is little to gain by rescheduling the remainder cash flows via cash flow warehousing, this degree of complexity is omitted from the structure of the remainder component by the logic means.","Block  computes the yield rate for the remainder under the assumption that it is regarded as a tax-exempt security.","The computation of the remainder price in Block  proceeds iteratively exactly as in the case of the estate for years, substituting Block  for Block , Block  for Block , and Block  for Block . Also, again as with computation of the estate for years purchase price, the iterations can be avoided and replaced by an analytic formula for the tax-exempt remainder purchase price if the remainder cash flows are assumed to be sufficiently regular.","The computation of the average life of a fixed-income security is based on pretax cash flows and pretax interest rate. Block  computes the implied pretax remainder interest rate. This value is identical to the tax-exempt yield rate computed by Block  if the tax rate schedule from Input Data  is zero, and in general the value computed by Block  differs only slightly from the tax-exempt yield rate. The interest rate computed by Block  together with the pretax cash flows and the tax-exempt remainder purchase price from Block  are used to compute the tax-exempt average life for the remainder in Block .","Viewing the remainder as a taxable fixed-income security, the corresponding computations become much simpler. Input Data  receives the conventional Treasury yield curve, and Input Data  the corresponding (taxable) risk premium curve. Block  computes the taxable remainder yield rate, and Block  computes the taxable remainder purchase as the present value of the pretax remainder cash flows discounted at the yield rate computed in Block . As in previous cases, Block  computes the average life, half life, and duration for the taxable remainder, and the average life is fed back to Block  to iterate the computation of the taxable remainder yield rate.","Block  computes the sum of the estate for years and remainder prices. Block  computes a measure of profitability for the separation transaction by computing the difference between: (1) the sum of the estate for years price, the remainder price, the value of the unseparated portion of the partnership interests, and any underwriting fees received in connection with the overall transaction, and (2) the price of the tax-exempt fixed-income portfolio acquired by the partnership.","An additional feature of component decomposition applied to tax-exempt fixed-income portfolios arises because of the zero-coupon nature of the remainder interest.","During the estate for years term, the remainder is a zero-coupon security, and the return earned on the remainder is tax-deferred for a remainder investor; taxes are only due when the estate for years term has expired and the remainder investor begins to receive cash flows, or when the remainder is sold. Consequently, a tax-effective strategy for a philanthropic remainder purchaser would be the following: hold the remainder during the estate for years term while it earns tax-deferred returns, then make a charitable donation of the remainder when the estate for years term expires and take a charitable deduction enhanced by the increase in the remainder value. In addition, the remainder purchaser receives the satisfaction of seeing a favorite charitable foundation or institution receive a substantial fixed-income security as a gift.","Logic Means  computes values to describe and measure the value generated by a remainder purchaser through a remainder donation. The key value needed by the remainder purchaser is the projected value of the remainder at the time of the donation. This value is a fixed-income present value computation analogous to the other present value computations made by Logic Means  in this application.","Input Data  receives the projected date of a remainder donation. Frequently, though not necessarily, the projected donation date will be near the expiration of the estate for years term.","Input Data  receives the AM g. o. curve projected for the date of the donation, and Input Data  receives the corresponding risk premium curve projected for that date. Block  selects the appropriate AM base rate and risk premium based on the average life of the remainder at the projected time of the remainder donation, and sums these two rates to obtain the projected discount rate needed to compute the projected present value of the remainder at the time it is donated.","Block  computes the projected value of the remainder at the projected donation date; using this value, Block  computes the average life, half life, and duration for the remainder at the projected donation date. Using the remainder purchase price computed earlier, Block  computes the projected growth rate in the remainder value between the remainder purchase date and the remainder donation date.","Using a projected donor tax rate schedule received by Input Data , Block  computes the projected value of the donor tax saving generated for the remainder investor by the remainder donation.","Block  computes the rate of return for the remainder purchaser from an investment equal in value to the remainder purchase price on the component separation date that generates a return equal in value to the projected value of the donor tax saving at the remainder donation date.","Finally, under the additional assumption that the tax-exempt portfolio held by the partnership is a financial obligation of the intended recipient of the remainder donation, Block  subtracts the remainder cash flows after the projected donation date from the tax-exempt portfolio cash flows and recomputes the cost of debt capital on the tax-exempt portfolio based on the remaining cash flows and the initial value of the tax-exempt portfolio. This is an additional piece of financial information to aid the remainder purchaser in gauging the effectiveness of a prospective remainder donation under the assumption that the intended donation recipient is the original issuer of the tax-exempt portfolio; in this case, Block  measures the reduction in the cost of capital for the fixed-income debt obligations in the partnership portfolio due to the cancellation of the portion of the debt represented by the remainder component.","E. Interrelat d Comput r Systems","That aspect of the invention illustrated with respect to , etc., can function in cooperation with other computer systems respectively in different institutions involved in the decomposition.

The logic means is also for manipulating the electrical signals representing cash flow and tax deduction schedules to produce altered electrical signals corresponding to at least one of the group consisting of (1) computing the tax, (2) generating a tax filing schedule, and (3) generating documentation at an output means electrically connected to said second computer.","Computer System  has hardware and logic means analogous to Computer System , except that the computer system is programmed particularly to examine a different tax and\/or investment scenario than that used in the decomposition conducted in accordance with System  for at least one of the components, e.g., a tax scenario under a different interpretation of the tax code or a change in the tax code. Computer System  is programmed to generate a tax schedule from input data representing: (1) a breakdown of the cash payment schedule into schedules of interest\/income payments and return of principal payments, (2) the security purchase price, and - - - in the case of estate for years securities - - - (3) the estate for years term. This input data includes at least some of the output . The Computer System  in  can also be programmed to format the schedule of tax deductions for transmittal to other computer systems, and to store and transmit this schedule in exactly the same way that System  does.","Computer System  thus can be programmed to compute: (1) independent verification of the tax deduction schedules furnished to purchasers by sellers, and\/or (2) a sensitivity analysis of the effect of future modifications in the tax code on the tax deduction schedule generated by the security and\/or the effect of these modifications on the present value of the aftertax cash flows.","More particularly, the Computer System  can be characterized as providing a second digital electrical computer controlled by third logic means controlling a second processor in manipulating other digital electrical signals representing next input data to the second computer, the next input data characterizing at least one of the at least two components decomposed from the property, the manipulating by the second processor including transforming the other digital electrical signals into other modified digital electrical signals representing a respective value for the at least one of the two components, the respective value being computed to reflect taxation for the components under a second tax and\/or investment scenario. Additionally involved is providing second input means electrically connected to the second computer converting the next input data into the other digital electrical signals, and communicating the corresponding other digital electrical signals to the second computer; and providing second output means electrically connected to the second computer for receiving the other modified digital electrical signals from the second computer, and converting the other modified digital electrical signals representing the respective value into a printed document.","Computer System  usually computes output values, for example, component prices and expected returns for a specific set of input parameter values at the time property decomposition into components occurs. Computer System  can also be programmed to perform risk analysis for the output parameters, e.g., by Monte Carlo analysis, for example, for the expected remainder annual return.","More particularly, an example of a risk analysis input (e.g., in the case of expected remainder annual return) is a probability distribution for the expected property value at a future time (e.g., at the end of the estate for years term) and a set of values for the other input parameters for the embodiment. Computer System  can be programmed to generate random samples from the probability distribution for expected future property value, and each random sample for the expected future property value can be combined with the fixed values for the other input parameters and processed to generate a set of output values, including a value for expected annual remainder return. By generating repeated random samples of the multiple future property value (e.g., normally at least one thousand, and usually at least ten thousand), Computer System  generates a probability distribution for the expected annual remainder return and can compute investment risk parameters for the expected annual remainder return from the distribution, for example, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis.","In cases involving further decomposition of the remainder component into a preferred interest and a residual interest, Computer System  also generates a probability distribution for the expected annual residual return and can compute investment risk parameters for the expected annual residual return from the distribution, for example, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis.","For the case of support for a decision about a commitment to component decomposition significantly in advance of the expected date for the component decomposition or in advance of the expected date for at least one component purchase, Computer System  can compute the probability that the decomposition of property into components and the at least one component purchase will become uneconomical due to changes in the values of input parameters between the date of the analysis and the expected date of component separation.","More particularly, in this case, an example of an additional input for a Computer System  risk analysis is a probability distribution for at least one input parameter, for example, a multivariate probability distribution for the following group of input parameters: the yield curve, the risk premium curve for the estate for years component, the risk premium curve for the preferred interest (in cases wherein there is or will be a preferred interest), and the future property value that will be expected at the time of component decomposition. An example of an additional input value for Computer System  in this case is at least one of the following: a value for the minimum required annual return for remainder interest investor(s), a value for the minimum required annual return for residual interest investor(s), and a value for the minimum required annual return for estate for years interest investor(s). Computer System  generates a multivariate distribution for the output parameters, from which it can compute a risk analysis of the financial success or failure of the transaction. For example, Computer System can compute at least one of the values for the following risk parameters: the probability that the sum of the estate for years purchase price and the remainder interest purchase price will not be sufficient to cover the sale price of the property together with associated expenses such as real estate brokerage commissions and the cost of component decomposition, the expected magnitude of the deficit, the expected magnitude of the deficit given that a deficit does occur, and the below-target semivariance of the deficit.","Computer System  is again structurally analogous to that of Computer System , with the digital electrical computer being controlled in its signal processing by a processor, etc. However, Computer System  can be used by an insurance company, for example, in computing premiums for writing insurance against the savings that accrue to the component purchaser from tax deductions generated by the component. Computing insurance premiums for a given event is a well explored discipline, though in the present case, it would reflect sensitivity analyses of the effect of tax code modifications too. Thus, the invention discussed with respect to  can be employed in combination with software for determining insurance premiums. Because tax deductions are default free, there is no credit risk associated with these deductions that might be reduced by insurance. However, insurance can be written against legislative risk that results from potential (future) changes in the tax law, such as: (1) changes in tax brackets and rates that inversely affect the value of tax deductions generated by the security, and (2) modifications of tax code regulations regarding availability and\/or scheduling of tax deductions.","More particularly, Computer System  can be characterized as providing a second digital electrical computer controlled by third logic means controlling a second processor in manipulating other digital electrical signals representing next input data to the second computer, the next input data characterizing at least one of the two components decomposed from the property, the manipulating by the second processor including transforming the other digital electrical signals into other modified digital electrical signals representing a respective value under a second tax scenario for the at least one of the two components, the manipulating by the second processor also including transforming the other digital electrical signals into still other modified digital electrical signals representing an insurance premium for insurance against the second tax scenario. Additionally involved is providing second input means electrically connected to the second computer converting the next input data into the other digital electrical signals, and communicating the corresponding other digital electrical signals to the second computer; and providing second output means electrically connected to the second computer for receiving the still other modified digital electrical signals from the second computer, and converting the still other modified digital electrical signals representing the insurance premium into a printed document.","Computer System  can also be used by an insurance company in computing premiums for writing insurance against an economic risk in a component. For the case of an estate for years component, this can include insurance to protect the estate for years holder against any property-related risk that might otherwise be assumed by purchase of the estate for years component in cases wherein the existing leases are not bondable net. Insurance for the estate for years component can also include credit enhancement insurance to raise the credit rating of the estate for years component to investment grade in cases wherein one or more existing lessees for the property have below-investment-grade credit ratings. For the case of a remainder component, this can include residual value insurance, which sets a minimum target valuation for the property and insures the remainder interest holder against the risk that the property value will be below the target valuation when the remainder interest matures into ownership of the property.","In the case of residual value insurance for remainders, such policies have been discussed in recent years for conventional real estate ownership. However, in this case they suffer from the defect that the insurer has a subordinate claim on the real estate to any mortgage lender. Thus the insurer can suffer huge losses if tenants default and the mortgage lender forecloses because of temporary cash flow deficiencies, events which have nothing to do with the underlying economics of the real estate. By contrast, residual value insurance on the remainder provides the insurer with an unsubordinated claim on the real estate. This is the rationale for the innovation of residual value insurance for remainders.","Computer System  in  is again structurally analogous to that of Computer System , except it is programmed, to: (1) receive market-based interest rate inputs, (2) compute the current market-based yield\/discount rate for the component, (3) determine the current market \/based price of the component by computing the sum of the present values of expected aftertax future cash flows and future purchaser tax savings from tax deductions generated by the component.","Computer System  is adapted to provide analytic support for purchasers who a might need to sell or resell the component security at some time prior to the maturity date of the security. Thus, making use of logic such as that in , Computer System  is programmed to price the security for resale and to compute the schedule of tax deductions generated by the security for the subsequent owner if a resale effort is successful.","More particularly, Computer System  can be characterized as providing a second digital electrical computer controlled by third logic means controlling a second processor in manipulating other digital electrical signals representing next input data to the second computer, the next input data characterizing at least one of the two components decomposed from the property, the manipulating by the second processor including transforming the other digital electrical signals into other modified digital electrical signals representing a respective value under a tax scenario for the at least one of the two components, the manipulating by the second processor also including computing current market-based yield\/discount rate for the at least one component, and determining a market\/based price of the at least one component by computing a sum of present values of expected aftertax future cash flows and future purchaser tax savings from tax deductions generated by the at least one component. Additionally involved is providing second input means electrically connected to the second computer converting the next input data into the other digital electrical signals, and communicating the corresponding other digital electrical signals to the second computer; and providing second output means electrically connected to the second computer for receiving the other modified digital electrical signals from the second computer, and converting the other modified digital electrical signals into an illustration of data corresponding to the other modified electrical signals.","As with any of the above-referenced computer systems and methods for making or using them, the invention extends to any kind of property, including a portfolio of at least one tax-exempt fixed income security. Further, the tax may be computed in different ways, including with an accelerated deduction for at least one of the components, as well as taxation under different interpretations of the existing tax code, or under a changed tax code altogether, without at all departing from the spirit of the invention of the computer system and methods related to electrical signal processing.","While a particular embodiment of the present invention has been disclosed, it is to be understood that various different modifications are possible and are within the true spirit of the invention, the scope of which is to be determined with reference to the claims set forth below. Of course, the invention can be carried out by using multiple computers or by using the same computer to handle operations sequentially, as would be equivalent under the circumstances - - - software embodiments being equivalent to hardwired embodiments, as is well known in the art.

The lease is uncancellable during the initial term except as described below. The Security entitles the holder to receive Base Rent from the lease on the Premises during the initial lease term, and to re-lease the Premises subject to specified restrictions in the event of premature lease cancellation.","The Security has similar investment characteristics to an asset-backed bond: a debt-like obligation with the right to legal recourse to compel Tenant performance absent Tenant bankruptcy; and in Tenant bankruptcy, a senior claim to repossess the asset (term occupancy of the Premises) that secures the debt-like obligation if the Tenant repudiates the obligation. The general rental agreement formalizes financial restrictions, offering sufficient security for classification of the Security as a fixed-income investment for regulatory purposes.","Expiration of the estate for years term will coincide with expiration of the initial lease term. The period from acquisition of the estate for years by the grantor trust to expiration of the initial lease term will henceforth be known as the \u201cTerm.\u201d","Covenants in the estate for years deed and the remainder interest deed will provide for claims of the estate for years beneficiary incurred during the Term to survive the Term expiration. The grantor trust indenture will provide for continuation of the trust until all such claims are resolved.","The Tenant is Anonymous Mortgage Company, a wholly-owned affiliate of Anonymous Conglomerate Corporation. The lease is tentatively scheduled to begin on Oct. 15, 1992, and will expire on the last day of the calendar month that contains the tenth anniversary of the Commencement Eve Date, where the Commencement Eve Date is the day immediately prior to the commencement of the lease term.","Security cash flows consist of Base Rent from the Anonymous Mortgage lease. Annual Base Rent is determined by multiplying the annual base rent per square foot by the building net square footage. Initial annual Base Rent per square foot is $ 11.00. The preliminary estimate of net square footage is 100,000 feet, implying an estimated initial Annual Base rent of $ 1,100,000.","The building net square footage, and hence the initial net rent, will be finalized for the Term as described in Lease Section 3.02 within ten days of the Lease Commencement date.","Annual Base Rent per square foot in subsequent lease years is determined by increasing the base rent per square foot in the preceding year by three percent (3%) and rounding the resulting value off to the nearest cent ($ 0.01).","Base Rent is due in equal monthly installments at the beginning of each month.","Prepayment","Security cash flows cannot be reduced by prepayment.","Tax Shields","From a legal perspective the Security is an income-producing asset, so tax treatment of Security cash flows differs from tax treatment of cash flows generated by debt securities.","Tax deductions generated by the Security arise from amortization of a wasting asset purchase price rather than from the separation of cash flows into taxable and tax-exempt (i.e. interest and principal) components. Since Security deductions are generated by asset characteristics rather than by cash flow receipts, Security tax deductions are independent of cash flows. Consequently, whereas the credit risk of Security cash flows is determined by the credit risk of Anonymous Mortgage, Security tax deductions are default free.","The Security holder is entitled to an annual amortization deduction on the estate for years. The annual deduction is computed by multiplying the Security tax basis by the following ratio: the number of days during the tax year that the grantor trust held the estate for years divided by the number of days remaining in the estate for years on the first day of the tax year that the grantor trust held title.","Amortization deductions are classified for tax reporting purposes as passive deductions, and are subject to the restrictions of the Internal Revenue Code on the use of such deductions to offset taxes on income. These restrictions vary with the tax status and classification of the beneficiary.","Any of the following events constitutes a default under the Security lease: failure by Tenant to pay monthly Rent when due, together with failure to pay within ten (10) days after Landlord serves Tenant with written notice of past due Rent; failure by Tenant to perform or observe any other provision of the lease, provided that such failure continues for more than ten (10) days after Landlord gives Tenant written notice of such failure or, if the failure cannot be corrected within the ten (10) day period, provided that Tenant does not commence to correct the failure within the ten (10) day period and thereafter pursue the correction through to completion within a reasonable time, and in any case prior to such time as failure to complete the correction could result in violation of any law, rule, or ordinance; failure by Tenant to pay monthly Rent on time more than three (3) times during any twelve (12) month period, or failure by Tenant to perform or observe any other provision of the lease more than three (3) times during any twelve (12) month period; performance by Tenant of any act that results in the creation of a lien upon the Premises and fails to discharge the lien or post bond for the lien with Landlord as required by Lease Article XX; any attempt by Tenant to make an unpermitted assignment or sublease; failure by Tenant to maintain in force all insurance policies required by the lease, and such failure continues for more than ten (10) days after Landlord gives Tenant written notice of such failure; the filing of a petition against Tenant or any guarantor of the lease under any section of the Bankruptcy Code (and in the case of an involuntary proceeding, the filing is not permanently discharged or vacated within sixty (60) days); if Tenant or any guarantor of the lease becomes insolvent or makes a transfer in fraud of creditors or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors; a court-authorized appointment of a receiver, custodian, or trustee for substantially all Tenant assets or all assets of or any guarantor of the lease is made and not subsequently vacated within sixty (60) days of the initial appointment date; the cumulative transfer of more than 50% interest in Anonymous Mortgage that results in Anonymous retaining less than a 50% interest Anonymous Mortgage.","Security Lease Provisions","In event of default, Landlord has the right to enter and take possession of the Premises and if Landlord elects, at Tenant's expense release the Premises and\/or repair any damage for which Tenant is responsible. In the event that Landlord relets the Premises: Tenant is liable for all costs associated with the default and with recovery of the Premises; all accumulated Rent up to the time the Anonymous Mortgage lease is terminated; costs associated with preparing the Premises for new tenants; and any deficiency between the present value of rent payable by new tenants over the remaining Term and the present value of Anonymous Mortgage rent contracted in the current lease. The deficiency between the present value of total rent payable by the new tenant(s) and contracted total rent in the Anonymous Mortgage lease can be calculated either: before the new lease(s) are signed, on the basis of expected market rent; after the new lease(s) are signed, on the basis of actual rent specified in the new lease(s).","Letter of Credit","For the duration of the lease Anonymous or a successor Anonymous-affiliated parent of Anonymous Mortgage agrees to provide a one-time two million dollar ($2,000,000) irrevocable letter of credit within two (2) business days of receipt of written notification from Landlord of any one of the following events: Tenant default under the lease that remains uncured for twenty (20) days after written notification to Anonymous Real Estate and which, in the case of nonmonetary default, Tenant has not commenced or has not diligently pursued to cure; a decline in Tenant net worth, as calculated annually, of either more than five percent (5%) of total Tenant assets or below twenty-five million dollars, which continues without correction for ten (10) business days after the determination of the decline. The letter of credit must be issued by a nationally recognized institution with sufficient funds available to fund such a credit instrument at the time of issuance.","In the event that Anonymous Real Estate or its successor Anonymous-affiliated parent fails to provide the agreed-upon letter of credit as required, Anonymous agrees to provide the letter of credit within ten (10) business days of written notification from Landlord of nonperformance of the first-specified provider.","In event of Tenant default(s), Landlord can draw cumulatively against the credit line provided by the letter up to the lesser of the default amount and the remaining balance of the credit line. If Tenant default results in lease termination, the entire remaining balance on the letter of credit will be available immediately to the Landlord.","In event of a Tenant default resulting in lease termination prior to the end of the Term, then effective as of the termination date, the amount deemed due and owing to Landlord pursuant to the Letter of Credit agreement shall be the amount due and owing to Landlord pursuant to the lease remedies provisions.","In event that the scheduled letter of credit expiration date is earlier than the end of the Term, Landlord is entitled to draw upon the full outstanding balance of the credit line unless the letter is renewed at least thirty (30) days prior to scheduled expiration for an amount equal to the remaining outstanding balance.","Condemnation","If the entire Premises is acquired or condemned by eminent domain, the lease terminates as of the date the condemning authority takes possession, and total Rent due is adjusted to that date.","If partial condemnation results in the loss by Landlord of at least five percent (5%) of the Building or ten percent (10%) of parking for the Building, then Tenant may elect to terminate the lease within thirty (30) days of final determination of the extent of the loss, termination to occur as of the date the condemning authority takes possession, and total Rent due is adjusted to that date.","If Tenant has the option to terminate the lease but fails to exercise the option, then Landlord shall promptly restore the remaining Premises to a condition comparable to its condition immediately prior to condemnation and the lease shall continue as prior to the condemnation, except that after the effective date of condemnation the Rent shall be reduced as reasonably determined by Landlord if such reduction is reasonably warranted. Tenant waives any right or claim to any part of a compensatory award from the condemning authority to Landlord, and waives any claim against Landlord due to the condemnation.","In any action of eminent domain involving the Premises, the grantor trust and the remainder interest holder make separate compensation claims against the condemning authority. The estate for years deed and the remainder interest deed will disallow condemnation claims of the deed holders against each other.","Damage and Destruction","The Security holder shall carry rent business interruption insurance applicable to the Premises sufficient to cover Base Rent payments plus all related taxes and operating expenses for a period of 300 days. The cost of business interruption insurance will be reimbursed by the Tenant, including all related appraisal and consulting fees.","If the Building or any portion thereof is damaged or destroyed to such an extent that it cannot be repaired within two hundred seventy days of the event, then the Tenant has the right to terminate the lease by giving the Landlord written notice within the later of (i) thirty (30) days after the event or (ii) five (5) business days after determination that the damage or destruction cannot be repaired within 270 days. The Landlord would continue to receive Base Rent for the period covered by business interruption insurance, and would have the right to relet the Premises after restoration for the remainder of the Term.","In event of destruction or damage to the Building which does not result in lease termination but which renders the Building wholly or partially untenantable, Base Rent shall be abated in proportion to the area so rendered until restoration is completed. However, the Landlord would continue to receive the abated portion of Base Rent plus operating expenses while restoration is under way due to business interruption insurance, unless restoration took longer than 300 days.","If the Building or any portion thereof is destroyed by fire or other cause during the last two (2) years of the lease term, then Tenant shall have the right to terminate the lease by giving written notice to the Landlord within sixty (60) days of the destruction. In this case, the Landlord would continue to receive Base Rent plus taxes and operating expenses from business interruption insurance for 300 days.","Grantor Trust","The grantor trust indenture will charge the trustee with preventing the Security holder from imposing any lien whatsoever on the Premises, with removing any liens imposed by other entities that the Security holder does not promptly seek to remove by all legal means available, and otherwise with passing tenant rent through to the Security holder. Otherwise, ultimate responsibility for Landlord decisions concerning property management, maintenance, insurance and taxes will remain with the Security holder during the Term, although under the Anonymous Mortgage lease the Tenant will assume full responsibility for performance in these areas as prescribed in the lease, together with responsibility for direct payment of all costs associated with performance. The trust indenture assigns the Security holder the general responsibilities accorded financial fiduciaries, reserving other specified services to the trustee as appropriate.","During the final Term year, the Security holder and Anonymous Mortgage are responsible only for management and maintenance costs incurred prior to Term expiration, and only for a pro rata share of tax and insurance expenses based on the ratio of the number of days during the year that fall within the estate for years to the total number of days in the year.","Management and Maintenance","Anonymous Mortgage assumes full and sole responsibility for the condition, operation, repair, replacement, management and maintenance of the Premises and all improvements thereon. At its own expense, Anonymous Mortgage Company will keep the Premises both clean and in good order and operating condition, and make all necessary repairs (both structural and nonstructural, interior and exterior, ordinary and extraordinary, foreseen and unforeseen, of every nature, kind and description, including parking areas, driveways, sidewalks, landscaping and roadways).","Anonymous Mortgage will maintain, at its own expense, service contracts satisfactory to the Landlord for the following: (i) maintenance for HVAC systems, roof, elevators, landscaping and irrigation, and the parking lot; (ii) fire alarm service; (iii) janitorial service; (iv) security service; (v) snow removal; (vi) exterior window cleaning at least four (4) times per calendar year.","If, after expiration of the sixth (6th) year of the lease term, any capital repairs are required, and such repairs are not required due to (i) the failure of the tenant to perform routine maintenance required by the lease, (ii) tenant negligence, (iii) unusual or excessive tenant use of any system or portion of the Premises, or (iv) any tenant act which voids a warranty that otherwise would reimburse repair costs, then tenant is only required to pay a fraction of the repair cost based on the ratio of the remaining lease term (including exercised options for extension) to the remaining useful life of the item repaired.","Anonymous Mortgage will not make any alterations to the Premises without first obtaining written Landlord consent, which consent shall not be withheld or delayed unreasonably. Landlord may refuse permission for any alterations that are likely to weaken the structure of the Building, which are likely to damage or disrupt the HVAC systems or other major Building systems, or which are visible from the exterior of the Building. All alterations shall be made at Tenant's sole expense, either by Tenant's contractors approved in advance by Landlord or, at Tenant's option, by Landlord on terms reasonable to Tenant, including a fifteen percent (15%) supervisory fee in addition to the net cost of the materials and labor.","Notwithstanding the above, Anonymous Mortgage will pay, in addition to Base Rent, a management fee of one and eight tenths percent (1.8%) of the Base rent for administering the lease and as reimbursement of Landlord expenses for the costs of semiannual maintenance review and other management overhead.","Taxes","Anonymous Mortgage is responsible for direct payment of all real and personal property-related taxes (except income taxes) as specified in Lease Section 5.01. Tenant will provide Landlord with evidence in the form of official receipts or other acceptable proof that complete payment has been made within thirty (30) days of each assessment due date.","Anonymous Mortgage has the right at its sole expense to contest the validity or amount of any tax, but will first pay the tax under protest.","For taxes and assessments related to the calendar year during which the Term expires, the Security holder is responsible for a pro rata share of taxes and assessments based on the ratio of the number of days during the year that fall within the Term to the total number of days in the year, and the remainder interest holder is responsible for the remaining portion of taxes and assessments. If the lease has not been extended, Anonymous Mortgage is responsible for the portion of taxes attributable to the Security. If the lease has been extended, Anonymous Mortgage is responsible for all property taxes incurred during the calendar year.","Insurance and Indemnification","Tenant shall obtain and maintain various insurance policies related to the Premises and activities therein. All expenses in connection with Tenant policies shall be the sole responsibility of the Tenant.","Tenant policies shall include the following: All Risk insurance sufficient to cover the replacement cost of Tenant personal property, Building improvements and alterations; business interruption insurance; comprehensive general public liability insurance with limits of not less than $5,000,000 per occurrence; automobile liability insurance of at least $300,000; Worker's Compensation and Employer's Liability insurance; Tenant's All Risk Legal Liability insurance for the replacement cost of the Premises.","Except for events due to Landlord negligence or willful misconduct, Tenant waives all claims against Landlord and agrees to indemnify and hold Landlord harmless for damage to any property, or injury to or death of any person, on or about the Premises. This includes injury or damage to persons or property resulting from fire, explosion, falling plaster, steam, gas, electricity, water, rain, flood, snow, dampness, or leaks from pipes, appliances, plumbing works, roof, floor or ceiling subsurfaces or from the street.","Utilities","During the Term, Anonymous Mortgage is responsible for all deposits and fees in connection with obtaining and maintaining necessary utility services for the Premises, including but not limited to the following: water, sewage, heat, gas, light, garbage, electricity, telephone, steam and power.","Tenant-Incurred Liens","Anonymous Mortgage warrants to keep the Premises free from any liens arising from any work performed, materials furnished, or obligations incurred by or on behalf of Anonymous Mortgage. If any such lien is attached and not promptly discharged as prescribed in Lease Section 10.01, Landlord has the right to pay the full amount of the lien without inquiry into its validity, and to bill Tenant as Additional Rent for all expenses connected with the lien removal, including interest and attorneys' fees.","Hazardous Materials and Indemnification","Tenant is restricted to use of the Premises for executive, sales and administrative purposes. For the restrictions on use and\/or handling of hazardous and toxic material, see Lease Article XXV.","Tenant shall indemnify, defend and hold Landlord, its beneficiaries, any managing agents and leasing agents of the Premises, and their respective agents, partners, officers, directors and employees harmless from all damages, costs, losses, expenses (including, but not limited to, actual attorney's fees and engineering fees) arising from or attributable to any breach by Tenant or any of its warranties, representations or covenants in Lease Article XXV. Tenant's obligations hereunder shall survive termination of this lease.","Remainder Interest Liens","During the Term the remainder interest will be held in a grantor trust. Among the primary responsibilities of the remainder interest trustee will be to prevent any liens whatsoever from being attached to the remainder interest fee.","During each year of the Term, on no later than March 1, Anonymous Mortgage shall provide Landlord with a net worth report as of December 31 of the prior calendar year and the preceding year. The report shall be certified by a nationally recognized accounting firm.","At any time during the Term, up to once per fiscal year, Tenant will, upon ten days prior notice from Trustee A, provide the Trustee with a current financial statement and financial statements for the two (2) preceding fiscal years.

Accordingly, each holder of a Certificate will be subject to Federal income taxation as if it owned directly its proportionate interest in each asset owned by the Trust.","In the opinion of Kirkland & Ellis, for Federal income tax purposes the Term Interest constitutes a depreciable asset and the initial cost of the Term Interest to the Trust is recoverable under Section 167(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, by means of equal and ratable cost recovery deductions which may be taken by the Trust and passed through to holders of Certificates through 2009. See \u201cFEDERAL INCOME TAX MATTERS.\u201d","Investor Suitability","Certificates will be offered and sold solely to \u201cqualified institutional buyers\u201d (\u201cQIBs\u201d), as such term is defined under Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, in compliance with Rule 144A. See \u201cNOTICE TO INVESTORS.\u201d","Rating","Standard & Poor's, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies (\u201cS&P\u201d), has assigned the Certificates a rating of \u201cA+\u201d. A rating reflects only the views of S&P and an explanation of the significance of such rating may be obtained from S&P. Once assigned, there is no assurance that any rating will continue for any given period of time, or that it will not be revised downward or withdrawn entirely by the issuing rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. Any downward revision or withdrawal of a rating assigned to the Certificates may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Certificates. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. See \u201cRATING.\u201d","INVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS","Single Purpose Issuing Entity","The Certificates will be issued by K.C. ABBE\u00ae 1995-1 Trust, a special purpose grantor to trust created solely for the purpose of purchasing the Term Interest. The Trust will not engage in any activity other than acquiring and holding the Trust Property, issuing the Certificates, receiving Lease Payments and distributing Certificate Payments with respect to the Certificates.","Unconditional Lease Guaranty","The obligations of the Tenant under the Lease have been unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed, as to payment and not as to collection, by Kansas City Life Insurance Company. At Dec. 31, 1994, the obligation of Kansas City Life represented by the Guaranty had been capitalized for financial reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. See Kansas City Life's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 1994, which is attached hereto as Exhibit B.","Kansas City Life Insurance Company","Kansas City Life and its wholly-owned subsidiaries issue and market a full line of universal life, term and traditional whole life insurance and accident and health insurance products. For the year ended Dec. 31, 1994, Kansas City Life had consolidated revenues in the amount of $393.5 million, pre-tax income of $57.0 million and net income of $37.4 million. At Dec. 31, 1994, Kansas City Life had total assets of $2.7 billion and total stockholders' equity of $ 343.7 million. With respect to its claims paying ability, Kansas City Life has a rating from A.M. Best & Co. of \u201cA+\u201d and ratings from Standard & Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investors Service of \u201cA+\u201d and \u201cA2\u201d, respectively.","Absolute Net Lease","The Lease is an absolute \u201ctriple net\u201d lease, with Tenant assuming responsibility for all taxes, insurance and operating expenses, obligations for repair and maintenance (including structural repair and maintenance) and condemnation and casualty loss risks associated with the Building.","Capital Expenditures. The Trustee, in its capacity as landlord under the Lease, has no obligation under the Lease to make capital expenditures with respect to the Building. Tenant is required, at its sole cost and expense, to keep the Building and all parts thereof in good order, repair and condition, whether interior or exterior, structural or non-structural, ordinary or extraordinary, foreseen or unforeseen, including, without limitation, repair of all glass, utilities, conduits, fixtures, equipment, foundations, roofs, exterior and interior walls, heating and air conditioning systems, lighting fixtures, wiring, plumbing, sprinkler systems, paving, sidewalks, roads, parking areas, curbs, gutters and fences. The necessity for and adequacy of all repairs to be made to the Building pursuant to the Lease shall be measured by the standard which is appropriate for suburban office buildings in the Kansas City metropolitan area of similar construction, class and age.","Casualty Loss Risk. If the Building, or any part thereof, is damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty during the term of the Lease (except during the second to last and final year of the term), Tenant is obligated to promptly repair or restore the Building to substantially the same condition it was in immediately prior to such fire or casualty, and Tenant's obligation to pay Base Rent and to perform its other obligations under the Lease will not be suspended, abated or reduced as a result thereof.","In the event of (a) damage or destruction during the second to last year of the Term (the repair and restoration of which would cost in excess of 75% of the replacement value of the Premises) or (b) damage or destruction during the last year of the Term (the repair and restoration of which would cost in excess of 25% of the replacement value of the Building), the Trustee (in its capacity as landlord under the Lease) or Tenant may terminate the Lease, provided that any and all insurance proceeds in such case received by Tenant are required to be paid to and assigned to the Trust, as landlord. In each such case, the Trustee, in its capacity as landlord under the Lease and pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement, is obligated to utilize such insurance proceeds to restore the Building to substantially the same condition as existed immediately prior to the Casualty Loss giving rise to such Casualty Loss Termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall not have the right to terminate the Lease if (a) any damage or destruction is caused by an uninsured casualty, (b) Tenant shall have failed to maintain the insurance required to be maintained under the Lease or (c) Landlord is unable for any reason to collect all insurance proceeds which would otherwise be payable by Tenant's insurance carriers in connection with such damage or destruction. Pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement, the Trustee, in its capacity as landlord under the Lease, has been irrevocably instructed not to exercise its right to terminate the Lease upon the occurrence of a Casualty Loss. See \u201cTHE TRUST AGREEMENT - - - Specific Duties of Trustee - - - Casualty Loss.\u201d","In accordance with the terms of the Lease, Tenant is required to maintain all-risk property and casualty insurance for the full (100%) replacement cost of the Property (with a deductible of not more than $25,000). See \u201cTHE LEASE - - - Insurance.\u201d The Trustee is required pursuant to the Trust Agreement to procure rental interruption insurance in an amount sufficient to assure that holders of Certificates will receive when due monthly Certificate Payments with respect to the Certificates. There can be no assurance that receipt by the Trustee of any such casualty insurance or rental interruption insurance proceeds will be at such time or times sufficient to assure timely payment with respect to the Certificates. See \u201cTHE TRUST AGREEMENT - - - Specific Duties of Trustee - - - Rental Interruption Insurance.\u201d","Condemnation Risk. If less than 50% of the Building shall be taken by condemnation or other eminent domain proceedings pursuant to any law, general or special, or the use or occupancy of the Premises or any part thereof shall be temporarily requisitioned by any governmental authority, civil or military, then the Lease shall continue in full force and effect without abatement or reduction of Base Rent, additional rent or other sums payable by Tenant. In such event, Tenant is obligated after such taking or requisition, at its sole cost and expense, to repair any damage caused by any such taking or requisition in conformity with the provisions in the Lease governing the making of alterations to the Building.","If condemnation shall effect at least 50% of the Building and, in Tenant's reasonable judgment, shall render the Building unsuitable for restoration for continued use and occupancy (a \u201cTotal Condemnation\u201d), then Tenant shall terminate the Lease and submit an irrevocable offer to purchase from the Term Trust (a) any remaining portion of the Building and (b) the right to receive the net proceeds, if any, payable in connection with such condemnation. The purchase price shall be equal to ten times the then-annual Base Rent payable under the Lease, which amount will not be less than $9,326,500 and which amount will in all cases be equal to or greater than the then-applicable Prepayment Amount. In accordance with the terms of the Trust, the Trustee is required to accept such offer to purchase, and proceeds received by the Trust from the Tenant upon the occurrence of a Total Condemnation will be distributed, first, to holders of Certificates to the extent of the then-applicable Prepayment Amount, and second, if and only to the extent of any remaining proceeds, to the Remainder Trustee for distribution to holders of Remainder Trust Certificates.","Environmental Risk. In connection with the acquisition of the Property, the Grantor engaged Environment Audit Incorporated, Lee's Summit, Mo., to perform a Phase I environmental assessment of the Property. The Phase I assessment revealed no matters of significance with respect to non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Pursuant to the terms of the Lease, Tenant has agreed to defend, indemnify and hold the Trust, as landlord under the Lease, harmless from and against any and all claims, including without limitation wrongful death actions and third-party claims (but excluding claims for consequential damages) arising directly or indirectly from the presence of any Hazardous Material (as defined in the Lease) in, on, under, at or about the Property or any Hazardous Discharge (as defined in the Lease) in, on, under, at or about the Property, or any environmental complaint.","Depreciability of Term Interest","For Federal income tax purposes, the Term Interest constitutes a depreciable asset, the cost of which is subject to equal and ratable cost recovery deductions through Dec. 31, 2009. See \u201cFEDERAL INCOME TAX MATTERS\u201d.","Remedies of Trust Upon Tenant Default","The Trust will hold title directly to the Term Interest, which constitutes a current real property interest which will expire and terminate on Dec. 31, 2009, and the Trust will be the primary assignee and beneficiary of the Guaranty. The Trust will not hold a mortgage on the Property. As direct holder of the Term Interest, upon a default by the Tenant the Trustee (as landlord under the Lease) will be entitled to seek enforcement of its rights and remedies in accordance with the terms of the Lease and without resort to mortgage foreclosure or other judicial proceedings which otherwise might be required to realize upon a security interest in the Property.","The Trust is offering hereby a total of 452 Certificates at an offering price of $20,000 per Certificate and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The purchase price will be payable in full upon subscription. The minimum subscription is one Certificate. The Grantor reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to accept subscriptions for fractional Certificates, so long as the minimum subscription requirement is met. The Certificates will be sold only to such persons who meet the suitability standards set forth under \u201cNOTICE TO INVESTORS.\u201d","Pursuant to the terms of a Guaranty, dated as of Nov. 13, 1991 (the \u201cGuaranty\u201d), from Kansas City Life, the obligations of the Tenant under the Lease have been irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed by Kansas City Life. A copy of the Guaranty is attached hereto as Exhibit A. The Tenant is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kansas City Life.

The applicable Prepayment Amount at any monthly Certificate Payment date is included as Appendix B to the Trust Agreement, a copy of which has been included herein as Exhibit D.","On May 4, 1995, the Grantor acquired a fee simple interest in the Property for a purchase price of $10,455,000.

The bond-equivalent component represents the value on a net present value basis of the expected payments under the bondable lease, discounted at a rate appropriate to the duration of the lease and the credit-worthiness of the tenant. The bond-equivalent component is comparable in many respects to a intermediate-term, non-callable fixed-income security. In contrast, the \u201cresidual\u201d, or equity, component represents the value of commercial real estate after the cash flows generated by the bond-equivalent component have been eliminated\u2014i.e., the net present value of the future right to occupy the real estate upon expiration of the term of the lease. Legally, the bond-equivalent component can be simulated by creating a term-of-years of a duration co-terminous with the term of the triple-net lease, while the equity component in a particular property represents an interest in a vested (i.e., current) unencumbered remainder interest in fee simple title to such property. This unencumbered remainder interest will entitle the holder of such interest to future possession and control of the property on a debt-free basis following the termination of the underlying term-of-years.","The Term Interest","The Term Interest is a real property interest and constitutes a vested (i.e., current) unencumbered estate-for-years in and to the Property expiring on Dec. 31, 2009. Following termination in 2009 of the Term Interest, the Trust will have no further interest in the Property. For Federal income tax purposes, the Term Interest constitutes a depreciable asset, the cost of which is subject to equal and ratable cost recovery deductions through Dec. 31, 2009. See \u201cFEDERAL INCOME TAX MATTERS\u201d.","Acquisition of the Property and Creation of Term Interest","On May 4, 1995 the Grantor purchased for $10,455,000 the entire fee simple interest in the Property, which consists of a 94,149 square foot office building (the \u201cBuilding\u201d) situated on a 2.091 acre parcel in the Country Club Plaza District of Kansas City, Mo. The Country Club Plaza District is located approximately 4.5 miles south of Downtown Kansas City. The Building was constructed in 1960 and substantial renovations were completed by Kansas City Life on the Building for approximately $1.5 million in 1992, and the Subtenant has made significant expenditures to maintain the space in a manner commensurate with a Class A office building space. The $10,455,000 purchase price represents a capitalization of the Building's operating income for the year ended Dec. 31, 1994 at a rate of 8.93%, a capitalization of projected operating income for the year ending Dec. 31, 2000 at a rate of 10.27% and a capitalization of projected operating income for the year ending Dec. 31, 2005 at a rate of 11.81%.","Immediately following Grantor's acquisition of the entire fee simple interest in the Property pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, Grantor \u201csplit\u201d the fee simple ownership of the Property by simultaneously (a) conveying or causing to be conveyed to the Trust the Term Interest expiring on Dec. 31, 2009 and (b) conveying or causing to be conveyed to the Remainder Trust for $2,150,000 a remainder interest in the Property, which remainder interest will entitle the beneficiaries of the Remainder Trust, upon termination of the Term Interest on Dec. 31, 2009, to a fee simple interest in the Property.","The Grantor established the Trust by assigning and selling the Term Interest to the Trust in exchange for $8,305,000, which amount was contributed to the Trust by K.C.

(Article XI).","Insurance","Tenant shall maintain at all times, at its sole cost and expense, insurance coverage as follows:","1. All-risk property insurance for the full (100%) replacement cost of the Property (with a deductible of not more than $25,000);","2. Commercial general public liability insurance against claims for bodily injury, death or property damage occurring on or about the Premises in a single limit amount of $10,000,000 with respect to bodily injury or death arising out of any one accident or occurrence;","3. Boiler and machinery insurance in the amount of at least $1,000,000 (with a deductible of not more than $10,000);","4. Worker's compensation insurance to the extent required by law;","5. During any period of construction with respect to the Building, builders' risk insurance on a completed value basis for the total cost of any alterations;","6. If and to the extent such insurance is commonly obtained by prudent owners of suburban office buildings in the Kansas City metropolitan area, environmental impairment insurance in such amounts as are commonly obtained by such prudent owners. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall not be required to carry such environmental impairment insurance so long as its net worth exceeds Tenant's Minimum Net Worth (as defined) (and further provided that, to the extent that Tenant is required to carry such insurance because its net worth is equal to or less than Tenant's Minimum Net Worth, Tenant may maintain a deductible with respect to such insurance of not more than 5% of its net worth);","7. Such other insurance in such amounts as are commonly obtained at the time in question by prudent owners of suburban office buildings in the Kansas City metropolitan area.","For purposes of the foregoing paragraph (6), \u201cTenant's Minimum Net Worth\u201d is an amount equal to the greater of (i) $50,000,000 or (ii) the product of (1) 50 times (2) the Base Rent and taxes with respect to the Premises payable by the Tenant in the then-current calendar year. All insurance maintained by Tenant with respect to the Premises must name Landlord as an additional insured as its interest may appear. In addition, at the request of Landlord, but not more than once every three years, Tenant at Tenant's sole cost and expense shall increase the limits of liability on any of the insurance policies Tenant is otherwise required to maintain to such greater amounts as Landlord shall reasonably request. (Article XII)","All insurance required to be maintained by Tenant shall be written by companies of nationally recognized financial standing, reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee in its capacity as landlord under the Lease. The Trust Agreement further provides that the Trustee will not accept insurance written by any company, unless such company has a claims paying rating of \u201cBBB+\u201d or better as determined by Standard & Poor's Corporation.","All proceeds of insurance maintained by Tenant under the Lease shall be payable to and administered by the Trustee under the terms of the Trust Agreement.","Fire and Other Casualty","In the event of (a) damage or destruction during the second to last year of the Term (the repair and restoration of which would cost in excess of 75% of the replacement value of the Premises) or (b) in the event of damage or destruction during the last year of the Term (the repair and restoration of which would cost in excess of 25% of the replacement value of the Premises) (each such events in clause (a) and (b) a \u201cCasualty Loss\u201d), then in each such event, Landlord or Tenant, upon 30 days' written notice to the other, may terminate the Lease, provided that any and all insurance proceeds in such case received by Tenant are required to be paid to and assigned to Landlord. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall not have the right to terminate the Lease if (a) any damage or destruction is caused by an uninsured casualty, (b) Tenant shall have failed to maintain the insurance required to be maintained under the Lease or (c) Landlord is unable for any reason to collect all insurance proceeds which would otherwise be payable by Tenant's insurance carriers in connection with such damage or destruction. In accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement, the Trustee, in its capacity as landlord under the Lease, has been irrevocably instructed not to exercise its right to terminate the Lease upon the occurrence of a Casualty Loss. See \u201cTHE TRUST AGREEMENT\u2014Specific Duties of Trustee\u2014Casualty Loss.\u201d (Article XIV.B.)","Upon the occurrence of a Casualty Loss giving rise to a Casualty Loss Termination, the Trustee, in its capacity as landlord under the Lease and pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement, is obligated to utilize such insurance proceeds to restore the Building to substantially the same condition as existed immediately prior to the Casualty Loss giving rise to such Casualty Loss Termination. The Trustee is required pursuant to the Trust Agreement to procure rental interruption insurance in an amount sufficient to assure that holders of Certificates will receive when due monthly Certificate Payments with respect to the Certificates. There can be no assurance that receipt by the Trustee of any such casualty insurance or rental interruption insurance proceeds will be at such time or times sufficient to assure timely payment with respect to the Certificates. See \u201cTHE TRUST AGREEMENT\u2014Specific Duties of Trustee\u2014Rental Interruption Insurance.\u201d","Condemnation","Tenant has irrevocably assigned to Landlord any award or payment to which Tenant may be or become entitled by reason of any taking of the Premises or any part thereof by condemnation or other eminent domain proceedings pursuant to any law, general or special, by any governmental authority, civil or military. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall have the right to any award or payment on account of Tenant's trade fixtures, equipment and moving expenses, to the extent Tenant shall have a right to make a separate claim therefor against the appropriate governmental authority. (Article XV.A.)","If less than 50% of the Premises shall be taken by condemnation or other eminent domain proceedings pursuant to any law, general or special, or the use or occupancy of the Premises or any part thereof shall be temporarily requisitioned by any governmental authority, civil or military, then the Lease shall continue in full force and effect without abatement or reduction of Base Rent, additional rent or other sums payable by Tenant. In such event, Tenant is obligated after such taking or requisition, at its sole cost and expense, to repair any damage caused by any such taking or requisition in conformity with the provisions in the Lease governing the making of alterations to the Premises. (Article XV.E.)","If all or substantially all of the Property shall be taken by condemnation or other eminent domain proceedings, then the Lease shall terminate on the day preceding the date of the vesting of title to the Premises or portion thereof in the condemning authority, and Base Rent and additional rent shall be paid to the date of such termination. (Article XV.B.)","If condemnation shall affect at least 50% of the Premises and, in Tenant's reasonable judgment, shall render the Premises unsuitable for restoration for continued use and occupancy (a \u201cTotal Condemnation\u201d), then Tenant shall, not later than 30 days after such condemnation, deliver to Landlord (i) notice of its intention to terminate the Lease on the next rental payment date which occurs not less than 90 days after the delivery of such notice (the \u201cCondemnation Termination Date\u201d), (ii) a certificate of an authorized officer of the Tenant describing the event giving rise to such termination and (iii) an irrevocable offer by Tenant to Landlord to purchase on the Condemnation Termination Date (a) any remaining portion of the Premises and (b) the right to receive the net proceeds, if any, payable in connection with such condemnation, at a price equal to ten times the then annual Base Rent. If Landlord shall reject such offer by notice given to Tenant not later than 15 days prior to the Condemnation Termination Date, the Lease shall terminate on the Condemnation Termination Date upon payment by Tenant of all Base Rent, additional rent and other sums then due and payable to and including the Condemnation Termination Date. (Article XV.C.) Notwithstanding the foregoing and notwithstanding any direction to the contrary of the Certificateholders, the Trustee pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement is irrevocably instructed to accept the Tenant's offer to purchase the Property required to be made upon the occurrence of a Total Condemnation pursuant to the provisions of the Lease (or the comparable provisions of any Replacement Lease). See \u201cTHE TRUST AGREEMENT\u2014Specific Duties of Trustee\u2014Condemnation.\u201d","Assignment and Subletting","Tenant shall have the right to assign the Lease (in whole, but not in part) or to sublet the Premises (in whole or in part) without the consent of Landlord, provided that in the case of a subletting, no subletting shall be for a term ending later than one day prior to the expiration date of the Term. No assignment shall be deemed a waiver of any agreement, term, covenant or condition of the Lease or a release of Tenant from the performance or further performance by Tenant of the agreements, terms, covenants, conditions of the Lease, and Tenant shall continue to be primarily liable under the Lease in accordance with its terms. (Article XVI.A.)","The merger or consolidation or sale of substantially all the assets of Tenant shall be deemed to be an assignment of the Lease. However, it shall be a condition precedent to the merger of Tenant into another corporation or the consolidation of the Tenant with one or more other corporations, that the surviving entity shall (i) have a minimum net worth at least equal to the net worth of Tenant immediately prior to such merger or consolidation, (ii) deliver to Landlord a certified financial statement evidencing satisfaction of the requirement set forth in the foregoing clause (i), and (iii) deliver to Landlord an acknowledged instrument in recordable form assuming all obligations, covenants and responsibilities of Tenant under the Lease.

See \u201cTHE TRUST AGREEMENT\u2014Assignment of Lease.\u201d","Environmental Matters","Tenant has agreed not to use, manufacture, store, dispose or sell any substance or material (collectively, \u201cHazardous Materials\u201d) identified to be toxic, or hazardous according to any applicable federal, state or local statute, law, rule or regulation relating to regulation or control of toxic or hazardous substances or materials (\u201cEnvironmental Laws\u201d). If Tenant receives any written notice of any event involving the use, spill, discharge, dumping or clean-up of any Hazardous Material in at or about the Premises or into the sewer, septic system or waste treatment system servicing the Premises (any such event being hereinafter referred to as a \u201cHazardous Discharge\u201d) or any complaint, order, citation or notice with regard to such Hazardous Discharge, then in such event Tenant shall give immediate oral and written notice of same to Landlord.","For purposes of the Lease, the following event constitutes an Event of Default:\n\n","Tenant has agreed to defend, indemnify and hold Landlord harmless from and against any and all claims, including without limitation wrongful death actions and third-party claims (but excluding claims for consequential damages) arising directly or indirectly from the presence of any Hazardous Material in, on, under, at or about the Premises or any Hazardous Discharge in, on, under, at or about the Premises, or any environmental complaint. (Article XIII.)","Alterations","Tenant, at its sole cost and expense, may make alterations or additions or other improvements to the Premises or any part thereof, provided that any alterations or additions (i) shall not reduce the fair market value of the Premises below its value immediately before such alteration or impair the usefulness or structural integrity of the Building or change the use thereof; (ii) shall not reduce the gross leaseable area of the Premises, (iii) are effected in good and workmanlike manner in a safe and careful fashion in compliance with all applicable legal requirements and (iv) are fully paid for by the Tenant.

The occurrence of an Event of Default described under \u201cEnvironmental Matters\u201d above;","3.

If Tenant shall make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or shall file a voluntary petition under any bankruptcy or insolvency law or an involuntary petition alleging any act of bankruptcy or insolvency shall be filed against Tenant, and the occurrence of certain other bankruptcy-related events, and in such case such events shall occur and continue without the acquiescence of Tenant for a period of 90 days;","5. The occurrence of any event or contingency whereby the Lease or the estate thereby created or the unexpired balance of the Lease Term would, by operation of law or otherwise, devolve upon pass to any person, firm or corporation, except as expressly permitted in the Lease; or","6. If Tenant shall abandon all of the Demised Premises by vacating the premises and failing to (i) maintain the premises, (ii) make all repairs thereto, (iii) maintain security and\/or (iv) comply with all the terms, covenants and provisions thereof for a period in excess of 30 days.","If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Landlord shall have the right to give Tenant a five-day notice of Landlord's termination of the Lease. Upon expiration of such five-day period, the Lease and the estate thereby granted shall expire and terminate, and all rights of Tenant under the Lease shall expire and terminate, but Tenant shall remain liable under the Lease as hereinafter provided. (Article XVIII.B.)","Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Landlord shall have the following additional rights and remedies:","1. Landlord shall have the right to reenter the Premises, to dispossess Tenant by a summary proceeding or other appropriate suit and, at Tenant's expense, to remove, for the sole benefit of Landlord, Tenant's effects and to hold the Premises and the right to receive all rental and other income of and from the Premises;","2. In the case of any such reentry termination and\/or disposition the Base Rent, Additional Rent and any other sums payable by Tenant under the Lease shall become immediately due and be paid up to the time of such reentry, disposition and\/or termination, together with such reasonable expenses as Landlord may incur for legal expenses, attorneys' fees and disbursements; Landlord may relet the premises or any part or parts thereof for a term or terms which may at Landlord's option be less than or exceed the period which would otherwise have constituted the balance of the Term;","3. Tenant shall also pay to Landlord as liquidated damages an amount equal to the Liquidated Damages Amount set forth in the Lease; and","4. Landlord shall have the right to invoke any remedy allowed at law or in equity as if reentry, summary proceedings and other remedies were not provided for in the Lease.","In the event of any termination of the Lease or in the event that Landlord shall reenter the premises as above described, Tenant will pay to Landlord as liquidated damages, at the election of Landlord, either:","(i) A sum equal to the excess, if any, discounted at 8% per annum, of (x) the full amount of Rent reserved under the Lease for the balance of the unexpired portion of the Initial Term, or a Renewal Term, as applicable, and the Additional Rent and other charges or sums payable by Tenant hereunder which would have been payable had the Lease not so terminated, over (y) the aggregate rental value of the Premises for the same period considered on a net rental basis, such sum to be immediately due in full upon such termination or reentry; or","(ii) a sum which is equal to the aggregate of the Base Rent reserved under the Lease for the balance of the unexpired portion of the Initial Term or Renewal Term, as applicable, and the Additional Rent and other charges or sums payable by Tenant thereunder which would have been payable by Tenant had the Lease not so terminated, or had Landlord not so reentered the Premises, payable upon the due dates specified in the Lease following such termination or such reentry and until the date for the expiration of the Initial Term or such Renewal Term, as applicable, as provided herein.

The Certificates will be issued in denominations of $20,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.","The Certificates will be initially registered through a book-entry only system operated by The Depository Trust Company, New York, N.Y. (\u201cDTC\u201d). Details of payments of the Certificates and the book-entry only system are described below under the subcaption \u201cBook-Entry Only System\u201d. Except as described under the subcaption \u201cBook-Entry Only System\u201d below, beneficial owners of the Certificates will not receive or have the right to receive physical delivery of Certificates, and will not be or be considered to be the Owners thereof. Accordingly, beneficial owners must rely upon (i) the procedures of DTC and, if such beneficial owner is not a DTC Participant (as described below), the DTC Participant who will act on behalf of such beneficial owner to receive notices and payments of Lease Payments with respect to the Certificates, and to exercise voting rights and (ii) the records of DTC and, if such beneficial owner is not a DTC Participant, such beneficial owner's DTC Participant, to evidence its beneficial ownership of the Certificates. So long as DTC or its nominee is the registered owner of the Certificates, references herein to Holders or owners of such Certificates shall mean DTC or its nominee and shall not mean the beneficial owners of such Certificates. The laws of some states may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. Such limits and laws may impair the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Certificate.","If at any time the Holder of any Certificate shall request that its Certificate be registered in its name and not that of Cede & Co., the Trustee shall promptly take such action as is necessary to authenticate and deliver to such Holder Certificates registered in its name or that of its nominee.","Prepayment","Except as set forth below and except for monthly Certificate Payments made in accordance with the payment schedule attached hereto as Exhibit C, the Certificates will not be prepaid, in whole or in part, prior to expiration of the Term Interest on Dec. 31, 2009. The Certificates shall be prepaid prior to expiration of the Term Interest only upon the occurrence of a Total Condemnation (see \u201cTHE LEASE\u2014Condemnation\u201d and \u201cTHE TRUST AGREEMENT\u2014Specific Duties of Trustee\u2014Condemnation\u201d) through the application of moneys on deposit in the Certificate Distribution Account under the Trust Agreement. In each such case, prepayment shall be in an amount equal to the then-applicable Prepayment Amount specified in Appendix B to the Trust Agreement, but without premium.","Certificate Payments","The sole source of payment of Certificate Payments with respect to the Certificates will be the Tenant's monthly Lease Payments of Base Rent under the Lease. The ability of the Trust to make timely Certificate Payments with respect to the Certificates will be entirely dependent upon its receipt of timely Lease Payments by the Tenant under the Lease. Under the Trust Agreement and the Lease, the Tenant is required to make Lease Payments of Base Rent directly to the Trustee. The Trustee will apply these payments as described under \u201cTHE TRUST AGREEMENT\u2014Certificate Payments.\u201d","Book-Entry Only System","The following information has been furnished by DTC for use in this Offering Memorandum and neither the Placement Agent nor the Grantor takes any responsibility for its accuracy or completeness.","DTC will act as securities depository for the Certificates. The Certificates will be registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC's partnership nominee). One fully-registered Certificate will be issued in the aggregate issuance amount and will be deposited with DTC.","DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a \u201cbanking organization\u201d within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a \u201cclearing agency\u201d registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. DTC holds securities that its participants (\u201cParticipants\u201d) deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the settlement among Participants of securities transactions, such as transfers and pledges, in deposited securities through electronic computerized book-entry changes in Participants' accounts, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Direct Participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations. DTC is owned by a number of its Direct Participants and by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., the American Stock Exchange, Inc., and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as securities brokers and dealers, banks, and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Direct Participant, either directly or indirectly (\u201cIndirect Participants\u201d). The Rules applicable to DTC and its Participants are on file with the Commission.","Purchases of the Certificates under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct Participants, which will receive a credit for the Certificates on DTC's records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each Certificate (\u201cBeneficial Owner\u201d) is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and Indirect Participants' records. Beneficial Owners are expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct or Indirect Participant through which the Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership interests in the Certificates are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Participants acting on behalf of Beneficial Owners. Except as otherwise provided herein, Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership interests in the Certificates, except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the Certificates is discontinued.","To facilitate subsequent transfers, all Certificates deposited by Participants with DTC are registered in the name of DTC's partnership nominee, Cede & Co. The deposit of the Certificates with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. effect no change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of the Certificates; DTC's records reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts such Certificates are credited, which may or may not be the Beneficial Owners. The Participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.","Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct Participants, by Direct Participants to Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time.","Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. will consent or vote with respect to the Certificates. Under its usual procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to the Trust as soon as possible after the record date. The Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede & Co.'s consenting or voting rights to those Direct Participants to whose accounts the Certificates are credited on the record date (identified in a listing attached to the Omnibus Proxy).","Certificate Payments with respect to the Certificates will be made to DTC. DTC's practice is to credit Direct Participants' accounts on payable date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC's records unless DTC has reason to believe that it will not receive payment on payable date. Payments by Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in \u201cstreet name,\u201d and will be the responsibility of such Participant and not of DTC, the Trustee, or the Trust, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Payment of Certificate Payments to DTC is the responsibility of the Trustee, disbursement of such payments to Direct Participants shall be the responsibility of DTC, and disbursement of such payments to the Beneficial Owners shall be the responsibility of Direct and Indirect Participants.","DTC may discontinue providing its services as securities depository with respect to the Certificates at any time by giving reasonable notice to the Grantor or the Trustee. Under such circumstances, if a successor securities depository is not obtained, certificates for the Certificates are required to be printed and delivered.","The Trust may decide to discontinue use of the system of book-entry transfers through DTC (or a successor securities depository). In that event, certificates for the Certificates will be printed and delivered.","Set forth below is a summary of certain provisions of the Trust Agreement governing the terms of the Trust. The description and summaries of the Trust Agreement hereinafter set forth do not purport to be comprehensive or definitive, and reference is made to the Trust Agreement for the complete details of all terms and conditions.

The Certificate Distribution Account must be established at a bank or other financial institution (i) authorized pursuant to applicable laws to exercise corporate trust powers with respect to the Term Interest; (ii) having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authorities; and (iii) having (or having a parent which has) a long term unsecured debt rating of at least BBB+ by Standard & Poor's Corporation (an \u201cEligible Bank\u201d).","Funds in the Certificate Distribution Account will be invested as provided in the Trust Agreement in \u201cEligible Investments\u201d. \u201cEligible Investments\u201d are defined generally as","(i) demand and time deposits in, or certificates of deposit of, any depository institution or trust company (including the Trustee) incorporated under the laws of the United States or any state thereof having a combined capital and surplus of at least $25,000,000 and subject to supervision and examination by federal and\/or state banking authorities; provided, however, that such deposits shall be in amounts no greater than $100,000 for any one such depository institution or trust company unless the commercial paper or other unsecured short-term obligations of such depository institution or trust company are rated at least A+ by Standard & Poor's Corporation;","(ii) direct obligations of, and obligations fully guaranteed by, the United States of America, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, FNMA, Federal Farm Credit System, the Federal Home Loan Banks or any agency or instrumentality of the United States of America the obligations of which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America;","(iii) bankers' acceptances issued by any depository institution or trust company (including the Trustee) meeting the requirements of clause (i) above; provided, however, that at the time of such investment or contractual commitment providing for such investment the commercial paper or other unsecured short-term debt obligations of such depository institution or trust company carry at least the ratings required under clause (i) above;","(iv) repurchase obligations with respect to any securities described in clause (ii) above or any other security issued or guaranteed by any instrumentality of the United States of America, the obligations of which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America; provided, however, that in either case, such security shall have a remaining maturity of one year or less and such repurchase obligation shall have been entered into with a depository institution or trust company (acting as principal) of the type described in the proviso to clause (iii) above; and","(v) commercial paper (including both non-interest bearing discount obligations and interest bearing obligations payable on demand or on a specific date not more than one year after the date of issuance thereof) rated at least A+ by Standard & Poor's Corporation.","Investments of amounts on deposit in the Certificate Distribution Account described below with respect to any Distribution Date are limited to obligations or securities that mature not later than the corresponding Distribution Date.","The Trust Agreement also creates and establishes a special and segregated trust account, in the name of the Trustee on behalf of the Trust and for the benefit of Certificateholders (the \u201cRating Agency Account\u201d), into which the amount of $17,500 will be deposited by the Grantor initially on the Closing Date. The funds on deposit in the Rating Agency Account shall be used to fund the annual rating agency monitoring fee payable to Standard & Poor's Corporation, which fee shall be payable annually in an amount not presently expected to exceed $2,000. Funds on deposit in the Rating Agency Account will be invested as provided in the Trust Agreement in Eligible Investments. If, upon termination of the Term Interest or earlier termination of the Trust (see \u201cTermination of the Trust\u201d below), there shall remain any unapplied balance in the Rating Agency Account, such unapplied balance shall be distributed to the Grantor.","Certificate Payments","The Servicer will deposit all Lease Payments made by the Tenant with respect to the Lease into the Certificate Distribution Account within two days of receipt by the Servicer thereof. On the 15th day of each month, commencing Sep. 15, 1995 and ending on Dec. 15, 2009 (each, a \u201cDistribution Date\u201d), the Trustee will distribute to each holder of Certificates as of the immediately preceding Record Date such holder's ratable share of the amount of Distributable Funds then on deposit in the Certificate Distribution Account. Distributable Funds includes the total balance of funds then in the Certificate Distribution Account less the sum of: (i) $25,000; plus (ii) the amount of all Reimbursable Costs incurred by the Trustee for which the Trustee has not previously been reimbursed; plus (iii) the amount of all Reimbursable Costs reasonably anticipated by the Trustee to be incurred prior to the next succeeding Distribution Date; plus (iv) the amount of any Net Casualty Proceeds and\/or any Net Compensation deposited in the Certificate Distribution Account pending application in accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement; plus (v) any Additional Servicing Fee payable to the Servicer pursuant to the terms of the Servicing Agreement; plus (vi) the amount of any investment earnings (net of losses and investment expenses) on amounts on deposit in the Certificate Distribution Account; plus (vii) the amount of any Trustee's fees payable pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement. The Trustee has a priority right to reimbursement of Reimbursable Costs incurred pursuant to the Trust Agreement from Lease Payments received by the Trustee and, if necessary, from the Trust Estate. On the Final Distribution Date, the Distributable Funds shall be calculated without regard to clauses (i), (iii) and (vi) above. On each Distribution Date, the Trustee will include with the distribution to each Certificateholder a statement itemizing Lease Payments received, Reimbursable Costs incurred and the calculation of the amount of Distributable Funds.","For purposes of calculating Distributable Funds, \u201cReimbursable Costs\u201d include all fees, expenses, costs or other charges incurred in good faith by the Trustee in the performance of its duties and obligations under the Trust Agreement. By way of example, Reimbursable Costs include all fees and expenses incurred by the Trustee in connection with the engagement by the Trustee of the Servicer and counsel to advise the Trustee regarding the discharge by the Trustee of its obligations under Section 6.2 of the Trust Agreement upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Casualty Loss Termination or Total Condemnation.","General Duties of Trustee","The Trustee shall generally have only such duties as are specifically set forth in the Trust Agreement relating to the administration of the Trust in the interest of the holders of the Certificates and is required to discharge such duties in accordance with its general obligations of loyalty and prudence as Trustee. In addition, the Trustee shall be required to give and receive all notices in respect of the Trust Estate as more specifically set forth in the Trust Agreement.","Specific Duties of Trustee","Actions to be Taken By Trustee Upon Event of Default under Lease; Termination of Lease.

If so directed in writing by the holders of Certificates, the Trustee shall initiate, or cause the Servicer to initiate on its behalf, such actions, including the commencement of legal proceedings, as shall in the reasonable judgment of counsel retained by the Trustee for such purpose be necessary or appropriate to preserve the Trust Property and to enforce the rights and remedies of the Trust, in its capacity as the landlord under the Lease. All costs and expenses incurred by the Trustee in so acting shall constitute Reimbursable Costs. The Trustee shall not be required to take any action, incur any expense or advance any funds unless: (i) there shall then be on deposit in the Certificate Distribution Account funds sufficient, in the reasonable judgment of the Trustee, to provide for reimbursement of all Reimbursable Costs incurred or to be incurred by the Trustee in acting at the direction of the holders of Certificates; or (ii) the Trustee shall have received assurances from the holders of Certificates as to the source and manner for the reimbursement of such Reimbursable Costs reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee (clauses (i) and (ii) above being hereinafter referred to as the \u201cReimbursement Conditions\u201d). If the Trustee shall seek such assurances and the holders of Certificates shall fail or refuse to provide the same within fifteen (15) days after demand therefor by the Trustee, such failure or refusal shall constitute a Termination Event and the Trustee shall be excused from taking any further action with respect to such Event of Default.","If the Lease or Tenant's right to possession of the Property thereunder shall be terminated in connection with an Event of Default, a Casualty Loss Termination or Total Condemnation (see \u201cCasualty Loss; Casualty Loss Termination\u201d and \u201cCondemnation\u201d, below), the Trustee shall direct the Servicer to provide usual and customary property and asset management services pursuant to the Servicing Agreement with respect to the Property pursuant to a written management agreement. The Trustee shall initiate such actions as are, in the reasonable judgment of the Servicer and counsel engaged by the Trustee for such purpose, necessary and appropriate to (i) preserve the Trust Estate and maintain the Property, including the payment of property taxes, insurance premiums and other reasonable costs and expenses of maintaining and preserving the Property in good operating condition and (ii), if so directed in writing by the holders of Certificates, procure a Replacement Lease or Leases on such terms and conditions as shall be approved in writing by the Certificateholders. The Trustee shall not be required to take any such action unless the Reimbursement Conditions shall have been satisfied. A \u201cReplacement Lease\u201d is any lease for all or any portion of the Property, which lease (A) shall require the Tenant thereunder at its sole cost and expense to (i) maintain at least the insurance prescribed by the Lease, (ii) pay all ad valorem and other real property taxes levied against the Property and (iii) maintain or cause the Property to be maintained in good operating condition and in compliance with all applicable laws and (B) shall have been submitted to Standard & Poor's Corporation (\u201cS&P\u201d), and S&P shall have confirmed that such Replacement Lease shall not result in a downgrade, qualification or withdrawal of its then-assigned rating with respect to the Certificates.","Casualty Loss. In the event of a Casualty Loss affecting the Property involving a loss in excess of $100,000, the Trustee is required to give written notice to the holders of Certificates within not less than five business days after the date the Trustee first obtains knowledge of such Casualty Loss. The Trustee shall establish at an Eligible Bank a segregated trust account (the \u201cCasualty Account\u201d), into which the Net Casualty Proceeds from such Casualty Loss shall be deposited in accordance with Article XIV of the Lease (or any comparable provision of any Replacement Lease), and the Trustee, in its capacity as landlord under the Lease, shall exercise the rights and remedies set forth under Article XIV of the Lease (or the comparable provisions of any Replacement Lease) in connection with the restoration of the Property by the Tenant.","If such Casualty Loss results in a Casualty Loss Termination of the Lease, the Trustee shall deposit into the Casualty Account the Net Casualty Proceeds, which shall be applied by the Trustee or, at its direction the Servicer, to restore the Property to substantially the same condition as existed immediately prior to the Casualty Loss giving rise to the Casualty Loss Termination. In such event, the Servicer on behalf of the Trust shall obtain, within 45 days after such Casualty Loss, three fixed price bids for the performance of the work required in connection with the restoration of the Property from a \u201cQualified Contractor.\u201d A \u201cQualified Contractor\u201d is an experienced general contractor having (i) a net worth of at least $10,000,000; (ii) a five year annual average contract revenues of not less than $50,000,000; and (iii) not less than ten years of continuous business operation. The Trustee shall submit the three bids to the Certificateholders, who shall direct in writing the Trustee as to the bid to be selected not later than 30 days after receipt by the Certificateholders of such bids. If the holders of the Certificates fail or refuse to select one of the three bids within such 30-day period, the Servicer shall recommend to the Trustee the bid which, in the judgment of the Servicer exercised in accordance with the servicing standards set forth in the Servicing Agreement (see \u201cTHE SERVICING AGREEMENT\u2014Duties of Servicer\u201d), is the bid in the best interest of the Certificateholders, and the Trustee shall select such bid and proceed with the restoration. If the holders of Certificates shall direct the Trustee with respect to the taking of any actions in response to such Casualty Loss Termination, all fees and expenses reasonably incurred by the Trustee in connection therewith shall be Reimbursable Costs. The Trustee shall have no obligation to take any such actions unless the Reimbursement Conditions are then met.","For purposes of the Trust Agreement, a \u201cCasualty Loss\u201d is any loss or damage suffered or incurred with respect to the Property arising out of any fire, windstorm, flood, earthquake, act of God, war, strike or other casualty. A \u201cCasualty Loss Termination\u201d means any termination of the Lease resulting from the occurrence of a Casualty Loss. Pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement, the Trustee, in its capacity as landlord under the Lease, has been irrevocably instructed not to exercise its right to terminate the Lease upon the occurrence of a Casualty Loss. See \u201cTHE LEASE\u2014Fire and Other Casualty.\u201d","Rental Interruption Insurance. Provided the same may be obtained on commercially reasonable terms, the Trustee shall, or shall cause the Servicer to, obtain and maintain at all times during the last two years of the Initial Term rental interruption insurance in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) 125% of the Prepayment Amount applicable as of the first month of the penultimate year of the Initial Term; and (ii) the total rent payable under the Lease during the final two years of the Initial Term. Such rental interruption insurance shall be on such terms and conditions as shall be customary insuring the Trust against interruption of rental payments under the Lease, and the cost of such rental interruption insurance shall constitute a Reimbursable Cost under the Trust Agreement. Such rental interruption insurance shall be written by a company having a claims-paying ability rating of \u201cBBB+\u201d or better as determined by Standard & Poor's Corporation.","To fund its obligations to maintain rental interruption insurance, the Trustee shall establish and maintain a segregated trust account (the \u201cRental Insurance Reserve Account\u201d), into which shall be deposited from funds otherwise constituting Distributable Funds on the initial Distribution Date with respect to the Certificates the amount of $28,200. Funds in the Rental Insurance Reserve Account will be invested as provided in the Trust Agreement in Eligible Investments. If, after acquiring such rental interruption insurance during the last two years of the Initial Term, there shall remain any unapplied balance in the Rental Insurance Reserve Account, such unapplied balance shall be distributed to the Certificateholders.","Condemnation. In the event of a Partial Condemnation affecting the Property, the Trustee shall deposit the Net Compensation received by the Trustee from such Partial Condemnation into a segregated trust account at an Eligible Bank (the \u201cCondemnation Account\u201d), and the proceeds therein shall be applied by the Servicer on behalf of the Trustee in accordance with the provisions of the Lease (or the comparable provisions of any Replacement Lease) respecting payments to be made to the Tenant (or any Replacement Tenant) in connection with the restoration of the Property by the Tenant as required by the Lease. See \u201cTHE LEASE\u2014Condemnation.\u201d If, after making all payments of Net Compensation required to be made to the Tenant (or any Replacement Tenant) there shall remain any unapplied balance of the Net Compensation in the Condemnation Account, such unapplied balance shall be paid over to the Remainder Trustee.","If there shall occur a Total Condemnation, the Trustee shall give written notice thereof to the Certificateholders not later than five business days after the Trustee shall have obtained knowledge of such Total Condemnation. Thereafter the Trustee shall, upon the written direction (or consent) of the Certificateholders, exercise the rights and perform the obligations of the Trust, in its capacity as landlord under the Lease, under the provisions of the Lease governing a Total Condemnation (or the comparable provisions of any Replacement Lease). Notwithstanding the foregoing and notwithstanding any direction to the contrary of the Certificateholders, the Trustee is irrevocably instructed to accept the Tenant's offer to purchase the Property required to be made upon the occurrence of a Total Condemnation pursuant to the provisions of the Lease (or the comparable provisions of any Replacement Lease). See \u201cTHE LEASE\u2014Condemnation.\u201d The proceeds received by the Trustee from such sale shall be thereupon deposited into the Certificate Distribution Account, and such proceeds shall be distributed in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement governing a Termination Event. See \u201c\u2014Termination of the Trust,\u201d below.","Termination of the Trust","The Trust Agreement and the trust created thereby will terminate upon the final distribution by the Trustee of all monies of the Trust Estate following the earlier of (i) Dec. 31, 2009, (ii) the occurrence of a Total Condemnation, or (iii) the failure of holders of Certificates to give to the Trustee certain financial assurances and indemnities upon the occurrence of a Event of Default under the Lease or upon the occurrence of a Casualty Loss Termination (each such event set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) a \u201cTermination Event\u201d, and each event set forth in clause (iii) a \u201cSection 6.2 Termination Event\u201d).

Upon presentation and surrender of the Certificates, the Trustee shall cause to be distributed to Certificateholders amounts distributable on such Final Distribution Date. The Final Distribution Date shall be not later than (i), in the event of a Total Condemnation, 30 days following receipt by the Trustee of the Net Compensation payable in connection therewith; (ii), in the case of a sale of the Property following a Section 6.2 Termination Event, 30 days following receipt by the Trustee of the proceeds from such sale; and (iii) not later than 30 days following Dec. 31, 2009.","Upon the occurrence of a Section 6.2 Termination Event, the Trustee shall give a termination notice with respect thereto to the Certificateholders and the Trustee shall thereafter sell the Property at an open outcry auction held in a commercially reasonable manner and on commercially reasonable terms on a date not earlier than 30 days and not later than 90 days after such termination notice has been given by the Trustee. Such termination notice shall specify the time, place and terms of such auction.

The area surrounding the Property is fully developed, made up of approximately 45% single family residential, 15% institutional, 15% commercial retail, 15% multi-family residential and 10% commercial office buildings.","The Kansas City, Mo.\/Kansas metropolitan area is the 28th largest in the United States, with a population in excess of 1.5 million. The economy of the region is diversified, with the manufacturing, wholesale\/retail services and government sectors each contributing in excess of 15% of the non-agricultural jobs in the region. Transportation, finance, insurance and real estate are also substantial contributors to the region's economy.","The purchase of Certificates involves substantial risks for investors. In addition to general investment risks and the factors described elsewhere herein, a prospective purchaser of Certificates should consider the following factors.","Real Estate Investment Risks","An investment in Certificates will be subject to many of the risks generally associated with the ownership of real property, including the possibility of adverse changes in national and local economic conditions; changes in rates of inflation; changes in the real estate investment climate; adverse changes in local market conditions due to changes in general or local economic conditions and neighborhood characteristics; adverse changes in governmental rules and fiscal policies; natural disasters, including earthquakes (which may result in uninsured losses) and other factors which are beyond the control of the Grantor.","No Operating History","The Trust is newly formed and has no operating history.","Casualty Loss Risk","If the Building, or any part thereof, is damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty during the term of the Lease (except during the second to last and final year of the term), Tenant is obligated to promptly repair or restore the Building to substantially the same condition it was in immediately prior to such fire or casualty, and Tenant's obligation to pay Base Rent and to perform its other obligations under the Lease will not be suspended, abated or reduced as a result thereof.","In the event of (a) damage or destruction during the second to last year of the Term (the repair and restoration of which would cost in excess of 75% of the replacement value of the Building) or (b) damage or destruction during the last year of the Term (the repair and restoration of which would cost in excess of 25% of the replacement value of the Building), the Tenant may terminate the Lease, provided that any and all insurance proceeds in such case received by Tenant are required to be paid to and assigned to the Trust. In each such case, the Trustee, in its capacity as landlord under the Lease and pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement, is obligated to utilize such insurance proceeds to restore the Building to substantially the same condition as existed immediately prior to the Casualty Loss giving rise to such Casualty Loss Termination.","In accordance with the terms of the Lease, Tenant is required to maintain all-risk property and casualty insurance for the full (100%) replacement cost of the Property (with a deductible of not more than $25,000). See \u201cTHE LEASE\u2014Insurance.\u201d The Trustee is required pursuant to the Trust Agreement to procure rental interruption insurance in an amount sufficient to assure that holders of Certificates will receive when due monthly Certificate Payments with respect to the Certificates. There can be no assurance that receipt by the Trustee of any such casualty insurance or rental interruption insurance proceeds will be at such time or times sufficient to assure timely payment with respect to the Certificates. See \u201cTHE TRUST AGREEMENT\u2014Specific Duties of Trustee\u2014Rental Interruption Insurance.\u201d","Tenant Lease Payments\u2014Bankruptcy Considerations","The sole source of payment of Certificate Payments with respect to the Certificates will be the Tenant's monthly Lease Payments of Base Rent under the Lease. The Trust, as landlord under the Lease, will be entitled to receive directly all payments made by the Tenant pursuant to the Lease.","If the Tenant and Kansas City Life are unable to make their respective payments required under the Lease and Guaranty, respectively, there can be no assurance that the Trust will be able to obtain a substitute tenant or tenants willing to make rental payments sufficient to generate Lease Payments with respect to the Certificates, and to otherwise pay operating expenses and tax payments associated with the Building. It is not possible to predict the future demand for, or rents associated with, office space in the Building's market.","In a bankruptcy proceeding involving the Tenant, the Tenant would have the option to assume or reject the Lease. If the Tenant elects to assume its obligations under the Lease, it could do so only upon approval of the bankruptcy court following a hearing at which the financial burdens and business purpose of the assumption were presented, and at which the Tenant's other creditors were given an opportunity to participate. If the bankruptcy court allowed the Tenant to reject the Lease, the Trust would be entitled to file a claim for its actual rejection damages or a formula amount, whichever is less. Under the formula, rejection damages are allowed in an amount equal to the greater of (a) one year's rent or (b) 15% of the total rent remaining due under the Lease, up to a maximum of three years' rent. The rejection damages claim, plus any unpaid pre-bankruptcy rent, would be treated as a pre-bankruptcy general unsecured claim against the Tenant. It is not possible to predict what action a bankruptcy court might take with respect to the Lease, although typically a bankruptcy court defers to the judgment of the debtor (the Tenant) or bankruptcy trustee, as the case may be. In any bankruptcy of the Tenant, it is possible that there may not be sufficient assets to pay in full pre-bankruptcy unsecured claims, including the claim of the Trust. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the damages actually recovered in a bankruptcy case would be sufficient to pay the full amount of Lease Payments with respect to the Certificates.","If Kansas City Life were also a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or failed to make payments of rent or other obligations when due, the Trust would be entitled under certain circumstances to file a claim under the Guaranty for the Lease Payments due with respect to the Certificates. Kansas City Life's obligations under the Guaranty are intended to be contractually independent of the Tenant's obligations under the Lease so that a claim against Kansas City Life under the Guaranty might not be subject to the same limitation on rejection damages described above as might be applicable to the Trust's claim against the Tenant under the Lease. However, it is not free from doubt that the independence of such obligation from the Tenant's obligations under the Lease would be preserved by a bankruptcy court in a proceeding involving Kansas City Life as the debtor, and such obligations may be subject to the rejection formula described above in bankruptcy proceedings involving the Tenant. If the Tenant rejected the Lease in a bankruptcy proceeding, its obligations to pay rent would be terminated (subject to the receipt by the Trust of any rejection damages).","If the Tenant were a debtor in a bankruptcy case and Kansas City Life were not, the Trust, to the extent permitted by law, would be entitled, in certain circumstances provided for in the Guaranty, to pursue an action against Kansas City Life for payments due under the Lease. Kansas City Life's obligations under the Guaranty are contractually independent of the Tenant's obligations under the Lease and an action against Kansas City Life under the Guaranty should not be subject to the same limitation on rejection damages as might be applicable to the Trust's claim against the Tenant under the Lease. If the Tenant rejected the Lease in a bankruptcy proceeding, its obligations to pay rent would be terminated (subject to receipt of any rejection damages as described above).","Lack of Liquidity","There is no established market for the Certificates and the Grantor does not anticipate that any such market will develop. Consequently, holders may not be able to liquidate their investment in the event of an emergency or for other reasons. Purchase of a Certificate is therefore suitable only for persons who have no need for liquidity with respect to their investment and who are able to bear the economic risks of their investment for an unlimited period of time.","Securities Law Aspects","The Certificates have not been registered under the Act or the Illinois Securities Act in reliance upon certain exemptions from registration thereunder. The Grantor believes that the offering presently qualifies and, where appropriate, will continue to qualify under the exemptions. However, since the availability of certain of these exemptions is based upon subjective factors, and in some instances the criteria for exemption are subject to reinterpretation by state or federal regulatory agencies and courts, there can be no assurance that such exemptions will be determined to be available.","ERISA Considerations","The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (\u201cERISA\u201d), and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) generally prohibit certain transactions between a qualified employee benefit plan under ERISA (an \u201cERISA Plan\u201d) and persons who, with respect to that plan, are fiduciaries or other \u201cparties in interest\u201d within the meaning of ERISA or a \u201cdisqualified person\u201d within the meaning of the Code. In the absence of an applicable administrative exemption, transactions between an ERISA Plan and a party in interest with respect to an ERISA Plan, including the acquisition by one from the other of a Certificate, could be viewed as violating those prohibitions. In this regard, the Tenant or Kansas City Life might be considered or might become a \u201cparty in interest\u201d within the meaning of ERISA or a \u201cdisqualified person\u201d within the meaning of the Code, with respect to an ERISA Plan. Prohibited transactions within the meaning of ERISA and the Code may arise if Certificates are acquired by an ERISA Plan with respect to which the Tenant or Kansas City Life is a party in interest or a disqualified person. In all events, fiduciaries of ERISA Plans, in consultation with their advisors, should carefully consider the impact of ERISA and the Code on an investment in Certificates.","PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR PERSONAL TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF PURCHASING CERTIFICATES.","The following is a summary of the material federal income tax consequences to holders of Certificates. This summary is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), and upon rules and regulations promulgated under the Code and existing interpretations thereof, any of which could be changed at any time, by legislation or otherwise. Any of such changes may or may not be retroactive with respect to transactions consummated prior to the date such changes are announced. The discussion below does not purport to address federal income tax consequences applicable to particular categories of investors, some of which (e.g., banks, tax-exempt organizations, insurance companies or foreign investors) may be subject to special rules. No rulings will be sought from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to any of the matters discussed herein.","In the opinion of Kirkland & Ellis, special tax counsel to the Grantor, the Term Trust will be classified for Federal income tax purposes as a grantor trust and not as an association taxable as a corporation. Accordingly, each holder of a Certificate will be subject to federal income taxation as if it owned directly its proportionate interest in each asset owned by the Trust. Each holder of Certificates will be required to report on its federal income tax return its pro rata share of each item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit from the Property held in the Trust, in accordance with such holder's method of accounting.","Subject to the restriction set forth in the succeeding paragraph, in the opinion of Kirkland & Ellis, each holder of a Certificate will be entitled to amortize its tax basis in the Certificate. Section 167(a) of the Code provides a depreciation deduction for business or income-producing property which obsolesces or \u201cwastes away\u201d over a reasonably determinable time period. The Term Interest held by the Trust is a term-of-years interest in real property which produces income under the Lease, the value of which decreases commensurately with the passage of time. Therefore, as a general matter, the Term Interest constitutes a depreciable asset and each holder of a Certificate is entitled to claim a deduction, for each taxable year during which it holds such Certificate, in an amount equal to (1) its adjusted tax basis in such Certificate, divided by (2) the number of years, including the current year, remaining in the term of the Term Interest. (This amount may have to be prorated if a holder holds a Certificate during less than all of a taxable year.) Under Section 167(c) of the Code, none of a Certificate holder's adjusted tax basis is allocable to, and no separate depreciation deduction is allowable for, the Trust's interest in the Lease.","However, Section 167(e) of the Code prohibits the taking of a depreciation deduction (under Section 167 or any other income tax provision of the Code) with respect to a term interest in property for any period during which the remainder interest in such property is held (directly or indirectly) by a related person. For this purpose, \u201crelated person\u201d is defined very broadly by reference to Code Sections 267(b) and (e) and includes family members, corporations, partnerships and\/or trusts having 50% or more cross-ownership or common ownership, among other relationships. Moreover, these related person rules are expanded as applied to \u201cpass-thru entities,\u201d including Subchapter S corporations and partnerships (and limited liability companies structured to be taxable as partnerships under the Code). Under these expanded rules, as applied for purposes of Section 167(e), if, for example, a partnership owned the Term Interest, no depreciation deduction would be allowable it any of its partners, or any family member of any of its partners, or any corporation in the same controlled group as any of its partners, etc., owned (directly or indirectly) the Remainder interest (or any other remainder interest) in the Property. For purposes of rendering its opinion, Kirkland & Ellis has assumed that no holder of a Certificate or \u201crelated person\u201d owns or will own (directly or indirectly) the LURE\u00ae interest or any other remainder interest in the Property.","A holder that sells or exchanges a Certificate should recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between its adjusted tax basis in the Certificate and the amount realized upon such sale or exchange. If the holder held such Certificate as a capital asset, any such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss, which will be long-term capital gain or loss if the Certificate was held for more than one year. Any long-term capital gains realized on the sale or exchange of a Certificate will be taxable under current law to corporate taxpayers at the rates applicable to ordinary income, and to individual taxpayers at a maximum marginal rate of 28%. Any capital losses realized generally will be deductible by a corporate taxpayer only to the extent of capital gains and by an individual taxpayer only to the extent of capital gains plus $3,000 of other income.","Pursuant to a placement agreement (the \u201cPlacement Agreement\u201d) between the Grantor and William Blair & Company (the \u201cPlacement Agent\u201d), the Placement Agent has agreed to use its best efforts to solicit the purchase of the Certificates. The Grantor has agreed to pay the Placement Agent a fee as compensation for its services in connection with the issuance and sale of the Certificates.","The Grantor has agreed to indemnify the Placement Agent against certain civil liabilities, including certain liabilities arising out of any incorrect statements or information or omissions in or for this Offering Memorandum, and to contribute with respect to payments that the Placement Agent may be required to make in respect thereof.","Standard & Poor's, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies (\u201cS&P\u201d), has assigned the Certificates a rating of \u201cA+\u201d. No application was made to any other rating agency for the purpose of obtaining an additional rating of the Certificates. A rating reflects only the views of S&P, and an explanation of the significance of such rating may be obtained from S&P. The Grantor has furnished to S&P information and materials in order to secure a rating for the Certificates, including certain information and materials which have not been included in the Official Memorandum. Once assigned, there is no assurance that any rating will continue for any given period of time, or that it will not be revised downward or withdrawn entirely by the issuing rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. Any downward revision or withdrawal of a rating assigned to the Certificates may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Certificates.","A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency, and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.","Kansas City Life is the guarantor of the Tenant's obligations under the Lease and, as such, may become the ultimate source of payment on the Certificates. Because of this dependence upon Kansas City Life for the ultimate payment of the Certificates, the rating on the Certificates is directly related to the credit of Kansas City Life. It should, therefore, be expected that a reduction, withdrawal or qualification of the debt ratings of Kansas City Life would adversely affect the rating on the Certificates.","The Trustee will furnish to each holder of Certificates certain reports, statements and tax information, as set forth in the Trust Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit D, including such information necessary in the preparation of the Certificateholders' federal income tax returns.","The Grantor will make every effort to furnish to any qualified prospective investor any additional information, or opportunity for inquiry, concerning the terms and conditions of this offering, including information requested to verify the accuracy of the information contained in this Offering Memorandum or otherwise furnished the prospective investor.","The legality of the Certificates offered hereby will be passed upon for the Grantor by Gardner, Carton & Douglas, Chicago, Ill. Gardner, Carton & Douglas has served as special securities counsel to the Grantor and certain affiliates of the Grantor. Certain tax matters relating to the Trust, the Certificates and the Term Interest will be passed upon for the Grantor by Kirkland & Ellis, Chicago, Ill.","The remedies available to the Trustee or the owners of the Certificates upon an event of default under the Lease or the Trust Agreement are in many respects dependent upon judicial actions that are often subject to discretion and delay. Under existing constitutional and statutory law and judicial decisions, including specifically Title 11 of the United States Code (the \u201cBankruptcy Code\u201d), the remedies specified by the Lease or the Trust Agreement may not be readily available or may be limited. The various legal opinions to be delivered concurrently with the delivery of the Certificates will be qualified as to the enforceability of the various legal instruments by limitations imposed by principles of equity and by bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally. Similarly, the remedies available to the Trustee under the Lease may be subject to common law principles and statutory provisions affecting the rights of landlords and tenants.","Because of the following restrictions, purchasers are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or other transfer of Certificates.","The Certificates have not been registered under the Securities Act or with any securities regulatory authority of any jurisdiction and, accordingly, may not be offered or sold within the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Accordingly, the Certificates are being offered and sold only to qualified institutional buyers (\u201cQIBs\u201d), as defined in Rule 144A, in compliance with Rule 144A.","Each purchaser of Certificates offered hereby, by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented to and agreed with the Grantor as follows:","1. It understands and acknowledges that the Certificates have not been registered under the Securities Act or any other applicable securities law, are being offered for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the Securities Act, or any other securities laws, and, unless so registered, may not be offered, sold or otherwise transferred except in compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act or any other applicable securities law, pursuant to an exemption therefrom or in a transaction not subject thereto and in each case in compliance with the conditions for transfer set forth in paragraph (4) below.","2. It is a \u201cqualified institutional buyer\u201d (\u201cQIB\u201d), as defined in Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities Act, and it is aware that any sale of the Certificates to it will be made in reliance on Rule 144A. Such acquisition will be for its own account or for the account of another QIB.","3. It will deliver to each person to whom it transfers Certificates notice of any restrictions on transfer of such Certificates.","4. It is purchasing the Certificates for its own account, or for one or more investor accounts for which it is acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act, subject to any requirements of law that the disposition of its property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control. It agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which it is purchasing the Certificates and each subsequent holder of the Certificates by its acceptance thereof will agree to offer, sell or otherwise transfer such Certificates only (a) to the Grantor, (b) pursuant to a registration statement which has been declared effective under the Securities Act, (c) for so long as the Certificates are eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, to a person it reasonably believes is a QIB that purchases for its own account or for the account of a QIB to whom notice is given that the transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A, (d) pursuant to offers and sales that occur outside the United States within the meaning of Regulation S under the Securities Act, or (e) pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144 under the Securities Act, if available, and in each of the foregoing cases, in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States.

Tenant shall give prompt notice to Landlord of Tenant's intention to contest as hereinabove set forth. In the event Landlord does not receive such notice on or before the date which is thirty (30) days prior to the last day such contest may be commenced, Landlord shall have the right, but not the obligation, at Landlord's expense, to conduct such contest and file any and all papers and\/or commence such proceedings as in Landlord's opinion may be necessary or desirable.

All repairs made by Tenant shall be at least equal in quality and class to the original work. The necessity for and adequacy of repairs to the Demised Premises pursuant to this Article shall be measured by the standard which is appropriate for suburban office buildings in the Kansas City Metropolitan area (both Missouri and Kansas) of similar construction, class and age, provided Tenant shall in any event make all repairs necessary to avoid any structural damage or injury thereto. In connection with the making of any such repairs, Tenant shall comply with the provisions of Article VII hereof. Tenant shall not commit any waste of the Demised Premises. Landlord makes no representation or warranty with respect to the condition of the Demised Premises or its fitness or availability for any particular use, and Landlord shall not be liable for any latent or patent defect therein.","B.

Tenant hereby waives the right to make repairs at the expense of Landlord pursuant to any law in effect at the time of the execution of this Lease or thereafter enacted.","C. If, during the last twelve (12) months of the Lease Term, Tenant is required pursuant to any Legal Requirement to make structural repairs or alterations to the Demised Premises (a \u201cMandated Repair\u201d), then notwithstanding the provisions of Paragraphs A and B of this Article VII, the following shall apply. If a Mandated Repair must be completed prior to the expiration of the Lease Term, Tenant shall be responsible to complete same at its sole cost and expense.

Landlord shall be deemed to have consented to any alterations, additions or improvements requested to be made by Tenant pursuant to the preceding sentence, if Landlord does not provide Tenant with written notice of its objection to same within ten (10) business days of receipt of Tenant's written request with respect to any such alterations, additions or improvements. All other alterations, additions or improvements shall not require the consent of Landlord. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in no event shall Tenant have the right to demolish any part of the Demised Premises (other than non-structural improvements) without Landlord's consent. All such alterations, additions or other improvements shall be and remain a part of the realty and the property of Landlord, shall be subject to the terms of this Lease, and shall be surrendered to Landlord upon the expiration or earlier termination of the Lease Term.","IX. ","Tenant, or any permitted subtenant hereunder may, at its sole cost and expense, install or assemble or place in, on or about the Demised Premises, and remove and substitute, any items of machinery, equipment, furniture, furnishings or other personal property used or useful in Tenant's or its subtenant's business that can be removed from the Demised Premises without material damage thereto, which property shall constitute Tenant's \u201cEquipment\u201d. Tenant's Equipment shall not include ceiling height movable partitions. Title to Tenant's Equipment shall be and remain in the Tenant or the applicable subtenant and Tenant or the applicable subtenant may remove the same upon the expiration or prior termination of the Lease Term or sublease term, as applicable; provided, however, that Tenant or any subtenant, as applicable, shall have no right to remove any such item which is necessary for the operation or maintenance of the Improvements as such, without regard to the nature of the business conducted therein, including, without limitation, heating, ventilating and air-conditioning equipment; and provided further that any of Tenant's Equipment not removed by Tenant or any applicable subtenant after the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease shall be considered abandoned by Tenant or the applicable subtenant and may be appropriated, sold, destroyed or otherwise disposed of by Landlord without obligation to account therefore. Tenant shall pay all costs and expenses incurred in removing or disposing of Tenant's Equipment, whether removed by Tenant or Landlord, and shall repair, at its sole cost and expense, all damage to the Demised Premises caused by the removal of Tenant's Equipment, whether effected by Tenant, a subtenant or Landlord.","X. ","A. Tenant shall cause to be paid all charges for all work done (labor and materials) upon the Demised Premises during the Lease Term and shall not suffer or permit any mechanics' or similar liens for labor or materials furnished to the Demised Premises during the Lease Term to be tiled against the Demised Premises or any part thereof; and if any such lien shall be filed, Tenant shall either pay the same or procure the discharge thereof in any manner permitted by law within thirty (30) days after such filing. Tenant shall indemnify Landlord and save Landlord harmless from and against any and all loss, damage, claims, liabilities, judgments, costs and expenses arising out of the filing of any such lien.","B. If a notice of mechanic's lien shall be filed against the Demised Premises for labor or materials alleged to have been furnished, or to be furnished at the Demised Premises, to or for Tenant or to or from someone claiming under Tenant; and if Tenant shall fail to take such action as shall cause such lien to be discharged within thirty (30) days after such filing, in addition to all other rights of Landlord hereunder, Landlord may pay the amount of such lien or discharge it by deposit or by bonding proceeding, and in the event of such deposit or bonding proceeding, Landlord may require the lienor to prosecute an appropriate action to enforce the lienor's claim. In such case, Landlord may pay any judgment recovered on such claim. Any amount paid or expense incurred by Landlord, as in this Section provided, and any expense incurred or sum of money, paid by Landlord by reason of the failure of Tenant to comply with any provision of this Lease, or in defending any such action, shall be deemed to be additional rent for the Demised Premises, and shall be due and payable by Tenant to Landlord on demand, together with interest at the Interest Rate on the amount so paid by Landlord, from the date paid by Landlord until the date repaid by Tenant. The receipt by Landlord of any installment of the regular stipulated Rent hereunder or any of said additional rent shall not be a waiver of any other additional rent then due.","C. Nothing contained herein shall constitute any consent or request by Landlord, express or implied, to or for the performance of any labor or services or the furnishing of any materials or other property in respect of the Demised Premises, nor as giving Tenant any right, power or authority to contract for or permit the performance of any labor or services or the furnishing of any materials or other property in such fashion as would permit the making of any claim against Landlord in respect thereof; and notice is hereby given that Landlord will not, under any circumstances, be liable for any labor, services or materials furnished to Tenant or to anyone having an interest in the Demised Premises or any part thereof through or under Tenant, and no mechanic's or other lien for any such labor, services or material shall attach to or affect the reversionary or other interest of Landlord in and to the Demised Premises, or in and to any alterations, additions or improvements to me made or erected thereon.","XI. ","Tenant shall arrange for the procurement of and pay, or cause to be paid, all charges for electricity, power, gas, steam, water, telephone and other utilities and services, including, without limitation, cleaning and maintenance services, used upon or in connection with the Demised Premises.

Tenant agrees to, and shall, maintain at all times and at its sole cost and expense, insurance covering the Demised Premises as follows:\n\n","B. All of the insurance required by this Article shall be written by companies of nationally recognized financial standing, reasonably satisfactory to Landlord, which are authorized to issue policies in the state in which the Demised Premises are located. The insurance maintained by Tenant pursuant to this Article or otherwise in respect of the Demised Premises shall name Landlord and Landlord's mortgagee as additional insureds as their interests may appear. The proceeds of the insurance maintained by Tenant under Section A.1 shall be payable in case of loss to the holders of any fee mortgages upon the Demised Premises as their interests may appear. All insurance maintained by Tenant shall provide that (i) no cancellation or reduction thereof shall be effective until at least thirty (30) days after receipt by Landlord of written notice thereof, and (ii) all losses shall be payable as provided in Article XIV notwithstanding any act or negligence of Landlord, Tenant, or any person or entity having an interest in the Demised Premises. Tenant, on the execution and delivery hereof, shall furnish to Landlord, and any mortgagee, certificates for such insurance, and not less than ten (10) days before the expiration of any such insurance, a certificate or binder evidencing the replacement or renewal thereof. Landlord agrees to obtain from any fee mortgagee to whom insurance proceeds are payable hereunder, an agreement that such fee mortgagee shall permit such insurance to be disbursed in accordance with Article XIV hereof.","C. Tenant shall not take out separate insurance concurrent in form or contributing in the event of loss with that required by this Article to be furnished by Tenant unless Landlord and any mortgagee are included therein as additional insureds, as their interests may appear, with loss payable as in this Article provided.

Should Tenant fail to effect, maintain or renew any insurance required to be maintained by the provisions of this Article, or to pay the premium therefor, or to deliver to Landlord, or any mortgagee, any of such policies or certificates, then and in any of said events Landlord, at its option, but without obligation to do so, may, upon ten (10) days' notice to Tenant, procure such insurance on Tenant's behalf. Any sums expended by Landlord to procure such insurance, together with interest thereon at the Interest Rate from the date expended by Landlord until the date repaid by Tenant, shall be deemed to be additional rent hereunder and shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord on demand.","E. There shall be no apportionment of premium in respect of insurance maintained pursuant to this Article at the expiration Tenant may cancel any or any earlier termination of this Lease. Tenant may cancel any such policies as of such expiration or termination and obtain any premium refunds incident thereto. Tenant shall be entitled to any premium refund or dividend received by Landlord or Tenant on account of any insurance maintained by Tenant pursuant to this Article.","F. Tenant hereby waives any and all rights of recovery, claim, action or cause of action against Landlord and Landlord's partners, trustees, agents, officers and employees, for any loss or damage that may occur to the Demised Premises, and to all property, whether real, personal or mixed, located in or about the Demised Premises, by reason of fire, the elements or other risks, regardless of cause or origin, including the negligence of Landlord and Landlord's partners, trustees, agents, officers and employees. Tenant agrees to furnish Landlord with reasonable evidence of Tenant's insurance carrier's consent to such waiver of subrogation.","G. At the request of Landlord, but not more than once every three (3) years, Tenant, at Tenant's sole cost and expense, shall increase the limits of liability on any of the insurance policies (with a corresponding increase in the applicable deductibles if Tenant's net worth at such time equals or exceeds Tenant's Minimum Net Worth) Tenant is required to maintain pursuant to subparagraphs A(2), (3), (6) and (7) of this Article, to such greater amounts as Landlord shall reasonably request; and in the event Tenant shall fail to do so, Landlord may procure such increase on behalf of Tenant and the premiums paid by Landlord therefore, together with interest thereon at the Interest Rate, from the date paid by Landlord until the date repaid by Tenant, shall be deemed to be additional rent hereunder and shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord on demand. Any such request of the Landlord shall be based upon and not in excess of the amount of insurance then being carried by prudent owners of suburban office buildings in the Kansas City metropolitan area (Kansas and Missouri) of similar construction, class and age. If Landlord and Tenant disagree as to the amounts of the limits of liability required by Landlord, Tenant shall first procure the increased limits of liability and may then submit such dispute to arbitration and the same shall be determined by arbitration as hereinafter described, and judgment upon the award rendered may be entered in any Court having jurisdiction. The person desiring arbitration shall appoint a disinterested person as arbitrator on its behalf and give notice thereof to the other party who shall, within fifteen (15) days thereafter, appoint a second disinterested person as arbitrator an its behalf and give written notice thereof to the first party. The arbitrators thus appointed shall appoint a third disinterested person, and such three arbitrators shall, as promptly as possible, determine the matter which is the subject of the arbitration . The decision of the majority of the arbitrators shall be conclusive and binding on all parties. Each arbitrator shall have at least ten (10) years experience in owning, operating or managing real estate in Kansas City (Missouri or Kansas). If a party who shall have the right pursuant to the foregoing to appoint an arbitrator fails or neglects to do so, then, and in such event, the other party shall appoint a second arbitrator. If the two arbitrators appointed shall fail within fifteen (15) days after the appointment of the second arbitrator to appoint a third arbitrator, then either may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction to appoint such third arbitrator. The expenses of arbitration shall be shared equally by Landlord and Tenant but each party shall be responsible for the costs of its own counsel. Landlord and Tenant agree to, and hereby do, waive any and all rights they or either of them may at any time have to revoke their agreement hereunder to submit to arbitration and to abide by the decision rendered thereunder. The arbitrators shall have no power to modify the provisions of this Lease and their judgment is limited accordingly.","XIII. ","A.

All costs and expenses incurred by Landlord in the exercise of any such rights, together with interest thereon at the Interest Rate from the date incurred by Landlord until the date repaid by Tenant, shall be deemed to be additional rent hereunder and shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord on demand.","D. The occurrence of the following event shall constitute an Event of Default under this Lease:","If the EPA, or any other local, state or federal agency asserts or creates a lien upon any or all of the Demised Premises by reason of the (a) presence of Hazardous Materials in, on, under, at or about the Demised Premises, (b) occurrence of a Hazardous Discharge, (c) an Environmental Complaint, (d) any violation of any Environmental Law or otherwise; or if the EPA, or any other local, state or federal agency asserts a written claim against Tenant, the Demised Premises or Landlord for damages or cleanup costs related to the presence of Hazardous Material, a Hazardous Discharge or an Environmental Complaint on or pertaining to the Demised Premises; provided, however, such claim or lien shall not constitute a default if, within ten (10) days after Tenant receives written notice of such lien or claim:\n\n","E.

In addition to its obligations set forth in this Article, Tenant shall, on or before the first anniversary date hereof, remove any exposed asbestos in, on, under or about the Demised Premises.

","A. If the improvements, or any part thereof, shall be damaged or destroyed by fire, the elements or other casualty during the term of this Lease, then Tenant shall give prompt notice thereof to Landlord, and Tenant shall promptly thereafter repair or restore the Improvements to substantially the same condition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, they were in immediately prior to the casualty, and notwithstanding any contrary law, Rent shall not be suspended, abated or reduced as a result thereof. All insurance proceeds recovered on account of any damage or destruction by fire, the elements or other casualty shall be made available for the payment of the cost of the aforesaid repair or restoration. If the amount of said insurance proceeds plus the amount of any deductible applicable to said damage or destruction shall be less than One Hundred Thousand ($100,000.00) Dollars, said insurance proceeds shall be paid over to Tenant. If the amount of said insurance proceeds plus the amount of any deductible applicable to said damage or destruction shall be less than One Hundred Thousand ($100,000.00) Dollars or more, said insurance proceeds shall be paid to any bank or trust company in Kansas City, Mo., designated by Landlord and shall be held in trust and shall be disbursed to Tenant, upon joint signatures of Landlord and Tenant, as the work of repair or restoration progresses upon certificates of the architect or engineer supervising the repair or restoration that the disbursements then requested, plus all previous disbursements made from said insurance proceeds, plus the amount of said deductible, do not exceed the cost of the repair or restoration already completed and paid for, and that the balance being held by Landlord is sufficient to pay for the estimated cost of completing the repair and restoration. All amounts held by such bank or trust company pursuant to the preceding sentence or by Landlord's mortgagee, as provided below, shall be invested in an interest bearing account until disbursed as provided in this Paragraph A, and the interest on such funds shall be added to the proceeds of such insurance for disbursement in accordance with the provisions of this Paragraph A. If the insurance proceeds shall be less than the cost of repair or restoration, Tenant shall pay the excess cost prior to the disbursement of any insurance proceeds. If the insurance proceeds shall be greater than the cost of repair or restoration, the excess shall be paid to Tenant. All repairs and restoration shall be completed in accordance with Article VIII hereof. If Landlord's first mortgagee shall be a bank, insurance company or other recognized institutional lender, such mortgagee may hold any insurance proceeds which would otherwise be paid to the aforementioned bank or trust company and such proceeds shall be disbursed by such mortgagee as the repair and restoration work progresses upon its receipt of the certificates described above.","B. In the event of damage or destruction during the second to last year of the Lease Term, the repair and restoration of which (as estimated and certified to by an architect or engineer designated by Tenant and reasonably approved by Landlord) would cost in excess of 75% of the replacement value of the Building, or in the event of damage or destruction during the last year of the Lease Term hereof, the repair and restoration of which (as estimated and certified to by an architect or engineer designated by Tenant and reasonably approved by Landlord) would cost in excess of 25% of the replacement value of the Building, Landlord or Tenant, upon written notice to the other given within thirty (30) days of such damage or destruction and the determination by the architect or engineer of the replacement value, as aforesaid, may terminate this Lease by serving upon the other at any time within said thirty (30) day period a ten (10) day written notice of its election to so terminate (but a sixty (60) day written notice shall be required in case of Landlord's election to terminate pursuant to this Paragraph B), provided that any and all insurance proceeds received by Tenant in connection therewith and the right to receive all insurance proceeds not previously paid by any insurance company insuring the Demised Premises shall be paid to and assigned to Landlord; and, subject to the following sentence, if such notice is given and such payment and assignment are made, this Lease shall cease and terminate and come to an end on the date specified in said notice as if said date were the date originally mentioned in this Lease for the expiration hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall not have the right to terminate this Lease if any damage or destruction is caused by an uninsured casualty, or if Tenant fails to maintain the insurance required hereunder, or if Landlord is unable (other than by reason of its own acts), for any reason whatsoever, to collect all insurance proceeds which would otherwise be payable by Tenant's insurance carriers in connection with such damage or destruction (unless Tenant makes Landlord whole by paying any such shortfall).","XV. ","A. Tenant hereby irrevocably assigns to Landlord any award or payment to which Tenant may be or become entitled by reason of any taking of the Demised Premises, or any part thereof (\u201cCompensation\u201d), in or by condemnation or other eminent domain proceedings pursuant to any law, general or special, by any governmental authority, civil or military (\u201cCondemnation\u201d), whether the same shall be paid or payable in respect of Tenant's leasehold interest hereunder or otherwise, but nothing in this Lease shall impair Tenant's right to any award or payment on account of Tenant's trade fixtures, equipment and moving expenses, if available, to the extent Tenant shall have a right to make a separate claim therefor against the appropriate governmental authority, but in no event shall any such separate claim be based upon the value of Tenant's leasehold interest and in no event shall any such claim reduce the award which would otherwise be made to Landlord. Tenant agrees to execute any and all documents that may be required in order to facilitate collection by Landlord of any and all such awards. Landlord, and only Landlord may appear in any such proceeding or action to negotiate, prosecute and adjust any claim for any Compensation, and Landlord shall collect any such Compensation.

If all or substantially all of the Land or Improvements shall be taken in or by condemnation or other eminent domain proceedings pursuant to any law, general or special, then this Lease shall terminate on the day preceding the date of the vesting of title to the Demised Premises or portion thereof in the condemning authority and Rent and additional rent shall be paid to the date of such termination.","C. If a Condemnation shall affect at least 50% of the Demised Premises and, in Tenant's reasonable judgment shall render the Demised Premises unsuitable for restoration for continued use and occupancy of Tenant, then Tenant shall, not later than thirty (30) days after such Condemnation, deliver to Landlord (i) notice of its intention to terminate this Lease on the next rental payment date (the \u201cCondemnation Termination Date\u201d) which occurs not less than ninety (90) days after the delivery of such notice, (ii) a certificate of an authorized officer of Tenant describing the event giving rise to such termination, and (iii) an irrevocable offer by Tenant to Landlord to purchase on the Condemnation Termination Date any remaining portion of the Premises and the Net Proceeds, if any, payable in connection with such Condemnation (or the right to receive the same when made, if payment thereof has not yet been made), at a price equal to ten times the then annual Rent payable hereunder. In the event that Tenant exercises the right to terminate the lease provided in this paragraph C, then, in such event, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Paragraph A above, Tenant shall have the right to participate in any condemnation proceeding in connection with such Condemnation. If Landlord shall reject such offer by notice given to Tenant not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the Condemnation Termination Date, this Lease shall terminate on the Condemnation Termination Date, except with respect to obligations and liabilities of Tenant hereunder, actual or contingent, which have arisen on or prior to the Condemnation Termination Date, upon payment by Tenant of all Rent, additional rent and other sums then due and payable hereunder to and including the Condemnation Termination Date and the Net Proceeds shall belong to Landlord. Unless Landlord shall have rejected such offer in accordance with this subparagraph, Landlord shall be conclusively considered to have accepted such offer, and, on the Condemnation Termination Date, there shall be conveyed to Tenant or its designee the remaining portion of the Demised Premises, if any, and there shall be paid and assigned to Tenant or its designee all its interest in the Net Proceeds, pursuant to and upon compliance with subparagraph D below.","D.

Tenant shall pay all charges incident to such conveyance and assignment, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements, recording fees, title insurance premiums and all applicable transfer taxes (not including any income, capital gain or franchise taxes of Landlord) which may be imposed by reason of such conveyance and other instruments. Upon the completion of any purchase of the entire Demised Premises (but not of any lesser interest than the entire Demised Premises) but not prior thereto (whether or not any delay or failure in the completion of such purchase shall be the fault of Landlord), this Lease shall terminate, except with respect to obligations and liabilities of Tenant hereunder, actual or contingent, which have arisen on or prior to such completion of purchase.","E. If (i) less than 50% of the Demised Premises shall be taken in or by condemnation or other eminent domain proceedings pursuant to any law, general or special, or (ii) the use or occupancy of the Demised Premises or any part thereof shall be temporarily requisitioned by any governmental authority, civil or military, then this Lease shall continue in full force and effect without abatement or reduction of Rent, additional rent or other sums payable by Tenant hereunder, notwithstanding such taking or requisition. In such event, Tenant shall promptly after any such taking or requisition and, at its sole cost and expense, repair any damage caused by any such taking or requisition in conformity with the provisions of Article VIII of this Lease so that, after the completion of such repair, the Demised Premises shall be, as nearly as possible, in a condition as good as the condition thereof immediately prior to such taking or requisition, except for ordinary wear and tear. In the event of any such lesser taking in or by condemnation or other eminent domain proceedings, Landlord shall promptly make payments to Tenant out of the Net Proceeds (which shall be held in trust for such purpose), and such payments shall be made in the same manner in which fire insurance proceeds are to be disbursed to Tenant pursuant to the provisions of Article XIV hereof. If there shall be any Net Proceeds remaining after the final payment has been made for such repair work, they shall be retained by Landlord.","F. For purposes of this Lease, all amounts paid pursuant to any agreement with any condemning authority which has been made in settlement of any condemnation or other eminent domain proceeding affecting the Demised Premises shall be deemed to constitute an award made in such proceeding.","XVI. ","A. Subject to the provisions of Paragraph F of this Article XVI and the other terms and conditions of this Article XVI, Tenant shall have the right to assign this Lease (in whole, but not in part), or sublet the Demised Premises (in whole or in part) without the consent of Landlord, provided that in the case of a subletting, no subletting shall be for a term ending later than one day prior to the expiration date of the Lease Term, subject, however, to the provisions of Paragraph D of Article III hereof. Landlord shall have the right to collect and enjoy all rents and other sums of money payable under any sublease of the Demised Premises following the occurrence of any Event of Default, and Tenant hereby assigns such rents and money to Landlord, such assignment to be effective upon the occurrence of any Event of Default.","B. If this Lease be assigned or transferred in violation of the terms of this Lease, Landlord may, after default by Tenant, collect rent from the assignee or transferee, and apply the net amount collected to the Rent, but no such assignment or collection shall be deemed a waiver of any agreement, term, covenant or condition hereof (except that to the extent Rent or additional rent has been collected under the sublease, Tenant shall be entitled to a credit against any Rent or additional rent due and payable by Tenant hereunder), or the acceptance of the assignee or transferee as tenant, or a release of Tenant from the performance or further performance by Tenant of the agreements, terms, covenants and conditions hereof, and Tenant shall continue liable hereunder in accordance with the agreements, terms, covenants and conditions hereof.","C. The merger or consolidation or sale of substantially all the assets of Tenant, shall be deemed an assignment of this Lease and shall be subject to all of the provisions of this Lease with respect to assignments, including, without limitation Paragraph E hereof. There shall be no restriction under this Article XVI applicable to the sale of all or any portion of the stock of Tenant to any third party, and such sale of stock shall not constitute an assignment of this Lease for any purposes under this or any other Article of this Lease.","D. No assignment made shall be effective until there shall have been delivered to Landlord an executed counterpart of such assignment containing an agreement, in recordable form, executed by the assignor and the proposed assignee, wherein and whereby such assignee assumes due performance of the obligations an the assignor's part to be performed under this Lease from and after the effective date of the assignment to the end of the Lease Term. In no event shall any such assignment relieve Tenant of its obligations hereunder.","E. It shall be a condition precedent to the merger of Tenant into another corporation or to the consolidation of the Tenant with one or more other corporations that the surviving entity or transferee of assets, as the case may be, shall (i) have a minimum net worth at least equal to the net worth of Tenant immediately prior to such merger or consolidation, (ii) deliver to Landlord a certified financial statement evidencing the requirements set forth in the foregoing subsection (i), and (iii) deliver to Landlord an acknowledged instrument in recordable form assuming all obligations, covenants and responsibilities of Tenant hereunder; and Tenant covenants that it will not merge or consolidate or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets unless the foregoing requirements are met and such statement and instrument shall have been so delivered.","F. No sublease shall be effective unless Tenant within ten (10) days after the execution of any sublease, shall deliver one fully executed original sublease to Landlord.

It is understood and agreed that if Tenant should sublease all of the Demised Premises to one or two subtenants, then, upon request of Tenant, and provided the conditions set forth in Paragraph I below are satisfied, Landlord, within ten (10) business days after request therefor, shall enter into an agreement with such subtenants, substantially to the effect that in the event of any default proceeding against Tenant (i) Landlord will not make such subtenant a party defendant to such action, nor disturb its possession under its sublease so long as there shall be no default continuing by said subtenant under its sublease (after the expiration of applicable grace periods, if any), and (ii) such subtenant shall be recognized by Landlord as a direct tenant pursuant to such subtenant's sublease as if Landlord had executed such sublease as sublessor thereof; provided, however, that any such subtenant shall attorn to Landlord (any such agreement, or any agreement of similar import, being referred to in this Lease as a \u201cRecognition Agreement\u201d). Any such Recognition Agreement shall provide that the sublease shall continue in full force and effect as a direct lease between Landlord and the subtenant upon all of the terms, conditions, and covenants as are set forth in the sublease, except that Landlord shall not (i) be liable for any previous act or omission of tenant under the sublease; (ii) be subject to any offset not expressly provided for in the sublease, which theretofore shall have accrued to the subtenant against Tenant; (iii) be obligated to perform any work; (iv) be bound by any previous modification of the sublease or by any previous prepayment of more than one month's rent, or additional rent, unless such modification or prepayment shall have been expressly approved in writing by Landlord; or (v) be obligated to repair the sublet space or the Improvements, or any part thereof, in the event of any casualty or in the event of partial condemnation. In connection with any Recognition Agreement, Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord, as additional rent, such reasonable attorney fees and disbursements as are incurred by Landlord in connection with any such Recognition Agreement.","I. Any such Recognition Agreement shall be executed by the Landlord only under the following circumstances:\n\n","A. Tenant shall protect, indemnify, defend and save Landlord, and any officer, director, shareholder, trustee or partner of Landlord, and any mortgagee (collectively, Indemnified Parties\u201d) harmless from and against all liabilities, obligations, claims, damages, penalties, causes of action, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements) imposed upon or incurred by or asserted against an Indemnified Party by reason of any of the following which occurs prior to the later of the expiration or the earlier termination of the Lease or the abandonment of the Demised Premises as described in Article XVIII(A)(vi); (a) any accident, injury to or death of persons, loss of or damage to property occurring in, on, under, at or about the Demised Premises or connected with the use, condition or occupancy of any part thereof; (b) any use, misuse, act or omission, alteration, maintenance or repair of the Improvements by Tenant, its agents, contractors, licensees, or sublessees; and (c) any failure on the part of Tenant to perform or comply with any of the terms, provisions and conditions of this Lease, including, without limitation, the provisions relating to Legal Requirements and Environmental Laws. Each indemnified Party shall give Tenant prompt notice of any such claim; and Tenant, at its sale cost and expense, shall contest, resist and defend any such claim, action or proceedings asserted or instituted against an Indemnified Party, with counsel of its choice, and may compromise or otherwise dispose of the same as it sees fit.","B. The indemnity set forth in the foregoing Section A shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, but only as to matters covered thereby which arose or accrued prior to the later of the expiration or earlier termination of the Lease or the abandonment of the Demised Premises as described in Article XVIII(A)(vi).","XVIII. ","A. Each of the following occurrences or acts shall constitute an event of default (an \u201cEvent of Default\u201d) under this Lease:\n\n","B. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Landlord shall have the right to give Tenant a five (5) day notice of Landlord's termination of this Lease; and upon the fifth (5th) day next succeeding the giving of such notice, this Lease and the estate hereby g ranted shall expire and terminate on such date as fully and completely and with the same effect as if such date were the date herein fixed for the expiration of the Lease Term, all rights of Tenant hereunder shall expire and terminate (Tenant hereby waiving all rights of redemption), but Tenant shall remain liable as hereinafter provided.","C. No expiration or termination of this Lease pursuant to the foregoing Section B, or by operation of law or otherwise, shall relieve Tenant of its liabilities and obligations hereunder, all of which shall survive such expiration or termination.","D. If any Event of Default continues beyond the applicable grace period, if any, Landlord shall have the following rights remedies, which rights and remedies shall not limit, restrict or otherwise modify any other rights or remedies of Landlord, including, without limitation, those set forth in the foregoing Section B:\n\n","E. In the event of any termination of this Lease under the provisions of Section B hereof or in the event that Landlord shall re-enter the Demised Premises under the Provisions of Section D hereof, Tenant will pay to Landlord as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, at the election of Landlord, either:\n\n","If the Demised Premises or any part thereof shall be relet by Landlord for the unexpired portion of the Lease Term, or any part thereof, before presentation of proof of such damages to any court, commission or tribunal, the amount of rent reserved upon such reletting shall, , be the fair and reasonable rental value for the Demised Premises, or part thereof, so relet during the term of the reletting.","In computing such liquidated damages under clause (ii), there shall be added to the said deficiencies such reasonable expenses as Landlord may incur in connection with any re-letting, including, without limitation, legal expenses, attorneys' fees and disbursements, brokerage fees and expenses and for keeping or putting the Demised Premises in good order and preparing the same for re-leting. Any suit brought to collect the amount of the Deficiency for any period shall not prejudice in any way a proceeding for any other period with respect to a deficiency. Landlord, at Landlord's option, may make such alterations, repairs, replacements and\/or decorations in the Demised Premises and advertise the same, as Landlord, in Landlord's reasonable judgment, considers advisable or necessary for the purpose of reletting the Demised Premises or any part thereof; and the making of such alterations and\/or decorations, or any other action by Landlord (except a written release executed and acknowledged by Landlord) shall not operate or be construed to release Tenant from liability hereunder as aforesaid. Landlord shall not be obligated to re-let or attempt to re-let the Demised Premises or any part or parts thereof and the failure of Landlord to re-let the Demised Premises or any part or parts thereof or the failure of Landlord to collect any rent due upon any re-letting shall not release or affect Tenant's liability, for such liquidated damages or other damages. Suit or suits for the recovery of such liquidated damages, or any installment thereof, may be brought by Landlord from time to time at its election and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to require Landlord to postpone suit until the date when the Lease Term would have expired if it had not been terminated under the provisions of Section B hereof, or, had Landlord not reentered the Demised Premises under the provisions of Section D hereof.","F. Nothing herein contained shall be construed as limiting or precluding the recovery by Landlord against Tenant of any sums or damages to which, in addition to the damages specifically set forth in the foregoing Sections, Landlord may lawfully be entitled by reason of the occurrence of any Event of Default hereunder.","G. Mention in this Lease of any particular remedy shall not preclude Landlord from any other remedy, in law or in equity. The specific remedies to which Landlord may resort under the terms of this Lease are cumulative and are not intended to be exclusive of any other remedies or means of redress to which it may be lawfully entitled in case of any breach or threatened breach of any provisions of this Lease; and the exercise by Landlord of any one or more of the rights or remedies provided for in this Lease or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise shall not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise by Landlord of any or all other rights or remedies provided for in this Lease or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise.","XIX. ","If Tenant shall default in the payment, performance or observance of any agreement or condition in this Lease contained on its part to be paid, performed or observed and shall not cure such default within ten (10) days after notice from Landlord specifying the default (except that no notice shall be required in an emergency, as reasonably determined by Landlord), or shall not within said period commence to cure such default and thereafter prosecute the curing of such default to completion with due diligence, Landlord may, at its option, at any time thereafter cure such default for the account of Tenant, and any amount paid or any contractual liability incurred by Landlord in so doing shall be deemed paid or incurred for the account of Tenant, and Tenant agrees to save Landlord harmless therefrom and to reimburse Landlord in the amount so incurred by Landlord, including all reasonable expenses incurred in connection therewith, including, without limitation, reasonable attomey's fees and disbursements, together with interest on all said amounts at the Interest Rate, from the date(s) incurred by Landlord until the date repaid by Tenant, and all such amounts shall be deemed to be additional rent hereunder, and shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord on demand.","XX. ","The failure of Landlord to insist in any one or more cases upon the strict performance of any of the conditions, terms, or covenants of this Lease shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment for the future of such or any other covenants, conditions or terms. The receipt by Landlord of any Rent, additional rent or other sum payable hereunder with knowledge of the breach of any covenant or agreement contained in this Lease shall not be deemed a waiver of such breach, and no waiver by Landlord of any provision of this Lease shall be deemed to have been made unless expressed in writing and signed by Landlord. Landlord shall be entitled, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to injunctive relief in case of the violation, or attempted or threatened violation, of any covenant, agreement, condition or provision of this Lease or to a decree compelling performance of any covenant, agreement, condition or provision of this Lease, or to any other remedy allowed to Landlord by law.","XXI. ","A. This Lease, and the lien hereof, and the rights of Tenant hereunder, are and shall be subject and subordinate in all respects to the lien of all present and future (a) ground leases, master leases, underlying leases, or grants of term of the Land and the Improvements or any portion thereof (collectively, including the applicable items set forth in subsection (c) below \u201cSuperior Lease\u201d), (b) mortgages, deeds of trust, building loan agreements, and spreader and consolidation agreements (collectively, including the applicable items set forth in subsection (c) below, \u201cSuperior Mortgage\u201d), and (c) all renewals, modifications, replacements, supplements, substitutions and extensions thereof, irrespective of the time of execution or time of recording of any Superior Lease or Superior Mortgage, provided that the holder of any such Superior Lease or Superior Mortgage (being hereinafter respectively referred to as \u201cSuperior Lessor\u201d and \u201cSuperior Mortgagee\u201d) shall enter into a Non-Disturbance and Attornment Agreement with Tenant on terms substantially as set forth in Paragraph B below.","B. Landlord and Tenant agree that the Non-Disturbance and Attornment Agreement referred to in Paragraph A above shall provide that upon the termination of the Superior Lease or foreclosure of the Superior Mortgage, this Lease shall continue in full force and effect as a direct lease between such Superior Lessor or Superior Mortgagee and Tenant in accordance with all of the terms thereof, including, without limitation, then unexercised rights to Renewal Terms and Tenant shall attorn to such Superior Lessor or Superior Mortgagee and this Lease shall continue in full force and effect upon all of the terms of this Lease except that such Superior Mortgagee or Superior Lessor shall not be (a) liable for any previous act or omission or negligence of Landlord under this Lease; (b) subject to any counterclaim, defense or offset, which theretofore shall have accrued to Tenant against Landlord; or (c) bound by any previous modification or amendment of this Lease or by any previous prepayment of more than one month's Rent, unless such modification or prepayment shall have been approved in writing by the Superior Lessor or the Superior Mortgagee, but this clause (c) shall be operative only if Tenant shall have been furnished with the name and address of the Superior Lessor or Superior Mortgagee before such prepayment or modification is made.","XXII. ","A. Neither Landlord, nor any partner, trustee, shareholder, officer or director of Landlord shall have any personal liability under this Lease. Tenant shall look only to Landlord's estate in the Demised Premises for the satisfaction of Tenant's remedies for the collection of a judgment (or other judicial process) requiring the payment of money by Landlord in the event of any default by Landlord hereunder, and no other property or assets of Landlord or its shareholders, trustees, partners or principals, disclosed or undisclosed, or its officers or directors, shall be subject to levy, execution or other enforcement procedure for the satisfaction of Tenant's remedies under or with respect to this Lease, the relationship of Landlord and Tenant hereunder or Tenant's use or occupancy of the Demised Premises.","B. The term \u201cLandlord\u201d shall mean only the owner at the time in question of the Demised Premises, or of a lease of the Demised Premises, so that in the event of any transfer or transfers of title to the Demised Premises, or of Landlord's interest in a lease of the Demised Premises, the transferor shall be and hereby is relieved and free of all obligations of Landlord under this Lease accruing from and after the date of such transfer, and it shall be deemed, without further agreement, that such transferee has assumed and agreed to perform and observe all of the obligations of Landlord set forth herein during the period it is the holder of Landlord's interest under this Lease; provided, however, that any such Landlord transferor shall continue to be responsible to Tenant for matters arising prior to the transfer of this Lease to the extent of any sole proceeds received by any such Landlord transferor either as a result of a sale of the Demised Premises or an assignment of the Lease.","C. If in this Lease it is provided that Landlord's consent or approval as to any matter will not be unreasonably withheld, and it is established by a court or body having final jurisdiction thereover that Landlord has been unreasonable, the only effect of such finding shall be that Landlord shall be deemed to have given its consent or approval; but Landlord shall not be liable to Tenant in any respect for money damages by reason of withholding its consent.","XXIII. ","In any case where Tenant is required to do any act (other than make a payment of money), delays caused by or resulting from Acts of God, war, civil commotion, fire or other casualty, labor difficulties, general shortages of labor, materials or equipment, government regulations or other causes beyond Tenant's reasonable control shall not be counted in determining the time when the performance of such act must be commenced and\/or completed, whether such time be designated by a fixed time, a fixed period of time or a \u201creasonable time\u201d.","XXIV. ","A. Each of Landlord and Tenant represents that it has, dealt with no real estate broker in connection with this transaction other than J. Scott Harrison of J. Scott Harrison & Co. and Ted Murray of PCA Realty Corporation (collectively, the \u201cBroker\u201d) and Tenant shall pay any commission of the Broker pursuant to a separate agreement. Tenant hereby indemnifies, defends and holds Landlord harmless from and against any and all losses, damages, costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses), causes of action, suits or judgments of any nature arising out of any claims or demands asserted by any broker, agent or finder, licensed or otherwise, including, without limitation, the Broker, claiming to have acted on behalf of Tenant in connection with this transaction. Landlord hereby indemnifies, defends and holds Tenant harmless from and against any and all losses, damages, costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses), causes of action, suits or judgments of any nature arising out of any claims or demands asserted by any broker, agent, or finder, licensed or otherwise, other than the Broker, claiming to have acted on behalf of Landlord in connection with this transaction.","B. The provisions of this Article XXIV shall survive the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease.","XXV. ","Landlord or Landlord's agents shall have the right to enter the Demised Premises at all reasonable times, upon one days' prior notice, except in an emergency, to inspect or examine the same (including environmental inspections), to show them to prospective purchasers, mortgagees or, during the last twenty four months of the term hereof or after an Event of Default of Tenant hereunder, lessees of the Demised Premises, and to make such repairs, alterations, improvements or additions as Landlord may elect to perform following Tenant's failure to make repairs or perform any work which Tenant is obligated to perform under this Lease and the elapsing of any grace period after notice as provided for herein and Landlord shall be allowed to take all material into and upon the Demised Premises that may be required therefor without the same constituting an eviction or constructive eviction of Tenant in whole or in part and the Rent shall in no wise abate while said decorations, repairs, alterations, improvements, or additions are being made. Except in an emergency, Tenant and Landlord shall not enter any area which Tenant reasonably designates as a security area where Tenant stores, or which contains valuable or proprietary items, without being accompanied by a representative of Tenant, unless such representative is not made available after request by Landlord. Nothing herein contained, however, shall be deemed or construed to impose upon Landlord any obligation, responsibility or liability whatsoever, for the care, supervision or repair of the Demised Premises or any part thereof.","XXVI. ","Landlord or Tenant, promptly upon request of the other (or sublessee hereunder, in the case of Landlord), shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the other (or any sublessee hereunder, in the case of Landlord), a certificate of Landlord or Tenant, as the case may be, certifying (a) that the copy of this Lease which is annexed to such certificate is a true and correct copy of same, is unmodified and In full force and effect (or, if there have been modifications, that this Lease is in full force and effect, as modified, and stating the date of each instrument so modifying this Lease), (b) the dates to which Rent and Taxes due hereunder have been paid, and (c) whether, to the best knowledge of each signer, any default exists hereunder (or, in the case of a request by any sublessee, under the applicable sublease) and, if any such default exists, specifying the nature and period of existence thereof and what action Landlord or Tenant, as the case may be, is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto and whether notice thereof has been given to the other party. Any certificate required under this Article may be relied upon by a prospective purchaser, mortgagee or other transferee of Landlord's or (subject to the provisions of Article XVI) Tenant's interest under this Lease.","XXVII. ","Tenant covenants and agrees that in case Landlord shall be made a party to any litigation commenced against Tenant, then Tenant shall pay all expenses, costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements incurred by or imposed on Landlord by or in connection with such litigation, and Tenant shall also pay all costs, expenses and reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements which may be incurred or paid by Landlord in any successful action (which shall include a settlement of any action in which Landlord receives a benefit) to enforce the covenants and agreements of this Lease, and all such expenses, costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements when paid by Landlord shall become at once a valid lien upon the improvements at any time situated on or in the Demised Premises and upon the leasehold estate hereby created, and shall be paid as additional rent hereunder, together with interest thereon at the Interest Rate from the date of payment by Landlord until the date repaid by Tenant, and shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord on demand.","XXVIII. ","If at any time or times during the Lease Term the Rent and\/or additional rent reserved in this Lease shall not be fully collectible by reason of any legal requirement (\u201cRent Control Law\u201d), then Tenant shall enter into such agreement(s) and take such other steps as Landlord may legally request to enable Landlord to collect the maximum rents which may, from time to time during the continuance of such legal rent restriction, be legally permissible (but not in excess of the amounts reserved under this Lease). Upon the termination of such legal rent restriction, (a) the rents shall become and thereafter be payable in accordance with the amounts reserved herein for the periods following such termination and (b) Tenant shall pay to Landlord, to the maximum extent legally permissible, an amount equal to (i) the rents which would have been paid pursuant to this Lease but for such legal rent restriction less (ii) the rents and payments in lieu of rents paid by Tenant during the period such legal restriction was in effect. Further, and notwithstanding anything contained in this Lease to the contrary, if any Rent Control Law is in effect either (a) at the time Tenant exercises its right to renew the Original Term or any Renewal Term of this Lease or (b) on the last day of the then Lease Term, then Tenant's exercise of its renewal right shall not be effective if Landlord is unable to collect the Rent in accordance with Article IV hereof on account of such Rent Control Law and, in such event, this Lease shall terminate at the expiration of the then current Lease Term as if the renewal right had not been exercised. The foregoing notwithstanding, Tenant shall have the right to exercise its renewal right if Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord an amount equivalent to the Rent and additional rent which would be due during such Renewal Term and Landlord agrees to cooperate with Tenant in agreeing upon such alternative method of payment.","XXIX. ","There shall be no merger of this Lease or the leasehold estate created by this Lease with any other estate or interest in the Demised Premises or any part thereof by reason of the fact that the same person, firm, corporation or other entity may acquire or own or hold, directly or indirectly (a) this Lease or the leasehold estate created by this Lease or any interest in this Lease or in any such leasehold estate, and (b) any such other estate or interest in the Demised Premises or any part thereof, and no such merger shall occur unless and until all persons, firms, corporations, and other entities having an interest (including a security interest) in (i) this Lease or the leasehold estate created by this Lease and (ii) any such other estate or interest in the Demised Premises or any part thereof, shall join in a written instrument effecting such merger and shall duly record the same.","XXX. ","A. Tenant shall surrender the Demised Premises to Landlord upon the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease, vacant and broom clean and in at least the condition as same had been upon the execution and delivery hereof, reasonable wear and tear excepted and subject to any damage by fire or other casualty or condemnation which Tenant is not required to repair under Articles XIV and XV of this Lease or which repair is not completed prior to the expiration or termination of this Lease. Tenant acknowledges that possession of the Demised Premises must be surrendered to Landlord at the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease. Tenant agrees to indemnify and save Landlord harmless from and against all cost, claim, loss or liability resulting from delay by Tenant in so surrendering the Demised Premises, including, without limitation, any claims made by any succeeding Tenant founded on such delay. The parties recognize and agree that the damage to Landlord resulting from any failure by Tenant to timely surrender possession of the Demised Premises as aforesaid may be extremely substantial, may exceed the amount of Rent and additional rent theretofore payable hereunder, and will be impossible to accurately measure. Tenant therefore agrees that if possession of the Demised Premises is not surrendered to Landlord within 24 hours after the date of the expiration or sooner termination of the this Lease, Tenant shall pay to Landlord for each month and for each portion of any month during which Tenant holds over in the Premises after the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease, a sum equal to three (3) times the aggregate of that portion of the annual Rent which was payable under this Lease during the last month of the Lease Term. In the event of any holding over, Tenant shall also pay any additional rent which would have been payable under the terms of the Lease attributable to any such period of holding over, including Taxes. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to permit Tenant to retain possession of the Demised Premises after the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease. The aforesaid provisions of this Section shall survive the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease.","B. If Tenant or anyone claiming under Tenant shall remain in possession of the Demised Premises or any part thereof after the expiration of the Lease Term without any agreement in writing between Landlord and Tenant with respect thereto, prior to acceptance of rent by Landlord, the person remaining in possession shall be deemed a Tenant at sufferance; and after acceptance of rent by Landlord, the person remaining in possession shall be deemed a Tenant from month to month subject to the provisions of this Lease insofar as the same may be made applicable to a tenancy from month to month. The aforesaid provisions of this Section shall survive the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease.","XXXI. ","Any notice and other communication given pursuant to the provisions of this Lease shall be in writing and shall be given by delivery by a nationally recognized courier service such as Federal Express, and except as may be expressly otherwise pro- vided in this Lease, any such notice or other communication, shall be deemed given when so delivered to the addressee thereof or rejected by the addressee.

Landlord and Tenant each hereby waives trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim brought by either against the other on any matter whatsoever arising out of or in any way connected with this Lease, the relationship of Landlord and Tenant, Tenant's use or occupancy of the Demised Premises, including, without limitation, any claim of injury or damage, and any emergency and other statutory remedy with respect thereto.","D.

For all purposes of this Agreement, the Servicer shall be deemed to have Actual Knowledge of an Event of Default in the payment of any amount required to be paid by the Tenant under the terms of the Lease not later than two (2) business days after the date required for the making of such payment. In furtherance of its duties hereunder, the Servicer shall inspect the Real Property not less frequently than two (2) times in each twelve (12) calendar month period during the term of this Trust for the purpose of determining the Tenant's compliance with the terms of the Lease and shall prepare and deliver to the Owner Trustee a Property Report reflecting the results of such inspection.","Section 4.07. Enforcement Proceedings. If so directed in writing by the Owner Trustee, after the giving of a Default Notice, the Servicer shall initiate such actions, including, without limitation, the commencement of legal proceedings, as shall, in the judgment of counsel retained by the Owner Trustee for such purpose, be necessary or appropriate to preserve the Trust Estate and enforce the rights and remedies of the Landlord under the Lease (collectively and individually, \u201cEnforcement Proceedings\u201d). In connection therewith, the Servicer shall obtain an inspection of the Real Property, including, without limitation, a phase I environmental inspection and shall deliver copies of any report prepared in connection therewith to the Term Trustee promptly upon receipt of the same.

If the Lease or the Tenant's right to possession of the Real Property thereunder shall be terminated in connection with an Event of Default, Casualty Loss Termination, or Total Condemnation, the Owner Trustee may direct the Servicer to provide Property Management Services and initiate such actions as are, in the reasonable judgment of the Servicer and counsel engaged by the Term Trustee for such purpose necessary or appropriate to: (i) preserve the Trust Estate and maintain the Real Property including, without limitation, the payment of real property taxes, insurance premiums as required to maintain the Minimum Required Insurance and other reasonable costs and expenses of maintaining and preserving the Real Property in good operating condition and in compliance with all Laws; and (ii) if so directed in writing by the Owner Trustee, procure a Replacement Lease or Leases on such terms and conditions as shall be approved in writing by the Owner Trustee. All reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Servicer pursuant to this Section 4.08 shall be Reimbursable Costs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Servicer shall not be required to take any action, incur any expenses or advance any funds of the Servicer under this Section 4.08 unless the Servicer shall have received assurances from the Owner Trustee (or otherwise) as to the source and manner for the reimbursement of such Reimbursable Costs reasonably satisfactory to the Servicer.","Section 4.09 Casualty Services.

The Depository Trust Company (\u201cDTC\u201d), New York, N.Y. will act as securities depository for the securities (the \u201cSecurities\u201d). The Securities will be issued as fully-registered securities registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC's partnership nominee). One fully-registered Security certificate will be issued for [each issue of] the Securities, [each] in the aggregate principal amount of such issue, and will be deposited with DTC. [If, however, the aggregate principal amount of [any] issue exceeds $150 million, one certificate will be issued with respect to each $150 million of principal amount and an additional certificate will be issued with respect to any remaining principal amount of such issue.]","2. DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a \u201cbanking organization\u201d within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a \u201cclearing corporation\u201d within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a \u201cclearing agency\u201d registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. DTC holds securities that its participants (\u201cParticipants\u201d) deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the settlement among Participants of securities transactions, such as transfers and pledges, in deposited securities through electronic computerized book-entry changes in Participants' accounts, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Direct Participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations. DTC is owned by a number of its Direct Participants and by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., the American Stock Exchange, Inc., and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as securities brokers and dealers, banks, and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Direct Participant, either directly or indirectly (\u201cIndirect Participants\u201d). The Rules applicable to DTC and its Participants are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","3. Purchases of Securities under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct Participants, which will receive a credit for the Securities on DTC's records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each Security (\u201cBeneficial Owner\u201d) is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and Indirect Participants' records. Beneficial Owners will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchase, but Beneficial Owners are expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct or Indirect Participant through which the Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership interests in the Securities are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Participants acting on behalf of Beneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership interests in Securities, except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the Securities is discontinued.","4. To facilitate subsequent transfers, all Securities deposited by Participants with DTC are registered in the name of DTC's partnership nominee, Cede & Co. The deposit of Securities with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. effect no change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of the Securities; DTC's records reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts such Securities are credited, which may or may not be the Beneficial Owners. The Participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.","5. Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct Participants, by Direct Participants to Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time.","6. Redemption notices shall be sent to Cede & Co. If less than all of the Securities within an issue are being redeemed, DTC's practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of each Direct Participant in such issue to be redeemed.","7. Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. will consent or vote with respect to Securities. Under its usual procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to the Issuer as soon as possible after the record date. The Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede & Co.'s consenting or voting rights to those Direct Participants to whose accounts the Securities are credited on the record date (identified in a listing attached to the Omnibus Proxy).","8. Principal and interest payments on the Securities will be made to DTC. DTC's practice is to credit Direct Participants' accounts on payable date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC's records unless DTC has reason to believe that it will not receive payment on payable date. Payments by Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in \u201cstreet name,\u201d and will be the responsibility of such Participant and not of DTC, the Agent, or the Issuer, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Payment of principal and interest to DTC is the responsibility of the Issuer or the Agent, disbursement of such payments to Direct Participants shall be the responsibility of DTC, and disbursement of such payments to the Beneficial Owners shall be the responsibility of Direct and Indirect Participants.","[9. A Beneficial Owner shall give notice to elect to have its Securities purchased or tendered, through its Participant, to the [Tender\/Remarketing] Agent, and shall effect delivery of such Securities by causing the Direct Participant to transfer the Participant's interest in the Securities, on DTC's records, to the [Tender\/Remarketing] Agent. The requirement for physical delivery of Securities in connection with a demand for purchase or a mandatory purchase will be deemed satisfied when the ownership rights in the Securities are transferred by Direct Participants on DTC's records.]","10. DTC may discontinue providing its services as securities depository with respect to the Securities at any time by giving reasonable notice to the Issuer or the Agent. Under such circumstances, in the event that a successor securities depository is not obtained, Security certificates are required to be printed and delivered.","11. The Issuer may decide to discontinue use of the system of book-entry transfers through DTC (or a successor securities depositor). In that event, Security certificates will be printed and delivered.","12. The information in this section concerning DTC and DTC's book-entry system has been obtained from sources that the Issuer believes to be reliable, but the Issuer takes no responsibility for the accuracy thereof.","1. Issuer represents that at the time of initial registration in the name of DTC's nominee, Cede & Co., the Securities were Legally or Contractually Restricted Securities,eligible for transfer under Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933 as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), and identified by a CUSIP or CINS identification number that was different from any CUSIP or CINS number assigned to any securities of the same class that were not Legally or Contractually Restricted Securities. Issuer shall ensure that a CUSIP or CINS identification number is obtained for all unrestricted securities of the same class that is different from any CUSIP or CINS identification number assigned to a Legally or Contractually Restricted Security of such class, and shall notify DTC promptly in the event that it is unable to do so. Issuer represents that it has agreed to comply with all applicable information requirements of Rule 144A.","2. Issuer represents that the Securities are [Note: Issuer must represent one of the following, and may cross out the other] [an issue of nonconvertible debt securities or nonconvertible preferred stock which is rated in one of the top four categories by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (\u201cInvestment-Grade Securities\u201d)]","3. If the Securities are not Investment-Grade Securities, Issuer and Agent acknowledge that if such Securities cease to be included in an SRO Rule 144A System during any period in which such Securities are Legally or Contractually Restricted Securities, such Securities shall no longer be eligible for DTC's services. Furthermore, DTC may discontinue providing its services as securities depository with respect to the Securities at any time by giving reasonable notice to Issuer or Agent. Under any of the aforementioned circumstances, at DTC's request, Issuer and Agent shall cooperate fully with DTC by taking appropriate action to make available one or more separate certificates evidencing Securities to any Participant having Securities credited to its DTC accounts.","4. Issuer and Agent acknowledge that so long as Cede & Co. is a record owner of the Securities, Cede & Co. shall be entitled to all applicable voting rights and to receive the full amount of all distributions payable with respect thereto. Issuer and Agent acknowledge that DTC shall treat any DTC Participant (\u201cParticipant\u201d) having Securities credited to its DTC accounts as entitled to the full benefits of ownership of such Securities. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, Issuer and Agent acknowledge that DTC shall treat any Participant having Securities credited to its DTC accounts as entitled to receive distributions (and voting rights, if any) in respect of Securities, and to receive from DTC certificates evidencing Securities. Issuer and Agent recognize that DTC does not in any way undertake to, and shall not have any responsibility to, monitor or ascertain the compliance of any transactions in the Securities with any of the provisions: (a) of Rule 144A; (b) of other exemptions from registration under the Securities Act or of any other state or federal securities laws; or (c) of the offering documents.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1317","num":"1396"},"sup":"1 "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1318","num":"1397"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00039","num":"00039"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"EXHIBIT G"},{"entry":"Letter of Representations"},{"entry":"(To be Completed by Issuer and Trustee)"},{"entry":"K.C.

Certain capitalized terms used in this summary are defined elsewhere in this Private Offering Memorandum.","The Certificates","The Certificates offered hereby evidence undivided fractional interests in K.C. LURE\u00ae Trust 1995-1, a special purpose grantor trust (the \u201cRemainder Trust\u201d). The Remainder Trust will be created and governed by the terms of a Trust Agreement, dated as of Apr. 27, 1995, between Scribcor, Inc. (the \u201cSeller\u201d) and The First National Bank of Chicago, as Trustee (the \u201cTrustee\u201d). The property of the Remainder Trust will consist of a current, fully vested unencumbered remainder interest in fee simple in real property (the \u201cLURE\u00ae Interest\u201d) comprised of the Old American Life Insurance Building, a three story commercial office building located at 4900 Oak Street in the Country Club Plaza district of Kansas City, Missouri (the \u201cProperty\u201d). Following expiration in 2009 of an underlying term-of-years to be purchased by an institutional investor, the Remainder Trust will hold fee simple title to the Properly.","The Remainder Trust","The Remainder Trust is a special purpose grantor trust created and governed by the terms of a Trust Agreement, dated as of Apr. 27, 1995 (the \u201cTrust Agreement\u201d), between the Seller and the Trustee. The Seller has established the Remainder Trust by selling and assigning the LURE\u00ae Interest to the Remainder Trust in exchange for $2,150,000. Prior to such sale and assignment, the Remainder Trust had no assets or obligations or any operating history. The Remainder Trust will not engage in any activity other than acquiring and holding the LURE Interest and issuing the Certificates pursuant to the Trust Agreement.","The LURE\u00ae Interest","The LURE\u00ae Interest is a real property interest and constitutes a current, fully vested unencumbered remainder interest in fee simple in and to the Property. Following termination in 2009 of an underlying term-of-years held by an institutional investor, the Remainder Trust will hold fee simple absolute title to the Property, free and clear of any underlying indebtedness.","Property Acquisition and Bridge Financing","On May 4, 1995, the Seller completed the acquisition of fee simple title to the Property for a purchase price of $10,445,000. The Property consists of a 94,149 square foot office building (the \u201cBuilding\u201d) situated on a 2.091 acre parcel in the Country Club Plaza District of Kansas City, Mo. The Country Club Plaza District is located approximately 4.5 miles south of Downtown Kansas City. The Building was constructed in 1960 and substantial renovations were completed on the Building in 1992.","In completing the acquisition of the Property, Seller caused the previous owner of the Property to \u201csplit\u201d the fee simple ownership of the Property by simultaneously (a) conveying to a single purpose grantor trust (the \u201cTerm Trust\u201d) a term-of-years real property interest in the Property (the \u201cTerm Interest\u201d), which Term Interest will terminate on Dec. 31, 2009, and (b) conveying to the Remainder Trust the LURES\u00ae Interest, which will entitle the Remainder Trust, upon termination of the Term Interest on Dec. 31, 2009, to a fee simple interest in the Property.","The Seller established the Term Trust by assigning and selling the Term Interest to the Term Trust in exchange for $8,295,000, which amount was contributed to the Term Trust by K.C. ABBE Holdings, L.L.C. (\u201cHoldings\u201d), a Delaware limited liability company, the sole members (equity holders) of which are principals or affiliates of the Seller or spouses thereof. Holdings was formed to facilitate the purchase of the Property pending completion of a private placement to institutional investors of certificates representing beneficial interests in the Term Trust (the \u201cTerm Trust Certificates\u201d). Holdings financed its purchase of the beneficial interest in the Term Trust representing the Term Interest by incurring bank indebtedness in the amount of $8,295,000, which indebtedness and accrued interest thereon will be discharged with the proceeds of the offering of the Term Trust Certificates. See \u201cESTIMATED SOURCES AND USES OF FUNDS\u201d and \u201cTHE TRUST AGREEMENT.\u201d","Investment Characteristics of the LURE\u00ae Interest","The LURE\u00ae Interest to be acquired by the Remainder Trust is similar in many respects to a zero-coupon security, with payment \u201cat maturity\u201d occurring in 2009 at the expiration of the underlying term-of-years in the form of unencumbered fee simple absolute title to the Property. However, unlike the holder of a zero-coupon debt security, the Remainder Trust will not be subject to taxation of imputed interest on, or appreciation of, the LURE\u00ae Interest during the underlying term-of years.","During the Term Interest expiring in 2009, the Term Trust will receive all net rental cash flow from the Property and will be responsible for all expenditures associated with conservation of the investment value of the Property, including maintenance, taxes, insurance, etc. The Remainder Trust will receive no financial benefits during the term-of-years and, correspondingly, will not be subject to any property-related expenditures during this period. The beneficiaries of the Term Trust will not have any financial claims against the Remainder Trust, as holder of the corresponding LURE\u00ae Interest, or any claims to any of the economic benefits to be derived from the Property following expiration of the term-of-years in 2009. Accordingly, upon the expiration of the term-of-years in 2009, the Remainder Trust, as holder of the LURE\u00ae Interest, will hold fee simple absolute title to the Property, free and clear of any underlying indebtedness. See \u201cTHE LURE\u00ae INTEREST.\u201d","The Lease","Pursuant to the terms of a Lease, dated as of Dec. 29, 1989, as amended (the \u201cLease\u201d), the Property has been leased to Old American Life Insurance Company (the \u201cTenant\u201d) for an initial term expiring in 2009. The Lease is a so-called \u201ctriple net\u201d lease, with Tenant assuming responsibility for taxes, insurance and operating expenses, obligations for repair and maintenance, and certain condemnation and casualty risks associated with the Building. See \u201cTHE LEASE.\u201d","The Lease Guarantor","The obligations of the Tenant under the Lease have been guaranteed by Kansas City Life Insurance Company (\u201cKansas City Life\u201d or the \u201cLease Guarantor\u201d). Kansas City Life and its wholly owned subsidiaries issue and market a full line of universal life, term and traditional whole life insurance and accident and health insurance products. For the year ended Dec. 31, 1994, Kansas City Life had consolidated revenues in the amount of $393.5 million, pre-tax income of $56.9 million and net income of $37.4 million. At Dec. 31, 1994, the Lease Guarantor had total assets of $2.7 billion and total stockholders' equity of $343.7 million. See \u201cTHE LEASE GUARANTOR.\u201d","Certain Tax Matters","In the opinion of Kirkland & Ellis, special tax counsel to the Seller, the Remainder Trust will be classified for Federal income tax purposes as a grantor trust and not as an association taxable as a corporation. Accordingly, each holder of a Certificate will be subject to Federal income taxation as if it owned directly its proportionate interest in each asset owned by the Trust. See \u201cFEDERAL INCOME TAX MATTERS.\u201d","The Seller and Affiliates","Scribcor, Inc. (the \u201cSeller\u201d) is the grantor of the Remainder Trust and an affiliate of Electrum Partners L.L.C (\u201cElectrum\u201d), a newly-formed Illinois limited liability company. Principals of Electrum have been engaged for over the past three years in developing the proprietary software and technology associated with originating and pricing the term and residual components of commercial real estate.","The principal officers and majority owners of Electrum are Richard M. Ross, Jr. and Richard A. Graff.","Mr. Ross is President of Scribcor, Inc., and has been associated with Scribcor in various administrative capacities since 1971.

He is an author of several widely recognized articles on innovations in real estate finance and investments that have appeared or are scheduled to appear in various professional and academic real estate and financial publications.","The Offering","$2,150,000 aggregate amount of Certificates are being offered hereby at a subscription price of $50,000 per Certificate to persons who satisfy the investor suitability requirements described under the caption \u201cInvestor Suitability.\u201d The minimum subscription for each investor is one Certificate.

The Certificates are being offered without registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cAct\u201d), pursuant to the exemptions provided by Regulation D thereunder.","An investment in Certificates is available only to prospective investors who meet the requirements described below or who the Sellers otherwise determine to be suitable investors.","Each subscriber for Certificates must represent that he:","(a) has an individual net worth, or joint net worth with his spouse, in excess of $1,000,000; or has had an individual income in excess of $200,000 in each of the two most recent years or joint income with his spouse in excess of $300,000 in each of those years and has a reasonable expectation of reaching the same income level in the current year; or otherwise qualifies as an \u201cAccredited Investor\u201d as that term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended;","(b) has an overall commitment to investments which are not readily marketable that is reasonable in relation and not disproportionate to his net worth and his investment in the Certificates will not cause such overall commitment to become excessive, and the investment in the Certificates will not exceed 20% of the subscriber's net worth (exclusive of principal residence, furnishings and automobiles);","(c) is willing and able to bear the economic risk of an investment in the Certificates, has no need for liquidity with respect to this investment and is able to sustain a complete loss of his investment in the Certificates;","(d) has read this Confidential Private Placement Memorandum for purposes of evaluating the risks of investing in the Certificates;","(e) has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters, in general, and in health care investments, in particular, to believe that he is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in the Certificates;","(f) is purchasing Certificates for his own account, for investment, and not with a view to resale; and","(g) is a United States citizen or is treated as a United States citizen for federal income tax purposes.","The foregoing is a summary of certain of the investor suitability and other requirements set forth in the Subscription Agreement and Suitability Statement included as Exhibit A hereto. The investor suitability requirements set forth above represent minimum suitability requirements for prospective purchasers and the satisfaction of such standards by a prospective purchaser does not necessarily mean that the Certificates are a suitable investment for such purchaser. The Seller, in circumstances it considers appropriate, may modify such requirements (including the \u201cAccredited Investor\u201d requirement), without notice, for any reason.","The foregoing representations will be reviewed to determine the suitability of prospective purchasers, and the Seller will have the right to refuse a subscription for a Certificate or Certificates if in its sole discretion it believes that the prospective purchaser does not meet the suitability requirements or that the Certificates are otherwise an unsuitable investment for the prospective purchaser. The Seller will have sole discretion regarding the acceptance or rejection of any subscription to purchase Certificates.","It is anticipated that comparable suitability standards will be imposed by the Seller in connection with any resales of the Certificates; any such resale is subject to various restrictions and consequences. See \u201cTransfers\u201d.","In the event that the Seller or one or more affiliates of the Seller purchase unsold Certificates, certain of the provisions set forth above may be waived provided that such purchase will not result in the loss of an applicable securities law exemption. Any resale of such unsold Certificates, however, will be made only to persons meeting the foregoing criteria.","Offering Terms","The Seller is offering hereby a total of approximately 43 Certificates. The Certificates are being offered at a purchase price of $50,000 per Certificate. The purchase price will be payable in full upon subscription. The minimum subscription is one Certificate, although the Seller reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to accept subscriptions for fractional Certificates.","Except as provided below, the Certificates will be sold only to such persons who meet the suitability standards set forth under \u201cInvestor Suitability.\u201d The Certificates will be sold by the Seller on a best efforts basis and no commissions will be payable in connection therewith.","The offering period will terminate on or before Jun. 1, 1995, unless extended to a date not later than Dec. 31, 1995 (the \u201cOffering Period\u201d).

Except as described under the caption \u201cAdditional Inquiries,\u201d no party has been authorized to give any information or to make any representations other than those contained in this Offering Memorandum, and any such representations may not be relied upon.","Aquisition of Property and Bridge Financing","On May 4, 1995, the Seller completed the acquisition of fee simple title to the Property for a purchase price of $10,445,000. In completing the acquisition of the Property, the Seller caused the previous owner of the Property to \u201csplit\u201d the fee simple ownership of the Property by simultaneously (a) conveying or causing to be conveyed to the Term Trust the Term Interest expiring on Dec. 31, 2009 and (b) conveying or causing to be conveyed to the Remainder Trust, in exchange for $2,150,000, a remainder interest in the Property, which remainder interest will entitle the beneficiaries of the Remainder Trust, upon termination of the Term Interest on Dec. 31, 2009, to a fee simple interest in the Property.","The Seller established the Term Trust by assigning and selling the Term Interest to the Term Trust in exchange for $8,295,000, which amount was contributed to the Term Trust by K.C.

Holdings was formed to facilitate the purchase of the Property pending completion of a private placement of certificates evidencing beneficial interests in the Term Trust (the \u201cTerm Trust Certificates\u201d).

The actual proceeds to be realized upon issuance of the Term Trust Certificates will depend upon prevailing interest rates at the time of issuance of the Term Trust Certificates.","(2) The Seller will be reimbursed for all legal, accounting and filing fees related to the organization of the Remainder Trust, the Term Trust, the preparation of the Trust Agreement and this Offering Memorandum and related organizational expenses.","Risk Factors and Other Considerations","The purchase of Certificates involves substantial risks for investors. In addition to general investment risks and the factors described elsewhere herein, a prospective purchaser of Certificates should consider the following factors.","Real Estate Investment Risks","An investment in Certificates will be subject to many of the risks generally associated with the ownership of unleveraged real property, including the possibility of adverse changes in national and local economic conditions; changes in rates of inflation; changes in the real estate investment climate; adverse changes in local market conditions due to changes in general or local economic conditions and neighborhood characteristics; adverse changes in governmental rules and fiscal policies; natural disasters, including earthquakes and other factors which are beyond the control of the Seller. The success of an investment in the Certificates will depend in large part upon the ability of the Trustee to re-lease the Property upon the completion of the Term Interest in 2009.","Condemnation Risk","As described below, under certain circumstances during the early years of the underlying Term Interest, a \u201ctaking\u201d of the Property by means of eminent domain or other governmental proceedings (a \u201ccondemnation\u201d) resulting in a termination of the Lease could result in loss of all, or a significant portion, of a Certificateholder's investment.","If a condemnation affects more than 50% of the Building and, in Tenanrs reasonable judgment, renders the Building unsuitable for restoration for continued use and occupancy (a \u201cTotal Condemnation\u201d), then Tenant is required to terminate the Lease and submit an irrevocable offer to purchase from the Term Trust (a) any remaining portion of the Building and (b) the right to receive the net proceeds, if any, payable in connection with such condemnation. The purchase price shall be equal to ten times the then-annual Base Rent payable under the Lease, which amount will not be less than $9,326,500. In accordance with the terms of the Term Trust, the Term Trustee is required to accept such offer to purchase, and proceeds received by the Term Trust from the Tenant upon the occurrence of a Total Condemnation are to be distributed, first, to holders of Term Trust Certificates solely to the extent of the applicable Prepayment Amount, and second, if and only to the extent of any remaining proceeds, to the Remainder Trustee for distribution to holders of Certificates. The applicable \u201cPrepayment Amount\u201d at any date with respect to holders of Term Trust Certificates will be an amount generally equal to the present value of the then-remaining monthly lease payments otherwise to be made under the Lease, discounted to the date of prepayment at the Imputed Interest Rate. The \u201cImputed Interest Rate\u201d with respect to the Term Trust Certificates is the annual pre-tax interest rate which the holders of Term Trust Certificates applied, at the time of initial issuance of the Term Trust Certificates, as the discount rate to the stream of cash flows represented by payments to be made during the Term Interest under the Lease.","Assuming an Imputed Interest Rate of 7.24%, the amount of the proceeds to be received upon a Total Condemnation will be generally equal to or nominally in excess of the then-applicable Prepayment Amount through the period ending Dec. 31, 1999. As a result, in the event of a Total Condemnation during such period, holders of Certificates will not receive a return of their initial investment and could incur a significant loss. While the Seller believes that the probability of a Total Condemnation under the Lease is remote, the occurrence of such an event during the early years of the underlying Term Interest could have a material adverse effect upon the holders of Certificates.","No Operating History","The Remainder Trust is newly formed and has no operating history.","Achievement of Objectives","There can be no assurance that any or all of the principal objectives of the Remainder Trust as set forth under \u201cBusiness\u201dcan be achieved. Any reference to the objectives of the Seller should not be interpreted as a guarantee, representation or warranty. Arbitrary Offering Price","The offering price of the Certificates offered hereby has been arbitrarily determined by the Seller based primarily upon the estimated cost of acquiring the LURE\u00ae Interest, the expenses to be paid as a result of this offering, the cost of organizing the Remainder Trust and other matters. The offering price of the Certificates is no indication of their value or the value of the assets which the Remainder Trust will acquire. No assurance is or can be given that any Certificates, if transferable, could be sold for the offering price or for any amount.","Lack of Liquidity","There is no established market for the Certificates and the Seller does not anticipate that any market will develop. Consequently, holders may not be able to liquidate their investment in the event of an emergency or for other reasons. Purchase of a Certificate is therefore suitable only for persons who have no need for liquidity with respect to their investment and who are able to bear the economic risks of their investments for an unlimited period of time.","Securities Law Aspects","The Certificates have not been registered under the Act or the Illinois Securities Act in reliance upon certain exemptions from registration thereunder. The Seller believes that the offering presently qualifies and, where appropriate, will continue to qualify under the exemptions. However, since the availability of certain of these exemptions is based upon subjective factors, and in some instances the criteria for exemption are subject to reinterpretation by state or federal regulatory agencies and courts, there can be no assurance that such exemptions will be determined to be available.","The LURE\u00ae Interest","Background","Academics and real estate finance specialists have generally accepted the notion that commercial real estate leased on a so-called \u201cbondable\u201d basis (i.e., obligating the tenant to pay, among other things, all maintenance, insurance and tax expenses and to assume certain condemnation, environmental and structural repair risks) to credit-worthy tenants can be divided conceptually into two components: a bond-equivalent component and a \u201cresidual)\u201d, or equity, component. The bond-equivalent component represents the value on a net present value basis of the expected payments under the bondable lease, discounted at a rate appropriate to the duration of the lease and the credit-worthiness of the tenant. The bond-equivalent component is comparable in many respects to an intermediate-term, non-callable fixed-income security. In contrast, the \u201cresidual\u201d, or equity, component represents the value of commercial real estate after the cash flows generated by the bond-equivalent component have been eliminated\u2014i.e., the net present value of the future right to occupy the real estate upon expiration of the term of the lease. Legally, the bond-equivalent component can be simulated by creating a term-of-years of a duration co-terminous with the term of the triple-net lease, while the equity component in a particular property represents a current, fully vested unencumbered remainder interest in fee simple title to such property. This unencumbered remainder interest will entitle the holder to future possession and control of the property on a debt-free basis following the termination of the underlying term-of-years.","Over the last four years, principals of Electrum have developed proprietary financial software to implement this debt\/equity conceptual model of commercial real estate value. Electrum utilizes a proprietary pricing model comparable to that used to price and value fixed income securities to appropriately price and value both the bond-equivalent component of a commercial real estate asset and the residual equity component of that asset. Investment Characteristics of LURE\u00ae Interest","The LURE\u00ae Interest to be acquired by the Remainder Trust is similar in many respects to a zero-coupon security, with payment \u201cat maturity\u201d occurring in 2009 at the expiration of the underlying term-of-years in the form of unencumbered fee simple absolute title to the Property. However, unlike the holder of a zero-coupon debt security, holders of Certificates, as beneficiaries of the Remainder Trust, will not be subject to taxation of imputed interest on, or appreciation of, the LURE\u00ae Interest during the underlying term-of-years.","In effecting the acquisition of the entire fee simple interest in the Property pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, Seller caused the previous owner of the Property to \u201csplit\u201d the fee simple ownership of the Property by simultaneously (a) conveying to the Term Trust a term-of-years real property interest in the Property, which term-of-years interest will terminate on Dec. 31, 2009 and (b) conveying to the Remainder Trust the LURE\u00ae Interest, which will entitle the holders of Certificates, as beneficiaries of the Remainder Trust, upon termination of the Term Interest on Dec. 31, 2009, to a fee simple interest in the Property.","The Seller has established the Remainder Trust by selling and assigning the LURE\u00ae Interest to the Remainder Trust in exchange for $2.15 million. Prior to such sale and assignment, the Remainder Trust had no assets or obligations or any operating history. The Remainder Trust will not engage in any activity other than acquiring and holding the LURE Interest and issuing the Certificates.","During the term-of-years expiring in 2009, the Term Trust will receive all net rental cash flow from the Property and will be responsible for all expenditures associated with conservation of the investment value of the Property, including maintenance, taxes, insurance, etc. The Remainder Trust as holder of the LURE\u00ae Interest will receive no financial benefits during the term-of-years and, correspondingly, will not be subject to any property-related expenditures during this period. The Term Trust will not have any financial claims against the Remainder Trust, as holder of the corresponding LURE\u00ae Interest, or any claims to any of the economic benefits to be derived from the Property following expiration of the term-of-years in 2009. Accordingly, upon the expiration of the term-of-years in 2009, the Remainder Trust, as holder of the LURE\u00ae Interest, will be entitled, free of any underlying indebtedness, to exclusive possession and control of the Property.","To illustrate the investment characteristics of the LURE\u00ae Interest, set forth below is an example of hypothetical investment returns to the Remainder Trust, assuming the LURE\u00ae Interest is held by the Remainder Trust until expiration of the underlying term-of-years in 2009:","Property Purchase Price: $10,455,000.","Valuation of Term-of Years and LURE\u00ae Interest: Assume that the bond-equivalent component entitled to receive the net cash flows from the Lease is sold to an institutional investor or investors. The price of the LURE\u00ae Interest to the Remainder Trust equals the difference between the market value of the Property (plus fees and expenses associated with the separation), less the cost of the bond-equivalent component, or $2.15 million.","Investment Return: If the LURE\u00ae Interest is held to maturity (i.e., until Dec. 31, 2009), the investment return on the LURE\u00ae Interest is determined by the value of the Property at the end of the term-of-years:","Assuming a 25% decline in the Property's market value over the investment period (to $7,841,250), then the LURE\u00ae Interest will yield a compound annual return of 9.22% and a total return of 264.71%.","Assuming no change in the Property's value over the investment period, then the LURE\u00ae Interest will yield a compound annual return of 11.38% and a total return of 386.28%.","Assuming a 25% increase in the Property's market value over the investment period (to $13,068,750), the LURE\u00ae Interest will yield a compound annual return of 13.08% per annum and a total return of 507.85%.","An investment in Certificates will be subject to many of the risks generally associated with the ownership of unleveraged real property, including the possibility of adverse changes in national and local economic conditions; changes in rates of inflation; changes in the real estate investment climate; adverse changes in local market conditions due to changes in general or local economic conditions and neighborhood characteristics; adverse changes in governmental rules and fiscal policies; natural disasters, including earthquakes and other factors which are beyond the control of the Seller.","The Remainder Trust","Set forth below is a summary of certain provisions of the Trust Agreement governing the terms of the Remainder Trust. The description and summaries of the Trust Agreement hereinafter set forth do not purport to be comprehensive or definitive, and reference is made to the Trust Agreement for the complete details of all terms and conditions. All statements herein are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Trust Agreement, a copy of which is attached as exhibit C to this Confidential Private Placement Memorandum.","The Certificates","The Certificates will be issued only in fully registered form. The Certificates will be issued in denominations of $50,000 and integral multiples thereof.","The Trust Agreement","General","The Trust Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions on which the Trustee shall hold the LURE\u00ae Interest, both during the term-of-years held by the Term Trust, and following the termination of the Term Trust upon the expiration of the term-of-years expiring in 2009. The Trust Agreement establishes the duties and obligations of the Trustee regarding the collection and distribution of funds and other administrative responsibilities relating to the LURE) Interest. The Trust Agreement assigns the Trustee the general responsibilities accorded financial fiduciaries, reserving other specified services to the beneficiaries as appropriate.","Flow Of Funds","The terms of the Trust Agreement require the Trustee to establish the Administration Account into which the Trustee is required to deposit all monies received for the benefit of the Certificateholders on account of any rent or other payments received in respect of the Property. The Administration Account must be established at a bank or other financial institution: (i) authorized pursuant to applicable laws to exercise corporate trust powers with respect to the LURE\u00b0 Interest; (ii) having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authorities; and (iii) having (or having a parent which has) a long term unsecured debt rating of at least BBB-by Standard & Poor's Corporation and at least Baa3 by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. On the 15th day of each month following the establishment of the Administration Account, the Trustee is directed to distribute to the Certificateholders as of the immediately preceding Record Date the amount of Distributable Funds then on deposit in the Administration Account. Distributable Funds includes the total balance of funds then in the Administration Account less the sum of: (i) $25,000; plus (ii) the amount of all Reimbursable Costs incurred by the Trustee for which the Trustee has not previously been reimbursed; plus (iii) the amount of all Reimbursable Costs reasonably anticipated by the Trustee to be incurred prior to the next succeeding Distribution Date. The Trustee has a priority right to reimbursement of Reimbursable Costs incurred pursuant to the Trust Agreement from Collections received by the Trustee and, if necessary, from the Trust Estate. On the Final Distribution Date, the Distributable Funds shall be calculated without regard to clauses (i) and (iii) above.","For purposes of calculating Distributable Funds, \u201cReimbursable Costs\u201d include all fees, expenses, costs or other charges incurred in good faith by the Trustee in the performance of its duties and obligations under the Agreement. By way of example, Reimbursable Costs would include all fees and expenses incurred by the Trustee in connection with the engagement by the Trustee of Qualified Real Estate Consultants and counsel to advise the Trustee regarding the discharge by the Trustee of its obligations under Section 6.2 of the Trust Agreement upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Casualty Loss Termination or Total Condemnation.","General Duties Of Trustee","The Trustee shall generally have only such duties as are specifically set forth in the Trust Agreement relating to the administration of the Remainder Trust in the interest of the Certificateholders and is required to discharge such duties in accordance with its general obligations of loyalty and prudence as Trustee. The Trustee shall receive on behalf of the Certificateholders all Collections with respect to the Property and shall deposit the same into the Administration Account for monthly distribution in accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement. Each monthly distribution shall be accompanied by a statement itemizing Collections received, Reimbursable Costs incurred and the calculation of the amount of such distribution. In addition, the Trustee shall be required to give and receive all notices in respect of the Trust Estate as more specifically set forth in the Trust Agreement.","Specific Duties Of Trustee","Actions to Be Taken By Trustee Upon Event of Default Under Lease. The Trustee is required generally to monitor the performance of the Tenant under the Lease and to give and receive all notices required or permitted to be given or received by the Trustee under the Administration Agreement. If an Event of Default shall occur under the Lease, the Trustee must give notice thereof to the holders of Certificates and proceed upon the further written instruction of the holders of Certificates with respect to such Event of Default. Because of the nature of the LURE\u00ae Interest, during the term-of-years owned by the Term Trust, the Trustee has limited rights with respect to actions involving the Property. Such rights will generally be limited to the Trustee's ability to commence an action against the Term Trustee seeking to prevent waste regarding the Property through the failure of the Term Trustee to enforce the terms of the Lease or to otherwise take such actions as are reasonably necessary with respect to the preservation of the Property.","If so directed in writing by the holders of Certificates, the Trustee shall initiate such actions, including the commencement of legal proceedings, as shall in the reasonable judgment of counsel retained by the Trustee for such purpose be necessary or appropriate to preserve the Trust Property. All costs and expenses incurred by the Remainder Trustee in so acting shall constitute Reimbursable Costs. The Trustee shall not be required to take any action, incur any expense or advance any funds unless: (i) there shall then be on deposit in the Administration Account funds sufficient, in the reasonable judgment of the Trustee, to provide for reimbursement of all Reimbursable Costs incurred or to be incurred by the Trustee in acting at the direction of the holders of Certificates; or (ii) the Trustee shall have received assurances from the holders of Certificates as to the source and manner for the reimbursement of such Reimbursable Costs reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee (clauses (i) and (ii) above being hereinafter referred to as the \u201cReimbursement Conditions\u201d). If the Trustee shall seek such assurances and the holders of Certificates shall fail or refuse to provide the same within fifteen (15) days after demand therefor by the Trustee, such failure or refusal shall constitute a Termination Event and require the Trustee to cause the Trust Property to be sold at auction to the highest bidder. The holders of Certificates will not be permitted to bid at such auction.","Casualty Loss; Casualty Loss Termination. In the event of a Casualty Loss affecting the Property involving a loss in excess of $100,000, the Trustee is required to give written notice to the holders of Certificates. If such Casualty Loss results in a Casualty Loss Termination of the Lease, the Trustee shall so notify the holders of Certificates and await the further written instructions of the holders of Certificates. If the holders of Certificates shall direct the Trustee with respect to the taking of any actions in response to such Casualty Loss Termination, all fees and expenses reasonably incurred by the Trustee in connection therewith shall be Reimbursable Costs. The Trustee shall have no obligation to take any such actions unless the Reimbursement Conditions are then met. For purposes of the Trust Agreement, a \u201cCasualty Loss\u201d is any loss or damage suffered or incurred with respect to the Property arising out of any fire, windstorm, flood, earthquake, act of God, war, strike or other casualty. A \u201cCasualty Loss Termination\u201d means any termination of the Lease resulting from the occurrence of a Casualty Loss. See \u201cExhibit D\u2014SUMMARY OF LEASE PROVISIONS\u2014Fire and Other Casualty.\u201d","Condemnation. In the event of a Partial Condemnation affecting the Property, the Trustee shall give written notice thereof to the holders of Certificate and await the instructions of the holders of Certificate. If, after restoration of the Property pursuant to the terms of the Lease, there remains any unapplied balance of the Condemnation Award received in respect of such Partial Condemnation, such unapplied balance is required by the terms of the Term Trust to be paid to the Trustee, who in turn shall deposit the same in the Administration Account for distribution in accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement.","If there shall occur a Total Condemnation, the Trustee shall give notice thereof to the holders of Certificates and proceed in accordance with the written instructions thereof; provided that if the holders of Certificates fail to direct the Trustee as to the taking or failing to take of any action in connection with such Total Condemnation, the Trustee shall retain a Qualified Real Estate Consultant with respect to the Total Condemnation and shall proceed in the manner determined by the Qualified Real Estate Consultant to be in the best interests of the holders of Certificates. All legal fees and expenses incurred by the Trustee in so acting shall be Reimbursable Costs.","For purposes of the Trust Agreement, a \u201cPartial Condemnation\u201d means (i) any taking by condemnation or other eminent domain proceeding pursuant to any law or (ii) temporary requisition of the Property or any part thereof by any governmental authority after the occurrence of which the Lease shall remain in full force and effect. A \u201cTotal Condemnation\u201d means any condemnation after the occurrence of which the Lease shall not remain in full force and effect. A \u201cQualified Real Estate Consultant\u201d means the commercial loan servicing, property or asset management group which is an affiliate of the Trustee, if such group is affiliated with the Trustee, or any Person who: (i) has not less than 10 years of experience as a professional asset or property manager and is licensed (if required) to perform such services in the locale of the property; (ii) then has under management a portfolio of commercial and office properties containing in the aggregate not less than 2 million square feet or with an aggregate fair market value of not less than $20 million; and (iii) then has not fewer than employees directly engaged in the provision of asset or property management services.","Termination Of Trust Agreement","The Trust shall terminate upon the final distribution of all monies or other property or proceeds of the Trust Estate following the occurrence of a Termination Event or a sale of the Trust Estate pursuant to Section 7.2 of the Trust Agreement. A \u201cTermination Event\u201d shall have occurred upon the happening of any of the following: (i) a Total Condemnation; (ii) the failure of the holders of Certificates to give the financial assurances or indemnity required pursuant to Sections 6.2(d) or (g) of the Trust Agreement with respect to actions to be taken by the Trustee following an Event of Default or Casualty Loss Termination; (iii) the expiration of ten (10) years from the date on which the Term Trust shall have terminated; or (iv) following the date on which the Term Trust shall have terminated, the receipt by the Trustee of a written direction from all holders of Certificates directing the Trustee to terminate the Trust and containing a release of all claims of any nature whatsoever of such holders of Certificates against the Term Trustee and the beneficial owners of any interest in the Term Trust arising from or in connection with the Term Trustee's ownership of the Term Interest in the Property, or the use, operation or maintenance of the Property during the term of the Term Trust.","Section 7.2 of the Trust Agreement requires the Trustee to sell the Trust Estate at auction in the event of the occurrence of a Termination Event pursuant to Sections 6.2(d) or (g) of the Trust Agreement. Such sale shall take place pursuant to an auction to be held in a manner and at the direction of an auctioneer as recommended by a Qualified Real Estate Consultant retained by the Trustee with respect to conduct of such auction. The holders of Certificates will not be permitted to bid at such auction. All reasonable fees and expenses incurred by the Trustee, including, without limitation, fees and expenses incurred by counsel retained by the Trustee in connection with such auction shall be Reimbursable Costs. The proceeds of such auction shall be deposited into the Administration Account, and applied in accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement.","Amendments","For so long as Elizabeth McKeever Ross is the sole Certificateholder, she may cause the Trust Agreement to be amended at any time by a written instrument effecting such amendment, provided that any amendment which materially modifies the scope or nature of the duties and obligations of the Trustee shall not be effective unless consented to by the Trustee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. It is contemplated that upon the sale by K.C. ABBE\u00ae Holdings, L.L.C. of the beneficial interest in the Term Trust, the Trust Agreement shall be amended to eliminate such right of amendment by Elizabeth McKeever Ross and to reflect the designation of a successor trustee to The First National Bank of Chicago. The Trust Agreement may be amended by the Trustee with the consent of the holders of 51% or more of the Voting Interests only for the limited purposes of (i) curing any ambiguity; (ii) correcting or supplementing any provision in the Trust Agreement that may be defective or inconsistent with any other provision; (iii) as shall be required in connection with the acceptance of the appointment of a successor Trustee; or (iv) and as may be required to facilitate the administration of the Remainder Trust under the Trust Agreement by more than one Trustee pursuant to Article 6 of the Trust Agreement. The Trust Agreement may not otherwise be amended.","The Trustee","The First National Bank of Chicago will serve as Trustee. The Trustee, in its individual capacity or otherwise, and any of its affiliates, may hold Certificates in their own name or as pledgee. In addition, for the purpose of meeting the legal requirements of certain jurisdictions, the Trustee will have the power to appoint co-trustees or separate trustees of all or any part of the Remainder Trust. In the event of such appointment, all rights, powers, duties and obligations conferred or imposed upon the Trustee by the Trust Agreement will be conferred or imposed upon the Trustee and such co-trustee or separate trustee jointly or, in any jurisdiction where the Trustee is incompetent or unqualified to perform certain acts, singly upon such co-trustee or separate trustee who shall exercise and perform such rights, powers, duties and obligations solely at the direction of the Trustee.","The Trustee may resign at any time, in which event the Certificateholders may appoint a successor trustee. The Certificateholders may also remove the Trustee if the Trustee ceases to be eligible to serve, becomes legally unable to act, is adjudged insolvent or is placed in receivership or similar proceedings.","The Trust Agreement provides that the fees and expenses of the Trustee constitute Reimbursable Costs, reimbursable from funds on deposit in the Administration Account created pursuant to the Trust Agreement.","The Trustee's Corporate Trust Office is located at One First National Plaza, Suite 0126, Chicago, Ill. 60670-0126. The Seller and its affiliates may have other banking relationships with the Trustee and its affiliates in the ordinary course of their respective businesses.","The Building and the Property","General","The Seller has purchased for $10,445,000 the entire fee simple interest in the Kansas City Life Insurance Office Building, a 94,149 square foot office building (the \u201cBuilding\u201d) located at 4900 Oak Street in the Country Club Plaza district of Kansas City, Missouri. The Building was constructed in 1960 and substantial renovations were completed on the Building in 1992. Pursuant to the terms of a so-called \u201cbondable\u201d lease, the term of which expires in 2009, the Building is 100% leased to Old American Life Insurance Company (the \u201cTenant\u201d). The obligations of the Tenant under the Lease have been unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by Kansas City Life Insurance Company (the \u201cLease Guarantor\u201d), and the Tenant has subleased a portion of the Building to The Ewing Kauffman Foundation (the \u201cSubtenant\u201d). The sublease expires in 1997, but the Subtenant has options to extend.","The Building","The Building is a three-story office building containing 94,149 square feet of rentable area, of which approximately 27,780 square feet comprise a basement containing a mailroom, print shop, cafeteria, boiler room and restrooms. A sprinklered garage containing 76,341 square feet adjoins and is connected to the structure and provides sheltered parking for 250 vehicles.

This summary is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), and upon rules and regulations promulgated under the Code and existing interpretations thereof, any of which could be changed at any time, by legislation or otherwise. Any of such changes may or may not be retroactive with respect to transactions consummated prior to the date such changes are announced. The discussion below does not purport to address federal income tax consequences applicable to particular categories of investors, some of which (e.g., banks, tax-exempt organizations, insurance companies or foreign investors) may be subject to special rules.","In the opinion of Kirkland & Ellis, special tax counsel to the Seller, the Remainder Trust will be classified for Federal income tax purposes as a grantor trust and not as an association taxable as a corporation. Accordingly, each holder of a Certificate will be subject to Federal income taxation as if it owned directly its proportionate interest in each asset owned by the Trust. Each holder of Certificates will be required to report on its federal income tax return its pro rata share of each item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit from the property held in the Remainder Trust, in accordance with such holder's method of accounting. In general, until the expiration in 2009 of the underlying Term Interest in the Property, the Remainder Trust is not expected to recognize any income or incur any expenses with respect to the LURE\u00ae Interest. Any increase or decrease in the fair market value of a Certificate will not give rise to recognizable gain or loss, respectively, to a holder for Federal income tax purposes, until the earlier of such holder's sale of his Certificate or the Remainder Trust's sale of the LURE\u00ae Interest.","A holder that sells or exchanges a Certificate should recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between its adjusted lax basis in the Certificate and the amount realized upon such sale or exchange. If the holder held such Certificate as a capital asset, any such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss, which will be long-term capital gain or loss if the Certificate was held for more than one year. Any long-term capital gains realized on the sale or exchange of a Certificate will be taxable under current law to corporate taxpayers at the rates applicable to ordinary income, and to individual taxpayers at a maximum marginal rate of 28%.
