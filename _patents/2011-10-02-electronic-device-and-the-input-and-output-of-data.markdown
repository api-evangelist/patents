No. 13\/053,550, filed Mar. 22, 2011, entitled \u201cElectronic Device and the Input and Output of Data,\u201d which claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/316,017, filed Mar. 22, 2010, entitled \u201cElectronic Device and the Input and Output of Data,\u201d and claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/437,118, filed Jan. 28, 2011, entitled \u201cIdentifiable Object and a System for Identifying an Object by an Electronic Device,\u201d and claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/442,084, filed Feb. 11, 2011, entitled \u201cElectronic Device and the Input and Output of Data,\u201d and claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/442,086, filed Feb. 11, 2011, entitled \u201cIdentifiable Object and a System for Identifying an Object by an Electronic Device.\u201d The entire disclosure of each of the above-identified U.S. non-provisional patent application and four U.S. provisional patent applications is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The present invention relates to an electronic device, and in particular, to the input and output of data from the electronic device. The present invention also relates to a system for identifying an object, such as a toy figure or toy vehicle, on a touch screen of an electronic device. The present invention further relates to an object that is identifiable by an electronic device.","Various electronic devices including a touch screen configured to detect an object (e.g. a stylus) or a user's finger are known. Some electronic devices provide for a virtual environment presented on a display, on which physical objects may be placed on the display and optically detected using a camera. Other devices receive data transmitted from memory provided in an object. Such conventional devices are relatively complex and\/or fail to recognize the identity, location and\/or orientation of an object on a touch screen of an electronic device.","Children are becoming more familiar and comfortable with the use of electronic devices, such as mobile phones, tablets, etc. However, conventional children's toys lack the ability to be used with such electronic devices.","Thus, there is a need for a system that allows children's toys to interact with an electronic device to provide an enhanced play experience. In addition, there is a need for an object that can be easily identified by an electronic device. There is also a need for an object whose orientation on the electronic device can also be detected or determined.","In one embodiment, an electronic device can be configured to receive information or data. In addition, the electronic device can be configured to output information or data. The output from the electronic device may include an encoded or embedded signal. A module can be used with the electronic device to decode the embedded or encoded signal from the electronic device and transmit it to a remote object, such as a toy. The embedded or encoded signal can be used to drive functionality in the remote object.","In one embodiment, a case can be coupled to the electronic device. The case can include a module having circuitry that can be in communication with the electronic device. The module may be in direct contact with the electronic device, such as via a plug in a headphone jack of the electronic device. Alternatively, the module may be spaced apart from the electronic device.","In one embodiment, the present invention is directed to a system for identifying an object. The system includes an electronic device having a touch screen, and an object recognizable by the touch screen. The object may be a toy figure, a toy vehicle, a toy building, a playing card, a coin, poker chips, board game pieces, a geometric structure, etc. The object includes a first contact member engageable with the touch screen and a second contact member engageable with the touch screen. The first contact member is spaced from the second contact member by a first distance. The electronic device identifies the conductive object when the first and second contact members engage the touch screen. In addition, the system can be used to detect a gesture or movement of an object.","The first and second contact members define a pattern of contact points on the touch screen recognizable by the electronic device for identifying the object. The location and\/or orientation of the object on the touch screen may also be determined based on the pattern of contact points on the touch screen.","In one embodiment, the object is a first conductive object. The system includes a second object having a third contact member engageable with the touch screen and a fourth contact member engageable with the touch screen. The third contact member is spaced from the fourth contact member by a second distance. The second distance differs from the first distance. The electronic device identifies the second object when the third and fourth contact members engage the touch screen.","In one embodiment, the object includes a conductive coating that conducts a user's capacitance to the touch screen for actuation thereof. The object may include a plastic core substantially coated by a conductive material. Alternatively, the object may be a metal object, a conductive rubber object, a plain rubber object with conductive rubber coating, or a co-molded object having some conductive regions. The object may be either hard or soft.","The present invention also relates to a toy including an electronic device having a touch screen and configured to generate some sort of state change in the device, such as an output on the touch screen, when a pattern of contact points is sensed by the touch screen. One type of state change can be internal (such as incrementing a count, or changing an internal system state). Another type of state change can be external (such as generating a visible output on the screen or other device, or generating a different output, including a signal transmission, an internet update, sounds, or lights). A conductive object includes at least a first contact member and a second contact member spaced from the first contact member. The first and second contact members define the pattern of contact points. The output is generated and displayed by the touch screen when the object engages the touch screen.","In one implementation, the conductive object includes a third contact member. The first, second and third contact members define the pattern of contact points.","The present invention is also directed to a method of identifying a conductive object on a touch screen of an electronic device. An electronic device including a touch screen is provided. A pattern of engagement points on the touch screen are recognized, such as by capacitive coupling between the object and the touch screen. The pattern of engagement points defines an identification. The identification is associated with an object, and output specific to the associated object is generated.","In one implementation, the pattern of engagement points is a first pattern of engagement points and the object is a first object. A second pattern of engagement points on the touch screen is recognized. The second pattern of engagement points defines a second identification. The second identification is associated with a second object, and a second output specific to the associated second object is generated.","Like reference numerals have been used to identify like elements throughout this disclosure.","Referring to , a schematic diagram of an electronic device according to an embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. The electronic device  can be any electronic device that outputs or generates an output that is in the form of a signal. The signal can be an electrical signal. For example, electronic device  can be an electronic device that generates an audio output.","In one embodiment, the electronic device  is configured so that data can be input into the electronic device , as represented by the arrow  in . The data can be in a variety of forms when it is input. As described below, the data can be input via several components of the electronic device  and in several different ways.","In one embodiment, the electronic device  is configured so that data can be output from the electronic device , as represented by the arrow  in . The data can be in a variety of forms when it is output from or by the electronic device . One or more of the components of the electronic device  can be used to output the data in the form of a signal.","The data that is output from the device  can be transmitted or communicated to a device or object . The data can be a text message, instructions for movement of an object, input for an application, or some other information.","Generally herein, the term \u201celectronic device\u201d includes any device that receives and\/or generates a signal.

Referring to , the electronic device  can communicate with device  as represented by arrow A. The communication A can be accomplished in a wired manner in which the devices  and  are connected together such as via a USB cable, in a wireless manner, and\/or in a contact manner in which the devices  and  are in physical contact with each other. Referring to , electronic device  includes an output  that communicates with an input  of device  as shown by arrow . The output  can communicate to multiple points or inputs for multiple devices. Referring to , electronic device  includes an input  that receives data or information from output  of device .","The communications between two electronic devices can be accomplished through optical pairing or recognition between the devices. For example, an electronic device could include a combination of a camera and a screen. The two electronic devices can be different types of devices operating different platforms.","Referring to , a schematic block diagram of an embodiment of an electronic device is illustrated. In this embodiment, the electronic device  includes several components. It is to be understood that in alternative embodiments, the electronic device  may not include all of the components illustrated in . Moreover, the electronic device  may include more than one of the particular components illustrated in .","In , the electronic device  is illustrated as having several components, including a port or jack , a visual display component , such as a screen, a sensor , a switch , a power component , a microphone , and a speaker . Each of these components can be used to input data or information to and\/or output data or information from the device .","Regarding the inputting of data to the device , several of the components of device  can be used. Some such components include the port or jack , the screen , the sensor , the switch , and the microphone .","The electronic device  may include a housing with a port or jack  formed therein. The port or jack  can be a headphone jack or a microphone jack. The port or jack  is sized to receive a plug that is connected to one or more components. The plug that is inserted into the jack  is in electrical contact with the system of the device . The plug that is inserted into the jack  can include a contact that engages the microphone line in the headphone jack . In one embodiment, the port or jack  of the electronic device  includes a microphone line in communication therewith. Thus, the plug is directly coupled to the line in the jack . Data can be transmitted out via the microphone lead in the headphone jack.","Referring to , in one embodiment, the electronic device  includes a headphone jack  and the jack  can be used to input data (arrow ) to the electronic device  and output data (arrow ) from the electronic device .","Referring to , an electronic device  includes a housing  with a port . In one embodiment, as shown in , the component  includes a plug  that can be inserted into the port  of device . The plug  is connected to a wire  coupled to one or more headphones  and .","Alternatively, the component or module  includes a housing  with a plug  wire can be inserted into the port or jack  of the device . The discussion of the functions of module  applies to the other modules of other embodiments described in greater detail later.","The component  can be used to process, distribute, manipulate or otherwise handle a signal from the device  that is communicated via the plug  to component . The component  may include a transmitter  that can transmit signals externally from the housing  to a different object or device via one of several types of communications, including RF, IR, a light such as a bulb or an LED, wired, audio, video, Bluetooth, WiFi, ZigBee, or other wireless communication. The component  can be directly coupled to the jack and as a result, the component  can be powered by drawing power from the electronic device . In one implementation, the component  may include a AC\/DC converter for this purpose.","The signal from the device  may be an audio signal and\/or a video signal which includes an encoded or embedded signal therein. The module  includes audio decoding circuitry  that can decode the encoded or embedded signal to a known or usable signal, which can be processed and assigned a code and subsequently transmitted by the transmitter  to a receiver of a different device. The embedded or encoded signal can be used to drive functionality (such as generating an output like an action) in the different device.","The encoding of signals may be accomplished by embedded a tone in an audio or sound file such as a song. A decoder, which is programmed to identify the tone frequency of the song, can be used to filter out the embedded signal which is different than the tone frequency of the song. Alternatively, inaudible tones, either lower or higher than a human's hearing range, can be used with the audio signal. Some electronic devices have an audio range of typically 20-22 kHz at the higher end of the range and as low as 10 Hz at the lower end of the range. In another embodiment, the pulse width of the tones can be used to communicate a signal. The decoder or processor can count the pulse width of the tones. The sinusoidal wave audio file can be chopped or separated into pulses, the frequency of which can be analyzed and the embedded signal identified.","In other embodiments, the encoding or embedding of data or information can be accomplished using monotones, duotones, a sequence of monotones and\/or duotones, dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signaling, a mixture of particular tones (such as to form a code using a timed sequence of tones), a frequency change in the tones of a signal, multiple tones at the same time, audible tones, or inaudible tones.","The electronic device may have a record application programming interface (API) to process real time audio as it is coming in to the electronic device. The application functions as a decoder of the audio input as it is receive. In one embodiment, the functioning of the electronic device can be changed by clicking on\/off the microphone jack, which would allow the detection of the sound, such as a pop, to be used as a signal. Some functionality may be to advance to the next song, to turn the device on, etc. Also, for example, the microphone jack can detect a press and hold on the microphone line as opposed to a single press. Alternatively, by pressing and holding the line, the circuitry of the electronic device may be coupled to an AC\/DC circuit.","As shown in , in an alternative embodiment, the housing  may include a port or jack  into which another plug, such as plug , can be inserted. Thus, the module  can be used to receive and process one or more signals from the device  and then audio signals can be heard by the user via headphones  and  when component  is coupled to the module .","In yet another embodiment, the component  may include a plug  connected to a wire  that is coupled to a dongle . The dongle  includes a system  that can process a signal from the device  and transmit the processed signal or a coded signal externally.","In another embodiment, the component  may include a plug  connected to a wire  that has a connector  also connected to it. The connector  can be coupled to another device or object and the signal from device  transmitted through the wire . For example, an electronic device, such as an iPhone mobile digital device, can be plugged into a separate device and an image or other signal can be transferred from one device to another device.","In another embodiment, also shown in , the component  includes a plug  connected to a wire  that is wired to a toy . In this implementation, signals from device  are transmitted through the wire  to the toy .","In different embodiments, one or more of the plugs , , , , and  can be connected to the housing  of the device  and not removable.","Referring back to , the electronic device  may include a visual output component , such as a screen or display. In one mode of operation, the screen  can be used as an input for the electronic device . In another mode of operation, the screen  can be used as an output for the electronic device .","Referring to , some exemplary visual output components  are illustrated. In , a screen  is illustrated with a particular region  that is used to communicate information from the device having screen . While region  is illustrated in , as a small area of screen , in different embodiments, the region  can be as large as the entire viewing area of the screen . Thus, one or more images in the region  (whether full screen or smaller portion of the screen) can flash. The pattern of the flashing (such as the frequency of flashes), the content of the flashing, the color or colors that are flashed are different ways and techniques by which information or data can be communicated from the device externally.","Referring to , the screen  may include a portion or region  that has a barcode  displayed. The content of the barcode  can be changed as desired to communicate different information. In other words, the barcode  can be flashing or the content or arrangement of the barcode  can vary. In one embodiment, the barcode  can be a three dimensional barcode.","Referring to , the screen  may include a portion or region  that is a different color or image than the remainder of the screen . In this mode of communication, the region  can move from a first position  to a second position . Some of the different techniques of communicating information using the region  include, but are not limited to, the speed at which region  moves from position  to , the location of position , the direction or path of movement of region , and any change in the size of region  while in positions  and  or moving therebetween.","Referring to , the screen  may include a portion or region  that is used to communicate information. In this mode of communication, the region  changes in size to communicate information. For example, during the elapsing of time, the size of the region  may change from a larger size  to a smaller size  and to an even smaller size . The particular sizes , , and  and the rate at which the size of region  changes are two exemplary ways in which the region  can be used to communicate information.","In summary, in each of the , the regions , , , and  can be flashed in whole or in part, the location can change, and\/or the color and\/or image in the region can change. For example, a corner of the screen of the electronic device can have a flashing part to provide an input or signal into the screen. In addition, the flashing part can be an emitter in that it emits a signal from the device.","Referring to , the communication between two devices which are in contact with each other is illustrated. In this arrangement, electronic device  is in contact with or is touching electronic device . The contact between the devices  and  facilitates the communication of information between the devices  and . One manner in which such communication can occur is to place the devices  and  so that their screens are facing each other and each may include a photo detector or camera that can be used to input data.","Referring to , in this embodiment, electronic device  includes a sensor . Sensor  can be an accelerometer or a piezoelectric element. Electronic device  includes a generator or actuator  that can be activated to generate a signal. In one implementation, the generator  can be a vibrating element, such as a pager motor, an off-center weight that is driven, or other device that creates vibrations. Such vibrating elements can be activated to provide a haptic output. The generator  can be a transducer that generates vibrations when audio output is generated and produced by the transducer.","The vibrations or movements generated by the generator or actuator  can be felt by the electronic device , and in particular, by the sensor  because the devices  and  are in contact. Alternatively, electronic device  may have a microphone that can hear the other device  buzzing or a tapping on the device  using a vibrating or shaking device to input via morse code into device .","The sensor  of the device  can be used to identify the other device that is placed in contact with electronic device . For example, there may be multiple devices , , and , each of which includes a generator , , and , respectively. Each of the actuators or generators , , and  produces a different output signal, such as vibrations at different frequencies. For example, actuator  may vibrate at a frequency greater than actuator  which vibrates at a frequency greater than actuator .","Electronic device  includes an electronic system that is configured to identify the particular device placed in contact with electronic device . The identification of the device , , or  is based on the signal or pattern detected by sensor  and identified by the system of the device .","Referring to , another embodiment of the invention is illustrated. In this embodiment, an electronic device  has an input or input mechanism  that can be engaged or actuated to provide an input to device . Another device, such as a toy , includes a component  that can be used to identify the device . The component  can be brought into contact with the input  of electronic device  as shown by dashed line . The electronic device  has an electronic system that uses signals from input  to control one or more outputs from device  and\/or data that is input into the device  for processing and\/or storage.","Referring to , electronic device  includes a screen  which functions as an input mechanism for electronic device . In one embodiment, the screen  can be a touch screen and the operating system of the device  can be connected to the screen  so that signals generated by the screen  can be processed by the device . Another device, such as a toy , may include a movable member  that can be brought into engagement with the screen  as shown by dashed line . The member , whether stationary or moving, can engage the screen  which uses the particular contact between the member  and the screen  to determine the identification of the member  and the toy  based on the detected signals. Different toys  can be brought into contact with the screen  which can determine the identification of the toy  based on the contact with the screen .","Referring to , an electronic device  having a housing  with a screen or display  is illustrated. The shape of the housing  can vary and in this embodiment, the housing  has a longitudinal axis . Screen  is a touch screen and can be referred to alternatively as a touch panel or touchscreen panel as well. The touch screen can be used as an input device and depending on the particular type of touch screen, a different type of input is used therewith. One type of touch screen is a pressure-sensitive or resistive touch screen. Another type of touch screen is an electrically-sensitive or capacitive touch screen. Another type of touch screen is an acoustically-sensitive touch screen that uses surface acoustic waves. A yet another type of touch screen is a photo-resistive (infrared) touch screen. A capacitive touch screen has a layer of capacitive material that holds an electrical charge. Touching the screen changes the amount of charge at a specific point of contact, which can be determined based on the change in the charge. A resistive touch screen is activated when pressure from an object, such as a human's finger, causes conductive and resistive layers of circuitry to touch each other. The result of the contact is a change in the circuit's resistance, and the location of the change can be determined by the device.","Also shown is another device , which in this embodiment is a toy vehicle. The device or toy vehicle  has at least one movable member that is driven for movement relative to the body  of the toy vehicle  by a drive mechanism . One movable member is in the form of a wheel  which is rotated relative to the body . The wheel  can be rotated along the direction of arrow \u201cA.\u201d The toy vehicle may have additional wheels  as well.","Referring to , a perspective view of wheel  is illustrated. The wheel  includes a body  with an outer surface  that extends along the portion of the wheel  in contact with a surface as the wheel  rotates. The wheel  also includes several bumps or protrusions  that extend outwardly from the outer surface . The protrusions can be referred to as nubs. The wheel can be mounted for rotation about axis  along the direction of arrow \u201cB.\u201d The wheel  can be formed of molded plastic, a rubber-like material, or other similar material.","In one embodiment, the protrusions  are integrally formed with the body  of the wheel . In an alternative embodiment, the protrusions  are formed separately from the wheel  and coupled to the body  by a friction fit, a snap arrangement, an adhesive, or another coupling technique or mechanism. For wheel , the protrusions  may extend a distance \u201ch\u201d from the outer surface  of the wheel . In an alternative embodiment, the distance that the protrusions  extend from the outer surface  of the wheel  may vary.","As the wheel  rotates, the wheel  is brought into contact with the screen  of electronic device . In this embodiment, the protrusions  are arranged in three rows that extend around the outer surface  of the wheel . In a different embodiment, the protrusions  can be arranged in fewer or more than three rows.","The electronic device  may be running a program or application that changes color or appearance of the locations or areas of the screen  that are contacted by an object. Referring to , an exemplary pattern of contact of the protrusions  on rotating wheel  with the screen  is illustrated. As shown, areas , , and  are created on the screen  as protrusions  engage the screen  and move therealong in contact until continued rotation of the wheel  results in the particular protrusions  no longer contacting the screen . Areas , , and  can be substantially the same length \u201cl\u201d provided that the radius of the outer surface  of the wheel  and the height \u201ch\u201d of the protrusions are substantially the same.","When the protrusions  are located in three rows extending around the wheel , the areas , , and  have row-like shapes that are spaced apart by the distances between the rows of protrusions  on the wheel . As shown, areas  and  are spaced apart by a distance \u201cd\u201d and areas  and  are spaced apart by a distance \u201cd.\u201d In different embodiments, the distances \u201cd\u201d and \u201cd\u201d are the same or can be different from each other.","As mentioned above with respect to , the screen of an electronic device can be used to identify a particular device or object that is brought into contact with the electronic device. Referring to , a different wheel  is illustrated. In one implementation, wheel  is coupled to a different toy body (not shown) and forms a part of a different toy vehicle, such as a sedan, truck or other vehicle (not shown).","Wheel  includes a body  that has an outer surface  with several bumps or protrusions  extending therefrom. The body  is configured to rotate along the direction of arrow \u201cC\u201d about axis . As compared to wheel  illustrated in , wheel  include few protrusions  located around the outer surface . In this embodiment, the protrusions  are located in rows around the outer surface  and when engaged with the screen , areas  and  (see ) are formed on the screen . The length dimension \u201cl\u201d of the areas  and  and dimension \u201cd\u201d between the areas  and  can vary depending on the protrusions .","In one variation, the front wheels and the rear wheels of a toy vehicle can vary. In particular, the protrusions located on the front wheels and the rear wheels can be different. For example, the protrusions may be in a different pattern, may have a different height, may be in a different quantity, and\/or may have different spacing. In addition, the diameters of the outer surface of the front wheels and the rear wheels may be different, which would result in different length areas being created on the surface of the screen of an electronic device based on the engagement of the wheels with the screen.","Thus, instead of the electronic device identifying different devices or toys based solely on each wheel of a toy being the same, each toy may have two or more different wheels and the electronic device may be running an application that prompts a user or otherwise anticipates that the user will put at least two different wheels from a toy vehicle in contact with the screen of the device. Accordingly, the order and manner in which the user places multiple wheels of a toy in engagement with the screen is part of the identification process.","Referring back to , the electronic device  may include a sensor , such as a piezoelectric element, that can sense or pick up vibrations to the housing . The vibrations can be imparted to the housing  based on the contact of an object with any part of the housing , such as the screen  or the rear surface of the housing .","When wheel  is rotated about axis , the protrusions  engage the device  (either via the screen  or another surface of the housing ) and such engagement creates a particular pattern of vibrations or movements imparted to the device  as protrusions  engage the device . The pattern of vibrations depends in part on the quantity of protrusions , the height of the protrusions , the spacing of the protrusions , and the speed of rotation of the wheel . Similarly, when wheel  is rotated about axis  and engaged with device , the protrusions  create a vibration or vibrating effect that is different than wheel  because the configuration of protrusions  are different than the configuration of protrusions .","The sensor  in electronic device  can detect the vibrations imparted to device  and the particular wheel  or  and the particular toy vehicle to which the wheel corresponds can be identified.","In an alternative embodiment, a toy can be made of a conductive rubber with bumps on the surface on a particular pattern. The bump pattern could be detected by an electronic device with a multi-touch screen. For example, the electronic device may detect a change in capacitance or charge on the touch screen when that toy is placed on the screen of the electronic device and touched with a finger of a user. In alternative embodiments, the electronic device may detect one or more changes in physically-, electrical resistance-, acoustical-, or photo-related properties of the touch screen when the toy is placed on the screen. In one embodiment, an entire keyboard structure can be provided via the touch screen of an electronic device using such a structure. The touch screen may have a grid with different spots or input areas defined thereon that may be contacted by the item placed on the touch screen. While the item may define many contact areas for the user (such as a keyboard), the grid on the touch screen may have fewer areas defined thereon provided that a microcontroller can determine the particular input from the user on the item.","In one embodiment of the invention, an object can interact with an electronic device. Such an object can be a toy that is altered slightly to create unique characteristics that can be detected by an electronic device. To stimulate a touch screen of an electronic device, the object may appear to the screen to like one or more fingers of a human.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0144","num":"0143"},"figref":"FIG. 18","b":"2010"},"The system  includes an electronic device  having a touch screen  and a recognizable object . In one implementation, the object  is conductive and can be placed in contact with or proximate to the touch screen  of the electronic device , such as an iPhone\u00ae, an iPad\u00ae, an iPod Touch\u00ae, or similar electronic device with a touch screen.","In one embodiment, the conductive object  includes a plastic core , which has been substantially coated or encased with a conductive material , such as conductive silicone applied via a vacuum metalized process or a conductive paint. Alternatively, the object may be a metal object, a die cast conductive object, a conductive rubber object, a plain rubber object with conductive rubber coating, a co-molded object having some conductive regions, or an object with a conductive coating resulting from being dipped into a conductive material, such as copper. Also, the object may be either hard or soft. When a user holds the object , the charge in the touch screen  at the location or locations where the object  is positioned proximate to or in contact with the touch screen  changes because some of the charge is transferred to the user due to the conductive coating  on the object  and the user contacting the coating . The result is that the device can determine the location or locations at which there is a change in capacitance of the touch screen  as caused by the change in the charge of a layer of the touch screen . Thus, the object  may be capacitively coupled to the touch screen , thereby allowing the contact point or points of the object  to be detected.","The object  includes a first contact member  engageable with the touch screen  and a second contact member  engageable with the touch screen . The contact members ,  are spaced from each other and effective form a multi-tipped stylus. The electronic device  senses the locations of each of the contact members ,  when the contact members ,  engage or are proximate to the touch screen . The electronic device  then determines the distance d, such as a quantity of pixels, between the two sensed contact (or proximity) points ,  of the contact members ,  on the touch screen , respectively. The distance d between the contact points ,  corresponds to the spacing between the contact members , . This distance d is associated with the particular object , such as a particular toy figure or toy vehicle. Thus, the conductive object , when placed on the touch screen , conducts the charge from a user to the touch screen , which is detected by the device  as a recognizable pattern or geometric arrangement of touches or contact points , . The pattern of contact points ,  defines an identification for the object . According to the present invention, the term \u201cidentification\u201d of an object and the term \u201cidentifying\u201d an object may encompass multiple levels of information determining. In one embodiment, the identification is the recognizing or confirming that the object is not one or more human's fingers. In particular, this confirmation may be a determination that the object is a proper object to be used with a particular application operating on the electronic device. For example, the application may be looking for a particular pattern of contact points, indicating that the object is a proper or correct object to be placed in contact with or proximate to the touch screen , before the application provides the user with access to a different part of the application or with other information. In another embodiment, the identification is the recognizing or confirming that the object proximate to or in contact with the touch screen  is of a particular category of objects, such as toy vehicles or figures. In this implementation, if the application confirms that the object is of a particular type or category that is proper or correct to be used with the application, then the application can provide additional content or information or access to different portions of the application. In another embodiment, the identification is unique to the particular object  and encompasses unique, specific information, such as an object-specific identity. At this level of identification, the exact identity of the object can be determined and content or information specific to that object can be output or obtained.","Thus, the particular object  is identified based on the distance d between the sensed contact points , . The contact members ,  define a pattern of contact points ,  on the touch screen  (when the object  is engaging or proximate to the touch screen ), which is recognizable by the electronic device  for identifying the object . Further, the location of the object  on the touch screen  may be determined based on the location of the contact points ,  on the touch screen .","The specific configuration of the object usable with the disclosed systems herein may vary. For example, the object may be a configured as a toy figure, a toy vehicle, a toy building, or some other structure.","Referring to , in one embodiment, the object is configured as a toy action . The  includes a torso  and appendages, such as a head , arms ,  and legs , . An underside  of a foot  of the leg  includes a first contact member , and an underside  of a foot  of the other leg  includes a second contact member . When placed on or proximate to the touch screen  of the electronic device , the first and second contact members ,  define first and second contact points , . The electronic device  senses the contact points ,  and considers them to be figures of a human. A distance d between the contact points ,  is determined by the electronic device . The determined distance d is then associated with an identification of the specific toy .","In one embodiment, the torso  is rotatable relative to the legs , . The head  and\/or arms ,  may also rotate and\/or move relative to the torso . However, the legs ,  and feet ,  of the  remain in a fixed position relative to each other. Thus, the spacing between the first and second contact members , , and distance d between the corresponding contact points , , remains constant. As a result, the identification of the action  remains constant.","An action  having an identification different than the identification associated with  is illustrated in . Similar to action , action  also includes a torso , a head , arms ,  and legs , . The arms , , legs ,  and\/or head  of the  have a different configuration compared to the corresponding appendages of the . The legs ,  are configured so that the  appears to be kneeling down on a knee  of the leg . The leg  includes a first contact member , and the other leg  includes a second contact member . In particular, an underside  of a foot  of the leg  may include the first contact member . A portion of the knee  engageable with the touch screen  of the electronic device  includes the second contact member . When placed on the touch screen , the first and second contact members ,  define first and second contact points , , respectively. The distance d between the contact points ,  corresponds to the distance between the contact members , . The electronic device  may therefore determine the distance d when the  is placed on or is near the touch screen . The identification of the  is thereby recognized based on the pattern of contact points ,  generated by the contact members , .","Another action  having a unique identification is illustrated in . Action  includes a torso , a head , arms ,  and legs , . The arms , , legs ,  and\/or head  of the  may have a different configuration compared to the corresponding appendages of the , . The legs ,  are configured so that the  appears to be walking forward. The front leg  includes a first contact member , and the back leg  includes a second contact member . In particular, an underside  of a foot  of the front leg  includes the first contact member , and an underside  of a foot  of the back leg  includes the second contact member . When placed on the touch screen , the first and second contact members ,  define first and second contact points ,  on the touch screen . The distance d between the contact points ,  is determined by the electronic device . The determined distance d is associated with an identification that is recognized as the .","Thus, each of the pairs of contact points ,  or ,  or ,  generated by each of the corresponding , ,  defines a distinct pattern or spacing of contact points. Each specific pattern of contact points is associated with a particular figure. In this way, the electronic device  recognizes a particular ,  or . When a figure is identified, a figure specific output, which may include audio and\/or visual components, may be generated by the electronic device. The output may include sound effects, access to previously locked material (such as features, game levels, a diary, etc.), the opening of an online world, a change in the state of a game being played, or the addition of features to a game or application on the electronic device. The use of multiple figures provides the ability for real time competitive gaming on an electronic device, such as an iPad.","Referring to , an application (e.g. a game) may be operable with the electronic device . For example, an ice skating game  may be operable on the electronic device . The device  displays a simulated ice rink  on the touch screen . One or more objects, such as toy ,  (shown in phantom in  and shown in ), may be placed on the touch screen . One of the  includes contact members ,  (such as feet) spaced by a distance d, and the other  includes contact members ,  spaced by another distance d different than distance d. When the  is placed on the touch screen  so that its contact members ,  engage or are proximate to the touch screen , a specific pattern of contact points (spaced by distance d) is recognized by the electronic device . Similarly, when the other  is placed on the touch screen  so that its contact members ,  engage or are proximate to the touch screen , a different pattern of contact points (spaced by distance d) is recognized by the electronic device . The identifications of the corresponding ,  are associated with each of the ,  disposed on the touch screen . Thus, the electronic device  recognizes the identification of each , , as well as the location of each particular ,  on the touch screen .","As shown in , more than one ,  may be placed on the touch screen . Thus, the electronic device  simultaneously recognizes the identification and location of multiple ,  on the display screen . Further, any movement of the ,  on the touch screen  (such as when a user slides the  and\/or  across the touch screen ) is tracked by the electronic device . Referring to , as the toy  is moved along the touch screen a line  is generated by the application that corresponds to the path along which the toy  has traveled or \u201cskated.\u201d The line  can remain on the screen while the application runs. In addition, an audible output resembling ice skate blades traveling along the ice is generated as the figure moves along the display simulating ice. It should be understood that only one  or  may alternatively be used at a given time with the device . Alternatively, additional figures may be used (e.g., three or more figures) with the electronic device , whereby all figures are recognized by the device .","Upon recognizing the identification and\/or location of the  and\/or , the electronic device  may generate a visual and\/or audio output in response thereto. For example, an image associated with the  and\/or  (e.g., such as an image representing the figure wearing skates) may be displayed on the touch screen . The image may be aligned with or proximate to the corresponding physical  or  disposed on the touch screen , and move along with the  or  as the user or users move the . In different embodiments, the  can interact and the output generated and displayed on the touch screen  includes a theme corresponding to the theme of the  and\/or .","It should be understood that the particular theme of the object and\/or application may vary. For example, the toy figure(s) and\/or the associated application(s) may be configured as wrestlers, soldiers, superheroes, toy cars, underwater vehicles or creatures, space vehicles or creatures, etc. In an embodiment using wrestler action figures, when a particular wrestler is placed into contact with the touch screen, that wrestler's signature music and\/or phrases can be generated by the electronic device.","In different embodiments of the invention, some exemplary applications include a cataloging application which can track the user's figure collection, share stats, etc. Another example application is to use the figures or accessories as keys into an online game, either as play pieces or tokens to enable capabilities, unlock levels or the like.","In one embodiment, the object to be identified by the electronic device  can be a weapon that is useable with the , , . For example, the object can be a weapon, such as a sword, that has two or more identifiable contact members projecting therefrom. Each of the contact members is engageable with or can be placed proximate to the touch screen  of the electronic device  when the user holds the weapon near the touch screen . If the electronic device  is running an application that includes a simulated battle with , , and , and when prompted by the electronic device , the user engages the weapon with the touch screen , the electronic device  can identify the conductive weapon from its contact members and a simulated weapon in the game on the electronic device  can be associated with one or more of the , , and . Accordingly, the user can play with the weapon and one or more of the , , and , while the game running on the electronic device  also includes representations of the , , and  and the weapon.","Another embodiment of an object usable with the disclosed system is illustrated in . The object is configured to resemble a key . The key  includes a handle portion  and an opposing end portion  having spaced projections , . One of the projections  includes a first contact member , and the other projection  includes a second contact member . The contact members ,  are spaced by a distance d. In this embodiment, the key  includes a conductive coating covering the key  and defining the outer surface thereof. When a user holds the key , a charge from the user passes along the conductive outer coating on the key  and to the contact members , .","Referring to , another application operable with an electronic device is illustrated. The application is a game  that includes an environment through which a user must navigate. The environment may include passages, locked doors, hidden treasure, etc. In order to pass through a particular passage, or to advance to another level, the user may be prompted to engage a particular object on the touch screen . For example, at a point in the game , a keyhole  of a lock  is displayed on the touch screen . In order to \u2018unlock\u2019 the lock , the user places the spaced projections ,  and thus the first and second contact members ,  against the touch screen  in positions aligned with the keyhole .","Referring to , when projections ,  of the key  are properly aligned with the keyhole , the contact members ,  engage the touch screen  so that a specific pattern of contact points ,  (spaced by distance d) is sensed and recognized by the electronic device . The electronic device  then associates the pattern and location of contact points ,  with the key . The key  may then be rotated in a direction X (e.g., 90\u00b0 rotation about a longitudinal axis of the key ). The electronic device  detects the corresponding movement of the contact points , , and in turn generates a visual and\/or audio output associated with the movement. For example, a rotation of the keyhole  may be displayed on the touch screen , followed by the image of the lock  turning and being unlocked (or an associated displayed door swinging open or vanishing). The user may then navigate past the lock  in the game .","The system is capable of identifying a gesture using the object (e.g., the key), as well as the object itself. A gesture is the movement of contact points across the touch screen. For example, a contact pattern, such as two contact points, can be made distinct from a human's fingers by requiring a gesture which is difficult to make with fingers. In one example, the key-like conductive object  must be rotated some number of degrees, such as 90 degrees. It is difficult, if not impossible, for a user to make this gesture with his or her fingers, while maintaining a constant finger spacing. Accordingly, this gesture component of the system increases the ability to generate an output in response to a particular gesture via the key object-screen interaction, and two distinguish such a gesture from a human attempt to mimic the gesture without the key object. A simple two or three contact ID object, coupled with a requirement of a particular gesture or gestures using the object, creates a more expansive identification system with respect to different applications and outputs that can be generated.","Referring to , the process of determining the movement of an object relative to the electronic device  is illustrated. The application running on the electronic device  is configured so that it can determine the distance between the contact points  and , which are caused by the contact members  and . The contact members  and  of the key  are a fixed distance apart from each other. When the application determines that the distance d between the contact points  and  is constant while one or both of the contact points  and  moves relative to the screen , the application determines that the object  is causing the contact points  and  and not a human's fingers, for which the constant distance between touch points is difficult to maintain.","Referring to , when the contact points  and  are in a first orientation , such as that illustrated in , the contact points  and  are spaced apart by a distance d. In , the contact points  and  have moved along the directions of arrows \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB,\u201d respectively, to a different orientation . As shown, the distance between the contact points  and  remains the same. Similarly, the contact points  and  have moved along the direction of arrows \u201cC\u201d and \u201cD,\u201d respectively, to a different orientation , and have the same dimension d therebetween.","The application continuously checks the distance d and tracks the precise distance between the contact points  and  as the object moves. In one embodiment, once movement of one or both of the contact points  and  is detected, the application checks the distance every 1\/1000of a second. The distance between contact points  and  is calculated each time the application checks the distance.","Referring to , an exemplary gesture involving the input object  and an exemplary application  running on the electronic device  are illustrated. In , the object  is engaged with a particular region or area  on the touch screen . This orientation of object  corresponds to the orientation  illustrated in . In , the object  is rotated or moved to orientation  (also shown in ) and the region  is also rotated because the application has determined that the distance between the contact points created by object  has remained fixed, thereby confirming that it is a proper input object and not the fingers of a human.","In , a screenshot shows the door portions in the application separating as a result of a correct or proper movement or gesture of the object  with the application . In , a screenshot of the application  is shown that is exemplary of the interior or inside of the closed doors illustrated in . Various audible and\/or visible outputs can be generated by the device upon the unlocking of the door as described above.","It should be understood that the specific configuration of the object usable with a gaming or other application may vary. For example, the object may be configured as a weapon, jewelry, food or an energy source, or any other device or structure related to the particular game. Alternatively, the object may be configured as a knob, which may be placed on the screen  and rotated and\/or slid relative to the touch screen  for increasing volume, scrolling through pages, or triggering some other visual and\/or audio output or event. The object may be configured as a playing card, whereby the distance between spaced contact members identifies the particular suit and number (or other characteristic) of the card.","An object  according to another embodiment is illustrated in . The object  includes first and second contact members ,  spaced by a distance d. The object  also includes a third contact member . First, second and third contact points , ,  are detected on the touch screen  by the electronic device  when the first, second and third contact members , ,  engage or are proximate to the touch screen . The first and second contact points ,  are spaced from each other by distance d (corresponding to the spacing between the first and second contact members , ). The third contact point  is spaced from a midpoint  between the first and second contact points ,  by another distance d. The arrangement of the first, second and third contact members , ,  of the object , as defined by distances d and d, define a unique pattern of contact points , , .","In one implementation, the electronic device  determines the distance d between the first and second contact points ,  in order to determine the specific identity and location of the object  in contact with or proximate to the touch screen . If the distance d is a particular distance, the electronic device  then determines the distance d between the midpoint  of the first and second contact points ,  and the third contact point  in order to determine the orientation of the object .","In another implementation, the electronic device  first determines the distance d between the first and second contact points ,  to determine a toy category associated with the object . For example, based on a distance d between the first and second contact points ,  of a particular distance, such as 64 pixels (about 10 mm), which spacing is provided on all toy cars usable with the system or the particular application, the electronic device  may determine that the object  is a toy car. The electronic device  then determines the specific identify of the object  within the toy category based on the distance d between the midpoint  and the third contact point . For example, based on a distance d between the midpoint  and the third contact point  of 55 pixels, the electronic device  may recognize the toy car to be a black van with red wheels. A different distance d could be representative of a white racing car. Further, the electronic device  may determine the location of the object  based on the detected pattern of contact points , , .","Referring to , an object usable with the disclosed system is configured as a toy vehicle . The toy vehicle  can be just one of many toy vehicles that can be identified by the system. A bottom view of the toy vehicle  is shown in . The vehicle  includes a chassis or body  having a front end , a rear end , and an underside . Wheels , , , and  are coupled to the body . The wheels , , , and  may be rotatable or fixed relative to the body . First and second contact members ,  are coupled to and project outwardly from the underside . The first and second contact members ,  are spaced by a distance d. A third contact member  is also coupled to and projecting outwardly from the underside . The third contact member  is spaced from a midpoint  between the first and second contact members ,  by a distance d. Distance d is different than the distance between contact members  and  and the distance between contact members  and , thereby allowing the electronic device to properly categorize the object using contact members ,  initially.","The base distance between contact points  and  is dimension d, which can be a fixed distance such as 64 pixels discussed above. For different objects in a group that have the same dimension d (which means that the objects are in the same category), the dimension d can be a multiple of dimension d. For example, three different toy vehicles can have the same dimension d, but different dimensions d that are integer increments of dimension d, such as one, two, and three times dimension d, respectively. Alternatively, if a greater quantity of toy vehicles is contemplated and space is limited, dimension d can be smaller increments of dimension d, such as increments of 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc. of dimension d.","Referring to , a bottom perspective view of a chassis for a toy vehicle is illustrated. In this embodiment, the chassis  can be a molded plastic object with a conductive coating. The chassis  can be electrically coupled to the touch of a human holding the toy vehicle so that the capacitance or charge at a location of the touch screen changes based on contact thereof from the human through the chassis . For example, a child may touch one or more sides of the chassis  while holding the toy vehicle. Alternatively, there may be a conductive member or piece of material that is connected to the chassis  and extends through the body of the toy vehicle so the child can touch the conductive member. The chassis  includes a body  with a lower surface  and opposite ends  and , with a mounting aperture  located proximate to end .","The chassis  includes an identification system  that can be detected and used by the electronic device  to identify the object of which chassis  is a part and the orientation of the object. In this embodiment, the identification system  includes several bumps or protrusions or contact members , , and , that extend outwardly from lower surface . Protrusion  includes a lower surface A and a side wall B that extends around the protrusion . The distance between contact members  and  is dimension d and the distance between contact member  and the line between contact members  and  is dimension d. In one embodiment, dimension h, which is the height or distance that the protrusions extend from surface , is slightly greater than the distance that the outer surface of wheels of the toy vehicle to which chassis  is coupled extend relative to the lower surface . This greater height allows the contact members , , and  to engage the touch screen of the electronic device. In other embodiments, the dimension h for one or more of contact members ,  and  is slightly less than the distance that the outer surface of wheels of the toy vehicle to which chassis  is coupled extend relative to the lower surface . In this latter case, contact members ,  and\/or  might only be detected by the screen in the event that the user pressed down upon the vehicle, causing the axles to flex slightly and the contact members to come into closer proximity to the screen, at which point they would be detectable by the system. The dimension h may also be adjusted such that while it is slightly less than the distance that the outer surface of wheels of the toy vehicle to which chassis  is coupled extend relative to the lower surface , the contact members are nevertheless detectable by the system due to their close proximity (though not contact) with the screen.","Protrusions  and  are similarly constructed to protrusion . In one embodiment, the protrusions , , and  can be formed integrally with the chassis. In another embodiment, the protrusions , , and  can be formed separate from the chassis and coupled thereto, using a coupling technique, such as an adhesive, bonding, melting, welding, etc. While protrusions , , and  are illustrated as being generally frusto-conical, in different embodiments, the configurations of the protrusions may be a cylinder, a cube, a semisphere, and a rectangular prism.","Referring to , a bottom view of another object usable with the disclosed system is configured as a toy vehicle  is illustrated. The vehicle  includes a chassis or body  having a front end , a rear end , and an underside . Several wheels , , ,  are coupled to the body  and are either rotatable or fixed relative to the body .","In this embodiment, a single contact member  projects outwardly from the underside . Wheels  and  are conductive and are either made of metal or other conductive material or are formed of a non-conductive material and coated with a conductive coating. The wheels  and  are spaced apart by a distance d. The contact member  is spaced from a midpoint  between wheels  and  by a distance d. Distance d is different than the distance between the wheels  and , thereby allowing the electronic device to properly categorize the object using contact members  and  initially.","The resulting contact points on the screen or surface of the electronic device are illustrated in . Contact member  causes contact point  and wheels  and  cause contact points  and  with dimensions d and d as shown. When the toy vehicle  is placed proximate to or in contact with the electronic device , and is moved around relative to the device , the dimensions d and d remain constant. As discussed above, the application running on the electronic device  continuously checks to see if the distances d and d remain constant through the motions of the toy vehicle . If the distances remain constant, the application can then determine that the object is the toy vehicle  and not the touches of a human.","Referring to , a schematic diagram of a virtual or conceptual grid that is associated with a toy object having an identification system is illustrated. In this embodiment, the grid  is formed by two sets  and  of perpendicular lines. The intersections of the lines are illustrated as nodes or points . This conceptual grid  is mapped onto the toy object and is not present on the electronic device. If the grid  can be matched or mapped onto the object, then the identification of the object can be determined and used by the application and device, as described below.","In this embodiment, the identification system of an object is represented by several contact points. The profile of the system is shown as  in . While the object may have any shape or configuration, in this embodiment, the profile  has a generally triangular shape defined by contact points , , and . When the electronic device senses the contact points , , and , the application running on the electronic device determines whether the distances between the contact members and the contact points can be mapped onto a grid.","In other words, contact points  and  are spaced apart by a distance d, contact points  and  are spaced apart by a distance d, and contact points  and  are spaced apart by a distance d.

The vehicle  may be placed anywhere on the touch screen . The determination that the object is a toy vehicle  is made by the electronic device  based on the distance d between the first and second contact points (associated with the first and second contact members ,  engaging or proximate to the touch screen ). For example, the vehicle  may be placed on portion A of the roadway  so that the vehicle  (shown in phantom) is in a position P. The identity and location of the vehicle  on the touch screen  are then recognized, as described above.

The object  can be placed onto a touch screen of an electronic device. The input member  can be moved or manipulated by a user to provide an additional contact or input to the touch screen in a selective manner.","Referring to , side and bottom views of the object  are illustrated. As shown, the base member  has an upper surface , a lower surface , and a side surface . The base member  also includes an inner wall  that defines a receptacle or channel  in which the input member  is located. As shown, the lower surface  of the object  has an opening  that is in communication with the receptacle  of the base member .","Extending from the lower surface  are several contact members , , and . In one embodiment, the contact members , , and  may be conductive so that contact by a person holding the object  proximate to or in contact with the touch screen S results in a change in the charge of the screen at touch points, as part of the charge is transferred to the person holding the object. The base member  can be made of or coated with a conductive material to transfer the touch of a human to the contact members , , and . The contact members , , and  generate touch or contact points on the touch screen which are used to identify the particular object. A first output or series of outputs can be generated by the electronic device in response to the detection of contact members , , and . In a different embodiment, the contact members , , and  are not conductive and are used only to support the object  on the touch screen S.","Referring to , a side view of the input member  is illustrated. In this embodiment, the input member  includes an upper surface  and a lower surface . A protrusion or contact member  extends from the lower surface  as shown. In one embodiment, the input member  can be made of a conductive material so that the capacitance of a touch screen S can be changed due to a person touching the input member .","Referring to , the use of the object  is illustrated. In , the toy object  is illustrated in a non-use configuration  in which the input member  does not engage the touch screen S. In this configuration , the input member  is in a raised or non-engaged position  spaced apart from the touch screen S. In , the input member  has been moved along the direction of arrow \u201cA\u201d to its lowered or engaged position  in which the contact member  touches or is proximate to the touch screen S.","The input member  may be retained to the base member  and prevented from separating therefrom via a tab and slot arrangement or other mechanical mechanism. A biasing member, such as a spring , can be located between the input member  and the base member  to bias the input member  to its non-engaging position . Since the input member  is spring-loaded, the input member  will be in only momentary contact with the touch screen.","A user can selectively move the input member  repeated along the direction of arrow \u201cA\u201d to make intermittent contact with the touch screen S. When the button is pressed, the addition contact point is created on the touch screen and feedback, such as a tactile feedback, can be generated and felt by the user. Some examples of objects may include levers, rotary knobs, joysticks, thumb-wheel inputs, etc. Alternatively, the intermittent contact can be used to input data into the electronic device in a serial manner.","In another embodiment, the input member  and base member  may be a two part conductive plastic item with a spring detent, such that when a user holds the object  to the screen of the device, the input device or object types is detected, and the button or input member  can be pressed.","In one exemplary implementation, the toy object can be a simulated blasting device with a switch. The base member of the toy object can be a housing and the input member  can be a movable plunger, the movement of which into engagement with the touch screen results in an output on the electronic device that is audible, visible, and\/or tactile.","In various embodiments, the actuation and movement of the input member of a toy object can vary. In addition to the pressing motion described above, the input member can be rotated, twisting, rolled, slid, and\/or pivoted relative to the base member.","Referring to , in this embodiment, the base member  has an input member  movably coupled thereto. The input member  can be screwed into and out of an opening in the base member . The input member  has a thread  located on its outer surface and can be rotated in either direction of arrow \u201cA\u201d about axis . When the input member  is rotated sufficiently so that the input member is moved along the direction of arrow \u201cB,\u201d a contact member located on the lower surface of input member  engages the touch screen of an electronic device on which the object is placed.","Referring to , in this embodiment, the object  includes a base member  with several contact members , , and  that can engage a touch screen S, as previously described. The object  includes an input member  located within a receptacle or chamber in the base member . The input member  has a main body with a contact member  extending therefrom. A lever arm  is pivotally mounted at pivot point  to the base member  so that movement of lever arm  along the direction of arrow \u201cA\u201d results in movement of the body  along the direction of arrow \u201cB\u201d so that contact member  engages the touch screen S. To disengage contact member  from the touch screen S, the lever arm  is moved in the opposite direction. In a variation of this embodiment, the lever arm can be replaced with an arm that is pressed or slid downwardly to move the input member in the same direction.","In another embodiment, the object includes two or more contact members, as well as data stored in an associated memory. Upon depression of the object against the touch screen, the data is transmitted from the object to the electronic device. For example, a user's contact information may be transmitted to the electronic device upon depression or activation of the object. The object may be configured such that different or additional data is transmitted upon subsequent depressions or activations. For example, an address of the user may be transmitted upon an initial depression or engagement of the object against the touch screen of an electronic device. The user's business profile (e.g., employment history, technical skills, etc.) may then be transmitted from the object to the electronic device upon a subsequent depression or engagement between the object and the touch screen.","In another embodiment, the object, once properly identified by an application, may \u2018unlock\u2019 a database accessible to the electronic device, which may include information relating to the object. For example, collector dolls may be provided with contact members that can be used with an electronic device to identify the object. Upon engagement with the touch screen by the contact members, information relating to collector type data is presented to the user.","Thus, the recognized pattern of contact points may be used by an application running on the electronic device to identify the particular conductive object and\/or to provide specific information related to the object or user. Various applications may be run on the electronic device that use the contact and identification of the conductive object as an input. For example, a game application can look for a particular object to be used with the screen at a particular point in the game. If the correct object is placed on the screen, then a feature or portion of the game can be unlocked and\/or a particular output may be generated and displayed.","The electronic device and associated application are configured to generate an output specific to a recognized pattern of contact points on the touch screen, as well as in response to movement of the recognized pattern of contact points on the touch screen. The pattern of contact points defines an identification that is associated with a particular object. An output specific to the associated object is then generated and displayed on the touch screen. The particular output generated and displayed may vary depending on the various patterns of engagement points associated with the corresponding various objects, as well as on the particular application operable by the device.","In different implementations, the conductive devices or objects can be hard or soft. Further, the particular types and locations of touches or contact points on the touch screen can vary, as well as the content that is unlocked or accessed. Thus, various embodiments of the present invention are possible.","The quantity of contact points that can be detected by an application is determined in part by the particular electronic device running the application.","Another exemplary embodiment of the invention is illustrated in . In this embodiment, a simulated toy weapon , such as a rifle, includes a barrel portion , a support portion , and a trigger  that can be manually actuated. The toy weapon  includes an electronic system with several light emitting elements  and a transducer for generating audible outputs. When a child plays with the toy weapon , lights and\/or sounds are generated in response to interaction by the child with the toy weapon .","The toy weapon  can be used with an electronic device  (shown in ). The toy weapon  includes a repositionable, interactive portion  that includes a door or plate  that is pivotally coupled to the barrel  at its end  by a coupler or hinge. Portion  can be flipped outwardly to couple the device  to the toy weapon . The inner surface of the plate  includes a receptacle into which the device  can be inserted or snapped into place so that the device  is physically retained by the physical toy (the toy weapon ). As a result, the screen  of the device  becomes part of the physical toy. In another embodiment, the plate  can be slidably coupled to the toy weapon . When the repositionable portion  is flipped outwardly, the screen  remains viewable for the child while playing with the toy weapon , thereby enhancing the play experience. At the same time, the toy weapon  retains independent play value even when the electronic device  is not attached to the toy. For example, it might include lights and sounds that can be actuated even in the absence of electronic device .","The toy weapon  can recognize the presence of the device  through detection via a switch and the device  can recognize the toy weapon  through its touch screen . In one embodiment, a portion of the toy weapon , such as a portion near hinge , can engage the touch screen  of the device  in a manner that enables an application running on the device  to identify the toy weapon  to which the device  is coupled. For example, the application may create a special area or region in which a part of the toy weapon , such as a conductive portion, may engage the touch screen . The single touch point created by the toy weapon  is used for identification of the toy weapon . The single touch point may be created when the user touches the toy as long as the capacitance of the user can travel and pass to the touch screen  of the device .","In one implementation, when the electronic device  is coupled to the toy weapon , the device  can sense or detect when a child first picks up the weapon  through the touch of the child on the weapon . When a child picks up the weapon , the touch of the child provides the capacitance needed by the touch screen of the electronic device  to cause an application running thereon to generate an audible and\/or visible output. At least a part of the weapon  may be made of a conductive material or a non-conductive material with a conductive coating or plating thereon. Thus, when a child first picks up the weapon , the device , either alone or via the weapon , can generate an output that is interesting to the child to cause the child to play with the weapon .","The toy weapon  may also recognize the presence of the device  as described below. In particular, a portion of the screen of device  may blink in a recognizable pattern that may be detected by a detector included in toy weapon . For example, a portion of door plate end  might include a photodetector that can recognize the presence or absence of light (or light at certain wavelengths) emitted from a target portion of the screen of device . Device  may use this capability to transmit data, including a signature indicating not only that device  is installed in toy , but that the proper application is running on device .","When the device  determines that it is mounted or coupled to the toy weapon , the application running on the device  can enter into a different portion of the program or application. For example, the toy weapon  by itself can be manipulated to make audible and\/or visible outputs, such as by the actuation of the trigger  or the movement of the toy weapon . The application on the device  can enhance the outputs from the toy weapon  by generating audible and\/or visible outputs as well in response to any interaction of the child with the toy weapon . The application on the device  can use the output components (the electronic system including the transducer) of the toy weapon  as a pass-through for the outputs generated from the device . In other words, the outputs generated by the device  can be played through the output components of the toy weapon , which can amplify the outputs of the device .","In one implementation, the generation of outputs by the device  and toy weapon  can occur in response to a particular input from the user of the toy weapon . The device  may wait for a second contact point to be detected by the touch screen  before any outputs are generated. The second contact point may be generated in response to the child's activation of the trigger of the toy weapon . When a child pulls the trigger, a second touch point in a special region of the touch screen  can be generated. In response to this second touch point, the electronic device  can generate a particular output, such as the sound of a weapon shooting. This second touch point can be generated by a mechanical link or linkage coupled to the trigger that moves into contact with the touch screen  as the trigger is pulled. Alternatively, this second touch point can be generated by a wire or cable that is movable in response to the movement of the trigger of the toy weapon . The wire or cable touches the touch screen  when the trigger is pulled. This second touch or contact point provides for focused outputs that are directed associated with the interaction of the child with the toy weapon . In yet another alternative, the second touch point may already be in contact with the screen , but might not be capacitively coupled to the child's body until the child pulls the trigger. For example, the pulling of a trigger may close a switch that electrically connects the second touch point to the child's finger.","Referring to , additional embodiments of a toy weapon useable with an electronic device are illustrated. Referring to , the toy weapon  includes a barrel portion , a handle , and a trigger . A light output device  is coupled to the barrel portion . Similar to toy weapon , the toy weapon  can generate audible and\/or visible outputs.","Referring to , toy weapon  includes a mounting mechanism  that is configured to receive a portion of the electronic device  to couple the device  to the toy weapon . The mounting mechanism  is located near the intersection of the handle portion and barrel portion of the weapon . The mobile electronic device  can be slid into the mounting mechanism  which includes a slot to receive the device . In one embodiment, an application for an on screen game is opened when the electronic device  is mounted to the toy weapon . When the device  is mounted, the device  can interact with the toy weapon , which detects the presence of the device  through mounting mechanism .","Referring to , a toy weapon  is illustrated that is generally similar in configuration to toy weapon  with the exception that the location of its mounting mechanism  is located along the barrel portion of the toy weapon .","Some exemplary applications that can be run on the electronic device  while coupled to the toy weapons  and  are illustrated in . Screen shot  is part of a change weapon mode of play in the application in which the child can change the particular weapon that the toy weapon  simulates via various outputs. Screen shot  is part of a night vision play in the application. Screen shot  shows an augmented reality game that can be playing on the device  while the child plays with and maneuvers the toy weapon . In one implementation, the electronic device adds a screen tint to generate an imaginary night vision mode. In another implementation, the toy weapon can have infrared LEDs that would allow for right night vision play using the electronic device. In another implementation, the electronic device can enter a stealth mode when lights are turned off and the toy weapon can automatically turn on the infrared LEDs.","The touch screen  of the electronic device  can be used for both input and output. Input via the screen can be accomplished as described above through the use of one or more contact members creating one or more contact points, and thus, the toy weapons  and  can control the device  by the points. The screen can also output data and information to the toy weapons  and  by blinking an image or lights (or lights of particular wavelengths) that can be sensed by a detector associated with and\/or forming part of the toy weapons  and . Such data could include a signature indicating the running of a particular application, or it might include data used by the toy to enhance gameplay.","In other embodiments of the invention, an interactive toy different than the toy weapons  and  can be can be used with an electronic device  which enhances the play and use of the interactive toy.","A weapon similar to weapon  or weapon  can have several different features.

In addition, the electronic device can instruct the toy about effects patterns and timing. The electronic device can automatically recognize the toy that it is coupled or mounted to and can configure itself to offer the correct play and interactive content with the toy.","The electronic device can be used to provide a heads up display. A camera on the electronic device can be used to deliver a room scene with statistics and other screen overlays, including but not limited to, weapon type, power level, messages from other players, targeting, and tracking. The electronic device can be used for different types of tracking. One example includes locking onto targets on its screen using graphics. Another example includes eye tracking for targeting systems in an electronic device with a front facing camera.","The electronic device can be configured so that when a child tilts the toy weapon, an input is created. For example, the child may be able to tilt or lift the front of weapon to effectively \u201creload\u201d the toy weapon for additional play. The electronic device also provides voice interaction with the toy weapon. Voice commands can be generated by the electronic device. For example, the electronic device may output \u201creload!\u201d, \u201cplasma grenade!\u201d, or \u201cstatus report!\u201d Other commands may be related to ammunition or weapons selection, or may request changes in the system and feedback from the child. Also, the electronic device may include various audible feedbacks relating to the play using the toy weapon.","The electronic device can be used to facilitate co-op play. In one example, co-op play in the same room or remotely can be accomplished through WiFi or Bluetooth communications or a network connection. Game play, such as scoring, can be coordinated between multiple players using multiple electronic devices. The players can exchange statistics with each other, and send \u201cbombs\u201d or \u201chits\u201d to an opponent, which result in a reaction (audible, visual, and\/or tactile) at the toy weapon of the opponent.

In one implementation, a child can pretend to call a character, such as Barbie, on a phone with another character, such as Ken. When the phone and the toy figures, Barbie and Ken, have emitted encoded watermarking signals, the phone and the toys have confirmed that proper electronic devices (including the toy figures) have been identified, the child and the toy figures can pretend to have a three way conference call. In a different embodiment, speech recognition can be used to identify particular toy figures that are \u201cspeaking.\u201d","Similarly, in another embodiment, the software of a game can listen for a particular electronic device, such as a phone, and the phone can listen for a particular game. In another embodiment, the electronic device, such as an iPhone mobile digital device, could be running an application that continually searches for a particular toy or device. When the signal for which the electronic device is searching is identified, then the electronic device can join the new device as an additional player in a game or as an additional \u201ccaller\u201d to an exiting \u201cconference call.\u201d","In another embodiment of the invention, an electronic device can be configured to perform gesture recognition. In this implementation, the electronic device may include an accelerometer which can be used to detect one or more gestures performed by a user or inanimate object. The detection of a particular gesture may result in the launching of an application on the electronic device. Alternatively or in addition, the detection of a particular gesture may result in the input of data into the electronic device. For example, an electronic device can be placed into a socket formed in a device, such as a toy sword. When a person moves the toy sword, the electronic device can track the movement of the toy sword for a period of time. The electronic device may be running an application that prompts the person to move the toy sword in a particular manner or pattern of movements. The application can track the movements of the toy sword and compare them to the target or specified movements. One or more outputs, including audio and visual outputs, can be generated in response to the comparison of the targeted movements and the specified movements. Alternatively, the application can cause various audible and\/or visual outputs as the toy sword is moved. In addition, the movement of the toy sword can be used to power up the electronic device by recharging a power source, in a manner similar to that described above.","In another embodiment, an electronic device can be used for visual or vision recognition. In one use, the electronic device can include a camera component and image recognition software. The camera and the associated software can be used to recognize changes in an environment. For example, the electronic device can be used to take a picture or snapshot of an area. A user can change the area in someway in which the area appears to be different than it was previously. The electronic device can then be used to take another image capture. The image files can be compared by the software and any differences identified. In one implementation, a picture can be mounted on a wall in a room. The electronic device is used to take image capture of the picture on the wall. The picture can then be removed from the wall and the electronic device can be used to take another image capture of the wall. The second image will be different than the first image. Alternatively, the original picture can be replaced with a different picture and a second image capture is taken by the electronic device. Alternatively, the first image is of an object in a first configuration and the second image is of the object in a second configuration different than the first configuration. Any differences in images can be used to convey information to the electronic device, such as to program the electronic device.","Referring to , another embodiment of a system according to the invention is illustrated. In this embodiment, the system  includes an electronic device , such as an iPad, with a touch screen surface . The electronic device  includes a sensor  that can detect the location of one or more objects, such as objects , , , , and . The movement or relocation of the objects relative to the screen  can be detected by the sensor . Thus, the system  of the electronic device  can determine the location of the objects at any one time. One application running on the electronic device  can generate images of tread marks on the screen  when an object simulating a toy vehicle is moved along part of the screen . The movement of the objects relative to the surface  can be tracked by the system  and when the movements cease and play is complete, images representing the movements can be replayed on the screen , and thus, a recreation is generated.","Referring to , an exemplary embodiment of an audio remote  that can be used as a remote control with an electronic device  is illustrated. In this embodiment, the electronic is a mobile device, such as an iPhone, iPod, or other audio player. The audio remote  includes an electronic component  that is coupled to the electronic device . The electronic component  is connected to an audio jack  of the device  via a wire . As described in detail below, the electronic component  is configured to transmit a signal  to a remote object . In this embodiment, the remote object  is a toy vehicle with a drive mechanism  and an IR receiver , such as a photodiode, that can receive an IR signal  from the audio remote . In other embodiments, the remote object  can be a character, a figure, a play set, or other device that can receive instructions to cause at least one movement of a portion of the remote object . Audio remote  may transmit the signal  via any of a wide variety of known wireless remote control techniques, including without limitation infra-red (IR) light, visible light, ultraviolet light, analog or digital radiofrequency signals, or RF signals according to various standards, such as 802.11 or Bluetooth. Remote object  would therefore include a corresponding receiver adapted to receive signal .","Referring to , the electronic device may include a touch screen or display  that present a user interface  that can be manipulated by a user to send control instructions from the audio remote  to the toy vehicle . The user interface  includes several graphic objects displayed on the screen . Graphic object  is a virtual button that is associated with movement of the remote object  in a forward direction. In addition, graphic object  may include indicia, such as an arrow pointing away from the user of the electronic device  and the word \u201cForward.\u201d Similarly, graphic objects , , and  are virtual buttons associated with movement of the toy vehicle  to the right, to the left, and reverse, respectively. Each of the graphic objects , , and  can include an arrow pointed in the proper direction as well as the associated word \u201cRight,\u201d \u201cLeft,\u201d or \u201cReverse.\u201d The user interface  also includes a virtual button  that is associated with stopping the vehicle. This button  may have a different color, such as red, a stop sign configuration, and\/or the word \u201cStop\u201d thereon.","Each one of the Forward, Reverse, Right, Left, and Stop functions generates an audio tone, which is output from the audio jack  of the device  to the circuit of electronic component . The electronic component  converts the received audio signal into an IR control signal that can be transmitted to the toy vehicle  to control the movement thereof.","Referring to , some of the components of the audio remote  and their usage are illustrated. As mentioned above, in the described embodiment the audio remote  is intended to be used as an infrared (IR) remote adapter\/converter for an electronic device . The control commands are recorded as audio files in any format that is playable by the player or device, such as .wav, .mp3, .m4a files or other audio file formats, or the control commands may consist of bursts of tones at particular frequencies and may therefore be generated on-the-fly by an application running on electronic device . As described below, the audio remote  modulates the incoming audio signal by an IR carrier frequency and sends the signal to one or more IR LEDs.","Referring to , some of the components of the circuit  of audio remote  are illustrated. The audio remote  takes an audio signal such as audio tones from an audio player and passes it through a preamplifier  which amplifies the signal to command pulses as shown in . The command pulses pass through a modulator  which combines the command signal with a 38 kHz carrier signal, resulting in a command signal as illustrated in .","An exemplary electrical schematic diagram of the audio remote  is illustrated in . As mentioned above, and as shown in , the adapter  includes a preamplifier circuit  for the audio signal, a modulator circuit  that combines the audio command signal with a 38 kHz carrier signal, and an amplifier  to amplify the combined signal for output by IR LED . The modulated signal next passes through amplifier circuit  to at least one output LED , though multiple LEDs may be provided to enhance signal transmission and reception. The LED  transmits the IR command signal from the audio remote  to the remote object . The circuit  also includes its own power supply, illustratively shown as battery BT, .","The output command signals of the IR LED  are detectable by the IR receiver  of the remote object or end device . The remote object  includes a microprocessor  that provides the resulting instructions from the received commands to one or more end devices , which can include one or more drive mechanisms in the remote object . For example, the remote object , such as a toy vehicle, may have two drive mechanisms in a \u201ctank steering\u201d configuration. In one implementation, the instructions can be to activate a motor or drive mechanism to cause one or more wheels or to be driven to move the toy vehicle forward or backward or to turn the toy vehicle in a different direction by operating wheels on different sides of the vehicle at different rates or in opposing directions.","In different embodiments, the user interface may include graphic objects and functionalities in addition to the driving functions described above. For example, a toy vehicle may have one or more movable parts, such as a turret, a crane, an arm, or other movable structure that can be moved by a drive mechanism on the toy vehicle. The parts can be moved in any number of directions relative to the body of the toy vehicle.","Referring to , another embodiment of an audio remote is illustrated. In this embodiment, the audio remote  is an adapter with many components similar to those discussed above for audio remote . Some audio players provide the possibility to use the internal power supply of the audio player to power external devices. For example, some audio players provide audio and microphone connectors (or a combined audio\/microphone jack), including three leads (audio out, microphone, and ground\/common). In such players, the microphone lead provides a bias voltage that can be used as a source of power for an external device, though the voltage and\/or current levels from such a power source are often quite limited. Audio remote  can be used with such an audio player, particularly, because the audio remote  does not have its own power supply.","As shown in , the circuit  of the audio remote  includes a preamplifier circuit , a 38 kHz modulator circuit , and an amplifier circuit  for the output LED . The microphone bias input provided by the microphone jack  of the electronic device  (see ) is used to power the audio remote , which is coupled as a dongle to the device . Because microphone bias current is quite limited, capacitor  is provided to store charge from the microphone bias during the time between command pulses discharged through the LED during the transmission of IR command pulses from the audio remote .","Referring to , the electronic device  may include a touch screen or display  on which a user interface  can be provided. Similar to the user interface  illustrated in , user interface  includes several graphic objects configured to resemble buttons. Graphic objects or virtual buttons , , , and  are associated with forward, spinning to the right, reverse, and spinning to the left movements, respectively, of a remote toy vehicle, such as a tank. The user interface  also includes a stop object or button  that can be actuated to stop movement of the toy vehicle. When the touch screen  of the electronic device  senses a touch of a user in the area of one of the graphic objects , , , , and , the application determines the selection of the particular function associated with the selected graphic object. Each function generates an audio tone, which is then output by the audio jack  of the device  to audio remote . The audio remote  converts the received audio tone signal into an IR control signal that can be received by the toy vehicle  to control the movement thereof.","Referring to , a schematic diagram of another embodiment of an audio remote is illustrated. In this embodiment, any type of information, such as commands, can be transmitted on the baseband signal without a carrier signal. In this implementation, the IR receiver decodes the unmodulated IR signal at baseband frequencies. The transmission of the signal can provide a data rate of up to 9600 baud or higher, based upon the audio output components included in the electronic device .","In this embodiment, the audio remote  includes a circuit  that receives an audio signal  and generates an output of an IR transmission signal via an output LED . The IR signal is not merged with a carrier signal. A remote object  has its own circuit  with a photodiode  configured to receive the transmitted IR signal from the LED  at baseband frequencies. The remote object  can be controlled by the audio remote  in this arrangement as well.","In an alternative embodiment, in a stereo system, one channel could be used for command transmission and the other channel could be used for an audible signal, such as music and\/or speech. That arrangement can be used for controlling an animated toy object with the possibility to change or pre-record different animation sequences and sounds.","The communications between electronic devices described above can be accomplished between different types of electronic devices. In other words, one type of electronic device can communicate with a different type of electronic device.","In different embodiments, the types of devices that can be used to receive signals from an electronic device can include, but are not limited to, vehicles such as tanks, cars, flying craft, or water craft, and other toys such as toy figures, game boards or sets, and action figures. The movement of the toys can be controlled by the sign from the electronic device. In one example, an electronic device, such as a phone, can be used as a controller and send a signal to a toy figure or doll. The electronic device and the toy figure can have simulated conversations with the electronic device functioning as a phone. Alternatively, the toy figure may have one or more mechanical movements that are activated by signals from the electronic device.","As an alternative to external devices that can be controlled, the signals can be used to control accessories that are attached to an electronic device, such as a hybrid phone and device system. In addition, the signals can be used to control game states on a network.","In different embodiments, the external device or object may include any one of the following indicators that can include, but are not limited, an LED-illuminated device that changes color or intensity, a bobble-head doll that vibrates, a motorized element that moves to a different position, a push-puppet that sags or straightens up, a screen (such as an LCD, e-paper, etc.) that changes an image or text, an audio enunciator device that announces, an analog meter that changes position.","In some embodiments, a signal coming in from the headphone jack can be converted to an IR signal. In other embodiments, a signal coming in from the headphone jack can be converted to an RF signal. In other embodiments, a signal coming in from a dongle or wireless adapter, can be sent to an electronic device.","As set forth above, there are several ways to provide input to an operating system of an electronic device. One method of input is to simulate touch events to transfer data into the operating system. A series of touch events can be mechanically or electrically generated at a single point. Alternatively, a pattern of touch events (either multiple simultaneous) can be mechanically or electrically generated at different locations on a touch screen.","Another method of input is to simulate user proximity to transfer data into the operating system via an ambient light sensor. A yet another method of input is to provide a signal through a headset jack microphone input. Alternatively, a method may involve sending data signals through a handset microphone using tone recognition. Another method of input may involve audio containing watermarking. Another method of input may involve tipping the electronic device and measuring or determining the acceleration and\/or direction of movement of the device. Another method of input may involve shaking the device using an acceleration based gesture recognition.","As set forth above, the different types of output from an electronic device can vary. In one embodiment, an audio output may contain watermarking to communicate to other devices, such as toys, and to children simultaneously. In another embodiment, an audio output may contain data tones to communicate directly to toys. In another embodiment, a customized accessory or module can be used with an audio jack output for remote control of a separate device and\/or for control of a device which is part of the system including the originating electronic device and another device. In another embodiment, the output may be a WiFi signal to another device or to a router or hub. In another embodiment, the output may be a Bluetooth signal to another device or a custom accessory. In another embodiment, the output may be via a cellular network which relays data from toys to the Internet. In another embodiment, the output may be a screen blinking data pattern, such as in one portion of the screen, that is used to communicate with a toy. In another embodiment, the output can be vibration which can be a direct feedback to a user and\/or a communication to an external device.","It is to be understood that terms such as \u201cleft,\u201d \u201cright,\u201d \u201ctop,\u201d \u201cbottom,\u201d \u201cfront,\u201d \u201crear,\u201d \u201cside,\u201d \u201cheight,\u201d \u201clength,\u201d \u201cwidth,\u201d \u201cupper,\u201d \u201clower,\u201d \u201cinterior,\u201d \u201cexterior,\u201d \u201cinner,\u201d \u201couter\u201d and the like as may be used herein, merely describe points or portions of reference and do not limit the present invention to any particular orientation or configuration.
