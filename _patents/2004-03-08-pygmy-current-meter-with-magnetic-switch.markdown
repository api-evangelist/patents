title: Pygmy current meter with magnetic switch
abstract: An apparatus for measuring fluid velocity includes a generally Y-shaped yoke including a base and first and second forks, the first and second forks including through holes at ends thereof; a bucket wheel supported between the first and second forks of the yoke; a first shaft that passes through the through hole in the first fork and supports one side of the bucket wheel; a second shaft that passes through the through hole in the second fork and supports the other side of the bucket wheel, the second shaft rotating with the bucket wheel and including a magnet mounted therein; the second fork of the yoke including an opening for receiving a reed switch assembly, the opening communicating with the through hole in the second fork, the magnet on the second shaft being aligned with the opening whereby when the second shaft rotates the magnet passes by the opening; and a reed switch assembly mounted in the opening in the second fork of the yoke.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for government purposes without the payment of any royalties therefor.","The invention relates in general to the measurement of fluid velocity and in particular to the measurement of water velocity in shallow streams.","The Price pygmy meter is one of the primary tools used by the U.S. Geological Survey to accurately measure water velocity. The original Price pygmy meter uses a contact switch that is difficult to properly adjust so that it works well at low and high velocities. The contact switch also has a very noisy signal that makes accurate counting of the contact closure difficult when using digital electronic devices. A non-contact switch is needed, but the small size of the meter has made a solution difficult.","Prior switches used in the Price pygmy meter include the contact or \u201cwiper\u201d switch, the Swoffer optic switch and the JBS Hall effect switch. The contact or \u201cwiper\u201d switch is sometimes referred to as the \u201ccat whisker\u201d switch and is the original switch used since the inception of the Price pygmy meter. However, the cat whisker switch is difficult to adjust so that it works properly over a wide range of velocities. Adjustments to the cat whisker switch affect the rated performance of the meter, especially at low velocities, thereby reducing the meter's accuracy.","Optic switches work well until water intrudes and refracts the emitted light thereby preventing the switch from closing. A watertight submersible meter is difficult and expensive to build. In addition, the optic switch will not work with a simple two wire connection. Hall effect switches open and close based on opposite ends of the magnetic pole. The Hall effect switch is open half the time and closed half the time, thereby adversely affecting the counting accuracy at low velocities. The Hall effect switch is a solid state device that requires continuous current to operate, making a simple two wire connection more complicated. A currently used Hall effect switch uses a dedicated three wire cable that extends from the meter up to the digital counter, thereby exposing several feet of wire to water velocities.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","12","14","16","18","12","16","18","20","22","24","16","18","12","24"]},"A first shaft  passes through the through hole  in the first fork  and supports one side of the bucket wheel .

The binding post assembly  includes a binding post conductor . Electrical lead  from the reed switch  is connected to the binding post conductor  by, for example, soldering.

Binding post assembly  includes a central binding post  with integral nut , a thumbwheel nut , nut  and binding post conductor . The top surface of the sleeve  is sandwiched between nuts , , thereby securing the binding post assembly  to the sleeve . Binding post  terminates in binding post conductor , to which is attached lead  from reed switch .","In operation, a known wading rod (not shown) is attached to the velocity meter  by insertion in opening  in the base  of yoke  (). Set screw  helps to secure the wading rod in place. An electrical wire (not shown) is connected at one end to the binding post assembly  by securing it between the nut  and the thumbwheel nut . The other end of the wire is connected to the wading rod and thence to a counting device. Flowing water forces the bucket wheel  to rotate, which also rotates the second shaft  with the magnet  disposed therein. Each time the magnet passes the reed switch , the reed switch closes thereby forming a closed circuit from the wading rod to the wire (not shown) connected to the binding post assembly  thru the binding post conductor , the reed switch , electrical leads  and , adapter , second fork , base  and thence back to the wading rod. In a known manner, the number of pulses generated by the reed switch closure are counted and processed.","While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments, numerous changes, alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims, and equivalents thereof."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["In the drawings, which are not necessarily to scale, like or corresponding parts are denoted by like or corresponding reference numerals.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["28","36"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"26"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":"34"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":"34"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
