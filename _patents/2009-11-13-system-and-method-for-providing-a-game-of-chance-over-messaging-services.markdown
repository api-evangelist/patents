title: System and method for providing a game of chance over messaging services
abstract: A system and method are described for providing a game of chance over messaging services. In one embodiment a method is disclosed for receiving a message from a first user which includes an identifier of a second user. The second user is registered for the game of chance based on the identifier of the first user. A message may be sent to the second user to invite the second user to enter the identifier of another user into the game of chance. A winning identifier is identified from a set of identifiers, such as the identifiers entered into the game of chance. A message is sent the second user if the amount by which the identifier of the first user matches the winning identifier satisfies a winning threshold. The message may include an indication that the second user won a prize.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application No. 12\/421,369, filed on Apr. 9, 2009, which is incorporated by reference herein.","BACKGROUND","The mobile phone may be increasingly important as an information and content access device. Mobile phones may be used for phone calls, messaging, such as short messaging service (SMS) messaging, multimedia messaging service (MMS) messaging, and email, and to browse the web. These features provide the users of the mobile devices access to other people and to content. Carriers may be introducing content services, multimedia services and applications, such as games, as a means of generating new revenue streams, retaining and attracting customers, increasing returns on investment, and extending and differentiating their service offerings to consumers. The emergence of these new services may be creating unique opportunities for mobile carriers and publishers to generate additional revenue streams through new and existing customers. Advancements in mobile phone technology have allowed carriers to provide graphics rich games and multimedia content to mobile phone users. However, the majority of mobile phone users may not have mobile devices capable of accessing these games and content.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"110"},"For example, the system may receive a message, such as a short message service (SMS) message, also referred to as a text message, from the first user which contains the phone number of the second user. Upon receiving the message, the system may register the second user into the game of chance based on the identifier of the first user, such that if the identifier of the first user wins the game of chance, the second user wins a prize. In one example, upon receiving the message, the system may register the first user and the second user into the game of chance. In this example, if the first user may be registered into the game of chance based on the identifier of the first user and\/or the second user, and the second user may be registered into the game of chance based on the identifier of the first user. The operator of the system may configure the game of chance such that a message from the first user registers only the second user, or a message from the first user registers the first user and the second user. The operator of the system may also charge the first user a fee upon receiving the message and registering the second user and\/or the first user into the game of chance provided by the system. Alternatively, in the case of mobile messages, the mobile carrier of the mobile phone used by the first user may charge a fee to the mobile phone account of the first user for sending the message to the system. The fee may be in addition to any standard mobile messaging fees charged to the user for sending mobile messages. The mobile phone operator may pay some of the additional fee, or the entire additional fee, to the operator of the system providing the game of chance. Thus, in one example, the first user is charged a fee to only register the second user into the game of chance provided by the system, while the second user is not charged any fee. In another example, the first user is charged a fee to register both the first user and the second user into the game of chance provided by the system. The system may receive additional messages from users which contain identifiers of other users to be registered into the game of chance. The steps of registering users for the game of chance are discussed in more detail in  below.","At step , the system may register the second user into the game of chance with the identifier of the first user. For example, the system may store an association between the identifier of the first user and an identifier of the second user in a data store associated with the game of chance. At step , the system may notify the second user that the first user registered the second user into the game of chance, based on the identifier of the first user, and the system may invite the second user to enter the first user into the game of chance. For example, the system may send a message to the second user notifying the second user that the first user registered the second user into the game of chance based on the identifier of the first user. The message may invite the second user to return the favor by entering the first user into the game of chance. Since the first user paid a fee to enter the second user into the game of chance, the second user may feel socially obligated to pay a fee to enter the first user into the game of chance. The message may indicate a confirmation response the second user may respond with in order to enter the first user into the game of chance, such as the confirmation response \u201cYES.\u201d In this instance, the second user may register the first user into the game of chance, based on the identifier of the second user, by responding to the invitation message with the response \u201cYES.\u201d If the second user was entered into the game of chance multiple times, such as by multiple other users, each invitation message sent to the second user may include a unique confirmation response which the second user may respond with to register the user responsible for registering the second user. This may allow the system to identify the other user the second user wishes to register into the game of chance. For example, the confirmation response for the second user to register the first user may be \u201cYES.\u201d However, if a third user also registers the second user into the game of chance, the confirmation response for the second user to register the third user into the game of chance may be \u201cYES1,\u201d or some other string of characters which is different than the confirmation response for registering the first user. The system operating the game of chance may maintain a database which tracks the confirmation message associated with each user such that the system can identify the user the second user wishes to register into the game of chance based on a confirmation response. Alternatively, the second user may respond to the invitation with an identifier of another user, who would then be entered into the game of chance based on the identifier of the second user.","At step , the system may send a message to the first user which confirms that the second user was entered into the game of chance based on the identifier of the first user. The message may also include an invitation to the first user to enter another user into the game of chance. The first user may enter another user into the game of chance by responding to the confirmation message with an identifier of another user. By inviting both first user and the second user to register another user into the game of chance, the system creates a viral environment where each user who is registered into the game may register another user into the game of chance.","At step , the system may determine at least one winning identifier. For example, if the identifiers entered into the game of chance by the users are phone numbers, then the winning identifier may be a winning phone number. Alternatively, the system may determine multiple winning identifiers. The system may determine a winning identifier by randomly selecting at least one winning identifier from a set of identifiers. The set of identifiers may be the set of identifiers entered into the game by the users. Thus, if the winning identifier is selected from the set of identifiers entered into the game, then at least one identifier entered by a user should win the game of chance. Alternatively, if the identifiers are phone numbers, the set of identifiers may be a set of active phone numbers in the geographic location where the phone number of the second user originates from. In this case, there may be no winners if no users were registered into the game of chance with the winning phone number. Alternatively, the set of identifiers may be a set of active phone numbers which are associated with the same country code as the phone number of the second user. Generally the set of identifiers may be any set of identifiers which includes the identifiers entered into the game.","At step , the system may determine an amount by which the identifier of the first user matches the winning identifier. If the identifiers are phone numbers, the amount by which the phone numbers match may be based on the number of digits of the phone numbers that match. For example, if five digits of the phone number of the first user match the winning phone number, then the amount by which the phone number of the first user matches the winning phone number may be five. Alternatively, the amount by which the phone number of the first user matches the winning phone number may be the percent that the phone number of the first user matches the winning phone number. If the phone number of the first user has ten digits, and five of the digits match the winning phone number, then the amount by which the phone number entered by the second user matches the winning phone number would be fifty percent.","At step , the system determines if the amount by which the identifier of the first user matches the winning identifier satisfies the winning threshold. The winning threshold may identify the minimum amount by which the identifier of the first user must match the winning identifier in order to win the game. The operator may set the winning threshold based on the amount of prizes awarded for the game. For example, if there are a large number of prizes awarded, the winning threshold may be set lower, which would typically result in more winners of the game. However, if there are a small number of prizes awarded, the winning threshold may be set higher, which would typically result in less winners of the game. For example, if the amount by which the phone number of the first user matches the winning phone number is seven digits, and the winning threshold is at least six digits, then the amount by which the phone number of the first user matches the winning phone number would satisfy the threshold. Alternatively, the winning threshold may only be satisfied if the phone number of the first user is equivalent to the winning phone number. In the example where the system selects multiple winning identifiers, there may be a winning threshold for each winning identifier. In one example, the winning threshold for each winning identifier may only be satisfied by an exact, or complete, match of each winning identifier.","If, at step , the amount by which the identifier of the first user matches the winning identifier does not satisfy the winning threshold, the system moves to step . At step , the system may notify the second user, such as by sending a message to the second user, that they did not win a prize based on the identifier of the first user, and may invite the second user to register the first user, or another user, into the next game of chance. As mentioned above, the message may include a confirmation response which the second user may respond with to register the first user into the next game of chance, such as the confirmation response \u201cYES.\u201d Alternatively, the second user may respond with the identifier of another user to enter another user into the game of chance.","At step , the system may notify the first user, such as by sending a message to the first user, that the second user did not win a prize based on the identifier of the first user, and may invite the first user to register the second user, or another user, into the next game of chance. As mentioned above, the message may include a confirmation response which the first user may respond with to register the second user into the next game of chance, such as the confirmation response \u201cYES.\u201d Alternatively, the first user may respond with the identifier of another user to enter another user into the game of chance.","If, at step , the amount by which the identifier of the first user matches the winning identifier satisfies the threshold, the system moves to step . At step , the system determines the prize awarded to the second user. For example, the prize awarded may be based on the amount by which the identifier of the first user matches the winning identifier. In this example, the prize may increase as the amount by which the identifier of the first user matches the winning identifier increases. Alternatively, the prizes may be arranged in tiers. For example, in the case of phone numbers, a phone number which matches all of the digits of the winning phone number would receive the largest prize, a phone number that matches all but one of the digits would receive a smaller prize, and so on. Alternatively, the system may select multiple winning identifiers. In this case, each winning identifier may be associated with a different prize amount. The prize amount may increase, or may decrease, with each successively selected winning identifier. In one example, the system may only award the prize associated with each winning identifier if an identifier registered into the game exactly matches one of the winning identifiers.","At step , the system determines whether the game is configured such that only the second user wins a prize for the identifier of the first user winning, or if both the first user and the second user win a prize for the identifier of the first user winning. For example, as mentioned above, the game of chance may be configured such that a message sent by the first user registers both the first user and the second user into the game of chance, or the game of chance may be configured such that the message sent by the first user only registers the second user into the game of chance. If the game of chance is configured such that the message only registers the second user in the game of chance, the system moves to step . If the game of chance is configured such that the first user and the second user are registered into the game of chance, the system moves to step .","At step , the system notifies the first user, such as by sending a message to the first user, that the first user won a prize because the identifier of the first user matches the winning identifier. The system may also provide the prize, or award, to the first user. For example, the system may send an electronic payment in the amount of the prize determined in step  to the first user. Alternatively, the system may credit an account of the first user, such as the mobile phone account of the first user, with the prize amount.","At step , the system notifies the second user, such as by sending a message to the second user, that the second user won a prize because the identifier of the first user matches the winning identifier. The system may also provide the prize, or award, to the second user. For example, the system may send an electronic payment in the amount of the prize determined in step  to the second user. Alternatively, the system may credit an account of the second user, such as the mobile phone account of the second user, with the prize amount.","At step , the system may invite the first and second users to register another user into the next game of chance. The system may send a message to the first user inviting the first user to register the second user, or another user, into the next game of chance. As mentioned above, the message may include a confirmation response which the first user may respond with to register the second user into the next game of chance, such as the confirmation response \u201cYES.\u201d Alternatively, the first user may respond with the identifier of another user to enter another user into the next game of chance. The system may also send a message to the second user inviting the second user to register the first user into the next game of chance.

Thus, if a user enters an identifier into the game of chance after the registration time period expires, the user may be automatically entered into the next game of chance.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 2"],"b":["510","200"]},"At step , the system  retrieves the first identifier entered into the game of chance. For example, the system  may retrieve the first identifier stored in a database or from memory. At step , the system determines the amount by which the identifier matches the winning identifier. The amount may be a percentage of the identifier which matches the winning identifier, or a number of characters and\/or numbers of the identifier which match the winning identifier. One game of chance may require that the characters and\/or numbers of the identifier match the winning identifier in order. However, other games may not require that the characters and\/or numbers of the identifier match the winning identifier in order.","At step , the system  determines whether the determined amount by which the identifier matches the winning identifier satisfies the winning threshold. The winning threshold may be different for each game depending upon the amount of winners the operator would like each game to have. The lower the winning threshold is, the more winners there will likely be, and vice-versa. Thus, the winning threshold may vary depending upon the number of identifiers entered into the game, the fee for entering the game, and the size of the prizes awarded for each amount by which each identifier matches the winning identifier. In one example, the winning threshold may only be satisfied if the identifier is an exact match of the winning identifier. If, at step , the system  determines that the amount by which the identifier matches the winning identifier satisfies the winning threshold, the system  moves to step .","At step , the system  determines the prize for the identifier based on the amount by which the identifier matches the winning identifier. For example, the prize may increase as the amount by which the identifier of the second user matches the winning identifier increases. The prizes may be arranged in tiers. For example, in the case of phone numbers, a phone number which matches all of the digits of the winning phone number would receive the largest prize, a phone number that matches all but one of the digits would receive a smaller prize, etc. If the winning threshold is only satisfied if the identifier is an exact match of the winning identifier, then there may only be one winning identifier. In this case the prize may be based on the number of entries into the game, or may be determined prior to the start of the game. Alternatively, the system  may select multiple winning identifiers. In this case, each winning identifier may be associated with a different prize amount. The prize amount may decrease, or increase, for each successively selected winning identifier.","At step , the system  may notify the user who was registered by the user having the identifier that the user wins a prize. For example, if a first user registers a second user for the game of chance with the identifier of the first user, and the identifier of the first user is a winning identifier, then the second user wins a prize. The system  may send a mobile message to the winning user informing the user that they won a prize and inviting the user to participate in the next game of chance by responding to the mobile message with an identifier of another user. The system  may also provide the prize to the winning user. For example, the system  may send an electronic payment in the amount of the prize determined in step  to the winning user.","At step , the system  may determine whether the game was configured such that both the user who was registered by the user having the winning identifier wins a prize, and the user having the winning identifier wins a prize. If, a step , the system  determines that the game was configured such that both the user who was registered by the user having the winning identifier wins a prize and the user having the winning identifier wins a prize, the system  moves to step . At step , the system  notifies the user who registered the winning user that the user wins a prize because their identifier satisfies the winning threshold. For example, the system  may sent a mobile message to the user informing the user that they won a prize and inviting the user to participate in another game by responding to the mobile message with an identifier of another user. The system  may also provide the prize to the user who registered the winning user. For example, the system  may send an electronic payment in the amount of the prize determined in step  to the user who registered the winning user. If, at step , the system  determines that the game was configured such that only the user who was registered by the user having the winning identifier wins a prize, the system moves to .","If, at step , the system  determines that the amount by which the identifier matches the winning identifier does not satisfy the winning threshold, then the system  moves to step . At step , the system determines that the identifier does not win, and thus, the user who was registered by the user having the identifier does not win a prize. The system  may send a mobile message to the user who was registered by the user having the identifier, and the user having the identifier, to inform them that the registered user did not win the game of chance. The mobile message may invite the users to play in the next game of chance by responding to the mobile message with an identifier of another user. At step , the system  determines whether there are additional identifiers which were entered into the game. If, at step , the system  determines that there are additional identifiers entered into the game, the system  moves to step . At step , the system  identifies the next identifier entered into the game and repeats steps - for the next identifier.","If, at step , the system  determines that there are no additional identifiers entered into the game, then the system  moves to step .
