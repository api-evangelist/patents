No. 12\/435,797 entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Enhanced Terahertz Radiation from High Stacking Fault Density,\u201d filed May 5, 2009, by Dr. Grace Metcalfe, et al., and U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/050,890 filed May 6, 2008. Both U.S. application Ser. Nos. 12\/435,797 and 61\/050,890 are hereby incorporated herein by reference.","The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, and\/or licensed by or for the United States Government.","This invention relates generally to radiation emitting crystals, and more particularly to crystal structures which provide a source of electromagnetic radiation.","Electromagnetic waves sent at terahertz frequencies, known as terahertz radiation, terahertz waves (THz) rays, occur in the region of the electromagnetic spectrum between 100 gigahertz (1\u00d710Hz) and several terahertz, and correspond to the wavelength range of from roughly a single digit millimeter (high-frequency edge of the microwave band) and roughly 100 micrometer (long-wavelength edge of far-infrared light).","THz-rays, which are shorter than microwaves and longer than infrared, have potential usage in biomedical and security applications in that THz-rays are safe, and non-ionizing, and can pass through such materials as clothing, paper, cardboard, wood, masonry, plastic, ceramics, as well as penetrate fog and clouds. THz radiation is safe for biological tissues (unlike X-rays), and images can be formed with terahertz radiation having resolution of less than 1 mm. THz radiation has potential spectroscopic uses in that while many materials are transparent to THz, many materials exhibit unique spectral identifiers when exposed to terahertz radiation, including explosives, pharmaceuticals, and illegal narcotic substances. Accordingly, items of interest can be observed through normally visually opaque intervening layers, such as packaging and clothing. For example, airport security scanners may use terahertz radiation.","To date, THz rays have not yet been widely used, partly because of the difficulty in producing them at sufficient intensity. For example, in the journal article entitled, \u201cGeneration of Terahertz Radiation with Two Color Semiconductor Lasers,\u201d Hoffman and Hoffman, Laser and Photonics Reviews, Rev. 1, No. 1, 44-56 (available on-line Feb. 13, 2007) (hereinafter Hoffman & Hoffman) though time-domain THz spectroscopy has been shown to be extremely powerful, it suffers from its enormous price (at least $ 200,000) and complexity, which restricts the use of the system.","Previous approaches to terahertz radiation devices have used photoconductive switches in conjunction with a semiconductor comprising two parallel metal strips on the surface separated by a small distance (hundreds of microns to a few millimeters). A schematic illustration of such a configuration is shown in . These metal strips act as electrodes, across which a large voltage (up to kV) is applied, creating electric fields as large as 10 kV\/cm. The semiconductor material is highly resistive, such that virtually no current flows without illumination. When the gap between the electrodes is illuminated with an approximately 100 femtosecond pulse of photon energy larger than the fundamental bandgap of the semiconductor, electron-hole pairs are created and swept out in the high field, producing a transient current that generates a THz pulse with usable bandwidth beyond 1 THz. The energy of the THz pulse is proportional to the square of the bias field. One disadvantage of this approach is that metal electrodes with kV voltages across them must be used to create THz radiation. Another disadvantage is that the external bias voltage, and therefore the THz pulse energy, is limited by dielectric breakdown in air to less than 300 kV\/cm in theory, but in practice 100 kV\/cm is rarely exceeded. Terahertz (THz) radiation in conventional devices is commonly generated through in-plane carrier acceleration in electric fields utilizing externally biased photoconductive (PC) switches, a surge-current normal to the surface due to a built-in surface field, or the photo-Dember field. Although the geometry of the biased photoconductive antennas is more favorable for coupling out the THz radiation than that for other semiconductor-based THz sources employing transport normal to the surface, these photoconductive switches require electrode processing and an external bias voltage, which is limited by the dielectric strength of air, to establish an in-plane electric field. An alternative optical THz generation approach creates narrow band radiation through the mixing of continuous-wave (CW) lasers separated in frequency by the desired terahertz difference frequency in a semiconductor photomixer. Most photomixers use low-temperature grown GaAs thin films as the active layer due to its short carrier lifetime (approximately 0.5 ps), large breakdown-field threshold (>300 kV\/cm) and high carrier mobility (\u02dc200 cm\/V\u00b7s).","THz emission from quantum wells (QWs) (see ) has been observed from GaAs\/AlGaAs single QWs and multiple quantum wells (MQWs), InGaAs\/GaAs and GaSb\/AlSb MQWs and superlattices, low indium concentration InGaN\/GaN (MQWs), and high indium concentration InN\/InGaN MQWs. While the THz radiation field is proportional to the number of photoexcited carriers under low excitation conditions, one can readily gauge the importance of the enhanced internal electric field by considering the MQW structure as a nanoscale capacitor, with the energy transfer from the excitation pulse to the THz pulse mediated by the partial or complete discharge of the nanocapacitor. Therefore the maximum THz pulse energy is limited by the electrostatic energy stored in the nanocapacitor, U=\u00bd\u03b5\u03b5AdF, where \u03b5\u03b5is the static permittivity, A is the area, d is the effective width of the capacitor, and F is the electric field inside the capacitor.","In consideration of the problems described above, an object of the present invention is to provide a method and device for generation of terahertz (THz) radiation that will provide significantly more terahertz power than that which can be obtained using current state of the art photoconductive switches. In a preferred embodiment, a polar crystal material is excited by an emission source, such as for example, a 100 femtosecond pulse source. The polar crystal material may have interstices, gaps, openings, or breaks between segmented portions. The interstices, gaps, breaks or openings may be produced by etching the polar crystal along a nonpolar direction to create high internal fields that result from, inter alfa, termination of, the spontaneous polarization (and\/or piezoelectric polarization) along the in-plane c-axis of the polar crystal material. Such interstices, gaps, openings or breaks may be created, for example, during the course of the heteroepitaxial growth of the crystals on non-native substrates, whereby large numbers (in the range of 10to 10per cm) of these interstices, gaps, openings or breaks are created, such as by masking, primarily perpendicular to the polar c-axis. The internal electric fields created by the interstices, gaps, openings or breaks can exceed those that can be obtained using large externally applied voltages in conventional, large aperture photoconductive switches, which are constrained by dielectric breakdown in air. Unlike photoconductive strips, the present invention does not require metal contacts. Moreover, the present invention requires no external voltage source. In a preferred embodiment, the interstices, gaps, openings or breaks may be substantially equally spaced. As shown in , the polar crystal segments or portions  may be in the form of polygons having interstices or spaces  there between. The polar crystal segments may use a polar crystal material having a Wurtzite crystal structure as depicted in , or a zinc blende crystal structure as depicted in . As used herein, the terminology \u201cwurtzite\u201d refers to the wurtzite crystal structure, named after the mineral wurtzite, which is a crystal structure for various binary compounds. In the case of zinc blende, there is relatively insignificant spontaneous polarization, so only piezoelectric polarization is depicted in . The segments may be formed of GaN, InN, AlN and alloys thereof, ZnO, MgO, ZnS, ZnSe, ZnTe, and alloys thereof, and SiC. These materials can be used as represented by . Zinc Blende compounds can be used, as represented by the embodiments of . The Zinc Blende compounds which could be utilized include zinc blende GaAs, InAs, AlAs, GaN, InN, AlN, GaSb, AlSb, InSb or alloys thereof, ZnO, MgO, ZnS, ZnSe, ZnTe, and alloys thereof, and SiC. Other crystal structures may be used to form the segments  without departing from the scope of the invention. The polar crystal segments may be in the form of multiple layers, represented by segments A and B in . The multiple layered segments may be made of the abovementioned materials, and the adjacent layer may be strained (i.e., one lattice is forced to conform to another) thereby creating a piezoelectric polarization in addition to the spontaneous polarization.","Polar crystal materials, which may be semiconductors, developed using the principles of the present invention use nonpolar growth directions to create in-plane spontaneous and piezoelectric polarizations that are terminated at interstices, gaps, openings or breaks to produce large in-plane internal electric fields within the segmented portions. The interstices, gaps, breaks, or openings in the polar crystal may be filled with air, exist in a vacuum, or may be filled with a different material (such as an insulator or other semiconductor material).","The polar crystal material layer constructed in accordance with the principles of the present invention can be GaN, InN, AlN, or alloys thereof.","Further examples of the polar crystal material layer are ZnO, MgO, ZnS, ZnSe, ZnTe, or alloys thereof. GaAs, InAs, AlAs, GaSb, AlSb, GaN alloys thereof may also be used. In addition, SiC may be utilized as the polar crystal material layer. The orientation of the crystal structure may be nonpolar with, in the case of wurtzite structures, the a-plane or m-plane as the growth plane. Although in , the polar axis is shown as being in-plane (or in the growth plane), the crystal structure orientation may be semipolar, where a projection of the polar axis is in the growth plane, as shown for example in .","The present invention results in spectrally broadened emission and greater efficiency of emitting devices. As described in greater detail in U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/435,797 (hereinafter '797 Application) entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Enhanced Terahertz Radiation for High Stacking Fault Density,\u201d the interruption of the polarization in the polar crystal material may be produced or created using stacking faults. In other words, the stacking faults perform the function of the interstices, openings, or breaks referenced above. As described further in the '797 Application, the p-polarized (s-polarized) THz radiation measured from the high stacking fault density samples reaches its maximum and minimum when the c-axis is parallel or antiparallel with the p-polarization (s-polarization) detection direction, respectively. A preferred method provides a stacking fault density in the approximate range of 10to 10per centimeter producing an average electric field in the approximate range of 3 to 1800 kV\/cm.","A preferred embodiment device for generating terahertz radiation comprises: a substrate; a plurality of segments of polar crystal material formed on the substrate, the segments having an internal electric polarization; each segment comprising at least two edges oriented substantially perpendicular to the polar axis such that the electric polarization terminates at the edges and the segment comprises a majority of positive charges on one edge and a majority of negative charges on the opposite edge thereby leading to creation of an internal electric field; whereby when irradiated by a pulsed source of duration less than one picosecond, electron-hole pairs are generated within the segments and the internal electric field separates and accelerates the electron-hole pairs to thereby produce terahertz radiation.","In order to attain the objectives described above, according to the present invention, there is provided an apparatus and methodology whereby enhanced levels of terahertz radiation are obtainable.","The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which embodiments of the invention are shown. However, this invention should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. In the drawings, the thickness of layers and regions may be exaggerated for clarity. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout. As used herein the term \u201cand\/or\u201d includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.","The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to limit the full scope of the invention. As used herein, the singular forms \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms \u201ccomprises\u201d and\/or \u201ccomprising,\u201d when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and\/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and\/or groups thereof.","It will be understood that when an element such as a layer, region or substrate is referred to as being \u201con\u201d or extending \u201conto\u201d another element, it can be directly on or extend directly onto the other element or intervening elements may also be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being \u201cdirectly on\u201d or extending \u201cdirectly onto\u201d another element, there are no intervening elements present. It will also be understood that when an element is referred to as being \u201cconnected\u201d or \u201ccoupled\u201d to another element, it can be directly connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being \u201cdirectly connected\u201d or \u201cdirectly coupled\u201d to another element, there are no intervening elements present.","It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and\/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and\/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another region, layer or section. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of the present invention.","Furthermore, relative terms, such as \u201clower\u201d or \u201cbottom\u201d and \u201cupper\u201d or \u201ctop,\u201d may be used herein to describe one element's relationship to other elements as illustrated in the Figures. It will be understood that relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in addition to the orientation depicted in the Figures. For example, if the device in the Figures is turned over, elements described as being on the \u201clower\u201d side of other elements would then be oriented on \u201cupper\u201d sides of the other elements. The exemplary term \u201clower\u201d, can therefore, encompass both an orientation of \u201clower\u201d and \u201cupper,\u201d depending of the particular orientation of the figure. Similarly, if the device in one of the figures is turned over, elements described as \u201cbelow\u201d or \u201cbeneath\u201d other elements would then be oriented \u201cabove\u201d the other elements. The exemplary terms \u201cbelow\u201d or \u201cbeneath\u201d can, therefore, encompass both an orientation of above and below. Furthermore, the term \u201couter\u201d may be used to refer to a surface and\/or layer that is farthest away from a substrate.","Embodiments of the present invention are described herein with reference to cross-section illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized embodiments of the present invention. As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and\/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, embodiments of the present invention should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, an etched region illustrated as a rectangle will, typically, have tapered, rounded or curved features. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the precise shape of a region of a device and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.","Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.","It will also be appreciated by those of skill in the art that references to a structure or feature that is disposed \u201cadjacent\u201d another feature may have portions that overlap or underlie the adjacent feature.","The present invention provides, inter alfa, a new source of terahertz radiation that will provide significantly more terahertz power when excited by a femtosecond laser pulse than that which can be obtained using current state-of-the-art photoconductive switches. This is accomplished by engineering higher internal electric fields in the device than can be obtained using large, externally applied voltages in conventional, large aperture photoconductive switches, which are constrained by dielectric breakdown in air. The present invention is therefore also easier to fabricate because it does not require metal contacts. Previous approaches have used a photoconductive switch comprised of a semiconductor with two parallel metal strips on the surface separated by a small distance (hundreds of microns to a few millimeters). These metal strips act as electrodes, across which a large voltage (up to a kV) is applied, creating electric fields as large as 10 kV\/cm. The semiconductor material is highly resistive, such that virtually no current flows without illumination. When the gap between the electrodes is illuminated with a \u02dc100 femtosecond pulse of photon energy larger than the fundamental bandgap of the semiconductor, electron-hole pairs are created and are swept out in the high field, producing a transient current that generates a THz pulse with useable bandwidth beyond 1 THz. The energy of the THz pulse is proportional to the square of the bias field.","One disadvantage of this approach is that metal electrodes with kV voltages across them must be used to create the THz radiation. While these voltages can be limited by reducing the gap spacing using metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) structures with interdigitated fingers, in this case the fields in adjacent gaps would be opposite, leading to a cancellation of the THz radiation. This can be addressed by using a shadow mask to eliminate the response of every other gap, thus ensuring that all of the fields in the remaining gaps are additive, but this will also reduce efficiency by lowering the effective illuminated area by as much as a factor of 4. Another disadvantage is that the external bias voltage, and therefore the THz pulse energy, is limited by dielectric breakdown in air to less than 30 kV\/cm in theory, but in practice 10 kV\/cm is rarely exceeded.","The present invention relates to Terahertz (THz) emission by a polar crystal upon excitation by a femtosecond laser source as shown schematically in .  illustrates the directions of the p-polarized and s-polarized components of the terahertz waveform produced by laser excitation of the semiconductor crystal structure . As recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art, a femtosecond is 10seconds and a femtosecond laser is a laser that operates in the domain of femtoseconds. The most preferable excitation source, labeled L in , B, is a low cost, compact, femtosecond fiber laser operating at either 1030 nm or 1560 nm (fundamental), or 515 nm or 780 nm (second harmonic). Preferably the pulsed radiation source has a photon energy greater than the bandgap of the crystal material. During photo excitation, a photo-Dember field can occur at the surface of a semiconductor due to a difference in diffusion coefficients for electrons and holes, and a structural asymmetry. Typically, electrons have a larger diffusion coefficient than holes. Consequently, upon photoexcitation, electrons diffuse more rapidly than the holes. In the absence of a surface boundary, no net dipole field is observed, since the center of charge does not change.","One aspect of the present invention is the recognition of polarized terahertz (THz) emission from nonpolar GaN, or the like, due to carrier transport in internal in-plane electric fields created by the termination, at boundaries (or edges), of the in-plane polarization. Observation of a flip in the THz waveform polarity with a reversal in c-axis orientation indicates a reversal of photoelectric charge acceleration direction, consistent with built-in electric field along the c-axis in the nonpolar nitride semiconductor. This polarized THz emission, for horizontal c-axis, can lead to significant enhancement of the THz radiation usually observed due to carrier diffusion normal to the sample surface,","In order to derive the THz electric field radiated, the first derivative of the net current with respect to time or the second derivative of the polarization, is calculated as a function of time. It acts as the source term in Maxwell's equations when determining the THz emission.","By way of background, the terminology \u201cpolar\u201d semiconductor is repeatedly referenced. A substance which has an unequal sharing of charge among constituent elements in the absence of a field is called a polar material. As used herein, the terminology polar, nonpolar, and semipolar relate to the orientations of the polar material. Specifically,  are illustrations showing three different orientations (polar, nonpolar and semipolar) of the c-axis of a wurtzite crystal's structure (with c-axis being defined as perpendicular to the c-plane) relative to the growth plane, which in these examples is the sample surface. In the polar orientation example shown in , the c-axis is perpendicular to the growth plane. In the nonpolar orientation example, the c-axis is parallel to the growth plane and perpendicular to the growth direction. A semipolar orientation is depicted in  in which the c-axis of the crystal structure has a projection onto the growth plane. As used herein the terminology \u201cprojection onto\u201d refers to a mathematical construct in which a vector diagram can be used to evaluate the intensity of the component projected onto a given plane. As shown in , the projection of the c-axis onto the growth plane results in a vector component labeled as \u201cprojection of c-axis onto growth plane\u201d in . As seen in , the intensity value associated with the projection is non-zero; but may be in the range of from whatever angle that the crystal may be cut to 100%. The orientation of the crystal structure is that represented by the insert in ","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a polar semiconductor is grown on a substrate such that growth proceeds in a non-polar direction, with the crystal's polar axis in-plane as depicted, for example in the bottom of . The fabrication process could involve creating a layer on the substrate and later etching away undesired portions or by selectively growing layer portions on the substrate. In accordance with the preferred embodiment illustrated in , the polar semiconductor could be in the configuration of bars or segments  supported by a substrate . Of significance is that the segments  have first and second air interface boundaries (or edges). Although these boundaries or edges appear linear in , they need only be of a form which results in the termination of the polarization at the boundaries or interfaces ,  in a manner in which the polarization effects are achieved. For simplicity, the interfaces ,  are labeled only for the rightmost segments  in each of , but each segment (each of , A and\/or B) has corresponding boundaries or interfaces , . The crystal structure of the segments  have a non-polar orientation and a non-zero in-plane polarization that can be terminated by a boundary, edge, or interface (, ) between the crystal and air (or another suitable material which causes the polarization to terminate at the boundary resulting in a charge at the boundary as a consequence of Gauss's Law). The boundaries\/edges\/interfaces ,  (as depicted in ) normally occur substantially perpendicular to the polar axis, but this is not a requirement. As depicted for example in , the material forming the boundary (such as air) is essentially an interruption in the normal crystal planes, effectively resulting in a material of a smaller or larger bandgap (such as air) that terminates the polarization at the boundary creating a polarization charge which results in an electric field across the segment. In addition to non-polar oriented crystal structure configurations where there is a non-zero in-plane electric polarization, the principles of the invention may be utilized with structures in which there is a projection of the c-axis on the growth plane, which is referred to as semi-polar oriented material; a representation of which is shown in .","In a preferred embodiment, a polar semiconductor grown on a substrate has a non-zero in-plane polarization that can be terminated by etching away the semiconductor material to form a semiconductor-air interface which can be, for example, in the form of bars as shown in . These bars can also be formed by selective growth of the bars on the substrate by, for example, masking certain areas to prevent growth in those areas. Assuming the segments or bars to be perpendicular to the in-plane projection of the polar axis, if this interface ( or ) occurs on an anion face, for example the gallium face of GaN, the interface will have a negative charge. If the interface ( or ) occurs on a cation face, for example the nitrogen face of GaN, it will have a positive charge. If one etches narrow bars of this material, these bars will therefore possess both positive and negative interfaces, leading to a strong internal electric field perpendicular to the bar axis. Moreover, if one etches a series of parallel bars, the internal electric fields in each bar will point in the same direction, as depicted in . When the distance \u201cd\u201d (see arrows in ) is very small, the electric field is determined by the piezoelectric and spontaneous polarizations in the material. However, as the bar width \u201cd\u201d becomes larger, for example, the field F across the bars decreases as F\u02dcEg\/(qd), where Eg is the bandgap of the semiconductor and q is the electron charge. In otherwords, the dimension of the bar is restricted as the voltage across the bar cannot be greater than the bandgap in electron volts of the material; otherwise tunneling from the valence band to the conduction band would occur that would screen the polarization charge and reduce the field. For most practical bar widths (>100 nm) the internal field can be as large as 100 kV\/cm in some materials without formation of metal contacts on the structure or application of a large external voltage. When illuminated with a \u02dc100 fs pulse with photon energy greater than Eg, carrier transport in these bars will generate THz radiation. Since the field in each bar lies in the same direction, the contribution of each bar to the total THz signal should be additive. This preferred embodiment device therefore enables one to generate broadband THz pulses with higher pulse energy than a standard photoconductive switch because it can support higher electric fields, and allows one to do so without metallization or application of high external voltage, while avoiding dielectric breakdown in the air.","Optionally, enhancement of the electric field may be achieved by growing another polar semiconductor material with different lattice constant atop the polar semiconductor material described above with respect to . The material of this additional layer may have a different lattice constant than the first semiconductor layer, and the thickness of this additional layer is limited by the critical thickness for strain relaxation. For example AlGaN on top of GaN, with the provision that the piezoelectric and spontaneous polarizations be additive. Although one additional layer has been described, more than one additional layer can be utilized without departing from the scope of the invention. Multiple layers could be desirable. When the bars are etched in this structure as described above, the built-in strain (as depicted by the symbol \u03b5) in the additional layer (or layers) will create a large internal piezoelectric field that adds to the polarization field in the added-on layer or layers.","The use of nonpolar growth directions to create in-plane spontaneous and piezoelectric polarizations that can be terminated at interfaces provided by etched bars to produce large in-plane internal electric fields in an array of contactless, photoconductive nanoswitches that create coherent additive THz fields under femtosecond pulse illumination is new and non-obvious. These novel structures allow one to replace the commonly used macro-photoconductive switches, which require metallization and application of large external voltages, to achieve THz emission when excited by femtosecond laser pulses.","In the embodiments of , the polar semiconductor could be wurtzite InN, GaN, AlN, or alloys thereof or ZnO, MgO, ZnS, ZnSe, ZnTe, or alloys thereof, with the nonpolar a-plane or m-plane as the growth plane. Semi polar wurtzite InN, GaN, AlN, or alloys thereof or ZnO, MgO, ZnS, ZnSe, ZnTe, or alloys thereof, with a projection of the c-axis (polar axis) in the growth plane can also be used. In , strained wurtzite InN, GaN, AlN, or alloys thereof, or ZnO, MgO, ZnS, ZnSe, ZnTe, or alloys thereof with a different lattice constant than the first wurtzite layer of InN, GaN, AlN, or alloy thereof, or ZnO, MgO, ZnS, ZnSe, ZnTe, or alloys thereof can be grown atop the first layer to create an additional piezoelectric field.","As depicted in , the polar semiconductor could also be zincblende GaAs, InAs, AlAs, InN, GaN, AlN, GaSb, AlSb, InSb or alloys thereof, with the nonpolar growth axis as the <110> direction, and, as depicted in , a strained layer of GaAs, InAs, AlAs, InN, GaN, AN, GaSb, AlSb, InSb or alloy thereof with a different lattice constant than the first layer grown atop this layer to create a piezoelectric field in the <111> direction when the polarization is terminated as etched bars. The polar direction in plane results in piezoelectric polarization being created in plane when bars are strained due to the lattice mismatch induced strain c depicted by the arrows in . The piezoelectric polarization Pis created as depicted by the representation of the bar in . Although rectangular bars are shown in  and , the invention is not limited to rectangular bars. Instead of rectangular, the configuration could be polygons, or any coplanar segment connected end-to-end to form a closed shape. In addition, the invention could be used with any curved closed shape; as long as there is a net polarization; where polarization is defined as a vector (i.e. the net polarization can be defined as pointing in a given direction). Because of the polarization fields, the photo excited carriers are accelerated and produce terahertz radiation (when illuminated by the laser).","The electric field is created by the polarization being terminated by creation of the material\/air interface, which occurs (in the case of ) at the edge\/boundary\/interface between the bars and the air, for example. Unlike the photoconductive switches, there is no voltage requirement as the electric field is built into (or created from) the structure.","The semiconductor material forming the segments  in  can be patterned using electron beam lithography for bars with widths as small as 100 nm. Standard dry and wet etching techniques can be used to create the segments . The most preferable excitation source is a low cost, compact, femtosecond fiber laser operating at either 1030 nm or 1560 nm (fundamental), or 515 nm or 780 nm (second harmonic).","The interfaces ,  at the boundary of the segment or bar that results in the termination of the polarization may be other than air (or a vacuum). Although air or a vacuum is preferred, the interface creating material can be another material that is not a conducting material. This can be achieved after etching, such as by regrowth of a non-conducting material. For example after growing the bars, a non-conducting material may be grown or deposited between the bars or segments .","It is possible that if the nonconducting material is also a polar material, and the polarization is stronger that the segment or bar material, then the added nonconducting polar material can also be used to generate terahertz emission.","The segments  can also be created spontaneously. One example is using stacking faults resulting from combining wurtzite and zinc blende material (which correlates to the additional material mentioned above), as described in detail in U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/435,797 entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Enhanced Terahertz Radiation from High Stacking Fault Density.\u201d","Although five segments , A and\/or B are shown in , it is desirable to have as many bars as possible. For example the segments , A and\/or B could number from one hundred to several thousand if a large amount of power is desired. As mentioned earlier, when the distance \u201cd\u201d is very small (as shown in ), the electric field is determined by the piezoelectric and spontaneous polarizations in the material. However, as the bar width \u201cd\u201d becomes larger, for example, the field F across the bars decreases as F\u02dcEg\/(qd), where Eg is the bandgap of the semiconductor and q is the electron charge. Therefore making the width of the bar or segment smaller is desirable.","Various Wurtzite or Hexagonal compounds can be utilized to form the crystal structure for segments , A and\/or B, such as, for example, GaN, InN, AlN and alloys thereof, ZnO, MgO, ZnS, ZnSe, ZnTe, and alloys thereof, and SiC.

The Zinc Blende compounds which could be utilized include zincblende GaAs, InAs, AlAs, GaN, InN, AlN, GaSb, AlSb, InSb or alloys thereof, ZnO, MgO, ZnS, ZnSe, ZnTe, and alloys thereof, and SiC. Various crystal structure methods of formation may be used to create the crystal structure, including molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), which are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. As illustrated in , for the greatest enhancement in THz radiation, the c-axis is in the plane of incidence and pointed along the +y direction (the x-y plane is shown in the left corner of , B), and detection of the THz radiation is in the p-wave direction.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 10","FIG. 10"],"b":["2","3"]},"The polar semiconductor could also be zincblende GaAs, InAs, AlAs, GaN, InN, AlN, GaSb, AlSb, InSb or alloys thereof, ZnO, MgO, ZnS, ZnSe, ZnTe, and alloys thereof, or SiC, with the nonpolar growth axis as the <110> direction, and a strained layer of GaAs, InAs, AlAs, GaN, InN, AlN, GaSb, AlSb, InSb or alloys thereof, ZnO, MgO, ZnS, ZnSe, ZnTe, and alloys thereof, or SiC or alloy thereof with a different lattice constant than the first layer grown atop this layer to create a piezoelectric field in the <111> direction when the polarization is terminated as etched bars.","Although the pump beam is shown in  as being at a wavelength of 266 nm, suitable for pumping the Galium Nitride example, it is only necessary that the wavelength of the pump beam correspond to a photon energy larger than the bandgap of the material being excited.","The plane of incidence is best understood by reference to  as the plane containing the laser propagated (incident) and THz propagated directional arrows. An exemplary configuration is shown in  that enables measurements via ultrafast optical excitation. In an additional example, a regenerative amplifier (RegA) system, which operates at 800 nm and has a repetition rate of 250 kHz, may be used as the ultrafast laser source L. The output of the RegA is split into two beams. For infrared excitation pulses, the stronger beam is frequency doubled to serve as the pump source for an optical parametric amplifier (OPA), which generates an infrared idler pulse tunable from \u02dc0.9-2.4 micrometers. The OPA also produces a visible signal beam tunable from \u02dc480-720 nm. The signal beam at 700 nm is doubled for 350 nm excitation. For other ultraviolet pulses, the stronger RegA beam is frequency doubled (400 nm) or tripled (266 nm). The pump pulse, after compression with a prism pair to typical pulse widths of \u02dc150 fs, is focused onto the semiconductor sample at a 45\u00b0 incidence angle with a beam diameter of \u02dc1 mm. The pump power is \u02dc4 mW for all excitation wavelengths. The weaker RegA split-off beam is used to probe the THz emission for all excitation wavelengths, as well as to irradiate the samples at 800 nm. The subsequent THz emission from the semiconductor surface is collected and focused with a pair of off-axis parabolic mirrors () onto a 2 mm-thick ZnTe crystal () for electro-optic (EO) sampling, which is based on the linear EO effect or Pockels effect and allows for coherent detection of freely propagating THz emission. The THz radiation incident on the EO crystal alters the birefringence of the crystal which results in a phase retardation of the probe beam through the EO crystal. Monitoring of the phase retardation of the probe beam is conducted with a balanced detector system.","The detection is a known electro optic sampling technique for detecting Terahertz emission. The configurations shown in , , , and  use both a probe beam and a pump beam. Specifically, a reflector , which may be for example, a pellicle or thin membrane, reflects the probe beam and transmits terahertz radiation. The quarter wave plate  results in the linearly polarized incident probe beam becoming circularly polarized. The circularly polarized probe beam is then split by the Wollaston prism  which breaks up the vertically and horizontally polarized components of the probe beam spatially. The difference signal between the vertically and horizontally polarized components is detected using a balanced detector. When no terahertz emission is present, the balanced detector measures no signal. When terahertz emission is produced, the circularly polarized probe beam becomes elliptically polarized. For an elliptically polarized probe beam, one polarization component has a stronger amplitude and the balanced detector , indicates the difference between each; i.e., the Wollaston Prism effectively breaks the beam into two orthogonal polarizations, and because the elliptically polarized probe light has two unequal components due to the Terahertz emission, the subtraction results in measurement of the Terahertz emission.

No. 12\/435,797. In-plane transport of photoexcited carriers proceeds parallel to the electric field, leading to the THz radiation polarized preferentially along this axis of the sample. This mechanism provided the 360 degree oscillatory component of the THz amplitude as a function of sample angle. Rotating the c-axis by 180 degrees also rotates the direction of the built-in field by 180 degrees and causes the photoexcited carriers to accelerate in the opposite direction. A reversal of the photoexcited carrier acceleration direction is observed as a flip in the THz waveform polarity, as seen in the THz signal from the high SF density m-plane GaN depicted in . The sin\u00d8 dependence of and 90\u00b0 shift between the p-and s-polarization curves (inset in ) indicates that the linearly polarized THz emission associated with in-plane carrier transport rotates with sample rotation.

As observed in the inset of , the terahertz signal exhibits a substantially 360\u00b0 periodicity with sample rotation and a polarity flip when the c-axis is rotated by 180\u00b0, characteristic of real carrier transport in an in-plane electric field parallel to the c-axis induced by stacking fault-terminated internal polarization at wurtzite domain boundaries.

The high fields within the wurtzite domains terminated by the stacking faults substantially point in the same direction, effectively creating an array of contactless PC switches that could significantly enhance THz emission from semiconductor surfaces under ultra short pulse excitation.","In accordance with the invention described in U.S. application Ser.
