title: Event-based health activity tracking with icon-based user interface
abstract: A health activity plan may be prescribed for an individual comprising a set of health activity instances (e.g., physical therapy exercises, an exercise regimen, or a wound management program.) The performed health activity instances of the individual may be tracked by a device, and may be presented to a user of the device in correlation with the health activity plan (e.g., to demonstrate compliance of the individual with the health activity plan.) The health activity information may be presented using a set of icons that depict the health activity information, which may improve an easier understanding and a more consistent communication of health activity information among the individual and healthcare providers.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Within the field of computing, many scenarios involve a tracking of health activities of an individual. As a first example, a user may choose to follow a particular health regimen, such as an exercise plan or a dietary supplement plan, and may use a calendar or journal to record a set of activities that the individual has performed in accordance with this regimen. As a second example, a physician may prescribe a set of health activities, e.g., a set of physical therapy exercises to be performed by an individual, and a second healthcare provider of the individual, such as a physical therapist, may observe the performance of the exercises by the individual and record such observations in a database (e.g., as part of the individual's electronic medical record.) As a third example, a device provided to an individual may be configured to record a set of health-related activities performed by the individual, such as the changing of a bandage or a self-performed examination of a health condition. In these and other scenarios, one or more computer systems may be used to detect, record, and report the individual's performance of the health activities.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Within the scenarios described herein and similar scenarios, some disadvantages may arise in particular configurations of computer systems used to track the performance of health activities of an individual. As one such drawback, the computer system may not be programmed with the regimen to which the performed activities relate. As a first example, the individual may record exercise activities in an electronic calendar, but no indication may be computable as to the conformity of the recorded activities with the anticipated exercise regimen of the individual. As a second example, a healthcare provider may describe a prescribed health regimen for the individual in one form (e.g., in an electronic medical record), but this entry may be described in natural language, prose, or another form that is not easily correlated in an automated manner with records of the performance of these activities by the individual, thereby necessitating the involvement of a human to evaluate the disjointed records to determine the conformity of the individual with the health regimen. As a second such drawback, the computer system may not be configured to communicate with the individual (as well as one or more healthcare providers involved in the care of the individual) in a convenient manner. For example, the records of the individual's performance of the activities might be displayed as a set of recorded metrics or prosaic descriptions that may be difficult for some users of the computer system to understand. Additionally, it may be difficult to communicate such information among a set of users, such as healthcare providers and the individual, if one or more users speak different languages or have low rates of literacy or understanding of technical terminology.","Presented herein is an alternative technique for configuring an activity tracking system to detect, record, and report the health activities of an individual that may present particular advantages with respect to conventional systems. An activity tracking system may be configured to store in memory a health activity plan, comprising a set of prescribed health activity instances of one or more health activity types that are to be performed by the individual. The activity tracking system may then be configured to receive notifications of a performance of a health activity instance of the individual, and to store in memory a record indicating the performance of the health activity instance of a health activity type. Moreover, when the activity tracking system is requested to present a report of the health activities of the individual, the activity tracking system may present to the user the set of health activity instances in at least two distinctive ways. As a first example, the health activity instances may be correlated with the prescribed health activity instances to illustrate the conformity of the individual's activities with the prescribed activity plan. As a second example, the performed health activity instances may be presented as icons selected from an icon set, where such icons depicting the performed health activity instances of particular health activity types. This presentation may promote the communication of health activity information in a more readily and commonly understandable manner, regardless of the language proficiencies or language differences of the various users of the activity tracking system. Moreover, the icon set may be standardized across a set of health-related system (e.g., the individual's electronic medical record, medication reminder devices, and service tracking devices provided to healthcare providers of the individual) to present a more consistent communications mechanism that may facilitate cognition, reduce errors, and promote the quality of healthcare for the individual.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects, advantages, and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.","The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident, however, that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.","The present disclosure relates to the recording and presentation of health activities that may be performed by an individual, such as stretching exercises comprising a physical therapy regimen, workout activities in an exercise routine or weight-training program, the changing of a bandage or wound dressing, or a self-performed examination. In these and other scenarios, a health activity plan may be prescribed for or adopted by an individual, and the individual may be committed to performing such activities. The health activity plan may comprise a set of prescribed health activity types (e.g., one or more particular physical therapy exercises), each of which is to be performed as one or more health activity instances, e.g., as occasions on which such health activity types are to be performed.","In these scenarios, it may be helpful to facilitate the individual in performing and tracking the performance of the health activities. As a first example, it may be helpful to display the health activity plan in a convenient manner, such as a calendar format, in order to assist the individual in planning to perform the health activity instances. As a second example, reminders may be rendered to prompt the individual in performing a prescribed health activity instance in order to promote compliance. As a third example, annotations of the health activity to be performed, such as textual or spoken explanations of the health activity type or illustrative diagrams or video, may be presented to the individual to facilitate the correct and complete performance of the health activities. As a fourth example, various details of the performance of the health activity may be recorded, such as detected indications of the correct performance of the health activity and annotations by the individual describing the health activity instance. As a fifth example, the historic record of the performance of the health activities may be presented and analyzed in various ways, such as to demonstrate the progress of the individual in a physical therapy regimen or exercise routine or to measure the compliance of the individual with the health activity plan.","Many techniques may be devised to promote and track the performance by the individual of the health activities comprising the health activity plan. However, one significant challenge in many such techniques is the convenient and consistent presentation of information. As a first example, the individual may have difficulty understanding a textual description of the health activity plan, e.g., textual names of activities prescribed by a healthcare provider, and may perform such activities in ways or instances different than prescribed. As a second example, the recordings of such information by an individual or device might be difficult to interpret by a healthcare provider, e.g., if inconsistent terminology is used or if information is presented as numeric data that is not easily evaluated by a healthcare provider. As a third example, the healthcare provider(s) and the individual may communicate in different languages, at different levels of technical complexity, or with different terminology drawn from various fields of health sciences, and the language differences may contribute to a divergence of the individual from the health activity plan or an incorrect evaluation of the record of the performed health activity instances. As a fourth example, different devices or systems may present information in different formats or with different communicative interfaces, and even if such formats and interfaces are cognizable and convenient, the differences may lead to confusion, misunderstandings, inconsistent record keeping, or avoidable complexity in the presentation of the health activity information to the individual and healthcare providers. These difficulties may be exacerbated with a larger set of concurrently or sequentially involved healthcare providers, with additional or dynamic health-related information systems, and with the complexity of the health activity plan prescribed for the individual.","One technique for alleviating these complications involves a consistent presentation of health activity information to the individual. As one example, health information system may incorporate and utilize a set of icons that, when used in isolation or in combination, depict some concepts relating to the health activity plan, such as the health activity types and various descriptors of performed health activities (e.g., the proficiency with which a particular health activity was performed during a particular health activity instance.) The health information system may communicate with the individual and healthcare providers through the presentation of such icons, which may promote the consistent understanding of the health activity plan and the record of the performed health activity instances. Moreover, a standardized icon set may be devised and incorporated by a large and disparate set of such health information systems. This adoption may promote a consistent presentation of the health activity information in a variety of contexts related to respective health information systems, and may promote the compliance of the individual with the health activity plan.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","18","14","16","12","12","14","22","14","18","18","20","18","20","12","22","14","12","22","20","22","22","14","16","20","16","20","16","12","22","24","22","22","26","20","16","16","16","20","28","12","16","14","16","22","20","14","12"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["30","12","30","32","34","58","36","38","40","30","42"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["64","12","64","22","56","54","60","58","52","12","12","64","64","14","64","66","14","64","68","54","62","64","52","22","56","62","20","14","64","14","12","14","52"]},"The techniques discussed herein may be devised with variations in many aspects, and some variations may present additional advantages and\/or reduce disadvantages with respect to other variations of these and other techniques. Moreover, some variations may be implemented in combination, and some combinations may feature additional advantages and\/or reduced disadvantages through synergistic cooperation. The variations may be incorporated in various embodiments (e.g., the exemplary method #R of  and the exemplary system  of ) to confer individual and\/or synergistic advantages upon such embodiments.","A first aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the architecture of embodiments thereof. A first exemplary architecture is illustrated in  as an exemplary system , which may be implemented, e.g., as a set of instructions configured to, when executed on a processor , cause the processor  to perform the techniques discussed herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["22","14","16","14","16","14","82","82","84","86","12","82","82","82","82","86","82","86","22","90","82","88","90","90","12","90","86","20","18","86","16","22","14","12"]},"Still another architecture wherein these techniques may be implemented involves a computer-readable medium comprising processor-executable instructions configured to apply the techniques presented herein. An exemplary computer-readable medium that may be devised in these ways is illustrated in , wherein the implementation  comprises a computer-readable medium  (e.g., a CD-R, DVD-R, or a platter of a hard disk drive), on which is encoded computer-readable data . This computer-readable data  in turn comprises a set of computer instructions  configured to operate according to the principles set forth herein. In one such embodiment, the processor-executable instructions  may be configured to perform a method of tracking health activities prescribed for and performed by an individual, such as the exemplary method  of . In another such embodiment, the processor-executable instructions  may be configured to implement a system for tracking health activities prescribed for and performed by an individual, such as the exemplary system  of . Many such architectures may be devised by those of ordinary skill in the art that are configured to operate in accordance with the techniques presented herein.","A second aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the manner of defining the health activity plan  of the individual . As a first variation, the health activity plan  may be represented as a data set that is loaded onto the device  through a communications component, such as a network adapter that is capable of receiving a transmission of the data set from another device or computer, or a memory reader that is capable of reading a removable media item (e.g., a flash memory device) onto which the data set is loaded. As a second variation, the health activity plan  may be generated on the device  by a user  of the device  (such as the individual  or a healthcare provider of the individual .) In one such embodiment, the instructions comprising an embodiment of these techniques may be configured to receive the health activity plan  by displaying for the user  icons  selected from the icon store  and depicting health activity types that may be prescribed for the individual . The health activity plan may then be stored by, upon receiving a selection by the user  of at least one icon  (e.g., as detected by the input component ), storing in the memory  a prescribed health activity instance  of the health activity type  represented by the selected icon . Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many techniques for storing the health activity plan in the memory  while implementing the techniques discussed herein.","A third aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the receiving of notifications that the individual  has performed a health activity instance. As a first variation, the input component  may be configured to receive the notification of the performed health activity instance from the user  (e.g., from the individual  or from a healthcare provider of the individual  who observes and can report on the performance of the health activity, such as a physical therapist.) In one such embodiment, an input component  may be configured to receive the notification of the performed health activity instance by displaying for the user  (e.g., on the display component ) at least one icon  selected from the icon store and depicting the health activities that may be performed by the individual , and by receiving from the user  a selection of at least one icon . Alternatively or additionally, the input component  may be configured to receive the notification from at least one detector configured to detect performances of the prescribed health activity instances by the individual . For example, a running shoe may be configured to detect the performance of a running exercise, and to report the detected performance to the exemplary system  of  for recording in the memory  as a performed health activity instance. Alternatively or additionally, other types of information may be received and included in the performed health activity record . For example, the input component  may receive (e.g., from the user  or a detector) at least one performed health activity instance descriptor that described the performed health activity instance, such as the performed health activity type, the time of the performed health activity instance, a proficiency of the performed health activity instance, an at least partial recording of the performed health activity instance, and\/or an annotation received from the user  and describing the performed health activity instance.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["110","114","12","112","110","112","12","114","12","114","12","112","12","114","116","12","116","12","22","26","12","20","18"]},"A fourth aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to a configuration of the embodiment as a reminder device, e.g., as a device capable of generating notifications for the user of health activity instances to be performed. For example, an embodiment may be configured to, before an imminent prescribed health activity instance, notify the user  and\/or the individual  by presenting on the display component  an icon  selected from the icon store  and depicting the health activity type of the imminent prescribed health activity instance (such as illustrated in .) This presentation may be augmented by other notification techniques, e.g., a vibration or audio device that generates a tactile or audible alarm, or a communications device configured to send email or another form of electronic message to the individual  and\/or user .","A fifth aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the displaying of the health activity plan , including the performed health activity instances that are depicted using icons . As a first variation, if the health activities are prescribed for the individual  in relation to a particular health condition (e.g., an injury such as a muscle strain or tear that results in a prescription of a physical therapy regimen), the health condition may be presented (e.g., on the display component ) along with the performed health activities relating thereto. For example, if the icon store comprises at least one health condition icon depicting the at least one health condition, then the presenting may, for respective health conditions, include a health condition icon selected from the icon store and depicting the health condition, and may present with the health condition icon the performed health activity instances prescribed in relation to the health condition. As a second variation, if an embodiment stores in the memory  one or more performed health activity instance descriptors, then when the health activity instance is presented on a display component , one or more performed health activity instance descriptors may be presented in correlation with the respective icon  to further describe the performed health activity instance. As a third variation, an embodiment may be capable of presenting to the user  a representation of future prescribed health activity instances, e.g., a calendar of upcoming health activity instances to be performed by the individual  (such as illustrated in .) For example, upon receiving from the user  a request to present future prescribed health activity instances, an embodiment of these techniques may present on the display component , for respective future prescribed health activity instances, an icon  selected from the icon store  and depicting the health activity type of the future prescribed health activity instance. Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many presentations of the health activity plan  and associated information while implementing the techniques discussed herein.","A sixth aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to additional capabilities that may be incorporated in embodiments of these techniques, and that may relate to the tracking of the performed health activity instances and the presentation thereof. As a first variation, an embodiment may be configured to compute a health activity plan compliance rating of the individual  based on correlations of the prescribed health activity instances to the performed health activity instances. The device may therefore display, along with the presented icons , a compliance rating indicator representing the health activity plan compliance rating. For example, the user may receive an \u201cA\u201d grade for fulfilling many of the prescribed health activities with high proficiency; a \u201cB\u201d grade for fulfilling many of the prescribed health activities with modest proficiency; and a \u201cC\u201d grade for fulfilling only some of the prescribed health activities. As a second variation, an embodiment may be configured to compute a proficiency trend among performed health activity instances of a health activity type (e.g., whether the individual  is improving in the performance of a particular health activity, such as increasing flexibility achieved through a particular stretching exercise, or whether the individual  is not making progress.) The embodiment may therefore present on the display component  a proficiency trend indicator representing the proficiency trend among performed health activity instances of the health activity type (e.g., an upward arrow indicating an improving trend, a horizontal arrow indicating a lack of progress, or a downward arrow indicating a declining trend.) As a third variation, if the health activity plan relates to at least one health condition (e.g., a muscle strain or tear prompting the prescription of a physical therapy regimen), an embodiment may be configured to correlate performed health activity instances with at least one health condition for which the performed health activity instance was prescribed, and to compute a health condition rating of the health condition based on the correlated performed health activity instances (e.g., an indication of whether the health condition of the individual  is improving or worsening, based on the performance of the health activities.) The presenting may therefore include a presentation of a health condition rating indicator representing the health condition rating of the health condition. As a fourth variation, where the health activities are prescribed for the individual  by a healthcare provider, an embodiment may be configured to, upon receiving the notification of a performed health activity instance, send the notification to the healthcare provider, e.g., as a record of the compliance of the individual  with the health activity plan . This sending may be achieved, e.g., through the inclusion of a network device that may send an email or other electronic message over a network to the healthcare provider or a health information system utilized thereby. Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many additional features that may be included in embodiments of these techniques.","Although the subject matter has been described in language specific to structural features and\/or methodological acts, it is to be understood that the subject matter defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the specific features or acts described above.
