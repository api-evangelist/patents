Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to metal nanowires from which a transparent low-resistance conductive layer can be formed without the aid of antioxidants, a method for producing the metal nanowires, and an aqueous dispersion thereof.","2. Description of the Related Art","As a method for producing an aqueous dispersion of metal nanowires with a long-axis length of 1 \u03bcm or more and a short-axis length of 100 nm or less, a method is proposed in which a polyol dispersion of silver nanowire is prepared by a polyol process, and a solvent contained in the polyol dispersion is substituted with water through centrifugation to thereby produce an aqueous dispersion of metal nanowires (see U.S. Published Patent Application No.2005\/0056118 and U.S. Published Patent Application No. 2007\/0074316).","Furthermore, U.S. Published Patent Application No. 2007\/0074316 and Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) No. 2004-196923 propose a transparent conductor made of metal nanowires. In practical use of metal nanowires, the resistance is disadvantageously increased because of oxidation of Ag. In order to prevent the increase of the resistance, an antioxidant is added to metal nanowires or an overcoat layer is applied on metal nanowires. However, since the antioxidants or the overcoat layers used in the above-mentioned metal nanowires are not conductive and their effects do not last permanently because their materials are organic substances, further improvements of metal nanowires are desired at present.","An object of the present invention is to provide metal nanowires whose transparency and conductivity can be maintained and from which a transparent conductor can be formed, a method for producing the metal nanowires, and an aqueous dispersion of the metal nanowires which is capable of improving its storage stability and dispersion stability after applied coat.","Measures for solving the above problems are as follows:","<1> Metal nanowires including at least silver, and a metal other than silver, wherein the metal other than silver has a standard electrode potential more positive than the standard electrode potential of silver, and the metal nanowires have a long-axis length of 1 \u03bcm or more and a short-axis length of 300 nm or less.","<2> The metal nanowires according to the item <1>, wherein the amount of the metal other than silver in the metal nanowires is 0.5 atomic % to 30 atomic % to the amount of the silver.","<3> The metal nanowires according to the item <1>, wherein the metal other than silver is at least one selected from the group consisting of gold, palladium, iridium, platinum, and osmium.","<4> A method for producing metal nanowires, including at least adding an aqueous solution of a salt of a metal other than silver to an aqueous dispersion of silver nanowires to initiate an oxidation-reduction reaction, and desalting the reaction product, wherein the metal nanowires include at least silver, and a metal other than silver, and wherein the metal other than silver has a standard electrode potential more positive than the standard electrode potential of silver, and the metal nanowires have a long-axis length of 1 \u03bcm or more and a short-axis length of 300 nm or less.","<5> The method for producing metal nanowires according to the item <4>, wherein the metal other than silver is produced through reduction by silver.","<6> An aqueous dispersion including at least metal nanowires, wherein the metal nanowires comprise silver, and a metal other than silver, the metal other than silver has a standard electrode potential more positive than the standard electrode potential of silver, and the metal nanowires have a long-axis length of 1 \u03bcm or more and a short-axis length of 300 nm or less.","<7> The aqueous dispersion according to the item <6>, wherein the metal nanowires contain metal nanowires whose long-axis length is 10 \u03bcm or more in an amount of 0.01% by mass or more.","<8> A transparent conductor including at least a transparent conductive layer which is formed by an aqueous dispersion which includes metal nanowires, wherein the metal nanowires contain silver, and a metal other than silver, the metal other than silver has a standard electrode potential more positive than the standard electrode potential of silver, and the metal nanowires have a long-axis length of 1 \u03bcm or more and a short-axis length of 300 nm or less.","According to the present invention, the problems of the prior arts can be solved, while metal nanowires whose transparency and conductivity can be maintained and from which a transparent conductor can be formed, a method for producing the metal nanowires, an aqueous dispersion of the metal nanowires which is capable of improving its storage stability and dispersion stability after applied coat, and a transparent conductor can be provided.","(Metal Nanowires)","Metal nanowires of the present invention include silver and a metal other than silver which has a standard electrode potential that is more positive than the standard electrode potential of silver.","The metal nanowires have a long-axis length of 1 \u03bcm or more and a short-axis length of 300 nm or less.","The shape of each metal nanowire is not particularly limited, can be appropriately selected depending on the purpose, and may be any shape such as a cylindrical columnar shape, a rectangular parallelepiped shape, or a columnar shape with a polygonal cross-section.","The long-axis length of the metal nanowires is 1 \u03bcm or more, preferably 5 \u03bcm or more, and more preferably 10 \u03bcm or more. The short-axis length of the metal nanowires is 300 nm or less, preferably 250 nm or less, and more preferably 200 nm or less. When the long-axis length of the metal nanowires is less than 1 \u03bcm, a transparent conductor, which is produced by applying an aqueous dispersion of the metal nanowires, may experience poor conduction due to a reduction in the number of junction points between metal elements, resulting in high resistance. Meanwhile, when the short-axis length of the metal nanowires is more than 300 nm, the transparent conductor disadvantageously shows conspicuous haze due to light scattering and becomes opaque, though the conductivity and storage stability of the transparent conductor are primarily improved.","The mean long-axis length and the mean short-axis length of the metal nanowires can be measured, for example, by a transmission electron microscope (TEM).","A metal other than silver, which forms the metal nanowires, is not particularly limited and can be appropriately selected depending on the purpose, so long as the metal other than silver has a standard electrode potential more positive than the standard electrode potential of silver; examples thereof include gold, palladium, iridium, platinum, and osmium. Among these, palladium, iridium, gold, and platinum are particularly preferred. The standard electrode potentials of the metals can be referred to those described in \u201c5 (Manual for Chemistry 5th edition (revised), Basic II), pp. 581 to 584\u201d. Since the standard electrode potential differs even among the compounds containing the same metal depending on the types of the compounds and coexisting chemical species, an appropriate standard electrode potential can be chosen and used depending on the metal species.","In terms of conductivity and dispersion stability, the amount of the metal other than silver in the metal nanowires is preferably 0.5 atomic % to 30 atomic %, and more preferably 1.0 atomic % to 25 atomic % to the amount of silver. When the amount of the metal other than silver is more than 30 atomic %, reduction of conductivity, or degradation of transparency of the resulting conductor may occur. When the amount of the metal other than silver is less than 0.5 atomic %, storage stability may be disadvantageously degraded.","The amount of each metal atom in the metal nanowires can be measured, for example, by applying inductively coupled plasma (ICP) to samples that have been dissolved in an acid.","The composition of the metal other than silver is not particularly limited and can be appropriately selected depending on the purpose; examples thereof include simple substances, oxides, inorganic salts described later, and organic compounds formed from the metal and an organic acid (or a salt of an organic acid).","A metal other than silver may be contained in a metal nanowire or may cover a metal nanowire. More preferably, a metal other than silver covers a metal nanowire. When a metal nanowire is covered by a metal other than silver, the metal other than silver does not necessary cover the entire surface of the core silver or core silver alloy of the metal nanowire but a portion of them.","In the present invention, the mean wire sizes (i.e. the long-axis length and the short-axis length) of the metal nanowires and the amount of a metal other than silver in the metal nanowires can be controlled by appropriately selecting the concentrations of metal salts, inorganic salts, and organic acids (or salts thereof); the type of a solvent for particle formation; the concentration of a reducing agent; the addition rate of each reagent; and the temperature, which are specified in the \u201cproduction method of the metal nanowires\u201d described below.","(Production Method of Metal Nanowires)","A method for producing metal nanowires of the present invention is a method for producing the metal nanowires of the present invention, and includes at least adding an aqueous solution of a salt of a metal other than silver to an aqueous dispersion of silver nanowires to initiate an oxidation-reduction reaction, and further desalting the reaction product.","Preferably, a metal other than silver is produced through reduction by silver.","The reduction reaction is carried out by heating a solvent in which the silver nanowires and a salt of a metal other than silver are contained. In the heated solution, the salt of a metal other than silver is reduced by silver. Furthermore, a photoreduction process, a process for adding a reducing agent, and a chemical reduction process may be appropriately used in combination with the above reduction process depending on the purpose.","The solvent can be heated using an oil bath, aluminum block heater, hot plate, oven, infrared heater, heat roller, steam (hot air), ultrasonic wave, or microwave, etc. The heating temperature is preferably 35\u00b0 C. to 200\u00b0 C., and more preferably 45\u00b0 C. to 180\u00b0 C.","Examples of the photoreduction process include process exposing the solvent to ultraviolet ray, visible light, electron beam, and infrared ray.","Examples of the reducing agent used in the process for adding a reducing agent include hydrogen gas, sodium borohydride, lithium borohydride, hydrazine, ascorbic acid, amines, thiols, and polyols.

These may be used alone or in combination. Particularly, organic carboxylic acids and salts thereof are preferred.","Examples of the organic acid salts include alkali metal-organic acid salts and organic acid-ammonium salts, with organic acid-ammonium salts being particularly preferred.","The aqueous dispersion preferably contains the organic acid or a salt thereof in an amount of 0.01% by mass to 10% by mass, more preferably 0.05% by mass to 5% by mass, relative to the total solid content thereof. When the content is less than 0.01% by mass, the dispersion stability may be degraded; whereas when the content is more than 10% by mass, the conductivity and durability may be decreased.","The organic acid (or a salt thereof) content can be measured through, for example, thermogravimetry (TG).","An aqueous solution of a salt of a metal other than silver may contain a water-miscible organic solvent described later.","After the metal nanowires are formed, the desalting treatment can be carried out using such techniques as ultrafiltration, dialysis, gel filtration, decantation, and centrifugation.","(Aqueous Dispersion)","An aqueous dispersion of the present invention contains the metal nanowires of the present invention in the dispersion solvent.","The amount of the metal nanowires of the present invention in the aqueous dispersion is preferably 0.1% by mass to 99% by mass, and more preferably 0.3% by mass to 95% by mass. When the amount of the metal nanowires in the aqueous dispersion is less than 0.1% by mass, an excessive amount of load is applied on the metal nanowires in drying during the production process. When the amount of the metal nanowires in the aqueous dispersion is more than 99% by mass, particles may be readily aggregated.","In this case it is particularly preferable for the aqueous dispersion to include metal nanowires having a long-axis length of 10 \u03bcm or more in an amount of 0.01% by mass or more, and more preferably in an amount of 0.05% by mass or more, in terms of achieving both excellent transparency and conductivity, thereby the conductivity of the resulting conductor can be increased with a smaller amount of applied coat thereof.","The dispersion solvent for forming the aqueous dispersion of the present invention is mostly water.
