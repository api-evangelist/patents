Field of the Invention","The present invention is directed to intelligently cycling power to a wireless modem in accordance with operating conditions or observations of the wireless modem.","2. Description of the Related Art","Wireless modems may be thought of as simplified cell phones, or cell phones without a user interface. A wireless modem is a component of a cell phone, but also can and does exist independently of a cell phone. Firmware written for wireless modems that allows external entities (such as computer software) to control the modems is not robust and is prone to failures that can cause the modems to become unresponsive to commands. A wireless modem's connection to a wireless infrastructure often breaks down (e.g., \u201cdropouts\u201d, lost connections, etc.). When this happens, a wireless modem's firmware can malfunction, rendering the modem unresponsive. Wireless modems often are released with minimal testing, and the firmware problems are not fixed. Because of the firmware problems, wireless modems that are continuously powered are prone to become non-responsive.","These wireless modem problems have limited how they are used, particularly for testing a wireless modem's wireless network. To avoid instability, wireless modems have been supplied with power on a per-test basis. Typically, power to a wireless modem is supplied to the modem for the duration of a test. For example, when testing wireless communication through a wireless modem, a discrete network test will begin with powering on the wireless modem. The test will be conducted and the modem will be powered off when the test is complete. Extended-use instability has prevented extended-use wireless testing, and modems have not been kept connected or powered on between tests.","What is needed is a system for increasing the availability and usability of a wireless modem by observing or monitoring the state of the wireless modem and cycling power to the modem as necessary, based on the observing or monitoring.","It is an aspect of the present invention to provide a system for controlling supply of power to a wireless modem based on the operability of the wireless modem.","It is another aspect of the present invention to provide a system cycling power to a wireless modem when attempts to communicate with the wireless modem have failed.","It is yet another aspect of the present invention to cycle power to a wireless modem when attempts to establish communication with the wireless modem have failed.","It is still another aspect of the present invention to cycle power to a wireless modem when the wireless modem cannot sustain or obtain a baud rate.","It is another aspect of the present invention to provide a system cycling power to a wireless modem when a communication path or link using the modem has failed.","It is another aspect of the present invention to provide a system cycling power to a wireless modem when the wireless modem supplies an application with erroneous or unexpected data.","It is another aspect of the present invention to provide a system cycling power to a wireless modem based on errors of an operating system that is providing application access to the wireless modem.","The above aspects can be attained by a system that monitors the status of a wireless modem and in response to a determination that the wireless modem is not functioning properly, the system automatically cycles power to the wireless modem. The system can be implemented with any arrangement by which a computer can automatically control the supply of power to a wireless modem.","More specifically, the above aspects can be obtained by a system that initiates a connection to a wireless network using a wireless modem, where the system maintains the connection to the wireless network even when the wireless modem becomes idle. The system determines that there is a problem using the wireless modem by passively or actively monitoring the status of the wireless modem. In response to a determination that there is a problem using the wireless modem, the system automatically cycles power to the wireless modem and again initiates a connection to the wireless network using the wireless modem.","The system may also be implemented by an apparatus having a power control device with a power outlet and a first communication interface receiving power control commands. The control device controls power to the power outlet according to the received power control commands. A wireless modem is coupled to the power control device. A controlling device has a second communication interface through which the controlling device monitors the status of the wireless modem device. The controlling device also has a third communication interface through which the controlling device sends power control commands to the power control device.","There are many possible bases for determining that there is a problem with the wireless modem under test, including, for example, failures to connect to the modem's wireless network, failures to read or write to the modem, unexpected or erroneous data read from the modem, etc.","These together with other aspects and advantages which will be subsequently apparent, reside in the details of construction and operation as more fully hereinafter described and claimed, reference being had to the accompanying drawings forming a part hereof, wherein like numerals refer to like parts throughout.","Wireless networks benefit from automated testing.  shows a wireless network testing system. A wireless modem  is controlled and used over an RS 232 line by a computing device , which uses the wireless modem  to communicate with or across a wireless network . Typically, the computing device  has an operating system, which provides an application programming interface (API) serving as a control layer through which the computing device  controls and accesses the wireless modem . In one embodiment, the computing device  conducts various tests relating to the network . Such a wireless network testing system may actively or passively monitor and test the wireless network, possibly at different network layers or levels.","A wireless network testing system uses wireless modems to communicate over the wireless network. However, wireless modems\u2014in effect simplified cell phones\u2014are inherently unstable. This instability has discouraged extended testing and has led to the design of testing systems with hardwired or unconditional power cycling.  shows a typical use of power cycling. When a discrete test begins , a wireless modem is powered on , a connection is initiated , a test is performed  and concluded , and then the wireless modem is powered off .","Extended use of wireless modems (extended testing, for example) with continuously connected or powered modems has not previously been performed. To avoid the likelihood of modem failure, wireless modems have been powered on only for a short time, and then powered off when no longer needed. Previously, modem failures have been manually corrected by manually cycling power (turning the wireless modem off and on, and removing the modem's battery pack, if it has one, for several seconds).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["130","132","130","134","132","134","136","134","132"]},"The power cycle device  generally will have one or more power sockets or outlets (not shown), through which it switchably supplies power. The supply of power at a socket or outlet may be individually turned on or turned off by the power cycle device . The power to a socket is switched or controlled by the power cycle device  in accordance with commands or control signals received by the power cycle device  over a communication interface, such as an RS 232 interface connected to the RS 232 link. The commands or control signals may be issued from a controlling device, such as computing device . Typical commands are \u201cturn power on\u201d, and \u201cturn power off\u201d, and also perhaps \u201ccycle power\u201d (turn power off and back on).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["134","130","140","142","134","142","134","134","144","146","134","146","132","130","132","134","132","134","134"]},"Typically, the wireless modem  is determined or deemed to be non-responsive  based on error codes returned from calls to an operating system resource associated with the wireless modem , or by failure of the wireless modem to respond to such calls. For example, an operating system resource such as a port is opened for accessing the wireless modem . If a system call to read from or write to the port associated with the wireless modem  returns an error code that is in a designated set of error codes, then the modem is deemed not responsive  and the modem is power cycled . If Microsoft Windows\/2000\u00ae is the operating system, exemplary error codes are error numbers  and .","A specified number of failed attempts to communicate with the modem  may be used as a basis for determining that the wireless modem  is non-responsive . Even if the application (or operating system) is able to communicate with the modem , the modem  may not be able to establish communication with a target device on or across the wireless network. A number of such failures may also indicate a non-responsive  modem . Failure to achieve or sustain a required or specific baud rate may also indicate an erroneous or non-responsive  wireless modem .","It is also possible that the wireless modem  may positively respond to system requests and yet be in a corrupt state . That is to say, a call to read from a port assigned to the wireless modem  may return a code indicating a successful read of data from the modem , yet the wireless  modem may be in an error state of the type that causes it to corrupt or incorrectly supply the data it is receiving from the wireless network. For example, the wireless modem  may have begun incorrectly decoding or otherwise processing received data. Therefore, even if the wireless modem  is not deemed to be non-responsive , it is preferable to check the data or content being read from the wireless modem . Various tests may be used to identify corrupt content , including, for example, comparing the data to a checksum, determining if the data has unusual or unexpected patterns such as long strings of null (0), comparing the data to expected formats or protocol layouts (e.g. a number is expected but not found in a particular position of read data), determining if an expected amount of data was read, etc. If it is determined that data read from the responsive (but possibly unstable) wireless modem  is corrupt or erroneous , then the wireless modem  is power cycled .","In general, any condition that may indicate a problem with a wireless modem may be used as a basis for resetting or power cycling the wireless modem. Other examples are unusually fast or slow response times. Furthermore, although active test conditions have been described, passive test conditions may also be used. For example, error interrupts may be generated by the operating system or by communication software used to communicate with the wireless modem .","Regardless of what conditions are used to indicate a problem with a wireless modem, the present invention may be said to intelligently cycle power to wireless modems; cycling depends on conditions as they occur rather than unconditionally. This allows a wireless modem to be treated as though it were any other stable network device or interface. Other than power cycling, no special treatment is generally necessary for a properly functioning wireless modem.","If a wireless modem enters an error state or begins to function improperly, then in response the wireless modem may be power cycled. This allows the wireless modem to be used for extended connectivity, rather than being powered on only when active use is required. Accordingly, it is possible to derive additional test information about the modem's wireless network. For example, it is possible to measure how long a connection lasts before failure. It also is possible to run a standard set of tests without constantly manually intervening. Previously, a wireless modem could not be left powered on because extended use was likely to result in a failure of the modem. However, with the present invention, although wireless modem failures are still possible, because they can be automatically detected and corrected, extended continuous modem connectivity or use becomes possible.","With external wireless modems, a power cycle device  is preferred because external wireless modems can be powered (or de-powered) by their own AC power supply (e.g. an AC adapter). Cutting off the AC power source cuts off power to the wireless modem. However, in the case of an internal or USB wireless modem, the computer itself may supply or control power to the modem. With such modems, the power cycle device is not used. Rather, the computer using the wireless modem applies the same or similar intelligent power cycling logic discussed above, and rather than cycling the modem's power with a separate power cycle device  the computer itself can directly cycle power to the wireless modem. For example, a computer communicating with a wireless modem through a USB could cycle the USB power, thus cycling the wireless modem device. Some laptops power off their USB when they switch to battery power. If switching to battery power can be controlled by an application, then an application can cycle its modem by temporarily switching to battery power and then back to line power. Modems using USB power control switches may have their power cut by way of a power control switch. In sum, any method by which a computer can control the supply of power to a wireless modem may be used.","Finally, the present invention is not limited to wireless network testing. In general, any use of a wireless modem can be improved by intelligently cycling its power. Some wireless modems are designed to perform a soft reset when so commanded. However, unstable wireless modems often lockup and therefore cannot respond to a reset command. Power cycling allows these modems to be intelligently and automatically reset.","The present invention has been described with respect to a system and method for intelligently power cycling wireless modems. The invention can apply not only to wireless modems, but also to any powered modem or device with which we can be interacted with in a meaningful way to assess its operational state. Standard V.90 modems have also been used. The many features and advantages of the invention are apparent from the detailed specification and, thus, it is intended by the appended claims to cover all such features and advantages of the invention that fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation illustrated and described, and accordingly all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
