{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, and licensed by or for the U.S. Government.","The present invention relates to a portable vented suppressive shielding device (\u201cVSS\u2019) that can be emplaced over a suspected explosive ordnance such as an Improvised Explosive Device (\u201cIED\u201d) and, more particularly, to a system to protect persons or equipment from the effects of an explosive detonation, such as the mechanical shock wave, heat, flames and\/or high velocity fragments.","The use of certain types of suppressive shielding for the containment of explosive blasts is well known. For example, vented blasting mats have long been used in quarry operations to confine detonation effects. The design of such mats was primarily achieved through trial and error. More recently, the application of suppressive shielding has been considered for use in other commercial and military applications.","In military applications, suppressive shielding developments have been generally directed towards the containment of an IED within a shielding. The blast, fragments and\/or fireball which accompany such a contained explosive\u2014as for example, the detonation of a round used as a large caliber weapon\u2014can be considered a worst case test for a shielding container.","An explosive suppressive shielding has many important applications. For example, such shielding can be used in transportation terminals, such as airports and bus stations where terrorist attacks can occur. The shields may take many forms in such an application. For instance, a suppressive shielding container may be placed over a suspected explosive device at baggage checkpoints. Such a shielding container may also be placed on an aircraft over a suspected explosive device until proper evacuation of the passengers and crew.","Naturally, applications for such a shield are not limited to airports and other transportation facilities. In an industrial plant, for example, equipment subject to explosion may be surrounded by a suppressive shield in order to protect workers in the vicinity.","Obviously, such vented suppressive shielding also has important military applications. Explosive devices may be stored within a shielded container or larger shields may be used to surround explosive storage areas. Such a shielding barrier requires that the shield has the ability to withstand not only high pressure waves and a thermal release (fireball) but also high velocity fragments (shrapnel) that invariably are part of military munition fragments after detonation.","The problems of providing a useful suppressive shielding are many. Concrete revetments\/walls and steel shelters can often provide sufficient shielding, but are too bulky and heavy to provide the various types of protection mentioned above. Such shields often inhibit movement of people or machines because of their large size. Also, the construction of portable shields of these materials is not possible because of their excessive weight and bulk.","Because of the abovementioned there has been a need for a suppressive shielding which is relatively light and not bulky, but which still provides sufficient protection from the blast pressure, heat, flame and fragments which may accompany an explosion. In many cases, IEDs are found in locations where large\/heavy blast systems are not tactically deployable or effective.","It would be very beneficial generally\u2014and to the military specifically\u2014to provide a shield for an IED or other explosives; which is compact and readily portable, practical and relatively low-cost, easily produced and\/or assembled out in the field, and capable of sustaining high-pressure blast waves, thermal releases and\/or high-velocity shrapnel or other fragments.","Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a shield which readily meets the objectives listed above.","In accordance with the teachings of the present invention, a preferred embodiment thereof is herein disclosed, which comprises a portable, vented suppressive shield for protective tactical emplacement over a suspected explosive device. This shield includes a base having an opening adapted to surround the explosive device. A plurality of rings are stacked one on top of another above the base. A lid is disposed on top of the stack of rings, the lid being provided with vent openings. Fastening means secures the lid to the base and clamps the stack of rings therebetween, such that the shield has the ability to withstand high-pressure blast waves, a thermal release, and\/or high-velocity fragments.","In a one embodiment, the stack of rings includes a plurality of first and second rings, respectively, stacked vertically and alternately with respect to each other, such that each second ring is nested radially inwardly of a corresponding first ring, and such that the alternate stacking provides a tortuous path for dissipation of the mechanical shock waves generated by the explosion.","In a preferred embodiment, a third set of rings is employed.","Preferably, the base has an external annular trepan formed thereon, and the rings includes a lowermost ring which is received within the trepan on the base.","Preferably, each ring is tubular and is welded together end-to-end to form welding junctions.","The rings may be hollow or made of a relatively heavy-gage metal, or made of a relatively lower-weight composite forming a polymeric barrier that encases a steel cable, or any combination thereof. The shield itself may be filled with foam to attenuate mechanical waves.","In a preferred embodiment, the lid is domed and is provided with a plurality of spaced-apart arcuately-formed vent openings, providing a tortuous path for rapidly dissipating the shock waves. The lid may be provided with a pair of handles for convenient manual portability.","Preferably, the fastening means comprises a plurality of circumferentially-spaced bolts disposed radially of the stack of rings; the bolts pass through respective openings in a radial flange on the lid and are received in respective tapped recesses in the base.","Viewed in another aspect, the present invention provides a protective shield for an explosive device, wherein the shield includes a base, a lid, and a plurality of wall sections disposed therebetween. The wall sections are stacked vertically and are spaced apart sufficiently to provide a tortuous path for the gases generated by an implosion of the device.","Preferably, the wall sections comprise respective sets of rings spaced apart, vertically, sufficient to accommodate maximum acceptable pressure limits.","These and other objects of the present invention will become apparent from a reading of the following specification taken in conjunction with the enclosed drawings.","With reference to , the shield  includes a base , a lid , and a stack  of rings (comprising wall sections) disposed therebetween. This stack of rings  includes a first plurality of rings , a second plurality of rings  and (preferably) a third plurality of rings . The rings  are of greater diameter (and cross-sectional thickness) then the rings  which, in turn, are greater than the rings ; and the rings ,  and  are nested within each other (see ) and are alternately stacked, vertically, as shown more clearly in , to form the stack .","This preferred alternate stacking arrangement provides a tortuous path for the escaping gases and contributes to the efficient performance of the shield . However, other stacking arrangements are equally applicable in accordance with the teachings of the present invention.","With reference to , the base  has an annular trepan  formed therein, and a lowermost one of the first plurality of rings  is disposed therein.","With reference again to , and with further reference to , a plurality of bolts  (or other suitable fastening means) clamps the stack  between the base  and the lid .","The bolts  pass through respective openings  formed in a radial flange  on the lid , and each bolt  is provided with threads  which are received in respective tapped recesses  formed in the base . The bolts  are circumferentially spaced and are disposed radially of the stack  of rings -. Preferably (see ) each bolt  is provided with a plurality of protruding grips  for convenient manipulation and tightening of the bolts , manually, and with or without a suitable tool (not shown).","With reference to , the shield  encompasses the explosive device, such as an improvised explosive device (IED) .","In the preferred embodiment, and viewed in another aspect, the shield  comprises a plurality of interlocking hollow toroidal rings (-), which are placed one at a time over the IED  (or other suspected item) to form the stack  of rings on top of the base . Those tubular shielding components are relatively lightweight and, as appreciated by one skilled in the art, provide a tortuous path shielding barrier, when interlocked with the bolt framing components. This shielding barrier comprises a plurality of attached pipes and\/or rods in a discrete tortuous conformation which, when stacked one on top the other, create a tortuous vented path leading away from the explodable device . This unique design affords a path of explosive by-products which removes energy from the explosion gases as they expand outwardly, mitigating blast over pressure. Additionally, this construction captures high velocity fragments and reduces the fireballs heat energy.","The tubular toroidal components (in the stack  of rings) are circularly bent and connected through a welded junction  that serves as its coupling. The respective welded junctions  can also provide a raised section in the stack  that allows for customized vented spacing when stacked vertically and aligned circumferentially with respect to each other (as shown in ) and the rings  and  may be welded to the coupling (welded junction) . The bolts  surround the wall barrier pieces such that they are free to move in the space defined to them, relative to the limitations of the bolts .","The lid  has its own tortuous vented pathway, comprising a plurality of spaced-apart arcuate openings  formed therein. The lid  is further provided with respective handles  for convenient portability.","Several additional steps may be taken to improve the performance of the shield . First, the shield  can be bolted to the ground, if possible, to help prevent it from being lifted up during an explosion when the reflective wave properties of the device are most important. Second, sandbags may be placed on top of the shield  to add more mass to the system, reducing the explosions ability to move the structure. Also, conventional aqueous foam (not shown) could be injected into the cavity created by the vertically-stacked rings  of the shield  to further mitigate the expansion of the gases from the explosion. It is known that applications of aqueous foam or explosion blast foam technology with expansion ratios of 50 or 100 to 1 will significantly lower blast overpressure.","With respect to the methodology involved in setting up the shield , there are basically three situations. All follow the same basic steps, but they differ in their order and where the shield  is set up in relation to the explosive device . In the first scenario, the shield  is assembled away from the explosive device ; the lid  is not put in place; the IED  is placed within the shield  and the lid  is then attached. In these specific cases standard \u201cRender Safe Procedures\u201d (RSP's) are adhered to before the lid  is attached.","In the second case, the shield  is completely assembled away from the explosive device , and is then placed overtop the explosive device . These first two methods are preferred because they minimize the operator time on target.","In the third situation, the base for the shield  is placed around the IED , and the shield  is built up around it. Standard containment measures are applied accordingly.","To set up the shield , first the base  is set on level ground. In a preferred embodiment, the base  is roughly three (3) feet in diameter. There is an annular recess\/or groove (trepan ) for the lowermost one of the first rings  that make up the walls of the shield. The wall pieces (rings of the stack ) are stacked on the base , starting in trepan , one on top of the other. For greater spacing between the wall pieces, the welded junctions (couplings)  can be stacked, thereby alleviating excessive blast pressures. The lid  is placed onto the stack  of ring wall sections (up to roughly two (2) feet above the ground in a preferred embodiment). The bolts  are then inserted thorough the holes (openings)  in the flange  on the lid  and screwed securely into their respective tapped recesses  in the base . The lid  can be carried by its handles . This will create the multi-component system (depicted herein) which is ready to diminish the damage an explosive device  could cause.","As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the respective sets of vertically-spaced rings - are stacked sufficiently to accommodate maximum acceptable pressure limits.","By maximum acceptable pressure limit, we are referring to that peak blast pressure which the VSS (shield ) can contain without sacrificing its operational purposes (namely, running the hazards produced during an explosion. In the present invention, additional wall sections may be added to the structure which will increase its internal volume, as well as the venting, both of which will increase the maximum acceptable pressure limit. By increasing the amount of surface area (increased venting) through which the blast wave can travel, the pressure build-up within the VSS (shield ) may be diminished, thus enabling the shield  to contain larger peak blast pressure.","Additionally, the VSS (shield ) relies on its mass to keep it in contact with the surface upon which the VSS is assembled. The VSS should have sufficient mass to prevent the VSS from lifting off the surface upon an explosion, thereby avoiding blast energy from escaping under a newly-created gap.","The welded junction  provides the desired static spacing between each ring of a wall section (wherein the rings are welded together). The welded junctions may be stacked one on top of the other (and circumferentially aligned) or in an offset manner. When stacked offset, a small area is produced between adjacent wall sections (\u201csister\u201d rings) thereby contributing to the tortuous pathway. When stacked one on top of the other, the larger spacing will reduce the peak pressure in the VSS (shield ) thus allowing it to contain larger blasts. This structural flexibility of the shield  is yet another desirable feature of the present invention.","As appreciated by those skilled in the art, the present invention substantially improves upon the prior art by providing a practical portable shielding device. The individual elements are comprised of a lightweight, yet sturdy metal. When assembled, the components form a solid system able to reduce the damage that would be caused by an explosive device. The system is man deployable; one or two individuals are able to set up the system in a matter of minutes. Furthermore, such as with multi-story buildings, it is easy to place in difficult locations due to its inherent compact size.","The components of the barrier may be made from heavy gauge aluminum or steel, or even an integrated lower weight composite consisting of a polymeric barrier that encases large diameter welded steel cable, as may be desirable in a particular application. Such components could be lighter in weight than materials such as steel or concrete.","Obviously, many modifications may be made without departing from the basic spirit of the present invention. Accordingly, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced other than has been specifically described herein."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 7"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
