modulate the activity of the PGI2 receptor. Compounds of the present invention and pharmaceutical compositions thereof are directed to methods useful in the treatment of: pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); idiopathic PAH; familial PAH; PAH associated with: a collagen vascular disease, a congenital heart disease, portal hypertension, HIV infection, ingestion of a drug or toxin, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, splenectomy, pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) or pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PCH); PAH with significant venous or capillary involvement; platelet aggregation; coronary artery disease; myocardial infarction; transient ischemic attack; angina; stroke; ischemia-reperfusion injury; restenosis; atrial fibrillation; blood clot formation in an angioplasty or coronary bypass surgery individual or in an individual suffering from atrial fibrillation; atherothrombosis; asthma or a symptom thereof; a diabetic-related disorder such as diabetic peripheral neuropathy, diabetic nephropathy or diabetic retinopathy; glaucoma or other disease of the eye with abnormal intraocular pressure; hypertension; inflammation; psoriasis; psoriatic arthritis; rheumatoid arthritis; Crohn's disease; transplant rejection; multiple sclerosis; systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); ulcerative colitis; atherosclerosis; acne; type 1 diabetes; type 2 diabetes; sepsis; and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD).","Prostacyclin (PGI2) is a lipid molecule derived from arachidonic acid through the cyclooxygenase pathway. It is a potent vasodilator, antiproliferative, anti-thrombotic and antiplatelet agent that mediates its effects as an agonist of a G protein-coupled receptor (PGI2 receptor; e.g., human PGI2 receptor, GenBank\u00ae Accession No. NP000951 and alleles thereof). It is known that the binding of PGI2 (or other such agonist) to the PGI2 receptor leads to coupling with the Gs protein and increases intracellular cAMP levels. (See, e.g., Zhang et al., Arch. Biochem. Biophys., 2006, 454:80-88.)","Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a life-threatening disease characterized by a progressive pulmonary vasculopathy leading to right ventricular hypertrophy. Right heart failure occurs if left untreated. Prostacyclin, which has vasodilatory and antiproliferative effects on the pulmonary vasculature has been found to be low in patients with PAH compared with normal controls. Exogenous administration of prostacyclin or an analog of prostacyclin (i.e., an agonist of the PGI2 receptor) has become an important strategy in the treatment of PAH. (See, e.g., Tuder et al., Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care. Med., 1999, 159:1925-1932; Humbert et al., J. Am. Coll. Cardiol., 2004, 43:13S-24S; Rosenzweig, Expert Opin. Emerging Drugs, 2006, 11:609-619; McLaughlin et al., Circulation, 2006, 114:1417-1431; Rosenkranz, Clin. Res. Cardiol., 2007, 96:527-541; Driscoll et al., Expert Opin. Pharmacother., 2008, 9:65-81.)","Trepostinil and iloprost are FDA-approved analogs of prostacyclin which, like prostacyclin, are not orally-active. Beraprost is an orally-active analog of prostacyclin approved for the treatment of PAH in Japan, but it has failed registration for the treatment of PAH in Europe and in the US. Of the three FDA-approved drugs, prostacyclin is the best studied in PAH patients. The approximate annual cost of treating PAH with these drugs is $25,000 to $200,000 depending on the dose. At present, many experts consider intravenous prostacyclin to be the most reliable agent for managing the sickest PAH patients. Due to the short half-life of prostacyclin, intravenous treatment is complicated by the need for a continuous infusion. Patients are at risk for potentially fatal rebound pulmonary hypertension if the infusion is abruptly disrupted, as well as significant risk of catheter-related complications including sepsis. (See, e.g., Rosenzweig, Expert Opin. Emerging Drugs, 2006, 11:609-619; Naeije et al., Expert Opin. Pharmacother., 2007, 8:2247-2265; Strauss et al., Clin. Chest. Med., 2007, 28:127-142; Driscoll et al., Expert Opin. Pharmacother., 2008, 9:65-81.)","There is considerable interest in developing prostacyclin analogs (i.e., agonists of the PGI2 receptor) for use in the treatment of other diseases, such as atherothrombosis. Developing stable, orally-active analogs of prostacyclin (i.e., stable, orally-active agonists of the PGI2 receptor) is a rate-limiting step in achieving this goal (see, e.g., Arehart et al., Curr. Med. Chem., 2007, 14:2161-2169; Arehart et al., Circ. Res., 2008, 102(8), 986-93), as well as in the improved management of PAH.","One aspect of the present invention encompasses certain cyclohexane derivatives selected from compounds of Formula Ia and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates and hydrates thereof:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0008"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"16.51mm","wi":"70.87mm","file":"US08940891-20150127-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"wherein:","Ris selected from: H and C-Calkyl;","Rand Rare each independently selected from: H, C-Calkyl, aryl and heteroaryl;

PAH in mice. The same group also reported that prostacyclin and its oral analog, beraprost sodium (BPS), may lack direct inhibitory effect on Rho-kinase in vitro, suggesting that combination therapy with a Rho-kinase inhibitor and BPS is effective for the treatment of PAH. Thus, male Sprague-Dawley rats were given a s.c. injection of monocrotaline (60 mg\/kg) and maintained with or without the treatment with a Rho-kinase inhibitor, fasudil (30 mg\/kg\/day), BPS (200 \u03bcg\/kg\/day), or a combination of both drugs for three weeks. The combination therapy, when compared with each monotherapy, showed significantly more improvement in PAH, right ventricular hypertrophy, and pulmonary medial thickness without any adverse effects.

Mice genetically deficient for the TPH1 gene (\u201cknockout mice\u201d) have been reported. In one case, the mice reportedly expressed normal amounts of serotonin in classical serotonergic brain regions, but largely lacked serotonin in the periphery. Walther, D. J., et al., Science 299:76 (2003). In another, the knockout mice exhibited abnormal cardiac activity, which was attributed to a lack of peripheral serotonin. Cote, F., et al., PNAS 100(23):13525-13530 (2003).","Recently, TPH knockout mice were studied in a hypoxia-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension model. Morecroft, I., et al., Hypertension 49:232-236 (2007). The results of those studies suggest that TPH1 and peripheral serotonin play an essential role in the development of hypoxia-induced elevations in pulmonary pressures and hypoxia-induced pulmonary vascular remodeling.","The PGI2 receptor agonists disclosed herein, alone or in combination with a tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor, are useful in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and symptoms thereof.","2. Antiplatelet Therapies (Conditions Related to Platelet Aggregation)","Antiplatelet agents (antiplatelets) are prescribed for a variety of conditions. For example, in coronary artery disease they are used to help prevent myocardial infarction or stroke in patients who are at risk of developing obstructive blood clots (e.g., coronary thrombosis).","In a myocardial infarction (\u201cMI\u201d or \u201cheart attack\u201d), the heart muscle does not receive enough oxygen-rich blood as a result of a blockage in the coronary blood vessels. If taken while an attack is in progress or immediately afterward (preferably within 30 min), antiplatelets can reduce the damage to the heart.","A transient ischemic attack (\u201cTIA\u201d or \u201cmini-stroke\u201d) is a brief interruption of oxygen flow to the brain due to decreased blood flow through arteries, usually due to an obstructing blood clot. Antiplatelet drugs have been found to be effective in preventing TIAs.","Angina is a temporary and often recurring chest pain, pressure or discomfort caused by inadequate oxygen-rich blood flow (ischemia) to some parts of the heart. In patients with angina, antiplatelet therapy can reduce the effects of angina and the risk of myocardial infarction.","Stroke is an event in which the brain does not receive enough oxygen-rich blood, usually due to blockage of a cerebral blood vessel by a blood clot. In high-risk patients, taking antiplatelets regularly has been found to prevent the formation of blood clots that cause first or second strokes.","Angioplasty is a catheter based technique used to open arteries obstructed by a blood clot. Whether or not stenting is performed immediately after this procedure to keep the artery open, antiplatelets can reduce the risk of forming additional blood clots following the procedure(s).","Coronary bypass surgery is a surgical procedure in which an artery or vein is taken from elsewhere in the body and grafted to a blocked coronary artery, rerouting blood around the blockage and through the newly attached vessel. After the procedure, antiplatelets can reduce the risk of secondary blood clots.","Atrial fibrillation is the most common type of sustained irregular heart rhythm (arrhythmia). Atrial fibrillation affects about two million Americans every year. In atrial fibrillation, the atria (the heart's upper chambers) rapidly fire electrical signals that cause them to quiver rather than contract normally. The result is an abnormally fast and highly irregular heartbeat. When given after an episode of atrial fibrillation, antiplatelets can reduce the risk of blood clots forming in the heart and traveling to the brain (embolism).","There is evidence that a PGI2 receptor agonist will inhibit platelet aggregation and thus be a potential treatment as an antiplatelet therapy (see, e.g., Moncada et al., Lancet, 1977, 1:18-20). It has been shown that genetic deficiency of the PGI2 receptor in mice leads to an increased propensity towards thrombosis (Murata et al., Nature, 1997, 388:678-682).","PGI2 receptor agonists can be used to treat, for example, claudication or peripheral artery disease as well as cardiovascular complications, arterial thrombosis, atherosclerosis, vasoconstriction caused by serotonin, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and restenosis of arteries following angioplasty or stent placement. (See, e.g., Fetalvero et al., Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat., 2007, 82:109-118; Arehart et al., Curr. Med. Chem., 2007, 14:2161-2169; Davi et al., N. Engl. J. Med., 2007, 357:2482-2494; Fetalvero et al., Am. J. Physiol. Heart. Circ. Physiol., 2006, 290:H1337-H1346; Murata et al., Nature, 1997, 388:678-682; Wang et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 2006, 103:14507-14512; Xiao et al., Circulation, 2001, 104:2210-2215; McCormick et al., Biochem. Soc. Trans., 2007, 35:910-911; Arehart et al., Circ. Res., 2008, 102(8), 986-93.)","PGI2 receptor agonists can also be used alone or in combination with thrombolytic therapy, for example, tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), to provide cardioprotection following MI or postischemic myocardial dysfunction or protection from ischemic injury during percutaneous coronary intervention, and the like, including complications resulting therefrom. PGI2 receptor agonists can also be used in antiplatelet therapies in combination with, for example, alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E), echistatin (a disintegrin) or, in states of hypercoagulability, heparin. (See, e.g., Chan., J. Nutr., 1998, 128:1593-1596; Mardla et al., Platelets, 2004, 15:319-324; Bernabei et al., Ann. Thorac. Surg., 1995, 59:149-153; Gainza et al., J. Nephrol., 2006, 19:648-655.)","The PGI2 receptor agonists disclosed herein provide beneficial improvement in microcirculation to patients in need of antiplatelet therapy by antagonizing the vasoconstrictive products of the aggregating platelets in, for example and not limited to the indications described above.

Atherosclerosis","Atherosclerosis is a complex disease characterized by inflammation, lipid accumulation, cell death and fibrosis. It is the leading cause of mortality in many countries, including the United States. Atherosclerosis, as the term is used herein, shall be understood to encompass disorders of large and medium-sized arteries that result in the progressive accumulation within the intima of smooth muscle cells and lipids.","It has been shown that an agonist of the PGI2 receptor can confer protection from atherosclerosis, such as from atherothrombosis (Arehart et al., Curr. Med. Chem., 2007, 14:2161-2169; Stitham et al., Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat., 2007, 82:95-108; Fries et al., Hematology Am. Soc. Hematol. Educ.

Res., 2008, 102(8), 986-93).","It has been shown that defective PGI2 receptor signaling appears to accelerate atherothrombosis in humans, i.e. that an agonist of the PGI2 receptor can confer protection from atherothrombosis in humans (Arehart et al., Circ. Res., 2008, 102(8), 986-93).","The compounds of the present invention disclosed herein are useful in the treatment of atherosclerosis, and the treatment of the symptoms thereof.

In further embodiments, methods are provided for treating a symptom of atherosclerosis in a patient in need of the treatment, comprising administering to the patient a composition comprising a PGI2 receptor agonist disclosed herein.","4. Asthma","Asthma is a lymphocyte-mediated inflammatory airway disorder characterized by airway eosinophilia, increased mucus production by goblet cells, and structural remodeling of the airway wall. The prevalence of asthma has dramatically increased worldwide in recent decades. It has been shown that genetic deficiency of the PGI2 receptor in mice augments allergic airway inflammation (Takahashi et al., Br J Pharmacol, 2002, 137:315-322). It has been shown that an agonist of the PGI2 receptor can suppress not only the development of asthma when given during the sensitization phase, but also the cardinal features of experimental asthma when given during the challenge phase (Idzko et al., J. Clin. Invest., 2007, 117:464-472; Nagao et al., Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol., 2003, 29:314-320), at least in part through markedly interfering with the function of antigen-presenting dendritic cells within the airways (Idzko et al., J. Clin. Invest., 2007, 117:464-472; Zhou et al., J. Immunol., 2007, 178:702-710; Jaffar et al., J. Immunol., 2007, 179:6193-6203; Jozefowski et al., Int. Immunopharmacol., 2003, 3:865-878). These cells are crucial for both the initiation and the maintenance phases of allergic asthma, as depletion of airway dendritic cells during secondary challenge in sensitized mice abolished all characteristic features of asthma, an effect that could be completely restored by adoptive transfer of wild-type dendritic cells (van Rijt et al., J. Exp. Med., 2005, 201:981-991). It has also been shown that an agonist of the PGI2 receptor can inhibit proinflammatory cytokine secretion by human alveolar macrophages (Raychaudhuri et al., J. Biol. Chem., 2002, 277:33344-33348). The compounds of the present invention disclosed herein are useful in the treatment of asthma, and the treatment of the symptoms thereof. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the present invention provides methods for treating asthma in a patient in need of the treatment, comprising administering to the patient a composition comprising a PGI2 receptor agonist disclosed herein. In further embodiments, methods are provided for treating a symptom of asthma in a patient in need of the treatment, comprising administering to the patient a composition comprising a PGI2 receptor agonist disclosed herein.","5. Diabetic-Related Pathologies","Although hyperglycemia is the major cause for the pathogenesis of diabetic complications such as diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), diabetic nephropathy (DN) and diabetic retinopathy (DR), enhanced vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation in diabetic patients has also been implicated to play a role in disease progression (Cameron et al., Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol., 2003, 367:607-614). Agonists of the PGI2 receptor promote vasodilation and inhibit platelet aggregation. Improving microvascular blood flow is able to benefit diabetic complications (Cameron, Diabetologia, 2001, 44:1973-1988).","It has been shown that an agonist of the PGI2 receptor can prevent and reverse motor and sensory peripheral nerve conduction abnormalities in streptozotocin-diabetic rats (Cotter et al., Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol., 1993, 347:534-540). Further evidence for the beneficial effect of an agonist of the PGI2 receptor in the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy is given by Hotta et al. (Diabetes, 1996, 45:361-366), Ueno et al. (Jpn. J. Pharmacol., 1996, 70:177-182), Ueno et al. (Life Sci., 1996, 59:PL105-PL110), Hotta et al. (Prostaglandins, 1995, 49:339-349), Shindo et al. (Prostaglandins, 1991, 41:85-96), Okuda et al. (Prostaglandins, 1996, 52:375-384), and Koike et al. (FASEB J., 2003, 17:779-781). Evidence for the beneficial effect of an agonist of the PGI2 receptor in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy is given by Owada et al. (Nephron, 2002, 92:788-796) and Yamashita et al. (Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract., 2002, 57:149-161). Evidence for the beneficial effect of an agonist of the PGI2 receptor in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy is given by Yamagishi et al. (Mol. Med., 2002, 8:546-550), Burnette et al. (Exp. Eye Res., 2006, 83:1359-1365), and Hotta et al. (Diabetes, 1996, 45:361-366). It has been shown that an agonist of the PGI2 receptor can reduce increased tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) levels in diabetic patients, implying that an agonist of the PGI2 receptor may contribute to the prevention of progression in diabetic complications (Fujiwara et al., Exp. Clin. Endocrinol. Diabetes, 2004, 112:390-394).","6. Glaucoma","Evidence that topical administration of an agonist of the PGI2 receptor can result in a decrease in intraocular pressure (IOP) in rabbits and dogs and thereby have beneficial effect in the treatment of glaucoma is given by Hoyng et al. (Hoyng et al., Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci., 1987, 28:470-476).","7. Hypertension","Agonists of the PGI2 receptor have been shown to have activity for regulation of vascular tone, for vasodilation, and for amelioration of pulmonary hypertension (see, e.g., Strauss et al., Clin Chest Med, 2007, 28:127-142; Driscoll et al., Expert Opin. Pharmacother., 2008, 9:65-81). Evidence for a beneficial effect of an agonist of the PGI2 receptor in the treatment of hypertension is given by Yamada et al. (Peptides, 2008, 29:412-418). Evidence that an agonist of the PGI2 receptor can protect against cerebral ischemia is given by Dogan et al. (Gen. Pharmacol., 1996, 27:1163-1166) and Fang et al. (J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab., 2006, 26:491-501).","8. Anti-Inflammation Therapies","Anti-inflammation agents are prescribed for a variety of conditions. For example, in an inflammatory disease they are used to interfere with and thereby reduce an underlying deleterious There is evidence that a PGI2 receptor agonist can inhibit inflammation and thus be a potential treatment as an anti-inflammation therapy.

Biol. Chem., 2002, 277:33344-33348; Czeslick et al., Eur. J. Clin. Invest., 2003, 33:1013-1017; Di Renzo et al., Prostaglandin Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids, 2005, 73:405-410; Shinomiya et al., Biochem. Pharmacol., 2001, 61:1153-1160). It has been shown that an agonist of the PGI2 receptor can stimulate anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) production by dendritic cells (Jozefowski et al., Int. Immunopharmacol., 2003, 865-878; Zhou et al., J. Immunol., 2007, 178:702-710). It has been shown that an agonist of the PGI2 receptor can stimulate anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) production by macrophages (Shinomiya et al., Biochem. Pharmacol., 2001, 61:1153-1160). It has been shown that an agonist of the PGI2 receptor can inhibit a chemokine (CCL17)-induced chemotaxis of leukocytes (CD4 Th2 T cells) (Jaffar et al., J. Immunol., 2007, 179:6193-6203).

It has been shown that an agonist of the PGI2 receptor can attenuate asthma (Idzko et al., J. Clin. Invest., 2007, 117:464-472; Jaffar et al., J. Immunol., 2007, 179:6193-6203; Nagao et al., Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol., 2003, 29:314-320). It has been shown that an agonist of the PGI2 receptor can decrease TNF-\u03b1 production in type 2 diabetes patients (Fujiwara et al., Exp. Clin. Endocrinol. Diabetes, 2004, 112:390-394; Goya et al., Metabolism, 2003, 52:192-198).

Traumatic Brain Injury","Prostacyclin production is known to increase after brain trauma, and in a recent study, the importance of prostacyclin for posttraumatic hemodynamic alterations and neuron survival was investigated. Prostacyclin receptor-deficient (IP) mice were compared to mice with functional prostacyclin receptors (IP) after a controlled cortical injury. Contusion volume was increased in IP mice compared with IP mice.

Transdermal patches dispense a drug at a controlled rate by presenting the drug for absorption in an efficient manner with minimal degradation of the drug. Typically, transdermal patches comprise an impermeable backing layer, a single pressure sensitive adhesive and a removable protective layer with a release liner. One of ordinary skill in the art will understand and appreciate the techniques appropriate for manufacturing a desired efficacious transdermal patch based upon the needs of the artisan.","The compounds of the invention, together with a conventional adjuvant, carrier, or diluent, may thus be placed into the form of pharmaceutical formulations and unit dosages thereof and in such form may be employed as solids, such as tablets or filled capsules, or liquids such as solutions, suspensions, emulsions, elixirs, gels or capsules filled with the same, all for oral use, in the form of suppositories for rectal administration; or in the form of sterile injectable solutions for parenteral (including subcutaneous) use.

In general, one skilled in the art understands how to extrapolate in vivo data obtained in a model system, typically an animal model, to another, such as a human. In some circumstances, these extrapolations may merely be based on the weight of the animal model in comparison to another, such as a mammal, preferably a human, however, more often, these extrapolations are not simply based on weights, but rather incorporate a variety of factors. Representative factors include the type, age, weight, sex, diet and medical condition of the patient, the severity of the disease, the route of administration, pharmacological considerations such as the activity, efficacy, pharmacokinetic and toxicology profiles of the particular compound employed, whether a drug delivery system is utilized, on whether an acute or chronic disease state is being treated or prophylaxis is conducted or on whether further active compounds are administered in addition to the compounds of the present invention and as part of a drug combination. The dosage regimen for treating a disease condition with the compounds and\/or compositions of this invention is selected in accordance with a variety factors as cited above. Thus, the actual dosage regimen employed may vary widely and therefore may deviate from a preferred dosage regimen and one skilled in the art will recognize that dosage and dosage regimen outside these typical ranges can be tested and, where appropriate, may be used in the methods of this invention.","The desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered at appropriate intervals, for example, as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day. The sub-dose itself may be further divided, e.g., into a number of discrete loosely spaced administrations. The daily dose can be divided, especially when relatively large amounts are administered as deemed appropriate, into several, for example 2, 3 or 4 part administrations. If appropriate, depending on individual behavior, it may be necessary to deviate upward or downward from the daily dose indicated.","The compounds of the present invention can be administrated in a wide variety of oral and parenteral dosage forms. It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that the following dosage forms may comprise, as the active component, either a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate or hydrate of a compound of the invention.","For preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the compounds of the present invention, the selection of a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier can be either solid, liquid or a mixture of both. Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, pills, capsules, cachets, suppositories and dispersible granules. A solid carrier can be one or more substances which may also act as diluents, flavoring agents, solubilizers, lubricants, suspending agents, binders, preservatives, tablet disintegrating agents, or an encapsulating material.","In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid which is in a mixture with the finely divided active component.","In tablets, the active component is mixed with the carrier having the necessary binding capacity in suitable proportions and compacted to the desire shape and size. The powders and tablets may contain varying percentage amounts of the active compound. A representative amount in a powder or tablet may contain from 0.5 to about 90 percent of the active compound; however, an artisan would know when amounts outside of this range are necessary. Suitable carriers for powders and tablets are magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose, pectin, dextrin, starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, a low melting wax, cocoa butter and the like. The term \u201cpreparation\u201d is intended to include the formulation of the active compound with encapsulating material as carrier providing a capsule in which the active component, with or without carriers, is surrounded by a carrier, which is thus in association with it. Similarly, cachets and lozenges are included. Tablets, powders, capsules, pills, cachets and lozenges can be used as solid forms suitable for oral administration.","For preparing suppositories, a low melting wax, such as an admixture of fatty acid glycerides or cocoa butter, is first melted and the active component is dispersed homogeneously therein, as by stirring. The molten homogenous mixture is then poured into convenient sized molds, allowed to cool and thereby to solidify.","Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or sprays containing in addition to the active ingredient such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.","Liquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions and emulsions, for example, water or water-propylene glycol solutions. For example, parenteral injection liquid preparations can be formulated as solutions in aqueous polyethylene glycol solution. Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed, as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.","The compounds according to the present invention may thus be formulated for parenteral administration (e.g. by injection, for example bolus injection or continuous infusion) and may be presented in unit dose form in ampoules, pre-filled syringes, small volume infusion or in multi-dose containers with an added preservative. The pharmaceutical compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and\/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form, obtained by aseptic isolation of sterile solid or by lyophilization from solution, for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g. sterile, pyrogen-free water, before use.","Aqueous formulations suitable for oral use can be prepared by dissolving or suspending the active component in water and adding suitable colorants, flavors, stabilizing and thickening agents, as desired.","Aqueous suspensions suitable for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely divided active component in water with viscous material, such as natural or synthetic gums, resins, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, or other well-known suspending agents.","Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations for oral administration. Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions and emulsions. These preparations may contain, in addition to the active component, colorants, flavors, stabilizers, buffers, artificial and natural sweeteners, dispersants, thickeners, solubilizing agents and the like.","For topical administration to the epidermis the compounds according to the invention may be formulated as ointments, creams or lotions, or as a transdermal patch.","Ointments and creams may, for example, be formulated with an aqueous or oily base with the addition of suitable thickening and\/or gelling agents. Lotions may be formulated with an aqueous or oily base and will in general also contain one or more emulsifying agents, stabilizing agents, dispersing agents, suspending agents, thickening agents, or coloring agents.","Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising active agent in a flavored base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier.","Solutions or suspensions are applied directly to the nasal cavity by conventional means, for example with a dropper, pipette or spray. The formulations may be provided in single or multi-dose form. In the latter case of a dropper or pipette, this may be achieved by the patient administering an appropriate, predetermined volume of the solution or suspension. In the case of a spray, this may be achieved for example by means of a metering atomizing spray pump.","Administration to the respiratory tract may also be achieved by means of an aerosol formulation in which the active ingredient is provided in a pressurized pack with a suitable propellant. If the compounds of the present invention or pharmaceutical compositions comprising them are administered as aerosols, for example as nasal aerosols or by inhalation, this can be carried out, for example, using a spray, a nebulizer, a pump nebulizer, an inhalation apparatus, a metered inhaler or a dry powder inhaler. Pharmaceutical forms for administration of the compounds of the present invention as an aerosol can be prepared by processes well known to the person skilled in the art. For their preparation, for example, solutions or dispersions of the compounds of the present invention in water, water\/alcohol mixtures or suitable saline solutions can be employed using customary additives, for example benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, absorption enhancers for increasing the bioavailability, solubilizers, dispersants and others and, if appropriate, customary propellants, for example include carbon dioxide, CFCs, such as, dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, or dichlorotetrafluoroethane; and the like. The aerosol may conveniently also contain a surfactant such as lecithin. The dose of drug may be controlled by provision of a metered valve.","In formulations intended for administration to the respiratory tract, including intranasal formulations, the compound will generally have a small particle size for example of the order of 10 microns or less. Such a particle size may be obtained by means known in the art, for example by micronization. When desired, formulations adapted to give sustained release of the active ingredient may be employed.","Alternatively the active ingredients may be provided in the form of a dry powder, for example, a powder mix of the compound in a suitable powder base such as lactose, starch, starch derivatives such as hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). Conveniently the powder carrier will form a gel in the nasal cavity. The powder composition may be presented in unit dose form for example in capsules or cartridges of, e.g., gelatin, or blister packs from which the powder may be administered by means of an inhaler.","The pharmaceutical preparations are preferably in unit dosage forms. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of preparation, such as packeted tablets, capsules and powders in vials or ampoules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsule, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form.","Tablets or capsules for oral administration and liquids for intravenous administration are preferred compositions.","The compounds according to the invention may optionally exist as pharmaceutically acceptable salts including pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic acids including inorganic and organic acids.

Certain pharmaceutically acceptable salts are listed in Berge, et al., 66:1-19 (1977), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The acid addition salts may be obtained as the direct products of compound synthesis. In the alternative, the free base may be dissolved in a suitable solvent containing the appropriate acid and the salt isolated by evaporating the solvent or otherwise separating the salt and solvent. The compounds of this invention may form solvates with standard low molecular weight solvents using methods known to the skilled artisan.","Compounds of the present invention can be converted to \u201cpro-drugs.\u201d The term \u201cpro-drugs\u201d refers to compounds that have been modified with specific chemical groups known in the art and when administered into an individual these groups undergo biotransformation to give the parent compound. Pro-drugs can thus be viewed as compounds of the invention containing one or more specialized non-toxic protective groups used in a transient manner to alter or to eliminate a property of the compound. In one general aspect, the \u201cpro-drug\u201d approach is utilized to facilitate oral absorption. A thorough discussion is provided in T. Higuchi and V. Stella, Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series; and in , ed. Edward B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.","Some embodiments of the present invention include a method of producing a pharmaceutical composition for \u201ccombination-therapy\u201d comprising admixing at least one compound according to any of the compound embodiments disclosed herein, together with at least one known pharmaceutical agent as described herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.","It is noted that when the PGI2 receptor modulators are utilized as active ingredients in a pharmaceutical composition, these are not intended for use only in humans, but in other non-human mammals as well. Indeed, recent advances in the area of animal health-care mandate that consideration be given for the use of active agents, such as PGI2 receptor modulators, for the treatment of an PGI2-associated disease or disorder in companionship animals (e.g., cats, dogs, etc.) and in livestock animals (e.g., cows, chickens, fish, etc.) Those of ordinary skill in the art are readily credited with understanding the utility of such compounds in such settings.","Hydrates and Solvates","It is understood that when the phrase pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates and hydrates is used in referring to a particular formula herein, it is intended to embrace solvates and\/or hydrates of compounds of the particular formula, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of the particular formula as well as solvates and\/or hydrates of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of the particular formula.","The compounds of the present invention can be administrated in a wide variety of oral and parenteral dosage forms.

Moreover, various hydrates and solvates of the compounds of the invention and their salts will find use as intermediates in the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions. Typical procedures for making and identifying suitable hydrates and solvates, outside those mentioned herein, are well known to those in the art; see for example, pages 202-209 of K. J. Guillory, \u201cGeneration of Polymorphs, Hydrates, Solvates, and Amorphous Solids,\u201d in: , ed. Harry G. Brittan, Vol. 95, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1999, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention pertains to hydrates and solvates of compounds of Formula Ia and\/or their pharmaceutical acceptable salts, as described herein, that can be isolated and characterized by methods known in the art, such as, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), TGA-mass spectroscopy, TGA-Infrared spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction (XRPD), Karl Fisher titration, high resolution X-ray diffraction, and the like. There are several commercial entities that provide quick and efficient services for identifying solvates and hydrates on a routine basis. Example companies offering these services include Wilmington PharmaTech (Wilmington, Del.), Avantium Technologies (Amsterdam) and Aptuit (Greenwich, Conn.).","Pro-Drugs of the Present Invention","The compounds of Formula Ia may be administered in the form of a pro-drug which is broken down in the human or animal body to give a compound of the Formula Ia. Pro-drugs of the present invention may employ any pro-drug strategy known in the art. A pro-drug may be used to alter or improve the physical and\/or pharmacokinetic profile of the parent compound and can be formed when the parent compound contains a suitable group or substituent which can be derivatized to form a pro-drug.

It is a further object of this invention to develop novel PGI2 receptor assays of which comprise such radio-labeled compounds.","The present invention embraces isotopically-labeled compounds of the present invention. Isotopically or radio-labeled compounds are those which are identical to compounds disclosed herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced or substituted by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number most commonly found in nature. Suitable radionuclides that may be incorporated in compounds of the present invention include but are not limited to H (also written as D for deuterium), H (also written as T for tritium), C, C, C, N, N, O, O, O, F, S, Cl, Br, Br, Br, Br, I, I, I and I. The radionuclide that is incorporated in the instant radio-labeled compounds will depend on the specific application of that radio-labeled compound. For example, for in vitro PGI2 receptor labeling and competition assays, compounds that incorporate H, C, Br, I, I or S will generally be most useful. For radio-imaging applications C, F, I, I, I, I, Br, Br or Br will generally be most useful.","It is understood that a \u201cradio-labeled\u201d or \u201clabeled compound\u201d is a compound of Formula Ia, Ic, Ie, Ig, or Ii that has incorporated at least one radionuclide; in some embodiments the radionuclide is selected from the group consisting of H, C, I, S and Br.","Certain isotopically-labeled compounds of the present invention are useful in compound and\/or substrate tissue distribution assays. In some embodiments the radionuclide H and\/or C isotopes are useful in these studies. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e., H) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability (e.g., increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements) and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in the Drawings and Examples infra, by substituting an isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent. Other synthetic methods that are useful are discussed infra. Moreover, it should be understood that all of the atoms represented in the compounds of the invention can be either the most commonly occurring isotope of such atoms or the scarcer radio-isotope or nonradioactive isotope.","Synthetic methods for incorporating radio-isotopes into organic compounds are applicable to compounds of the invention and are well known in the art. These synthetic methods, for example, incorporating activity levels of tritium into target molecules, are as follows:","A. Catalytic Reduction with Tritium Gas: This procedure normally yields high specific activity products and requires halogenated or unsaturated precursors.","B. Reduction with Sodium Borohydride [H]: This procedure is rather inexpensive and requires precursors containing reducible functional groups such as aldehydes, ketones, lactones, esters and the like.","C. Reduction with Lithium Aluminum Hydride [H]: This procedure offers products at almost theoretical specific activities. It also requires precursors containing reducible functional groups such as aldehydes, ketones, lactones, esters and the like.","D. Tritium Gas Exposure Labeling: This procedure involves exposing precursors containing exchangeable protons to tritium gas in the presence of a suitable catalyst.","E. N-Methylation using Methyl Iodide [H]: This procedure is usually employed to prepare O-methyl or N-methyl (3H) products by treating appropriate precursors with high specific activity methyl iodide [H]: This method in general allows for higher specific activity, such as for example, about 70-90 Ci\/mmol.","Synthetic methods for incorporating activity levels of I into target molecules include:","A. Sandmeyer and like reactions: This procedure transforms an aryl amine or a heteroaryl amine into a diazonium salt, such as a diazonium tetrafluoroborate salt and subsequently to I labeled compound using NaI. A represented procedure was reported by Zhu, G-D. and co-workers in 2002, 67, 943-948.","B. Ortho Iodination of phenols: This procedure allows for the incorporation of I at the ortho position of a phenol as reported by Collier, T. L. and co-workers in 1999, 42, S264-S266.","C. Aryl and heteroaryl bromide exchange with I: This method is generally a two step process. The first step is the conversion of the aryl or heteroaryl bromide to the corresponding tri-alkyltin intermediate using for example, a Pd catalyzed reaction [i.e. Pd(PhP)] or through an aryl or heteroaryl lithium, in the presence of a tri-alkyltinhalide or hexaalkylditin [e.g., (CH)SnSn(CH)]. A representative procedure was reported by Le Bas, M.-D. and co-workers in 2001, 44, S280-S282.","A radiolabeled PGI2 receptor compound of Formula Ia can be used in a screening assay to identify\/evaluate compounds. In general terms, a newly synthesized or identified compound (i.e., test compound) can be evaluated for its ability to reduce binding of the \u201cradio-labeled compound of Formula Ia\u201d to the PGI2 receptor. Accordingly, the ability of a test compound to compete with the \u201cradio-labeled compound of Formula Ia\u201d for the binding to the PGI2 receptor directly correlates to its binding affinity.","The labeled compounds of the present invention bind to the PGI2 receptor. In one embodiment the labeled compound has an ICless than about 500 \u03bcM, in another embodiment the labeled compound has an ICless than about 100 \u03bcM, in yet another embodiment the labeled compound has an ICless than about 10 \u03bcM, in yet another embodiment the labeled compound has an ICless than about 1 \u03bcM and in still yet another embodiment the labeled inhibitor has an ICless than about 0.1 \u03bcM.","Other uses of the disclosed receptors and methods will become apparent to those skilled in the art based upon, inter alia, a review of this disclosure.","As will be recognized, the steps of the methods of the present invention need not be performed any particular number of times or in any particular sequence.

CHO-K1 cells were obtained from ATCC\u00ae (Manassas, Va.; Catalog #CCL-61). An agonist of the prostacyclin receptor was detected in HTRF\u00ae assay for direct cAMP measurement as a compound which increased cAMP concentration. HTRF\u00ae assay also was used to determine ECvalues for prostacyclin receptor agonists.","Principle of the Assay:","The HTRF\u00ae assay kit was purchased from Cisbio-US, Inc. (Bedford, Mass.; Catalog #62AM4PEC). The HTRF\u00ae assay supported by the kit is a competitive immunoassay between endogenous cAMP produced by the CHO-K1 cells and tracer cAMP labeled with the dye d2. The tracer binding is visualized by a monoclonal anti-cAMP antibody labeled with Cryptate. The specific signal (i.e., fluorescence resonance energy transfer, FRET) is inversely proportional to the concentration of unlabeled cAMP in the standard or sample.","Standard Curve:","The fluorescence ratio (665 nm\/620 nm) of the standards (0.17 to 712 nM cAMP) included in the assay was calculated and used to generate a cAMP standard curve according to the kit manufacturer's instructions. The fluorescence ratio of the samples (test compound or compound buffer) was calculated and used to deduce respective cAMP concentrations by reference to the cAMP standard curve.","Setup of the Assay:","The HTRF\u00ae assay was carried out using a two-step protocol essentially according to the kit manufacturer's instructions, in 20 \u03bcL total volume per well in 384-well plate format (ProxiPlates; PerkinElmer, Fremont, Calif.; catalog #6008280). To each of the experimental wells was transferred 3000 recombinant CHO-K1 cells in 5 \u03bcL assay buffer (phosphate buffered saline containing calcium chloride and magnesium chloride (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.; catalog #14040) supplemented with IBMX (100 \u03bcM) and rolipram (10 \u03bcM) (phosphodiesterase inhibitors; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.; catalog #15879 and catalog #R6520, respectively) and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) fraction V (Sigma-Aldrich; catalog # A3059)), followed by test compound in 5 \u03bcL assay buffer or 5 \u03bcL assay buffer. The plate was then incubated at room temperature for 1 h. To each well was then added 5 \u03bcL cAMP-dconjugate in lysis buffer and 5 \u03bcL Cryptate conjugate in lysis buffer according to the kit manufacturer's instructions. The plate was then further incubated at room temperature for 1 h, after which the assay plate was read.","Assay Readout:","The HTRF\u00ae readout was accomplished using a PHERAstar (BMG LABTECH Inc., Durham, N.C.) or EnVision\u2122 (PerkinElmer, Fremont Calif.) microplate reader.","Certain compounds of the present invention and their corresponding activity values are shown in TABLE B.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0625","num":"0623"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"140pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE B"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},{},"human PGI2 receptor"]},{"entry":[{},"Compound No.","EC(nM) (HTRF\u2009\u00ae)"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"69","\u20028 nM"]},{"entry":[{},"31","31 nM"]},{"entry":[{},"43","36 nM"]},{"entry":[{},"67","73 nM"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"Certain other compounds of the invention had activity values ranging from about 2.1 nM to about 4 \u03bcM in this assay.","Blood collected from healthy human volunteers in aqueous trisodium citrate solution was centrifuged at 150 g for 15 min and the upper layer was recovered to obtain platelet-rich plasma (PRP).

MCT induces acute pulmonary endothelial damage associated with pulmonary vascular inflammation. Subsequently, pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells proliferate, occluding small pulmonary vessels and leading to severe pulmonary arterial hypertension including right ventricular hypertrophy. (See, e.g., Schermuly et al., Circ. Res., 2004, 94:1101-1108.)","Rats were randomly given a single subcutaneous injection of either 60 mg\/kg MCT (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) or 0.9% saline (sham) and assigned to receive oral administration of 20% hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrin (vehicle) or test compound (30 mg\/kg; ). 10-11 rats were used per treatment group. 24 h following MCT administration, test compound or vehicle was administered by oral gavage twice a day for 21 consecutive days.
