{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This disclosure generally relates to composite structures, and deals more particularly with a method and apparatus for removing out-of-tolerance areas within such structures, especially in connection with techniques for restoring or reworking these areas.","Composite structures sometimes include localized areas that may not conform to product and\/or performance specifications, for any of a variety of reasons. For example, areas of the structure may be out-of-tolerance because of inconsistencies such as, without limitation, voids, dents or porosities.","Localized areas of composite structures are sometimes reworked in order to reduce or eliminate non-conformities and thereby restore the structure. The rework process may involve removing one or more layers of material from the structure and then replacing the removed material with a composite patch that is bonded to the structure. During the material removal process, the edges of the rework area may be tapered or \u201cscarfed\u201d in order to form a scarf joint between the structure and the bonded patch. The rework process described above may require manual removal of the material by a skilled workman, typically using a handheld grinder or similar tool. This process is labor intensive and the accuracy of the material removal may be dependent upon the expertise of the workman. Accordingly, the consistency of the rework may vary from one rework to the next.","Accordingly, there is a need for a method and apparatus for reworking or restoring composite structures in which the localized removal of material to eliminate out-of-tolerance areas is rapid, accurate and predictable, while minimizing manual effort.","The disclosed embodiments provide a method and apparatus for reworking and\/or restoring out-of-tolerance areas of composite structures in which material is removed from the structure by an automated process in order to provide consistent, predictable and accurate results. An automatically controlled machine head operated by a programmed numerical controller both scans the structure in order to locate out-of-tolerance areas, and removes material from the structure based on the location of the out-of-tolerance area revealed by the scan. A tool on the machine head is used to both remove the material from the structure and form a scarf in the structure surrounding the area being reworked. The scarf forms a scarf joint between the structure and a bonded patch used to restore the out-of-tolerance area. The process of scanning the structure to locate out-of-tolerance areas and removing volumes of material may be iteratively performed to eliminate multiple out-of-tolerance areas in various layers of the structure.","According to one disclosed embodiment, a method is provided for restoring a composite structure containing an out-of-tolerance area. The location of the out-of-tolerance area is determined and a volume of the structure to be removed is selected based on the location of the out-of-tolerance area. An automatic material removal tool is programmed to remove the selected volume. The selected volume is removed by the programmed tool and then replaced by a patch. Determining the location of the out-of-tolerance area may involve moving a scanner over the surface of the structure, and selecting the volume to be removed may include selecting a layer to be removed from the structure and selecting an angle for a scarf along the edges of the layer.","According to another embodiment, a method is provided for removing one or more out-of-tolerance areas of the composite structure. The boundaries of the out-of-tolerance area within the structure are located, and are used to calculate a volume of material in the structure to be removed that includes the out-of-tolerance area. A toolpath used to guide a tool for removing material from the structure is calculated, and a controller is programmed with the calculated toolpath. The volume of material is removed from the structure using the tool, and the programmed controller may be used to control the tool. The method may further comprise selecting an angle for a scarf, wherein calculating the toolpath includes calculating a toolpath for forming the scarf having the selected scarf angle.","According to a further embodiment, apparatus is provided for removing an out-of-tolerance area in a composite structure. The apparatus comprises means for determining the location of the out-of-tolerance area within the structure, and a material removal tool. Means are provided for determining a volume of the structure to be removed which contains the out-of-tolerance area and for determining a toolpath followed by the tool to remove the volume. Automatic control means are provided for automatically controlling the movement of the tool along the toolpath. The means for determining the volume to be removed and for calculating the toolpath may include a computer, a set of data defining the geometry of the structure, and a program used by the computer to calculate the volume to be removed and to calculate the toolpath based on the geometry of the structure. The means for determining the location of the non-conforming area may include a non-destructive Inspection (NDI) type scanner that may use ultrasonic frequencies or infrared thermography for inspecting layers of material beneath a surface of the structure.","According to another embodiment, apparatus is provided for removing an out-of-tolerance area in a composite structure. A scanner is provided for internally scanning the structure and for identifying the location of an out-of-tolerance area within the structure. An automated machine tool is provided which includes a head moveable along multiple axes over the structure. A material removal tool is mounted on the head for removing material from the structure. A computer is provided which includes a program for calculating the volume of the out-of-tolerance area and for generating toolpath information used to guide the material removal tool. A controller is coupled with a computer for controlling the movement of the head and the operation of the material removal tool.","The disclosed embodiments satisfy the need for a method and apparatus for restoring out-of-tolerance areas of composite structures, which includes automated material removal that is rapid, accurate and consistent.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["20","22","20","20","24","24","26","28","22","35","20","20","24","30","30","20","24","24","24","24","30","30","20"],"i":["a","b ","a ","a","b ","a","b","a "]},"Referring now also to , the volume  of material shown in  is removed in a manner so as to form an outer peripheral scarf  that is tapered or inclined at a pre-selected scarf angle \u03b8. A preformed composite patch , which may comprise without limitation, multiple plies of composite material, may be bonded to the composite structure  and fills the volume  of material that has been previously removed. The peripheral edges of the patch  substantially match the scarf angle \u03b8 so as to form a bonded scarf joint  between the patch  and the composite structure .","While a scarf joint  as shown in  may be desirable for many applications, it may also be possible to remove the volume  of material from the composite structure  so as to form a series of peripheral step laps , as shown in , in which the height of each of steps lap  substantially matches the thickness of a corresponding ply  (). The peripheral step laps  may substantially match a series of similar step laps (not shown) on a patch (not shown) to form a step lap joint (not shown) between the patch  and the composite structure . Similarly, as shown in , material may be removed from the composite structure  during the restoration process so as so form a series of substantially contiguous scarfs , , respectively having differing scarf angles \u03b8, \u03b8, \u03b8. The multiple scarfs , , formed during removal of the volume  of material from the composite structure  may match corresponding scarfs (not shown) on the patch .","Attention is now directed to  which broadly illustrates the steps of a method of restoring a composite structure , that includes automated removal of one or more out-of-tolerance areas  () in the structure . Beginning at step , the surface  of the structure  is scanned to achieve machine-to-structure alignment using a device such as a triangulation\/line scan laser or touch probe to measure distance. Alternatively, a laser tracker (not shown) or a laser positioning system (not shown) may be used to locate the machine tool  relative to the structure , in a known x, y, z coordinate system, such as the coordinate system of an aircraft of which the structure  forms a part, so that when the machine tool  is located, a database may be used to identify the geometry. After multiple points on the surface  are measured, the surface information is stored and used to calculate the machine-to-structure alignment. Then, at step , the structure  is internally scanned to locate the boundaries of one or more non-conforming areas , which may require removal as part of the restoration process. As will be discussed below in more detail, the scanning process may be carried out using any of a variety of nondestructive inspection techniques, including those using ultrasonics. At , a first, initial volume of material within the structure  that must be removed is selected, based on the location of an out-of-tolerance area identified during the scanning step . In the example illustrated in , the out-of-tolerance areas identified during the initial scanning process may be limited to the out-of-tolerance area , since the out-of-tolerance area may be obscured by the overlying out-of-tolerance area and therefore not detectable during the initial scanning step. Thus, the first, initial volume of material removed from the structure  may be limited to the layer  which contains the out-of-tolerance area ","Next, at step , a machine tool (not shown) is programmed to remove the first selected volume of material. The process of programming the machine tool may include calculating a toolpath to be followed by a material removal tool (not shown), such as a mill or other cutting tool that is automatically controlled by a suitable numerical controller, as will be discussed later in more detail. The toolpath having been calculated at , the machine tool may then be used at step  to remove the first selected volume of material. As the first selected volume of material is being removed at step , an initial scarf () may be formed which may have a scarf angle that may be the same or different than a final scarf angle \u03b8.","Once the first selected volume of material has been removed, the structure  is rescanned at step  in order to locate the boundaries of any additional out-of-tolerance areas  that may be present beneath the newly exposed surface of the structure . In the example shown in , the rescanning process may result in the location of the boundaries of the out-of-tolerance area which resides in a layer  of material that is beneath the already removed layer  of material containing the out-of-tolerance area . At step , the machine tool is reprogrammed and used to remove a second selected volume  of material which again, in the case of the example shown in , includes the layer . The steps of rescanning the structure  to locate the boundaries of additional out-of-tolerance areas, reprogramming the machine tool and removing the selected volumes of material are repeated until no further out-of-tolerance areas  are identified during internal scanning of the structure .","When all of the out-of-tolerance areas  have been identified and removed, the final scarf  may be formed at step , using the material removal tool, so that the scarf has the desired scarf angle \u03b8. At step , the material that has been removed from the structure  may be replaced by an integrated patch . If desired, the restored structure  may be rescanned at step  in order to verify the desirability of the completed rework or restoration.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["52","56","54","57","65","78","57","52","35","20","35","57","56","20","56","65","54","78","20","56","54","65","58","56","60","58","65","58"]},"The computer  may be controlled by one or more software programs , and may have access to one or more geometry databases  which contain information defining the geometry and ply make-up of one or more composite structures  that are to be restored or reworked.

The tool may comprise a mill, router or similar tool which may be both rotated (via a spindle) and vertically displaced (along the Z axis) by the drive head  in order to remove material from the composite structure . A laser displacement unit  mounted on the head , directs a laser beam  onto the surface  of the composite structure  in order to develop depth-of-cut and machine-to-part orientation information that is used in controlling the drive head . An ultrasonic sensor  having a spring loaded riding dribbler head is mounted on the head  by means of a retractable sensor mount . The dribbler head of the sensor  may be displaced downwardly into contact with the surface  of the composite structure  in order to internally scan the composite structure  to locate the boundaries of out-of-tolerance areas . The camera  is mounted on the head  and oriented to view the area of the cutting tool so as to record either periodically or continuously, images of the material being removed. These images may be displayed to a user on the user display and\/or used by the computer  to control the operation of the head, including the cutting tool ","Attention is now directed to  which diagrammatically illustrate a method of restoring a composite structure having out-of-tolerance areas , , , using the apparatus shown in . illustrates a composite structure  comprising multiple plies  having known or suspected out-of-tolerance areas , , . As shown in , the machine tool  () may be used to scan the ultrasonic sensor  over the surface  of the composite structure  where out-of-tolerance areas are indicated or suspected. The initial scanning process performed in  may detect and locate approximate boundaries  of an out-of-tolerance area . Based on the boundaries  of the out-of-tolerance area , a first volume  of material is calculated that is to be removed by the cutting tool , as shown in , which includes the out-of-tolerance area . A toolpath (not shown) used to guide the movement of the cutting tool is calculated by the computer  () and is used to program the CNC controller  which controls the movement of the head , including the cutting tool . During removal of the first volume  of material, the cutting tool forms an initial scarf  () around the periphery of the volume  of material that has been removed.","Next, as shown in , the ultrasonic sensor  is used to re-scan the composite structure  in order to locate the boundaries of possible additional out-of-tolerance areas , at deeper levels in the structure  that may have been previously obscured by the overlying out-of-tolerance area . Based on the located boundaries of the additional out-of-tolerance areas , , a second, additional volume  of material () is calculated which includes the out-of-tolerance areas , . Based on the boundaries of the additional out-of-tolerance areas , , the CNC controller  () is re-programmed with a new toolpath for the tool that will result in the removal of the second volume  of material.  illustrates the second volume  of material having been removed and a final scarf  having been formed that includes the desired scarf angle \u03b8 (). At this point, the sensor  may be used to re-scan the composite structure  to determine whether there are any further out-of-tolerance areas that have not been previously detected.","Referring to , once all the out-of-tolerance areas have been removed from the composite structure , a composite patch  may be fabricated and bonded to the composite structure  in order to replace the material removed from the structure . The computer  () may be used to calculate the number, size and type of plies needed to fabricate the patch  based in part on the volumes ,  of material removed that were previously calculated by the computer . The patch  may include a scarf that substantially matches the final scarf  on the composite structure . After the patch  has been bonded to the composite structure , the restoration, including the patch  may be rescanned with the sensor , as shown in  in order to verify the integrity and the quality of the restoration.","Attention is now directed to  which illustrates a method of removing out-of-tolerance areas in a composite aircraft  (), which may be for example and without limitation, an exterior aircraft skin (not shown) formed of composite materials. Beginning at , the machine tool  () may be mounted on a fuselage  () of the aircraft , overlying and encompassing a section of the skin requiring restoration. Also at , a laser tracker or laser positioning system locates the machine tool relative to the fuselage  () within a known coordinate system, which may be the coordinate system of the aircraft  (). The computer  () may be used to retrieve aircraft skin geometry from an aircraft geometry database , which may form part of the geometry database  previously described in connection with . At , the software  causes the computer  to display on the visual display (), the maximum area on the fuselage that can be scanned without moving the machine tool . The user interface  also allows the user to determine the particular area on the fuselage to be scanned.","At , the section on the fuselage selected by the user is scanned in order to identify any out-of-tolerance areas. At , data representing the out-of-tolerance areas identified at step  are overlaid on the aircraft fuselage skin geometry retrieved from the database at , including ply surface definitions. Using this overlaid information, the volume of material that must be removed which includes the out-of-tolerance areas is automatically calculated. These calculations include calculating the portion to be removed for each ply in the composite structure, using a taper ratio (scarf angle) provided by the user. The user interface  allows a user to view each ply of the skin, including the portion to be removed from each ply.","At step , the computer  accesses the CAM application  () via the API interface  and uses the CAM application  to generate a toolpath for the cutting tool . The user may employ the user interface  to input additional information used to program the machine tool , such as the type of tool to be used, size of the tool, etc. At step , the generated toolpath is then used to direct the movement of the cutting tool which removes the calculated volume of material that contains the out-of-tolerance areas while forming a user defined taper angle (scarf angle).","Next, at step , the section of the fuselage skin where the volume of material is removed is rescanned to determine if there are additional out-of-tolerance areas previously undetectable by the prior scan due to overlying out-of-tolerance areas.","At , a determination is made of whether the fuselage skin still contains out-of-tolerance areas. If the answer is yes, steps , ,  and  are repeated. Otherwise, the process proceeds to step  where a final scarf angle or taper ratio, which may be, for example and without limitation, 30:1, is calculated. The CAM application  is then called up and a toolpath is generated which will result in removing additional material required to produce a final scarf angle. Again, the user may provide additional information during this step, such as the type and size of the tool to be used. Finally, at step , using the toolpath generated at step , the cutting tool removes the paint and ply area necessary to complete the scarf with a pre-selected or user scarf angle or taper ratio.","Embodiments of the disclosure may find use in a variety of potential applications, particularly in the transportation industry, including for example, aerospace, marine and automotive applications.
