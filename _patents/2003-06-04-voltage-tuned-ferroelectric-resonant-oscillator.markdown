{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or for the United States Government for governmental purposes.","A need has existed for an extended period of time, in the armed services and industry, for an oscillator having the ability to generate an RF signal from a D.C. power source which has the capability of rapidly selecting different RF output frequencies. This need is particularly acute in applications by frequency agile sources used in electronic warfare and communication links. Commercial applications for the invention will include the use in transmitters and receivers using phased-locked loops to stabilize a desired frequency. Prior art devices did not provide a reliable method to control a wide range of frequencies without concern for \u201cburning out\u201d or the need for shielding of the ferroelectric frequency control material when used in pulsed systems with high power or in environments where the generating sources are unstable. Prior art devices using a varactor diode as a variable capacitance for voltage controlled oscillators also were unreliable in high power pulsed systems. The varactor diode was vulnerable under the aforementioned environment whenever the maximum current rating was exceeded.","The present invention relates to a voltage tuned ferrroelectric resonant oscillator which has the capability of rapidly selecting different frequencies in high power pulsed systems.","An object of the present invention is to provide a reliable frequency tuned, \u201cferractor\u201d, oscillator which can control a wide range of frequencies without concern for burn out.","Another object of the present invention is to remove the threat of burn out of a tunable devise under pulsed systems with high power. A further object of the present invention is to provide a tunable ferractor which removes the threat of burn out due to inherent properties of the ferroelectric material being polarity independent.","tunable ferractor which removes the threat of burn out due to inherent properties of the ferroelectric material being polarity independent.","For a better understanding of the present invention, together with other and further objects thereof, reference is made to the following descriptions taken in connection with the accompanying drawings.","Throughout the following description, like numerals are used to denote like parts of the drawings.","Referring now to  the ferractor circuit comprises an amplification stage  which includes one or more amplifiers cascaded together. Additional amplification  may be attached to the output port  of the oscillator to achieve the required output power level. Input and output matching networks,  and  respectively, are connected to the amplifier ports. The signal from the output network  is then devided at the power split  between the feedback path  and the output path  of the device. This division can take the form of a coupler or a power devider as long as enough energy traverses the feedback loop . The ferractor is tuned by placing the ferroelectric material, hereinafter described in the ferroelectric resonator  portion of the oscillator circuit. The resonator  can be any reactive resonant structure such as a half wave dipole or a microstrip ring resonator, with its dielectric being a ferroelectric material whose effective capacitance is a function of the tuning voltage. This change in capacitance will tune the resonant frequency. The corresponding change in frequency is proportional to the square root of the effective dielectric constant.","Referring now to  ferroelectric material  is metal plated on both sides , \u2032. A biasing voltage \u201cV\u201d is applied to these plates by conductors  and \u2032 respectively, setting up an electric field within the ferroelectric material . When used as a resonator, the ferroelectric's permittivity is controlled by an external D.C. source, which is connected in parallel with the capacitance of the microstrip trace . The parameters of the microstrip shown in , are unaffected by the addition of this field. The bottom plated metal \u2032 of  is in electrical contact with a ground plane . The microstrip trace ground plane  is separated from the ferroelectric resonator \u2032 by coupling gaps , \u2032 and dielectric material . The voltage addition changes the resonator's overall capacitance and in turn the resonant frequency. With a given D.C. voltage swing, the amount of capacitive shift can be altered by proper selection of the composition of the ferroelectric material. The ferractor oscillator can be made to tune over a wide bandwith, comparable with YIG\u2014tuned oscillators, while at the same time, have the rapid tuning speed of a varactor-tuned oscillator.","Referring now to , complete ferractor oscillators are shown with the ferroelectric material used in place of a conventional varactor.  shows the ferroelectric material  used to change the capacitance of the resonator  in a similar  fashion to a semiconductor varactor.  shows the ferroelectric material \u2032 located in the resonator portion of the circuit.  show frequency tuned ferractor oscillator layouts having a ferroelectric voltage driver  operatively connected to the ferroelectric material  and \u2032 in feedback loop .","In operation the microwave signal goes through one or more amplification stages to boost the signal level. The first amplifier  and second amplifier  have input and output matching stubs , \u2032 and , \u2032 respectively, to minimize reflection at the ports of the amplifier. Once amplified, a portion of the signal power is coupled, or devided, into the feedback loop which once again amplifies the microwave signal, thereby reaching a steady state after a few iterations through the loop. The amount of energy fed back must cause the loop gain to be greater than unity. The result is a stable RF signal at RF output port  with a quality factor (Q) comparable to that of a varactor tuned oscillator. The development of a ferractor controlled oscillator is based on the intrinsic behavior of the ferroelectric material. The example ferractor layouts of  include gate bias amplifier input stub elements , \u2032 which include gate resistors , \u2032 electrically coupled to ground via metal conductors  and \u2032 respectively. Each of the amplifiers  and  include drain bias stubs  and \u2032 respectively which contain resistor and capacitor tank elements  and \u2032 respectively. The aforementioned resistors and capacitances are connected to ground via metal conductors , \u2032.","In an alternate embodiment the resonant devise, shown in  may be constructed entirely of ferroelectric material. This embodiment creates a distributed effect in which the change in frequency is proportional to the change in the effective wavelength of the signal in the material. Presently, a limitation of this embodiment is that the ferroelectric material has a very high dielectric tangential loss. The device may be constructed using Ba\u00d7Sn1-\u00d7Ti03, however any ferroelectric material that exhibits a change in permittivity due to an applied field will work. By using alternate material compositions or changing frequency ranges, a broad range of device performances are obtainable. The size and thickness of the ferroelectric material can be customized for a particular application that requires a particular voltage range or region of frequencies.","While specific embodiments of the invention have been shown and described in detail to illustrate the application of the principles of the invention, it will be understood that the invention may be embodied otherwise without departing from such principles."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00009","num":"00009"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00010","num":"00010"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00011","num":"00011"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00012","num":"00012"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00013","num":"00013"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
