Automatic modulation recognition is a tool in selecting the correct demodulation scheme automatically without hand shaking between the transmitter and receiver. Since the existing modulation recognition methods are time consuming and computationally intensive, a fast and simplified modulation recognition method is essential to meet the requirement of designing a cognitive radio with the real time adaptive demodulation and lower false modulation detection rate.","With the revolution of digitizing communications ever closer to the antenna, SDR with programmable modulation schemes and transmission rates has become a practical wireless communication platform. Recently, modulation classification techniques have attracted much attention in SDR applications to develop cognitive radios with automatic modulation scheme recognition and selection. The concept is to exploit the radio transmission environment and choose the best modulation scheme to maximize the channel capacity in real time. The general principles of SDRs and modulation classifications or schemes are presented in the following publications which are incorporated herein in their entirety: Y. Huang and A. Polydoros, Likelihood methods for MPSK modulation classification. ., vol. 43, 1493-1504; J. Sills, Maximum-likelihood modulation classification for PSK\/QAM. 99, 1999, 57-61; K. Umebayshi et al., \u201cBlind estimation of the modulation scheme adapted to noise power based on a concept of software define radio,\u201d in Proc. in European Wireless 2002(EW2002), pp. 829-834 (2002-02); O. Menguc and F. Jondral, \u201cAir interface recognition for a software radio system exploiting cyclostationarity,\u201d in Proc. of the 15th IEEE Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications, Vol. 3, September 2004, pp. 1947-1951. The concept of automatic modulation classification is also discussed in \u201cReal-time Modulation Classification Based on Maximum Likelihood,\u201d by Wei Su, Jefferson L. Xu and Mengchu Zhou. This publication was presented to the IEEE in about November 2008 and is incorporated herein in its entirety. Further discussion of software-defined radio and modulation recognition is presented in \u201cSoftware Defined Radio Equipped with Rapid Modulation Recognition\u201d by Jefferson L. Xu, Wei Su, , IEEE and Mengchu Zhou, , which is also incorporated herein in its entirety. The latter publication was also presented to the IEEE in about October 2009.","In cognitive radio, the signal data can be transmitted frame by frame. The modulation scheme in each data frame was determined depending upon the channel condition estimated before the transmission. The adaptive modulation scheme maintains the bit-error rate (BER) below a certain threshold to ensure the quality of the service in data transmission. To do this, a known pilot symbol is used in the transmitted data frame to indicate the modulation scheme for proper demodulation of the receiver.","Recently, some research has been done on migrating the existing automatic modulation classification algorithms to recognize the modulation scheme change automatically without the redundant pilot symbols. A common practice is to have a modulation estimator to operate in parallel with a programmable demodulator in the receiver. A change in the modulation scheme of the transmitter in each data frame will be detected and the demodulator will be cued to change the demodulation scheme accordingly. The objective of the automatic modulation recognition is to identify the modulation scheme of a transmitted signal with a high probability of success within a short observation time. The popular algorithms are maximum likelihood based approaches such as average likelihood ratio test (ALRT) and generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT), high-order statistics based approaches such as moments and cumulants, cyclic frequency based approaches, and some other approaches such as zero-crossing and spectral correlation etc.","Most of the existing practical automatic modulation classification methods have been developed for military applications which are time-consuming and computationally intensive in order to meet the blind and non-cooperative signal collection environment. However, the commercial cognitive radios operate in the quite different environment and face the different challenges. The prompt and low-cost processing are the key to success and new techniques are needed to meet the real-time demodulation capability.","The present invention is directed to a method for automatic modulation recognition in an adaptive modulation based cognitive software defined radio (SDR), comprising receiving a signal from a transmitter into the SDR; inputting a frame of data r(k) from the signal, k=1, 2, . . . , K; estimating the signal to noise ratio (SNR) for said frame of data r(k); feeding back the channel condition to the transmitter; selecting one of a plurality of predetermined modulation schemes from a database; determining for the one of a plurality of predetermined modulation schemes whether SNR(r(k)) is less than or equal to a predetermined threshold T; reporting a failure if SNR(r(k)) is less than or equal to a predetermined threshold T; estimating the mean b(k) for r(k) if SNR(r(k)) is not less than or equal to a predetermined threshold T; calculating \u2225r(k)\u2212{circumflex over (b)}(k)\u2225; accumulating to calculate",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0008"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"g","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"i"}},"mo":"=","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"k","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"K"},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["\uf605","\uf606"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"r","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"k"}},{"msup":{"mover":{"mi":"b","mo":"^"},"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"i"}},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"k"}}],"mo":"-"}},"mn":"2"}}},"mo":";"}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0009"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00004","num":"00004"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"g","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"i"}},"mo":"=","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"k","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"K"},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["\uf605","\uf606"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"r","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"k"}},{"msup":{"mover":{"mi":"b","mo":"^"},"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"i"}},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"k"}}],"mo":"-"}},"mn":"2"}}},"mo":";"}}},"br":{}},"In one preferred embodiment of the present invention, the method for fast automatic modulation recognition in an adaptive modulation based cognitive software defined radio (SDR) further comprises providing a buffer wherein the signal frame of data r(k) is inputted from the buffer.

The SNR of the communication channel is estimated and fed back to the transmitter  via the digital-to-analog converter (DAC)  and T\/R .","The modulation recognition process is described by a flowchart shown in , which takes the data frame in step  from the buffer to coarse estimate the SNR in step  to feed back to the transmitter  in step  to select the modulation scheme of the next transmitting data frame, and to determine if there is sufficient signal power to demodulate the current received data frame with respect to the hypothesis H. Assuming there is L number of hypotheses in step  that pass the SNR test in step block , the assessment values g, g, gare calculated via the i-loop between step block  and step block . The value gis calculated via the k-loop between block step  and step block . Then, the minimum value gis found in step  and checked with the condition in step block . If gpasses the test along the Yes route in , the modulation scheme is recognized and reported in step . Notice that according to various embodiments, the calculation from step block  to step block  can be implemented by parallel processing or by pre-calculated look-up tables. Therefore the modulation scheme can be recognized promptly, with simple processing, before the arrival of the next data frame.","An alternative implementation of choosing the hypothesis His to use a bank of matched filters as shown in .
