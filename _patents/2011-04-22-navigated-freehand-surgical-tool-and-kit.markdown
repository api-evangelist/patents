{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of priority of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/342,991, filed Apr. 22, 2010, on which this patent application is based and which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The present disclosure relates generally to methods, processes, apparatus, and systems for controlling a navigated freehand surgical tool. In particular, the present invention relates to a handpiece for a navigated freehand surgical tool for use in combination with at least one of the following: a tracking system; an electronic control unit; and a software application programming interface (API) for use with a surgical navigational system.","In a bone surgery such as, for example, a total knee replacement (\u201cTKR\u201d) procedure, it is important to carefully prepare a patient's bone to accept an implant in an anatomically correct, precise Location. Various bone cutting tools are available for use during this procedure. A navigated surgical tool may use electronic navigation to locate, fixate, adjust, and\/or correct the trajectory and cutting rate of the cutting tool based on a user-defined surgical plan, while allowing the surgeon to use a freehand cutting motion.","An operative navigated surgical tool may include such elements as, for example, a cutting drill having a rotating bur to provide the cuts on the bone, for example, an inner housing into which the drill is mounted, and parts or elements comprising the electronic tracking system, computing unit(s) and software to control and monitor the operations of the cutting tool, etc.","In order to assist in the cutting of the drill, a user and\/or surgeon may perform their surgery as usual using the navigation system for additional guidance and understanding of location of the drill. Other systems may be employed to fully automate the cut in the case of a robotic navigation system having a fixed target to assure a pre-determined cut.","Conventional systems may permit control methods wherein a free-hand tool can be used with navigational assistance such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,757,582, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. A navigational system as disclosed therein, provides control for a user\/surgeon by determining a distance between the cutting tool and the target shape, and robotically assisting the user\/surgeon to make the desired shape on the bone.","Further a user\/surgeon may wish to or may be accustomed to using specific drill(s), tracking systems, and\/or navigation software for navigated surgeries. However, such user-chosen components (drill, tracking system, etc.) may not operate with or may not be used with currently available, vendor-provided navigated surgical tools. In such a case, the user may have to settle with the surgical system provided by a vendor. It is therefore desirable to provide a navigated surgical tool that can accommodate a wide variety of user-selected surgical drills and tracking systems and can also operate with navigation software, thereby giving the user\/surgeon more flexibility in implementing a navigated surgical system with a desired navigated surgical tool.","Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a handpiece that provides desirable functionality of speed and extension control, that overcome some or all of the drawbacks and deficiencies in the prior art.","In addition, it is an object of the present invention to provide such a handpiece for a navigated surgical tool that can accommodate a wide variety of user-selected surgical tools, configured to work with a handpiece, and tracking systems and can also operate with a variety of navigation software. Accordingly, the navigated freehand surgical tool kit may include a handpiece, an electronic control unit, a software API to allow a user to \u201cbuild\u201d or configure an operative navigated surgical tool wherein a user-selected surgical drill becomes configured to work with a handpiece, tracking system, and navigation software.","In one preferred and non-limiting embodiment, the present invention is directed to a handpiece arrangement for a tool having a retaining member configured to receive t least a portion of the tool in a secure position, a guard configured to cover a portion of the tool, at least one mounting member configured to receive at least a portion of a tracking system and an actuator mounted to the handpiece. The actuator may be in communication with the retaining member and is configured to move the retaining member with respect to the guard.","In another embodiment, the present invention includes a navigational surgical tool including an end effector configured to shape an object, a tracker configured to indicate the position of the end effector, and a handpiece having a first attachment portion configured to retain at least a portion of the tool and a second attachment portion configured to retain the tracker.","In another embodiment, the present invention includes a navigational surgical tool system including a surgical tool, a tracking system configured to make the location of the tool known, a handpiece configured to receive at least a portion of the tool and a guard configured to cover at least a portion of the tool. The handpiece is further configured to move the tool.","In another embodiment, the present invention includes a handpiece arrangement for a tool having a retaining member configured to receive at least a portion of the tool, a guard configured to cover at least a portion of the tool, at least one mounting member configured to receive at least a portion of a tracking system, an actuator mounted to the handpiece and configured to control the exposure of at least portion of the tool relative to the guard.","In one preferred and non-limiting embodiment, provided is a navigated surgery kit is including a tracking system, a tool in communication with the tracking system, a platform in communication with the tracking system and the tool. The platform may have a processor, a computer readable storage medium having computer readable program code configured to selectively control shaping of an object with the tool via at least one hidden object associated with a predetermined navigated surgical operation. The computer readable program code may have computer readable program code configured to: 1) selectively control shaping of an object with the tool via at least one hidden object associated with a predetermined navigated surgical operation; 2) provide at least one application programming interface object that interfaces with the hidden objects; and 3) provide at least one object template that specifies at least one task configurable for operation on the platform.","These and other features and characteristics of the present invention, as well as the methods of operation and functions of the related elements of structures and combinations of parts and economies of manufacture, will become more apparent upon consideration of the following description and the appended claims with reference to the accompanying drawings, all of which form a part of this specification, wherein like reference numerals designate corresponding parts in the various figures. It is to be expressly understood, however, that the drawings are for the purpose of illustration and description only and are not intended to unduly limit the present invention. As used in the specification and the claims, the singular form of \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d, and \u201cthe\u201d include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.","For purposes of the description hereinafter, the terms \u201cupper\u201d, \u201clower\u201d, \u201cright\u201d, \u201cleft\u201d, \u201cvertical\u201d, \u201chorizontal\u201d, \u201ctop\u201d \u201cbottom\u201d, \u201clateral\u201d \u201clongitudinal\u201d and related derivatives thereof shall relate to the invention as it is oriented in the drawing figures. However, it is to be understood that the present invention may assume various alternative variations and step sequences, except where expressly specified to the contrary. It is also to be understood that the specific devices and processes illustrated in the attached drawings, and described in the following specification, are simply exemplary embodiments of the invention. Hence, specific dimensions and other physical characteristics related to the embodiments disclosed herein are not to be considered as unduly limiting.","It is to be understood that the invention may assume various alternative variations and step sequences, except where expressly specified to the contrary. It is also to be understood that the specific devices and processes illustrated in the attached drawings, and described in the following specification, are simply exemplary embodiments of the invention.","Optical navigation is used in surgery to track a rigid body's location in space.  illustrates a simplified view of an exemplary surgical navigation setup having a tracking system such as, for example, an infrared camera  and a tracker  that may be used to perform surgical navigation. The tracker A may be rigidly attached to any object , such as a drill for example, that the user\/surgeon wishes to track during the surgical procedure. The tracker A may comprise a unique configuration of markers  such as infrared reflective markers, for example. The camera  takes continuous pictures of the workspace during the surgical procedure, and the markers  may then be detected from those pictures.","Other position tracking systems may be used within the spirit and scope of the invention including, but not limited to, electromagnetic, inertial, hybrid, etc. Using the known rigid spatial relationship of the markers  on the image frame obtained by the camera , the position (i.e., the location and orientation) of the object  in a 3D (three dimensional) space can be determined. The location of the object  can be continuously output to a computer program that can integrate this location with patient anatomy positional information that may be obtained from a CT scan or ultrasound image, for example, thus permitting a determination of the location and orientation of the object  with respect to a remainder or reference potion of the patient anatomy. The location and orientation of object  relative to the patient anatomy, such as bone , also can be continuously displayed on a display terminal or monitor . Thus, the user\/surgeon will be able to know and understand the location of the object  relative to the bone .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["15","26","20","22","28","30","28","30","20","22"]},"The handpiece  may have an outer housing  and an inner housing  that receives at least a portion of the drill . The handpiece  may be configured to function as a robotically controlled shuttle that accepts and supports the user-supplied surgical drill  configured to be supported by the handpiece . The end effector  may be a rotating bur or other cutting member to cut the bone to a desired geometry and further acts as the primary motive drive generally to cut the patient anatomy. The drill  may thus be mechanically configured to couple to a drill-moving assembly  via guard attachment mechanism  disposed in the inner housing  of the handpiece .","A modular guard  also may be mounted on the drill  to control exposure of the end effector . The outer housing  may include a locking mechanism  such as a snap lock, threads, a snap-and-twist joint, etc. for easy attachment and detachment of the modular guard . The guard  is designed to shield the action of the end effector  of the drill  when the handpiece  of the navigated surgical tool  is in a \u201cretracted\u201d state. The guard  can be symmetric or asymmetric, but it is preferable to have the opening of the guard  lie near the central axis X-X of the drill  when the guard  is mounted on the handpiece . The optional guard  may preferably be provided with a guard attachment mechanism , as shown in , as part of the tool kit to allow the user\/surgeon to employ their desired guard  that may comprise various shapes to suit the procedure. The handpiece  may further be constructed of rigid plastic and\/or metal, for example, to support the tracker A and drill .","As can be seen in , a user may select the drill  from a number of drills having an engagement portion  compatible with the handpiece . Engagement portion  may be a collar with extensions, threads, or other suitable configurations as described herein for engaging a retaining member  within the inner housing . Accordingly, the drill  may be easily attached to the handpiece  within the inner housing  by the user\/surgeon such that the handpiece  provides semi-robotic functionality for a standard drill . In one embodiment, the retaining member  such as, for example, a threaded aperture, quarter-turn snap lock mechanism.","The handpiece  may further include a drill-moving assembly  that may include an actuator  such as, for example a servomotor, solenoid, pneumatic drive, linear motor, etc. as shown in . Once attached, the drill  can be moved relative to the outer handpiece housing  through action of the actuator . The operation of actuator  may be controlled by the tool control unit  as discussed below and actuator may thus provide a secondary motive drive to the end effector  in and out of guard . Accordingly, actuator  may provide force to move the drill  along an \u201cexposure\u201d axis relative to the outer housing  that may preferably be coincident with the central axis X-X.","The design of the outer housing  may include distal support  for the drill  as shown in  not having guard  attached thereto. Distal support  may thus minimizes wobble at the end effector  of the drill  relative to the housing  to help stabilize the tool  during the cutting action. Such stability is desirable in surgical procedures where accuracy of cut is an important factor in a successful operation.","In one embodiment, the design of the outer housing  may also include mounting features, such as threaded apertures (not shown) to receive mounting members  to accept the tracker A. Mounting members  may be, in one embodiment for example, thumbscrew received by apertures in outer housing . Other mounting arrangement and\/or sensors may be implemented with the present invention in accordance with the same.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["12","34","35","14","15","35","15","22","20","20","15","34","22","20","12","17","14","20","15","16","14","17","16","20","15","17","16","17","10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["15","11","11","15","19"]},"As mentioned above, the inner housing  of the handpiece  may also include the drill-moving assembly . In one embodiment, the drill-moving assembly may include an actuator , gearhead , gears , a lead screw nut , a lead screw\/ball screw  and bearings  mounted on both ends of the lead screw . Accordingly as can be seen in , and described in greater detail below, the handpiece  may receive at least a portion of the user-selected drill  for controlling the generally standard OEM drill  and moving the same with respect to the handpiece .","A guard attachment mechanism  may further be provided with the handpiece  to allow attachment of a cylindrical guard  to the attachment mechanism  for providing a shield to control the end effector . As can be seen in , the guard  may thus be attached to the attachment mechanism  while the inner housing  of the handpiece  may receive at least a portion of the drill  and may be mounted therein generally along the central axis X-X. Accordingly, various modular guards  may be implemented according to the desired user\/surgeon preference.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["15","26","51","50","20","36","22","52","15","22","52","15","22","52"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["15","12","13","20","44","26","26","22","20","26","15","15"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8","FIG. 12"],"b":["38","40","42","46","24","38","40","42","46","46","44","46","44","37","36","37","46","22","26","20","19","15","22"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIGS. 9 and 12","FIG. 9","FIG. 9"],"b":["15","20","21","36","15","20","22","26","37","26","26","22","52","51","50","52","26","50"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["20","19","22","22","37","38","15"]},"As mentioned before, the exposure control (via ECU  shown in ) of the end effector  may be necessary to prevent overcutting or erroneous cutting of the bone . When a bur retraction is desired to prevent damage to the bone , the exposure control module (not shown) in the ECU  may provide an appropriate signal to the actuator , which, in turn, may rotate the lead screw  via rotation of the gears . Thus, the rotating lead screw  axially moves the nut  towards the rear end of the housing , thereby also moving the drill  and end effector , which is mechanically coupled to the nut  via the attached retaining member . Thus, forward and backward motions of the end effector  can be obtained through appropriate rotation of the lead screw  by the actuator .","In accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, the design of the outer housing  may further include suitable strain relief for the communication and driver cables that attach to the electronic control unit (ECU) . Exemplary cables\/connections are shown in , , and . The control unit  may contain electronic circuitry for signal control, amplification, and filtering, as well as communications and safety-related circuits.","In accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, and as shown in , signal and driver electrical lines that run from the handpiece  to the electronic control unit  can include: one signal cable A attached to the drill  for drill speed control; and a second cable A attached to the actuator . The cable A contains leads for power and positional feedback signals. The electronic control unit  provides those signals to the cable A from an included power control module (not shown). This power control module accepts positional commands from computer , which may communicate to the control unit  via a communication protocol (e.g., a USB [universal serial bus]-based signal communication). The power control module may then translate these commands to suitable voltages to be provided as driver signals to the actuator . The linear advancement of the drill  (i.e., the exposure of the end effector  relative to the bone  being cut) can be thus controlled by suitable modulation of the driver signals to the actuator .","In accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, the ECU  may further include or encompass a microprocessor or microcontroller (not shown) that performs various tasks such as, for example, checking of consistency of data (e.g., data received from various data input sources such as the actuator ), communications with devices attached to the ECU , interpretation of data received from various sensors (e.g., data received from the tracking system  via the computer , or feedback signals received from the actuator ), and providing feedback and \u201cwatchdog\u201d functionality to the overall operation of the drill-containing handpiece . In one embodiment, the ECU  also includes control circuitry that modulates the speed of the attached surgical drill by taking, as input, a signal from an operator-controlled foot pedal (or trigger)  and, in comparison to the commands given by the computer , by providing a modified speed signal to the drill  (via cable A). This modified speed signal thus allows an extra layer of safety and control of bone cutting by controlling the cutting rate of the drill in a reasonably conservative manner based on the feedback signals received (by the ECU ) from the computer  in response to the tracking data obtained from the tracking system  (which tracks the relative position of the drill burr  with respect to the bone ).","In addition to the drill-less handpiece  and the ECU , the surgical tool kit, according to one embodiment of the present invention, also includes a software API to allow a manufacturer (e.g., a third-party manufacturer) to integrate the handpiece  with a surgical navigation system. Thus, the handpiece  (when inserted with an appropriate drill) can be used as a navigated surgical tool in conjunction with a surgical navigation system. Such an API is schematically illustrated, by way of non-restrictive example, in .","In accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, and as shown in , the API  can include a tool model  as well as a tool control module . During surgery, the API  can implement a command set  to directly command the handpiece  (e.g., via commands provided by an end user application  at a host computer, such as \u201cgo to exposure position X\u201d [] and \u201cset burr speed to Y %\u201d [], etc.).","In accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, and as illustrated by way of non-restrictive example in , API  can also include a bone model  and bone preparation algorithms . The bone model  can accept as input, from an end user application , a software model pertaining to bone information (such as shape information ) while bone preparation algorithms  can accept as input a surgical plan  and intra-operative position information (such as relative positions of the handpiece  [] and the bone  to be cut [], as well as the shape of the bone []). The bone model  and bone preparation algorithms , in conjunction with tool model  and tool control , can provide real-time control of the handpiece  by communicating with the ECU . The elements shown in  may be utilized together. Any of a wide variety of specific methods and systems can be employed to control a shaping tool (such as the handpiece  when fitted with a drill), such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,757,582, supra.","In accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, the API  may be installed on a host computer (e.g., the computer  in ), and, merely by way of example, can be provided via a disc (e.g., a CD, a DVD, a floppy diskette, or any other data storage medium) or via a software download. In one embodiment, the API  provides a list of supported commands through which an existing computer program hosted on computer  can communicate with a shaping tool (e.g., the handpiece ). Such commands can act to affect computation or data storage both within the host computer  and with respect to the ECU microcontroller  (which, e.g., itself may be provided with its own software pre-installed therein by a surgical tool kit supplier). In one embodiment, this ECU software may be changeable only by a separate firmware upgrade process. The ECU software may communicate with the host computer  by a communication protocol implemented by both the ECU software and the API . The communication protocol, in a preferred embodiment, is supported by a high-speed USB connection.","In accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, as schematically illustrated in , the API  can be configured to provide a user interface display (e.g., on the monitor of the computer  [see ] or on any other dedicated display screen) so that the surgeon can see an augmented view of the cutting action and intra-operative bone models during the surgery. These interface elements can be incorporated with navigation software, thereby allowing easy integration of the components of a surgical tool kit (e.g., comprising the handpiece , the ECU , and the API ) with the user's choice of surgical navigation system. Accordingly, graphics display routines  can be included in API  to be in communication with the bone model  and tool model , while receiving a command () based on a prompt or input from end user application , e.g., to \u201cdraw bones and tools\u201d (). The elements shown in ,  and  may be utilized together.","From the foregoing, it can be appreciated that a navigated surgical tool kit, in accordance with at least one embodiment of the present invention, provides a surgeon (or hospital) a great degree of flexibility in implementing a navigated surgical system. The handpiece  of the kit provides a housing (equipped with suitable drill motion control and tracking attachments) to receive a surgeon's drill  to form a navigated surgical tool that the surgeon can use in a freehand manner, while providing an added layer of safety (under the control of the electronic control unit of the tool kit) that ensures a precise and accurate cut. Thus, the handpiece , when inserted with an appropriately configured drill , can be used as a navigated surgical tool in a surgical navigation system, such as a navigation system of a third party.","As such, it can further be appreciated that a software API of a tool kit, in accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, provides a visual interface  of patient anatomy as well as navigation information (e.g., relating to object  location and orientation) to guide the surgeon during a surgical procedure. These interface elements can be incorporated with existing navigation software, thereby allowing easy integration of the components of a present surgical tool kit (i.e., the handpiece , the electronic control unit, and the API) with the user's (e.g., surgeon's) choice of surgical navigation system. Thus, a navigated surgical tool is provided that can accommodate a wide variety of user-selected surgical drills and tracking systems and can also operate with third-party navigation software, thereby giving the user (e.g., a surgeon or a hospital) more flexibility in implementing a navigated surgical system.","In accordance with at least one variant embodiment of the invention, as shown in , various modules and\/or functions and\/or elements can be split between an API  and an ECU . Conceivably, any or all of the elements described with respect to  as being resident in or associated with an API can be hosted in or associated with ECU .  provides but one illustrative and non-restrictive example of this possibility. Thus, as shown API  can accept as input a command set  based on prompts or input from an end user application , such as \u201chandpiece at position A\u201d (), \u201cbone at position B\u201d (), \u201csurgical plan is C\u201d () and \u201cbone shape is D\u201d (). While bone model  may be hosted in or associated with API , other elements such as a tool control module , a tool model  and bone preparation algorithms , can be hosted in or associated with ECU , whereupon these elements are in communication with a handpiece .","Although the invention has been described in detail for the purpose of illustration based on what is currently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiment(s), it is to be understood that such detail is solely for that purpose and that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments, but, on the contrary, is intended to cover modifications and equivalent arrangements that are within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. For example, it is to be understood that the present invention contemplates that, to the extent possible, one or more features of any embodiment can be combined with one or more features of any other embodiment. Since other modifications and changes varied to fit particular operating requirements and environments will be apparent to those skilled in the art, the invention is not considered limited to the example chosen for purposes of disclosure, and covers all changes and modifications which do not constitute departures from the spirit and scope of this invention."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 7"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 7"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 7"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 16"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
