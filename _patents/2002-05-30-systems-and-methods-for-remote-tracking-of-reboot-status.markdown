title: Systems and methods for remote tracking of reboot status
abstract: Systems and methods consistent with the present invention provide for remote tracking of the reboot status for a plurality of user terminals. Each user terminal runs a start-up routine capable of creating a record of information about the terminal, including reboot status. The record of information is stored in log file on a file server, along with the records of information from other user terminals. A collection routine executed by a central server collects the log files from the file servers and stores the records in a database. Based on the records stored in the database, various status reports may be generated that reflect, among other things, a reboot status associated with the user terminals over a predetermined period of time.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to the field of computer operating systems and more particularly to methods and systems for the remote tracking of reboot status of components in a distributed system.","2. Background and Material Information","Computer operating systems operate generally to control and manage the resources of a computer system. Typically, an operating system begins execution upon a power-on or start-up of the computer system by a sequence of events known as bootstrapping or booting. The operating system is started or \u201cbooted\u201d by executing a portion of code commonly referred to as boot code.","Once the operating system is properly booted, the computer system may begin normal operations. During these operations, the computer system may experience an event that causes an interrupt to the system. Various forms of events may cause the system interrupt, such as a shut down event (e.g., the user directing the shut down of the computer) or computer crash event. During a shut down event, the operating system receives a shut down command, which directs the computer system to perform standard shutdown procedures that may result in a reboot of the operating system. A crash event may occur when the operating system does not receive the shutdown command following a shut down event.","To aid in prevention and\/or recovery efforts associated with shut down and crash events, conventional computer systems employ reporting tools that may log information associated with the detected shut down or crash events. These reporting tools may provide local \u201chealth\u201d reports that indicate, among other things, the type of event detected (e.g., shut down and\/or crash event). Although these tools provide information that may aid in the analysis, and perhaps recovery, of such events, their use is restricted to the local system that runs the tool. For example, in a distributed computing environment including a plurality of computer systems, each system may run a reporting tool that provides error and\/or fault status information associated with their respective system.","Currently, there are no systems that collect information associated with reboot, shut down, and\/or crash events at a centralized remote location. Therefore, managers of such distributed environments may find it difficult to track the status and ramifications of localized shut down or crash events. In some instances, the manager may be required to visit each local computer system to collect a corresponding health report. Accordingly, there is a need for methods and systems that allows computer system health reports to be provided to a centralized location in a distributed computing environment.","Systems and methods consistent with the present invention provide for remote tracking of the reboot status for a plurality of user terminals. Each user terminal runs a start-up routine capable of creating a record of information about the terminal, including reboot status. The record of information is stored in log file on a file server, along with the records of information from other user terminals. A collection routine on a central server collects the log files from the file servers and stores the records from the log files in a database. Based on the records stored in the database, various status reports may be generated that reflect, among other things, a reboot status associated with the user terminals over a predetermined period of time.","The following detailed description of the invention refers to the accompanying drawings. While the description includes exemplary embodiments, other embodiments are possible, and changes may be made to the embodiments described without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. The following detailed description does not limit the invention. Instead, the scope of the invention is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.","Methods and systems consistent with certain principles related to the invention provide a reboot tracking system for the generation of reports in a distributed computing environment including a plurality of user terminals that are connected to a server system. Each user terminal runs a start-up routine when the terminal is started. The start-up routine determines the information needed to create a record that is a listing of information associated with the respective user terminal. For example, the record may include a flag indicating whether the user terminal crashed. The start-up routine may also start an application that monitors the user terminal for a \u201cShut Down\u201d command that, if received, indicates a proper shutdown by the user terminal. In one embodiment of the present invention, records from a number of terminals in the distributed computing environment are stored in a data file associated with a file server. The user terminals may periodically update the data file, which may be located on the file server. A collection routine at a central server collects information in the data file from the file servers and stores the information in a database on the central server. The database on the central server is then used to generate reports that indicate, among other things, the reboot status of the user terminal.","The above-noted features and principles of the present invention may be implemented in various environments. Such environments and related applications may be specially constructed for performing the various processes and operations of the invention or they may include a general purpose computer or computing platform selectively activated or reconfigured by program code to provide the necessary functionality.

For example, various general purpose machines may be used with programs written in accordance with teachings of the invention, or it may be more convenient to construct a specialized apparatus or system to perform the required methods and techniques.","Embodiments of the present invention also relate to computer readable media that include program instructions or program code for performing various computer-implemented operations based on the methods and processes of the invention. The program instructions may be those specially designed and constructed for the purposes of the invention, or they may be of the kind well known and available to those having skill in the computer software arts.

For example, I\/O devices  may include a keyboard, pointing device, or other like input devices that allows system  to receive data from a user. Further, I\/O devices  may include a display device that presents information to a user.","Network interface  may be any type of interface device that allows system  to communicate with computing systems or components external to system , via network . System bus  may be any type of bus configured in any type of configuration that allows data to be exchanged between the components of system . For example, system bus  may be a bi-directional system bus, containing thirty-two bit address lines for addressing a memory  and thirty-two bit data lines across which data is transferred among the components. Alternatively, multiplexed data\/address lines may be used instead of separate data and address lines. One skilled in the art would recognize that any type of system bus may be employed by system  without departing from the scope of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["150","310","320","110","114","110","118","150","110","118","150","150","110","118","150"]},"Further, routine  may collect status and\/or state information associated with the respective terminal \u2013 executing the routine . The status information may include reboot and\/or crash information. Reboot information may be associated with the status of the respective terminal \u2013 during a boot-up or reboot procedure. For example, reboot information may include data reflecting whether the terminal experienced a hard or soft shut down event that caused the system to reboot.","Crash information may reflect status and\/or state information associated with a crash of the respective terminal. Further, start-up routine  may include a shut down routine  that monitors an operating system running in the respective terminal \u2013 to determine whether it has received a \u201cShut Down\u201d command. During a shut down event, the operating system is configured to receive a shut down command from shut down processes operating within terminal \u2013. When a shut down command is received by the operating system, shut down routine  may designate the computer as having shutdown normally.","Start-up routine  may gather the status and state information associated with the respective terminal \u2013 executing the routine and generate a record. A record may be a file that includes the collected state and status information. Start-up routine  may provide the generated record to a file server, such as file server  or .  shows a diagram of an exemplary record consistent with an embodiment of the present invention. As shown, record  includes the fields of \u201cuser and context\u201d , CPU speed , RAM , OS , Template Build , Computer NetBios name , Network cards MAC Address , Time and Date stamp  and Reboot\/Crash Flag . The information that is collected is designed to gather the data needed to create reports on terminal and system health.","\u201cUser and context\u201d  is a Network Login name and the organizational unit of the user operating terminal \u2013. This information may be used by system architectures  and  to identify terminals and\/or their operators. For example, field  may be used by, for example, support personnel for identifying individual terminals and\/or operators that are experiencing various shut down and crash event trends. Further, the context of a user may be used to indicate if terminals associated with one organizational unit are restarting more frequently than terminals associated with other organizational units.","CPU  is the processor speed of the terminal. This information can be used for trending, such as determining if one CPU reboots more than another. RAM  may reflect one or more memory devices installed in the terminal and may also be used for trending. For example, a user may identify from a plurality of records  whether one type of memory device (e.g., size, manufacturer, etc.) are present in terminals that show a tendency of experiencing more reboots than other memory devices. For example, support personnel may justify upgrading the memory devices installed in the terminals of an organizational unit based on an identification of the type of memory device identified by field  in records  provided by the terminals in that organizational unit.","OS  is the operating system installed in the terminal \u2013. OS field  may be used by system architectures  and  to identify trends associated with the operating systems included in the terminals operating in the respective distributed systems. For example, users may use field  to identify trends associated with terminals that experience shut down and\/or crash events. For instance, based on the OS filed from a plurality of records  provided by terminals \u2013, a user (or a program executed by a processor) may determine that a particular type of operating system is installed on terminals that have experienced a pattern of abnormal shut downs. This information may be used to justify upgrades or changes in these operating systems.","Template  is the \u201cbuild\u201d number of the image file used on the terminal.","The image file contains everything to be installed on a terminal, such as the operating system and all of the software. The image file is used to \u201cbuild\u201d or replicate the system on a set of terminals. Each terminal for which a specific image was used will have an identical system. Template  indicates which version of an image file is used. Template  may be used be users (or programs executed by a processor) to identify problems with specific image files. For example, if one version is crashing significantly more than another in the same organizational unit, this may indicate a problem with the template.","Name  is the Net Bios name of the terminal. Name  may be used to track a terminal that is experiencing problems, such as abnormal operations. A user, such as a technician, may use this tracking information to identify the terminal, as well as correlate the identified problem with a trouble ticket. A trouble ticket is a representation, such as a job request, used by support personnel to identify and track problems associated with various components in system architectures , , including terminals \u2013.","Mac  is a unique network address that is burned into the network card. This field may be used by a user (or program executed by a process) to identify terminals for use in reports generated by central server . Date and Time  reflects the date and time terminal \u2013 generated the record .","Flag  may be an indicator of whether the terminal restarted normally or crashed the last time it was shut down. In one embodiment of the present invention, a \u201c0\u201d indicates a Crash (an abnormal shutdown) and \u201c1\u201d indicates that the terminal shutdown normally. Different types of flags, such as various bit sizes, coded information, etc., may be implemented without departing from the scope of the invention.

For example, log file  includes record information corresponding to a plurality of users identified by user column  (e.g., \u201cLEpps\u201d) and taken from \u201cuser and context\u201d  in a record  (). Context  may include information that corresponds to the \u201cuser and context\u201d  for each identified user (e.g., the context for LEpps is \u201cCRA.KN1.KNO.RIC.COS\u201d). CPU column  may correspond to the CPU speed field  included in record  (e.g., CPU speed of \u201c266\u201d for user LEpps' terminal). RAM column  may include information corresponding to the RAM field  in record  (e.g., RAM=\u201c64\u201d for user LEpps' terminal). OS column  may include information corresponding to the OS field  in record , which indicates the type of operating system executing in a respective user terminal (e.g., user LEpps' terminal is running the \u201cWindows95\u201d operating system provided by Microsoft\u00ae).","Template column  includes information that corresponds to the template build field  in record , while Computer Name column  may include information corresponding to the computer NetBios name field  in record  (e.g., the NetBios Name of LEpps' terminal is \u201cKN13617\u201d). MAC column  in network cards MAC address field  in record  (e.g., the Network Cards MAC Address of LEpps' terminal is \u201c:0008C78CF5B0\u201d). Date column  includes information corresponding to the time date stamp field  in record  (e.g., LEpps' terminal created its corresponding record on the date of \u201cJan. 8, 2002\u201d). Reboot time column  includes information that indicates a time when a terminal had to be rebooted (e.g., LEpps' terminal was rebooted at \u201c6:23:26 AM\u201d).","Last, flag column  includes information corresponding to the reboot crash flag field  in record . Flag  indicates whether a corresponding terminal experienced a crash. For example, a flag setting of \u201c0\u201d may indicate that the terminal experienced a crash event, while a flag setting of \u201c1\u201d may indicate that the terminal did not experience a crash event (e.g., normal shutdown). One skilled in the art would recognize that the information included in log file  may include different types of information associated with the status and state of a terminal. Accordingly, log file  is not limited to the information included in record  and may be supplemented or complimented with other status information. Moreover, the format of exemplary log file  is not limited to that shown in . One skilled in the art would recognize that any type of configuration and\/or format of the information included in log file  may be implemented without departing from the scope of the present invention.","The information in the log file can be used to generate reports; spot trends in system health; and determine training, performance and application issues.","As previously described, in one embodiment, file servers ,  may maintain the record information in log file  until requested by central server .  is a diagram of an exemplary configuration included in central server  consistent with certain features related to the present invention. As shown, collection routine  may be a process executed by central server  in a manner consistent with the present invention and exchanges information with a statistical database . Statistical database may be a memory device that stores information provided by collection routine  and provides data to processing elements and\/or processes executing central server  to produce reports. In one embodiment, central server  may execute collection routine  to retrieve log files  from file servers  and . Routine  may direct processing elements operating with server  to issue a request to file servers  and  for a log file. In response to the request, servers  and  may provide the log files  to server  where routine  directs server  to store the files in statistical database .

Some reports may be focused on individual terminals and users, while other reports may focus on the overall system. For example, the MAC field  may be used to key reports to specific terminals, because the value of MAC field  is unique to a single terminal. This field can also be used to identify and count the number of terminals operating in a distributed environment (e.g. architecture ) for use in reports generated by central server .","Server  may generate a report using a variety of different configurations, processes, and modelling tools. For example, in one embodiment, server  may generate a report using a combination of a user interface front end, such as a Visual Basic front end (e.g. SnapShot) and a statistical modelling and database tool, such as Excel by Microsoft\u00ae. One skilled in the art would recognize that the reports could be generated with any number of front ends, statistical modelling tools, and database tools without departing from the scope of the present invention. The statistical modelling and database tool may be used generate reports based on selected criteria predetermined by a user. The statistical modeling and database tool may be a database management system (DBMS), which is a collection of programs enabling the storage, modification, and extraction of information from a database.","Server  may generate reports that are specific to a variety of different predetermined criteria. For example, server  may be configured to generate a report that identifies one or more users that may have training or performance issues. Server may generate this type of report by running a database tool identify the average number of crashes each terminal experiences in a given period of time, such as a month. The database tool may then sum the number of crashes for each terminal and generate a report that identify terminals that show a trend of experiences an above average number of crashes The crash trends of terminals \u2013 may be provided in a report that may be used by a user (or a program executed by a processor) associated with central server  to target specific terminals for monitoring. For example, server  may initiate a target monitoring process that monitors terminals that have an above average crash rate for subsequent shut down and\/or crash events. A trend of an above average number of shut down and\/or crash events on a healthy terminal may reflect an inadequately trained individual operating that terminal.","Accordingly, server  may utilize the information provided in the records  provided by terminals \u2013 to generate reports that may reflect various trends.","For example, server  may generate a trend report for one or more terminals that experienced a certain number of crashes over a predetermined period of time. The trend report may be based on various terminal information, such as CPU, RAM, OS and Template Build, and can be summed to create a representation that reflects an overview of which types of terminals are particularly prone to problems. Trend reports may be used by system architectures ,  to justify upgrades or highlight problems with certain types of terminals or other components. For example, a graphical-based trend report may identify particular terminals or organizations that are crashing more than other terminals and\/or organizations. One skilled in the art would realize that a variety of different types of reports may be generated by server , such as summary and cost reports, without departing from the scope of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 9"],"b":["900","900","910","900","920","930","940","950","960","900"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["1000","900","1000","900","1010","220","220","1020","100","200","1030","1040"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["1100","1100","1100","220","220","1100"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 12"],"b":["1200","110","118","100","200","220","100","200","1200","110","118","100","200","1200"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 13","b":["1300","1300","1300"]},"To better describe certain features consistent with the present invention,  shows a flowchart of a process that distributed system  or  may perform to provide a reboot tracker report consistent with the present invention. Initially, when a terminal (e.g., \u2013) is started, the start-up routine  included in the respective terminal is executed (step ). During execution, start-up routine  may determine whether a record is to be created based on predetermined criteria. For example, start-up routine  may be configured to generate a record each time the terminal \u2013 is started. Alternatively, routine  may be configured to generate a record periodically, such as every hour, every 8 hours, every 24 hours, etc. Thus, if terminal \u2013 shuts down and starts up several times during the predetermined period, routine  will not generate a record until the predetermined period has expired. The record, however, will reflect the shut down and start up events during that period. Once routine  determines a record is to be generated, routine  may execute processes that collect the information used to generate a record, such as the information included in exemplary record  shown in  (step ). Each record created by terminal \u2013 may be stored in memory  for subsequent use by terminal \u2013 and\/or file server , .","Routine  may execute shutdown routine  (step ). In one embodiment of the invention, shut down routine  may, among other things, determine whether the shutdown is based on a normal or abnormal event (e.g., crash). At some point during execution of terminal \u2013, a shut down or crash event may occur. For example, a user operating terminal \u2013 may initiate a proper shut down procedure by activating a shut down program included in the terminal. Alternatively, the user may initiate an improper shut down procedure by simply turning off the terminal \u2013 without activating a shut down program. Further, terminal \u2013 may experience a fault or error that causes the terminal to either shut down properly or improperly.","Depending on whether terminal \u2013 experienced a normal or abnormal shutdown event, shut down routine  sets the reboot\/crash flag accordingly. For instance, if terminal \u2013 experienced a proper shutdown event, routine  may set the flag to \u201c1.\u201d Conversely, a crash event will not allow the shutdown routine to set the flag, so the flag will stay set at \u201c0.\u201d In one embodiment of the invention, the start-up routine interrogates the flag and stores its value in memory for use in record  (e.g., field ). Once the value of the flag has been stored, start-up routine  may reset the flag to \u201c0.\u201d Accordingly, the value of the flag is always set to \u201c0\u201d when a terminal is operating. The shutdown routine may be configured to set the flag to \u201c1\u201d each time the routine is executed, which is during a normal shutdown. Accordingly, a terminal that experiences a normal shutdown event will have the flag set to \u201c1\u201d by the shutdown routine. This may be reflected in the record  sent to file server , .","However, if a terminal experiences shutdown event and the flag was not set to \u201c1,\u201d this may reflect an abnormal shut down because the shut down routine did not set the flag to \u201c1.\u201d Therefore, if a terminal stops running normally (for any reason) the flag will still be set to \u201c0\u201d when the machine is subsequently started. This indicates that the terminal did not invoke the normal OS shutdown routine the last time it was shutdown (i.e., it crashed).","Terminal \u2013 may be configured to provide record  to file server ,  each time the record is generated (step ). Alternatively, following, or during, shutdown of terminal \u2013, the generated a local flag record. This record may be used by the start-up routine to generate a record that will be sent to a file server. Accordingly, file servers ,  may be constantly updated with new records from corresponding terminals \u2013.","File server ,  compiles all the records received from corresponding terminals \u2013 into a log file  (step ). Thus, log file  may include a collection of records provided from the terminals connected to the file server (e.g., file server  complies the records from terminals \u2013 into a log file and file server  compiles the records from terminals  and  into a corresponding log file). File server ,  in a memory device, such as memory , maintains the log files. In one embodiment, log file  may be stored in a non-volatile memory device that is tolerant to power loss conditions. Alternatively, log file  may be kept in redundant memory storage devices to allow file server ,  to recover any information that may be lost due to a fault or error condition.","Central sever  runs collection routine  to collect files from the file servers ,  (step ). In certain embodiments, central server  on a periodic basis, such as hourly, weekly, monthly, etc may execute collection routine . Accordingly, collection routine  may direct server  to generate a request that is provided to file server , . In response, to the request, file server ,  may create a response message that includes the information maintained in the log file . The log file  may be provided in the format generated by file server , , or may be provided in unformatted form. The response message may then be provided to central server . Once the log files  are received from the file servers , , collection routine  may store the log files in statistical database . The data stored in statistical database  may then be used by server  to create reports (e.g., reports \u2013) indicating the health of the terminals monitored in the distributed system (step ). In one embodiment, the reports are generated using a combination of a Visual Basic front end and a statistical modelling and database tool.","In another embodiment of the invention, system ,  may perform a reboot tracking process to remotely monitor the reboot status of terminals \u2013.  shows a flowchart of an exemplary process for tracking the reboot status of terminals \u2013 consistent with the present invention. During operations, a terminal \u2013 may execute a reboot tracker program that is a process similar to start-up routine . That is, the reboot tracker program may also generate a record similar to record  in manner similar to the processes described with respect to steps  and  of . The reboot tracker record that is created by the reboot tracker program may include information reflecting the number of reboots the terminal experienced and crashes associated with the reboots. For instance, the reboot\/crash flag  may be set by the reboot tracker program to an appropriate value (e.g., \u201c0\u201d or \u201c1\u201d) based on a detected reboot condition.","Once a record is created, the reboot tracker program may provide the record to a file server , . The file server may then add the record to a log file that includes, among other information, a reboot status for each corresponding terminal that provided a record to the file server ,  (step ). At some point, a collection routine operating on central server  may provide a request to the file server ,  for the log file. In response to the request, the file server ,  may provide the log file to central server , which in turn, is stored in a central memory file, such as statistical database  (step ). Accordingly, central server  may collect log files from a plurality of file servers ,  and store them in a central storage location. Central server  may access the information stored in the central memory file to generate reports indicating a reboot status of the terminals \u2013 included in the distributed system monitored by central server (step ). In one embodiment of the invention, central server  may create a reboot status report that indicates the number of reboots, crashes, terminals in operation, etc., within a predetermined interval of time.","A user may access the reboot status reports provided by central server  to analyses the performance of the distributed system monitored by server . For example, based on the reboot status tracking reports, as well as the other reports generated by central server  (e.g., reports \u2013), a user may determine when a remote terminal \u2013 experienced abnormal shut downs and crash events. Further, the user may obtain information from the reports that shows reboot and shutdown trends of selected users, terminals, operating systems, etc. For instance, a reboot status report may indicate that a certain user experiences an abnormal shut down 80% of the time the user is logged on to a terminal \u2013. This may reflect a trend that the user is not shutting down the terminal they are operating properly. Further, the reports may indicate that a certain terminal has experienced a high percentage of crashes over the past few weeks. Accordingly, central server  may provide information to a user, such as a system administrator, technical support personnel, network manager, etc., that enables technical support to be provided to an unhealthy terminal from a remote location. The data gathered may be used to look for trends, such as whether all the terminals at a particular site are crashing more than their counter parts at a different location.","Other embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the invention disclosed herein. For example, the distributed system  shown in  may perform a modified report generating processes described with respect to . For instance, server  may operate a collection routine that directs server  to receive the records generated by start-up routines  included in each terminal \u2013. Once collected, the records may be collected in a log file  and stored in a database where server  may generate reports reflecting the status of terminals \u2013, such as reports \u2013.","In one embodiment, for example, file servers  and  may be configured to perform fault tolerant operations to maintain the log files for central server . For example, file server  may be configured to retrieve records from terminals  and  in the event file server  is inoperable. Further, server  may be configured to receive records from terminals \u2013 in the event server  is configured to be inoperable.","A business may use a trend report to help in the choice of computer systems. A user may receive the trend report. The trend report may show a number of system parts, including but not limited to including CPU speed, RAM, operating system, template build. The trend report, or a user viewing the trend report, may make a correlation between a particular system part or combination of system parts and increased system reboots. Based on the correlation, the user may recommend a new system part be used.","A business may use a trend report to help in the review of terminal user training. A manager may receive the trend report. The trend report may show data for a number of month, both before and after a training event. The report may include data for a number of terminal users. The manager may review the trend report for indications of improvement by terminal users after the training event. The manger may also review the trend report or the trend report may indicate if a particular terminal user has continued problems, even after a training event. The manager may request that the user attend another training event.","Further, a business may use the trend report to reduce costs generated by trouble tickets. An Information Technology (\u201cIT\u201d) department at a business may receive trend reports for the terminal users at a business. The IT department may analyse the trend report. The analysis of the trend report may indicate that a particular department needs further training, a particular operating system causes higher then average problems, or other trends that indicate system problems. Based on the analysis of the trend report the IT department may implement a solution to the problem trend, such as adding training to a department or changing the operating system. Due to the pro-active changes the number of trouble tickets generated by a department operating costs are reduced, compared to not using the system.","Furthermore, although embodiments of the present invention are described as being associated with data stored in memory and other storage mediums, one skilled in the art will appreciate that these aspects can also be stored on or read from other types of computer-readable media, such as secondary storage devices, like hard disks, floppy disks, or CD-ROM; a carrier wave from the Internet; or other forms of RAM or ROM. Accordingly, the invention is not limited to the above described embodiments, but instead is defined by the appended claims in light of their full scope of equivalents."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The accompanying drawings provide a further understanding of the invention and, together with the detailed description, explain the principles of the invention.
