{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/720,326, filed Oct. 30, 2012 by Lin Han, et al., titled \u201cEncoding Packets for Transport over SDN Networks,\u201d which is incorporated herein by reference as if reproduced in its entirety.","Not applicable.","Not applicable.","Modern communication and data networks comprise network nodes, such as routers, switches, bridges, and other devices that transport data through the network. Over the years, the telecommunication industry has made significant improvements to the network nodes to support an increasing number of protocols and specifications standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). Creating and coupling the complex network nodes to form networks that support and implement the various IETF standards (e.g., virtual private network (VPN) requirements) has caused modern networks to become complex and difficult to manage. As a result, vendors and third-party operators seek to customize, optimize, and improve the performance of the interwoven web of network nodes.","A software defined network (SDN) is a network technology that addresses customization and optimization concerns within convoluted networks. SDN architecture allows network administrators to have programmable central control of network traffic without requiring physical access to the network's devices. SDNs may be Internet Protocol (IP) networks utilizing Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) protocols. SDNs may decouple the data-forwarding capability, e.g., the data plane, from routing, resource, and other management functionality, e.g., the control plane, previously performed in the network nodes. Decoupling the control plane from the data plane of the network enables the network controller to efficiently control the network traffic through globally optimized traffic engineering and routing, which departs from locally optimized shortest path first (SPF). SDN may also simplify network operations or even have the capabilities to flatten the network with extended data routing vectors.","The extended data routing vectors in SDN can cover network information from multiple Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) layers (e.g. Layer 2 (L2) and\/or Layer 3 (L3)) for intelligent routing purposes. A basic approach to achieve decoupling of the network control from the network topology and data plane is by applying globally aware and topology decoupled software control at the edges of the network. The assumption is that traditional topology-coupled bridging and routing may be re-used at the core of the network so that scalability, interoperability, high availability, and extensibility of the conventional networking protocols, such as IP networks, can still be maintained. Network nodes that support SDN, e.g., SDN compliant nodes, may be configured to implement the data plane functions, while the control plane functions may be provided by an SDN controller. A group of nodes, e.g., routers, switches, etc., controlled by a single SDN controller may be referred to as an SDN domain.","In an example embodiment, the disclosure includes an ingress node in an SDN. The ingress node comprises a transmitter, a receiver for receiving a data packet, and a processor coupled to the transmitter, the receiver, and the memory. In one embodiment, the processor is coupled to the receiver and is further configured to obtain the data packet from the receiver in a transport protocol agnostic manner, and encapsulate the data packet in an SDN packet header, wherein the packet header comprises SDN flow-specific information provided by an SDN controller. The embodiment may further comprise a transmitter coupled to the processor, with the transmitter being further configured to transmit the encapsulated data packet across a single SDN toward an egress node in the SDN.","In another example embodiment, the disclosure includes a method of routing a packet carried out in a network node of an SDN. In one embodiment, the method includes receiving a first data packet and a second data packet in a transport protocol agnostic manner, wherein the first data packet and the second data packet are encoded using different traffic protocols, encoded using the same traffic protocol with different source or destination addresses, or encoded using the same traffic protocol with different service requests, encapsulating the first data packet and the second data packet using a packet header specific to the SDN domain, wherein each packet header comprises a field for identifying at least one packet-specific property and a field for identifying a flow, and transmitting the encapsulated first data packet and the encapsulated second data packet across a single SDN domain to a receiver.","In yet another example embodiment, the disclosure includes a computer program product comprising computer executable instructions stored on a non-transitory medium that when executed by a processor cause the processor to receive a first data packet and a second data packet, receive a first data packet and a second data packet in a transport protocol agnostic manner, wherein the first data packet and the second data packet are encoded using different traffic protocols, using the same traffic protocol with different source or destination addresses, or using the same traffic protocol with different service requests, encapsulate the first data packet and the second data packet, wherein encapsulation comprises appending a packet header provided by an Software Defined Network (SDN) controller to the packet, and transmit the encapsulated first data packet and the encapsulated second data packet across a single SDN domain toward an egress node in the SDN, wherein each packet header comprises a field for identifying at least one packet-specific property and a field for identifying a flow.","These and other features will be more clearly understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and claims.","It should be understood at the outset that although an illustrative implementation of one or more embodiments are provided below, the disclosed systems and\/or methods may be implemented using any number of techniques, whether currently known or in existence. The disclosure should in no way be limited to the illustrative implementations, drawings, and techniques illustrated below, including the exemplary designs and implementations illustrated and described herein, but may be modified within the scope of the appended claims along with their full scope of equivalents.","The disclosure includes encapsulating packets from a wide variety of competing traffic protocols, e.g., Media Access Control (MAC), IP, Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)\/Frame Rate (FR), Synchronous Optical Networking (SONET), etc., using a packet header intelligible by all nodes within the SDN for a particular data flow and\/or stream. As used herein, the terms data flow and\/or stream may be defined as a series of packets comprising data traffic from a source to at least one destination. By using the SDN flow-specific encapsulation technique, the SDN may be implemented in a transport layer agnostic manner, or without regards to any interfacing traffic protocols. Some embodiments utilize an explicit mode packet header, wherein a multicast tree identifier is placed in a packet header field. Other embodiments utilize an implicit mode packet header, utilizing a lookup table to reference the multicast tree identifier, e.g., to optimize packet size by mapping the identifier(s) in a database. Additionally, some embodiments may identify a particular egress border router and\/or transit nodes in the header, while other embodiments do not. As used herein, a transit node or transit router may be a router inside the SDN domain that does not have any interfaces connecting to outside of the SDN domain. Other embodiments of methods, systems, protocols, and devices are described herein or would be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art, and are considered within the scope of this disclosure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106","104","102","104","106","104","106","104","104","106","104","106","102","104","102","102","104","100","104"],"i":["a","a","b","b","c"]},"The network controller  may receive data from and transmit messages to the network nodes . Some of the incoming messages or parts of the incoming messages may be translated into a standard independent format for processing by some of the modules in the network controller . The standard independent format may be based on an abstract network control data model that provides an abstraction of the attributes or features of the various standard formats. The network controller  may interact with the network nodes  via a variety of application programming interface (API) protocols, e.g., Openflow. The network controller  may determine the global network topology of the network . With the global network topology, state information, dynamic traffic flow\/volume information, and other network state information, the network controller  may make decisions on how to assign resources and route applications, information, and\/or data packet flows through the network .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","104","100","200","200","200","200","200","200","210","210","220","210","250","230","210","230","232","230","230","234","230","235","400","600","800","234","235","232","230","232","232"]},"It is understood that by programming and\/or loading executable instructions onto the NE , at least one of the processor , the cache, and the long-term storage are changed, transforming the NE  in part into a particular machine or apparatus, e.g., a multi-core forwarding architecture, having the novel functionality taught by the present disclosure. It is fundamental to the electrical engineering and software engineering arts that functionality that can be implemented by loading executable software into a computer can be converted to a hardware implementation by well-known design rules. Decisions between implementing a concept in software versus hardware typically hinge on considerations of stability of the design and numbers of units to be produced rather than any issues involved in translating from the software domain to the hardware domain. Generally, a design that is still subject to frequent change may be preferred to be implemented in software, because re-spinning a hardware implementation is more expensive than re-spinning a software design. Generally, a design that is stable that will be produced in large volume may be preferred to be implemented in hardware, for example in an ASIC, because for large production runs the hardware implementation may be less expensive than the software implementation. Often a design may be developed and tested in a software form and later transformed, by well-known design rules, to an equivalent hardware implementation in an ASIC that hardwires the instructions of the software. In the same manner as a machine controlled by a new ASIC is a particular machine or apparatus, likewise a computer that has been programmed and\/or loaded with executable instructions may be viewed as a particular machine or apparatus.","Packets received by an SDN IBR may be encapsulated using an SDN flow-specific header for transport and\/or routing through the SDN. The encapsulating header may comprise a control field and a Flow ID field. Control field may be used to describe a variety of characteristics, e.g., the length of the encapsulating header, unicast or multicast transmission, backup or primary path transmission, etc. The Flow ID may be used to identify and\/or distinguish one or multiple data flows inside an SDN domain. The Flow ID may be allocated either via an Implicit Method embodiment (e.g., relying on lookup tables) or via an Explicit Method embodiment (e.g., expressly containing needed data), as discussed further herein.","In order to encapsulate the new SDN header-encoded packet over an Ethernet network, a new EtherType may be assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (TANA).  is an example embodiment of an Ethernet packet  including a disclosed SDN header. The Ethernet packet  comprises an Ethernet field  using a new EtherType (not depicted), a Virtual Local Area Network (LAN) (VLAN) field , a new SDN packet header field , and a payload field , e.g., for transporting Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)\/IP\/MPLS\/MAC-encoded data.

The SDN controller may track Flow ID assignments using various databases, e.g., a free Flow ID pool database (containing unassigned Flow IDs) and an Assigned Flow ID Table database. An assigned Flow ID may be used to switch a flow based on the Flow ID at a system router, e.g., network node  of , using a local switching table installed at each router by the SDN controller. The local switching table is discussed further herein. The SDN controller may allocate and\/or assign a Flow ID such that a loop in the SDN network will not be formed and packet delivery from the SDN IBR, e.g., network node () of , to one or multiple SDN EBRs, e.g., network node () of , is ensured so as to satisfy any preset Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements for the delivery, e.g., Quality of Service (QoS), Traffic Engineering (TE), etc. The length of the Flow ID may depend on the value of the bits in the control field indicating the protocol version employed, e.g., IP version 4 (IPv4), IPv4 VPN, IP version 6 (IPv6), IPv6 VPN, Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS), L2 VPN, Multi-Topology (MT), etc., and the method of flow identification, e.g., Implicit Method or Explicit Method.
