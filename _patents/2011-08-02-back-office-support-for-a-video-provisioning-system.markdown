The users may use video client devices (e.g., a set top box, etc.) to obtain free broadcast television video content (e.g., from Fox, ABC, CBS, etc.), on-demand video content (e.g., Video On-Demand (VOD), pay-per-view (PPV), etc.), and\/or pay television video content (e.g., from HBO, Cinemax, etc.) from cable television operators (e.g., Comcast, Time Warner, etc.) and\/or satellite television operators (e.g., DirectTV, Dish Network, etc.). The users may use computer devices, wireless mobile handset devices, etc. to obtain other video content from on-line content providers, such as television operators (e.g., ABC, Fox, CBS, etc.), over-the-top (OTT) content providers (e.g., Hulu, Veoh, Jaman, YouTube, etc.), and\/or other commercial content providers (e.g., Apple Computer's iTunes, Netflix, Blockbuster, etc.).","The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements.","Systems and\/or methods, described herein, may enable a synchronization operation to be performed on one or more devices, associated with a video provisioning system (VPS), to ensure that each of the devices, that distribute video assets to different types of user devices, store the same video assets. Ensuring that each of the devices store the same video assets, may allow a set top box to obtain the same video assets as another user device that is a different type of user devices than the set top box. For example, the set top box that obtains video assets, from a first device associated with the VPS, may have access to the same video assets as a different type of user device that obtains video assets, from a second device associated with the VPS, when the first device and the second device are synchronized. The different types of user devices may, for example, include computer devices (e.g., desktop computers, laptop computers, and tablet computers), wireless handset devices (e.g., mobile phones, smart phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and tablet computers), and\/or set top boxes.","The systems and\/or methods may enable a video asset, that is no longer available for distribution to the user devices, to be stored in the VPS when the video asset has been purchased, at a prior time, by at least one of the user devices. The systems and\/or methods may that enable a catalog, associated with a user, to include information regarding transactions corresponding to a set top box associated with the user and\/or other transactions corresponding to another other user device, associated with the user, that is a different type of user device than the set top box.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","110","1","110","110","110","120","130","1","130","130","130","140","150"]},"Also, in some implementations, one or more of the devices of environment  may perform one or more functions described as being performed by another one or more of the devices of environment .
