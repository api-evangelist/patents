No. 14\/544,729.","The present invention relates to a new and distinct cultivar of plant, botanically known as and hereinafter referred to by the name \u2018Haflrest\u2019.","The new plant is a product of a planned breeding program conducted by the Inventor in Okayama-ken, Japan. The objective of the breeding program is to create new freely-branching plants with unique ray floret coloration.","The new plant originated from a self-pollination made by the Inventor in Okayama-ken, Japan in January, 2010 of \u2018K-SAIKA001\u2019, not patented. The new plant was discovered and selected by the Inventor as a single flowering plant from within the progeny of the stated self-pollination in a controlled greenhouse environment in Okayama-ken, Japan in May, 2010.","Asexual reproduction of the new plant by vegetative cuttings in a controlled environment in Okayama-ken, Japan since June, 2010 has shown that the unique features of this new plant are stable and reproduced true to type in successive generations.","Plants of the new have not been observed under all possible combinations of environmental conditions and cultural practices. The phenotype may vary somewhat with variations in environmental conditions such as temperature and light intensity, without, however, any variance in genotype.","The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be the unique characteristics of \u2018Haflrest\u2019. These characteristics in combination distinguish \u2018Haflrest\u2019 as a new and distinct plant:\n\n","Plants of the new differ primarily from plants of the parent, \u2018K-SAIKA001\u2019 in ray floret color as inflorescences of \u2018K-SAIKA001\u2019 have yellow and subdued orange bi-colored ray florets.","Plants of the new can be compared to plants of \u2018Haflpare\u2019, disclosed in a U.S. Plant Patent application filed concurrently. In side-by-side comparisons conducted in Okayama-ken, Japan, plants of the new differed from plants of \u2018Haflpare\u2019 in ray floret color as plants of \u2018Haflpare\u2019 have deep orange and yellow bi-colored ray florets.","Plants of the new can be compared to plants of \u2018Hafltibr\u2019, disclosed in a U.S. Plant Patent application filed concurrently. In side-by-side comparisons conducted in Okayama-ken, Japan, plants of the new differed from plants of \u2018Hafltibr\u2019 in plant size and ray floret color as plants of \u2018Hafltibr\u2019 are more compact than plants of the new and have orange-colored ray florets with orange red-colored central and lateral stripes.","Plants of the new can be compared to plants of \u2018Hafltifrpu\u2019, disclosed in a U.S. Plant Patent application filed concurrently. In side-by-side comparisons conducted in Okayama-ken, Japan, plants of the new differed from plants of \u2018Hafltifrpu\u2019 in plant size and ray floret color as plants of \u2018Hafltifrpu\u2019 are more compact than plants of the new and have orange and yellow bi-colored ray florets.","Plants of the new can be compared to plants of \u2018Hafltufr\u2019, disclosed in a U.S. Plant Patent application filed concurrently. In side-by-side comparisons conducted in Okayama-ken, Japan, plants of the new differed from plants of \u2018Hafltufr\u2019 in ray floret color as plants of \u2018Hafltufr\u2019 have ray florets with dark orange-colored centers and yellow to light yellow-colored apices.","Plants of the new can also be compared to plants of \u2018Florbikano\u2019, disclosed in U.S. Plant Pat. No. 25,087. In side-by-side comparisons conducted in Okayama-ken, Japan, plants of the new differed from plants of \u2018Florbikano\u2019 in the following characteristics:\n\n","The aforementioned photograph and following observations and measurements describe plants grown in 15-cm containers during October in a polyethylene-covered greenhouse in Cartago, Costa Rica and under cultural practices which approximate those generally used in commercial production. During the production of the plants, day temperatures averaged 26\u00b0 C., night temperatures averaged 18\u00b0 C. and light levels ranged from 12 to 15 moles per day. Plants were pinched two times and were 21 weeks old when the photograph and description were taken.
