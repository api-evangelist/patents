title: Methods and apparatus for uplink macro-diversity in packet-switched cellular networks
abstract: A method and apparatus for providing uplink macro-diversity in packet-switched networks that allows packets and/or portions of packets, e.g., frames, to be selectively sent from an end node, e.g., wireless communication device or mobile terminal, over a set of multiple communication connections, e.g., physical-layer or link-layer connections, to one or more access nodes, e.g., base stations. Uplink macro-diversity is achieved in part through intelligent selective forwarding over multiple communication connections, where the forwarding decision is controlled by the end node based on a variety of factors, e.g., physical-layer channel conditions and/or higher layer policy. The forwarding decision is executed on a rapid timescale, e.g., on a per packet basis, to adapt to the dynamically varying conditions of the set of communication connections.

In soft handoff mechanism, uplink frames at the link layer or Media Access Control (MAC) sublayer that are transmitted by a user's wireless communication device or mobile terminal are received at multiple base station transceivers as controlled by a separate controlling element, e.g., a Radio Network Controller (RNC) or Base Station Controller (BSC), which is typically more centrally located in the radio access network. The set of receiving base station transceivers forward the uplink frames to the controlling element, which then uses techniques such as frame selection or soft combining, as well as automatic repeat request (ARQ) mechanisms in an attempt to reconstruct and correctly receive the frames sent from the user's wireless communication device. This design has evolved primarily in support of circuit-switch applications, e.g., voice, and is not well-suited for packet-switched networking\/internetworking. The concentration of information through the controlling element reduces network scalability and also increases the reliability requirements, and cost, of the controlling element. The design also imposes timing, synchronization, and communication latency requirements between the base station transceivers and\/or between the base station transceivers and the controlling element.","These requirements are overly restrictive for many packet-switched network\/internetwork technologies. In connectionless, packet-switched networks\/internetworks such as those based on the Internet Protocol (IP), a sequence of packets (or packet flow) sent from a source node to a destination node need not follow the same path throughout the network\/internetwork. It is also generally desirable to confine the dynamics of a specific air-link interface technology to the interface itself, thereby allowing network layer intelligence to be brought forward to the edge of the fixed infrastructure.","Internet Protocol Overview","IP technology is designed to enable packet-switched interconnection of a heterogeneous set of computer communication networks. A potentially diverse set of network and link layer technologies are interconnected through gateways (or routers) that provide a packet forwarding service. Information is transferred from sources to destinations as blocks of data called datagrams, where sources and destinations (or hosts) are identified by fixed length addresses. Routing in IP internetworks is connectionless in nature, in that datagrams are forwarded between routers on a hop-by-hop basis using the destination address in the datagram. Each router makes an independent next-hop forwarding decision using its own internal forwarding table. IP also provides for fragmentation and reassembly of long datagrams, if necessary, for transmission through \u201csmall packet\u201d networks. In some IP internetworks there is relatively little distinction between hosts and routers. Herein, when no distinction is required the term \u201cnode\u201d will be used. One distinction that generally holds true is that while any IP node may send and receive datagrams, only routers forward datagrams.","In a common case a host has only one connection (or interface) to the internetwork. When the interface is point-to-point in nature, the decision regarding the next-hop to which datagrams from the host should be sent is trivial. Typically, a default route designates the remote end of the point-to-point link as the next-hop for all outgoing datagrams from the host. Alternatively, when the interface is broadcast in nature, such as with a direct connection to a Local Area Network (LAN), the next-hop decision for the host is more complex. In this case a contiguous set of addresses is typically associated with nodes directly connected via the interface (a \u201csubnet\u201d). Thus, if an outgoing datagram is destined for a node on the directly connected subnet (e.g., the destination address is within the interface address space), the datagram is sent directly to the corresponding node, otherwise the datagram must be sent to a router on the directly connected subnet for forwarding. In general there may be more than one router on the subnet and a host may use different routers as the next-hop depending on the destination address of the datagram. However, in many cases a host will simply designate one router as a default next-hop and direct all outgoing datagrams (that are not destined for a node on the directly connected subnet) to that default router. Finally, a host may be multihomed, wherein it has more than one interface that provide connectivity to the internetwork. Each interface may have an associated set of addresses that corresponds to directly connected nodes. Outgoing datagrams destined to a directly connected node are sent to the node on the associated interface. Other outgoing datagrams may be directed either to a specific next-hop router based on the destination address of the datagram or to a default router. The next-hop decision for a router is much the same as that described for a multihomed host. The primary difference being that a router must make such a decision for both datagrams sourced by the router and datagrams being forwarded by the router.","IP Internetworking over Wireless Communication and Networking Technologies","Connectivity between nodes in an IP internetwork can be provided by both wired and wireless communications and network technologies. Wireless communication and network technology can be used to provide connectivity either directly between IP nodes that have wireless communication device interfaces or through non-IP wireless link-layer devices, such as a wireless access point serving as a bridge between a wireless LAN and a hardwired LAN. In any case, channel conditions, spatial relationships, and other factors have a significant impact on physical and link layer connectivity, which makes these link connections more dynamic and time varying than in hardwired networks.","Before packets, e.g., IP datagrams, can be transmitted between two wireless communication devices, a viable communication connection must be established. The process of establishing a wireless communication connection may progress through a series of possible stages as follows.\n\n","Note that some of the message exchanges may directly or indirectly involve entities such as Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) servers other than the wireless communication devices and the entities that encompass them (particularly in the third and fourth stages above).","In some instances a communication connection may be more specifically described as either a physical-layer connection or a link-layer connection. While the specific attributes and differences may vary depending on the particular communication technology and\/or protocols, the former loosely corresponds with the end of the second stage and the later with the end of the third stage. Since a link-layer connection is typically associated with link-layer functions such as message framing and ARQ, which need not be closely coupled to a particular physical layer connection, it is possible that in some communication systems a link-layer connection may include, or operate over, multiple physical layer connections. When higher layer packets are transmitted over a physical-layer or link-layer connection, they are typically partitioned into one or more frames, where each frame may include some additional header information. Depending on the underlying technology and\/or protocols, frames may be either fixed or variable in length.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100","100","100","134","136","144","146","154","156","130","140","150","134","136","144","146","154","156","130","140","150","100","100","108","106","104"]},"The exemplary system  shown in  depicts a network  that includes the application server node , the session signaling server node , and the mobility agent node , each of which is connected to an intermediate network node  by a corresponding network link , , , respectively.

In particular, the interface memory  of the  embodiment includes a connection control\/monitoring module , an uplink macro-diversity control module , a packet size control module , an upper-layer protocol proxy module , and wireless communication interface data .","The connection control\/monitoring module  controls the operation of the wireless communication interface  and\/or end node  associated with establishing and maintaining communication connections, e.g., access links. In particular, the connection control\/monitoring module  controls processing and signaling associated with detecting available access nodes, e.g., base stations and determining whether to establish, maintain, or tear down communication connections, e.g., access links. In some embodiments the connection control\/monitoring module  uses a configurable set of parameters such as, but not limited to, pilot power, pilot power averaging time duration, minimum end node transmit power required and\/or impact on inter-sector and\/or inter-cell interference to monitor, assess and compare available access nodes and communication connections. The connection control\/monitoring module  generally maintains one or more communication connections, e.g., access links, with one or more access nodes, as needed to provide reliable access to the network with sufficient resilience to dynamic channel conditions. Over time, the connection control\/monitoring module  establishes, maintains or tears down communication connections in order to maintain a suitable set of alternative uplinks. In general, both the end node  and access nodes may limit the number and\/or frequency of transitions. The number of simultaneous communication connections may also be subject to hardware, software and other implementation limitations of the wireless communication interface  and\/or end node . In some embodiment of the invention, the connection control\/monitoring module  accesses the wireless communication interface data  to store, retrieve and\/or modify configuration information, e.g., parameters, and operation information, e.g, current status of various communication connections.","For the purpose of describing this invention, a bi-directional communication connection can be viewed as comprising two unidirectional communication connections, where the ability to send traffic, e.g., frames or packets, in either direction may vary as a function of time. When a distinction is required or useful for explaining the invention we will refer to the connection directed from the end node to the access node as the \u201cuplink\u201d and the connection directed from the access node to the end node as the \u201cdownlink\u201d.","The uplink macro-diversity control module  controls the operation of the wireless communication interface  and\/or end node , associated with selective forwarding of signals, e.g., messages, from the end node , when the end node  has multiple simultaneous uplink communication connections, e.g., access links to one or more access nodes. In particular, the uplink macro-diversity control module  controls processing associated with selecting the particular uplink communication connection over which to send a packet and\/or portion of a packet, e.g., frame, from among the set of available communication connections maintained and monitored by the connection control\/monitoring module . The selection process or determination of the particular uplink communication connection on which to send is based on one or more factors, e.g., physical-layer channel conditions, link-layer characteristics, contents and\/or size of the packet and\/or portion of the packet, corresponding protocol with which the packet is associated, type of packet, corresponding access node, and\/or higher layer policy. In some embodiments of the invention, the uplink macro-diversity control module  accesses the wireless communication interface data  to store, retrieve and\/or modify configuration information, e.g., parameters, and operation information, e.g, current status of various communication connections.","The packet size control module  controls the operation of the wireless communication interface  and\/or end node , associated with adapting the size of packets transmitted over the available communication connections. In particular, the packet size control module  controls processing and signaling associated with adapting the size of packets based on dynamic physical-layer and\/or link-layer conditions, e.g., as monitored and\/or reported by the connection control\/monitoring module . The determination of the packet size for transmission is based on one or more factors, e.g., physical-layer channel conditions, link-layer characteristics, contents of the packet, corresponding protocol with which the packet is associated, type of packet, and\/or higher layer policy. In some embodiments of the present invention, the packet size control module  utilizes packet fragmentation mechanisms, e.g., IP fragmentation, to dynamically control and adjust packet size prior to transmission. In alternative embodiments the packet size control module  may dynamically signal the preferred packet size to the sending application (e.g., application module ), or operating system (e.g., operating system module ), such that the sending application or operating system may adjust packet sizes as needed and avoid fragmentation. In some embodiments of the invention, the packet size control module  accesses the wireless communication interface data  to store, retrieve and\/or modify configuration information, e.g., parameters, and operation information, e.g, current status of various communication connections.","The upper-layer protocol proxy module  controls the operation of the wireless communication interface  and\/or end node , associated with enabling uplink macro-diversity selective forwarding to be based in part on the contents and\/or size of the packet, corresponding protocol with which the packet is associated, type of packet, corresponding access node, and\/or higher layer policy. In particular, the upper-layer protocol proxy module  controls processing and signaling associated with determining higher layer conditions and\/or policy that affect the selective forwarding decision. For example, a particular upper layer protocol, e.g., signaled from the upper-layer protocol module  included in the main memory , may require that its messages be directed over a particular communication connection or to a particular access node and thus are not eligible for dynamic selective forwarding by the uplink macro-diversity control module . In some embodiments, the upper layer protocol module  may directly signal its requirements, e.g., via an application programming interface (API), to the uplink macro-diversity control module . Alternatively, the upper layer protocol module  may directly signal its requirements to the upper-layer protocol proxy module  included in the wireless communication interface  via existing protocol mechanisms, signals, and\/or messages. This approach has the benefit of minimizing changes to pre-existing protocol modules included in main memory  when implementing the invention. In another alternative embodiment, the upper-layer protocol proxy module  may transparently intercept signals, e.g., messages, sent by the upper layer protocol module  to determine the required information. This has the benefit of requiring no changes to pre-existing protocol modules included in main memory  when implementing the invention.

In accordance with the present invention the connection control\/monitoring module  included in the end node  monitors signals from various access nodes and uses this information, possibly in combination with information stored in the wireless communication interface data , to determine if it should establish, maintain, or tear down communication connections. In each of ,  and , the end node  is depicted with two communication connections (, ), (, ), (, ), respectively. It is assumed that the end node  and access nodes , \u2032 have already performed the necessary operations to progress the communication connections (, ), (, ), (, ) through the necessary stages as previously discussed to enable the exchange of link-layer data messages (and thus higher layer packets). This may be done using known techniques. The details regarding how this is accomplished are specific to the particular wireless technology and\/or communication protocols and will not be described herein since known methods may be used. However, in order for the end node  to establish multiple simultaneous communication connections, it should be able to independently exchange link-layer control messages with multiple entities and direct control messages to a specific entity as needed.","It is also assumed that each of the communication connections (, ), (, ), (, ) is capable of supporting bi-directional exchange of link-layer data messages (e.g., frames) and higher layer packet (e.g., IP datagrams), although not necessarily at every instant in time. Channel conditions, spatial relationships, and other time varying dynamic factors may impede the ability to exchange link-layer messages (and thus higher layer packets) in one or both directions at any instant in time. Typically the physical, MAC, and link layers provide some ability to adapt to and persist through some degree of such dynamics without tearing down and re-establishing the communication connection.","In the  illustration, the end node  has a plurality of simultaneous communication connections , \u2014a first communication connection  with a first access node  and a second communication connection  with a second access node \u2032.  also depicts a sequence of packets , , , , , , , ,  with sequence numbers i to i+8, being part of a packet flow sent from the end node  to the application server node .

The selection process or determination of the particular communication connection on which to send is based on one or more factors, e.g., physical-layer channel conditions as monitored or reported by the connection control\/monitoring module , and\/or higher layer policy. Note that the preferred communication connection for transporting uplink and downlink may be independently selected and thus may differ at any point in time. In accordance with the present invention, the end node  can selectively forward uplink traffic over the set of communication connections on a rapid time scale to accommodate the physical-layer and\/or link-layer dynamics. However, forwarding of downlink traffic destined for the end node  is typically directed based on routing information maintained by nodes in the network infrastructure, e.g., the access nodes , \u2032 and\/or the mobility agent node . The latency of control loops and signaling associated with dynamically adapting or re-configuring the corresponding routing information for downlink traffic using traditional techniques may require considerable time for convergence and thus would typically exceed the time scale of physical-layer and link-layer dynamics.

Packets sent from the end node  over either communication connection ,  follow also the same path (denoted by arrow ) from the second access node \u2032 to the application server node .","In accordance with the present invention, the uplink macro-diversity control module  include in the end node  selects the particular communication connection , , e.g., uplink, over which to send each portion of a packet, e.g., frame, from among the set of communication connections maintained and monitored by the connection control\/monitoring module . While in  the selective forwarding is depicted as occurring on whole packets, e.g., packet boundaries, in  the selective forwarding is depicted as occurring on portions of packets, e.g., frame boundaries. The selection process or determination of the particular uplink communication connection on which to send is based on one or more factors, e.g., physical-layer channel conditions as monitored or reported by the connection control\/monitoring module  and\/or higher layer policy. As in , a solid line with an arrow  is used to depict a single exemplary path over which packets may be delivered from the application server node  to end node .","To illustrate the dynamic selective forwarding performed by the end node , individual portions of packets from the sequence of packets , , , , , , , ,  are depicted as following one of the two paths from the end node  to the second access node \u2032. Specifically, packet portions with sequence numbers i+5(b) (\u2032), i+7(a) (), i+8(a) () and i+8(b) (\u2032) are shown as following the first path, being sent over the first communication connection , while packet portions with sequence numbers i+5(a) (), i+6(a) (), i+6(b) (\u2032) and i+7(b) (\u2032) are shown as following the second path, being sent over the second communication connection . Packets with sequence numbers i (), i+1 (), i+2 (), i+3 () and i+4 () are depicted following the path from the second access node \u2032 to the application server node .","In accordance with the exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the packet reassembly module \u2032 included in the second access node \u2032 reassembles portions of packets received from the end node  over the various communication connections ,  prior to subsequent forwarding by the packet routing\/forwarding module \u2032. In particular, the packet reassembly module \u2032 is capable of reassembling a packet from portions that have been received over different communication connections.","In some embodiments of the present invention, communications between nodes is based all, or in part, on IP internetworking. Thus, communication of both data and\/or control signaling between the network nodes may use IP packets, e.g., datagrams. In embodiments of the present invention that utilize IP packets, said IP packets may be delivered to the intended destination nodes using either unicast or multicast addressing and delivery mechanisms. The use of IP multicast is particularly useful when the same information is sent from one node to a plurality of other nodes.","The methods and apparatus of the present invention may be used with CDMA, (OFDM), or various other types of communications techniques which may be used to provide wireless communications links between access nodes and end nodes.

Given a wireless technology that supports multiple simultaneous communication connections, the wireless communication device may or may not be limited to only transmitting or receiving on one such connection at a time. In the context of a cellular network, such a technology enables a wireless communication device or mobile terminal to maintain simultaneous communication connections with one or more base stations. In the context of IP internetworking, a wireless IP node could maintain simultaneous link-layer connections with multiple wireless access points or wireless access routers. This is possible even if the IP node has only a single wireless communication device or network interface card (NIC), and therefore would traditionally only have a single IP interface. It is also possible to develop a single NIC that supports simultaneous link-layer connections using multiple wireless communication and networking technologies, e.g., IEEE 802.11b and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM).","The invention described herein enables a form of uplink macro-diversity in packet-switched cellular networks. It allows packets and\/or portions of packets, e.g., frames, to be selectively sent from an end node, e.g., wireless communication device or mobile terminal, over a set of multiple communication connections, e.g., physical-layer or link-layer connections, to one or more access nodes, e.g., base stations. The new approach to uplink macro-diversity is achieved in part through innovative mechanisms for intelligent selective forwarding over multiple communication connections, where the forwarding decision is controlled by the end node based on a variety of factors, e.g., physical-layer channel conditions and\/or higher layer policy. The forwarding decision is executed on a rapid timescale, e.g., on a per packet basis, to adapt to the dynamically varying conditions of the set of communication connections.","Advantageously, the inventive approach is consistent with a connectionless networking paradigm. Furthermore, the invention is particularly well suited for use in a cellular network architecture, since an end node can typically communicate with other nodes, e.g., other end nodes and\/or application server nodes, in the network\/internetwork through any one of a set of available access links and\/or access nodes. The invention achieves uplink macro-diversity by enabling the end node to select the preferred uplink on a per packet basis subject to prevailing channel conditions, availability of air-link resources and other constraints. This is particularly important when the communication connections are subject to independent or partially correlated time variations in signal strength and interference. Finally, the invention improves the robustness and efficiency of communication, overall utilization of air-link resources, and quality of service experienced by the end node.","Viewed from a first aspect, the invention is directed to a method for providing uplink macro-diversity in a communications network. More specifically, the inventive method maintains a plurality of communications connections between an end node and at least two different receivers; monitors channel conditions on the communications connections; selects, as a function of the monitored channel conditions, between the plurality of communications connections for purposes of transmitting at least a portion of a packet, transmitting at least a portion of a packet using the selected communications channel; and repeating the above-steps.","Advantageously, the method may be used in a variety of configurations, e.g., wireless networks, monitoring characteristics from physical layer connections, link layer connections, or higher layer connections. In addition, multiple communications protocols may be supported simultaneously using the same or different access nodes, as well as controlling packet size as a function of channel conditions and switching the uplink multiple times without switching the downlink.","Viewed from another aspect, the invention is directed to an apparatus for providing uplink macro-diversity in a communications network. In particular, a communications system including an end node and at least two different receivers to which the end node communicates, the end node having a means for maintaining a plurality of communications connections between the end node and the receivers; a means for monitoring channel conditions on the communications connections; a means for selecting between the communications connections and a means for transmitting at least a portion of a packet using selected connections.","Further aspects of the apparatus include support for wireless connections; means for varying the packet size as a function of monitored channel conditions; and a means for selecting multiple times a communications connection while simultaneously maintaining a single downlink connection as well as a means for determining packet content, packet type and\/or protocol to which the packet corresponds."]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
