{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No. 2008-304950, filed on Nov. 28, 2008 in the Japan Patent Office, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a workflow information generation unit, a method of generating workflow information, an image processing apparatus, a control program for generating workflow information, an image processing apparatus, and a storage medium for the control program, and more particularly, to maintaining consistency of workflow information.","2. Description of the Background Art","Utilization of digitized information (hereinafter referred to as electronic information or electronic data) has been expanding in many fields of business, industry, and the like. Digitized information can be generated by scanning documents with scanners, and may be output as printed images using printers or facsimile machines. As such, image processing apparatuses such as printers, facsimiles, and scanners are now indispensable for handling such digitized information.","Such image processing apparatuses may include functions such as image capture, image formation, and communication, so that these image processing apparatuses can be used as printers, facsimiles, scanners, and copiers. Moreover, some image processing apparatuses may be configured as multi-function peripherals by incorporating multiple functions of a printer, facsimile machine, scanner, and copier in one machine. In addition, file management systems like that described in JP-2008-97586-A are known, in which digitized documents are stored on a document management server or distributed to designated locations (e.g., destinations identified by computer addresses) and used.","In such file management systems, a given workflow may be developed to handle file information efficiently. For example, a workflow configured with a scanner function and an information processing function may be developed to efficiently store file information.","Typically, corporate users use such file management systems for managing file information generated in the course of business activities, wherein such file management systems are based on a workflow scheme. In general, corporations or companies each have their own in-house information infrastructure configured with a given e-mail system and a given network environment in which the file management system is used. Because each corporation or company uses its own unique in-house information infrastructure suited to its business activities, it is difficult to develop a file management system that can be adapted to every kind of network environment in advance.","Given that network environments may be different for different entities, workflow systems embodied as software development kits (SDK) and application programming interfaces (API) have been developed. Such programming tools as SDK and API enable users to configure workflow programs adapted to their own user-specific environment and needs.","In general, a workflow program may be configured with a plurality of processes in a given system environment. For example, when a workflow for storing file information is developed in a given system environment, such workflow may include a scanning process, a document formatting process, a mailing process, or the like, which needs to be executed to complete the workflow. When API is employed in such workflow, some of these processes may be executed using an externally-provided program, which may not be provided in the given system environment as a default program.","Further, by employing API, events which occur in a given system environment may be reported to an externally provided program, wherein the event may be a given operation such as counting the executed number of given process, for example. When such event occurs, the externally provided program may not be used to execute processes included in a given workflow but may instead execute a given procedure that the externally provided program is supposed to execute in view of a system condition or operations executed for the system.","For example, in the above-described file management system, the workflow may include a billing process, executed using an externally provided program, which may be used to charge a given fee to a user depending, for example, on volume of document information which is processed in such workflow. When a result of storage of digitized documents or file distribution processing is reported to an externally provided program using API, the externally provided program executes a billing process based on the volume of document information that is stored in a memory or the number of distribution addresses to which the file information is distributed.","With the above-described SDK, when an event occurs in a given workflow system, the event is reported to an externally provided program via API after a process related to the event is executed. Such event may be referred as an \u201cafter-event\u201d because the event is reported to the externally provided program only after the process related to the event is actually executed. When the after-event is reported, the externally provided program can comprehend a system condition, status or the like. However, because the process related to the after-event has already occurred, the externally provided program to which the after-event has been reported cannot intervene in the operation of workflow system, despite the fact that the process related to the event may not be adequate for implementing the workflow system.","For example, assume a workflow scheme is configured with a plurality of processes executed using externally provided programs, in which a billing process is included to charge a fee for a given procedure. If one process is executed using one externally provided program and the billing process is executed for such one process, but thereafter another process is not correctly executed by another externally provided program because of an error, the workflow cannot be completed. In this case, although the workflow cannot be completed and the user cannot achieve his or her objective, he or she is still charged a fee by the billing process for such one process executed by the externally provided program.","Further, assume another case in which a user is to configure a workflow scheme by adding a process to the workflow, wherein the process may be executed by using an externally provided program. Such externally-provided program may be referred to as a \u201cplug-in\u201d or \u201cplug-in program.\u201d When a process is added to a workflow scheme, event information indicating addition of the process is reported to the externally provided program via API. In such a case, an addition to the workflow may be rejected by the plug-in program for some reason, for example, because of conditions placed on the number of licenses. If the workflow including such a rejection by the plug-in program is developed by a user, and the user implements such workflow, the plug-in program cannot be executed, thus necessitating reconfiguration of the workflow.","As such, if an event is reported to an externally provided program (or plug-in program) via API after an after-event occurs, the user is able to recognize that there is an error in the workflow scheme only after the workflow is implemented. Such error may be referred to as inconsistency of information included or related to a workflow, and as described above such information inconsistency included in a workflow cannot be detected immediately when the workflow scheme is developed. In addition, such information inconsistency may occur not only in a workflow system for file management system but also in SDK systems using an externally provided program via API.","In one aspect of the present invention, a workflow information generation unit used for constructing a workflow configured with a plurality of processes is devised. Information of the plurality of processes is includable in the workflow and storable in a workflow information storage using the workflow information generation unit. The workflow information generation unit includes a process-designation information obtaining, an advance notice output unit, an implementation-determination information obtaining unit, a process information output unit, and a result information output unit. The process-designation information obtaining unit obtains process-designation information designating a process to be included in the workflow. The advance notice output unit outputs advance notice information notifying that information of the process designated by the obtained process-designation information is to be stored in the workflow information storage before storing information of the designated process in the workflow information storage. The implementation-determination information obtaining unit obtains implementation-determination information when the advance notice information is output. The implementation-determination information indicates whether the designated process is allowed to be included in the workflow. The process information output unit stores information of the designated process to the workflow information storage when the obtained implementation-determination information indicates that the designated process is allowed to be included in the workflow. The result information output unit outputs result information for the designated process by preliminarily running the designated process when constructing the workflow. The result information is prepared based on the obtained implementation-determination information indicating whether the designated process is allowed to be included in the workflow.","In another aspect of the present invention, a method of constructing a workflow configured with a plurality of processes is devised. Information of the processes for constructing the workflow is storable in a workflow information storage using a workflow information generation unit. The method includes steps of a) obtaining, b) outputting, c) obtaining, d) storing, and e) outputting. In step a), obtaining process-designation information designating a process to be included in the workflow is obtained using a process-designation information obtaining unit. In step b), advance notice information is output by using an advance notice output unit. The advance notice information notifies that information of the process designated by the obtained process-designation information is to be stored in the workflow information storage before storing the designated process in the workflow information storage. In step c), implementation-determination information is obtained when the advance notice information is output using an implementation-determination information obtaining unit. The implementation-determination information indicates whether the designated process is allowed to be included in the workflow. In step d), information of the designated process is stored to the workflow information storage, using a process information output unit, when the obtained implementation-determination information indicates that the designated process is allowed to be included in the workflow. In step e), result information for the designated process is output by preliminarily running the designated process when constructing the workflow using a result information output unit. The result information is prepared based on the obtained implementation-determination information indicating whether the designated process is allowed to be included in the workflow.","In another aspect of the present invention, an image processing apparatus that executes a workflow configured with a plurality of processes is devised. The image processing apparatus includes a workflow information generation unit, an execution instruction obtaining unit, an advance notice output unit, an implementation-determination information obtaining unit, a process execution unit, and a result information output unit. The workflow information generation unit is used for constructing a workflow constructable by storing information of the processes in a workflow information storage. The execution instruction obtaining unit obtains information to designate a workflow to be executed and information to instruct execution of the workflow. The advance notice output unit outputs advance information notifies that the processes included in the workflow are to be implemented. The implementation-determination information obtaining unit obtains implementation-determination information for the processes when the advance information is output. The implementation-determination information indicates whether the processes included in the workflow are implementable. The process execution unit executes the processes included in the workflow when the obtained implementation-determination information indicates the processes included in the workflow are implementable. The result information output unit outputs result information indicating a result of the implemented process based on the obtained implementation-determination information.","The accompanying drawings are intended to depict exemplary embodiments of the present invention and should not be interpreted to limit the scope thereof.

Based on such information, the license management plug-in determines whether a process plug-in can be added (or registered) to a workflow in view of license condition, wherein such determination may be used as result information of the license management plug-in . Specifically, the license management plug-in retains information on license condition for application program, which is used to implement each of process plug-ins. As shown in , the license management plug-in may include information on identification (ID) for identifying each process plug-in, plug-in name, licenseable number, and the present number of registration, for example. The licenseable number indicates the maximum number allowable for license registration. The present number of registration indicates the number of already registered license.","For example, when a registration of \u201cplug-in a\u201d (see ) is instructed, the license management plug-in checks the present number of registration of \u201cplug-in a\u201d against the licenseable number. If the present number of registration of \u201cplug-in a\u201d is determined same as the licenseable number, the license management plug-in reports to the workflow construction unit  that the registration of \u201cplug-in a\u201d is impossible (or not allowed). With such configuration, a given process plug-in cannot be added and registered when the present number of registration of given process plug-in already becomes the maximum number (or upper limit number) of the licenseable number.","As such, the license management plug-in may be used to determine whether a designated process is allowed to be included in a workflow based on usage condition information set for an application program. Further, the license management plug-in may update information of the usage condition of the application program based on the result information.","If such configuration is not employed, a given process plug-in can be added and registered even when the present number of registration of given process plug-in already becomes the maximum number (or upper limit number) of the licenseable number, and then the given process plug-in may be used as information for constructing a workflow. However, such constructed workflow includes an error condition because of the above-mentioned, not-allowed registration condition. The above-described configuration according to an example embodiment can prevent such error-included workflow construction.","The device management plug-in retains information (see ), and determines whether a process plug-in can be added (or registered) to a workflow in view of device management condition, wherein the device may mean devices, apparatus, units, or the like, which may be referred to as an external device connected to the workflow information generation unit. Such determination may be used as result information of the device management plug-in . Specifically, the device management plug-in retains information license condition of the application server  and devices such as printer, facsimile, and scanner, for example, which may conduct processes included in a workflow. As shown in , the device management plug-in may include information on identification (ID) for identifying each device or apparatus, device name, the number of allowable registration, and the present number of registration, for example. The number of allowable registration indicates the maximum number allowable for registration of device to a workflow. The present number of registration indicates the number of already registered device license.","For example, when a registration of \u201cprinter A\u201d (see ) is instructed, the device management plug-in checks the present number of registration of \u201cprinter A\u201d against the number of allowable registration of \u201cprinter A\u201d. If the present number of registration of \u201cprinter A\u201d is determined same as the number of allowable registration of \u201cprinter A\u201d, the device management plug-in reports to the workflow construction unit  that the registration of \u201cprinter A\u201d is impossible (or not allowed).","Further, the device management plug-in can determine whether a concerned device (e.g., printer A) can be registered in view of authority status of an administrator using the administrator terminal  to the concerned device, or in view of inter-connectablity or compatibility between the concerned device and other device or process plug-in.","With such configuration, a given device cannot be added and registered when the present number of registration of device already becomes the maximum number (or upper limit number) of the number of allowable registration; or a given device cannot be added and registered when the given device has incompatibility with another device.","As such, the device management plug-in may be used to determine whether a given device is allowed to be included in a workflow based on usage condition information set for the given device. Further, the device management plug-in may update information of the usage condition of the given device based on the result information.","If such configuration is not employed, a given device can be added and registered even when the present number of registration of device already becomes the maximum number (or upper limit number) of the number of allowable registration or when the given device has incompatibility with another device, and then the given device may be used as information for constructing a workflow. However, such constructed workflow includes an error condition because of the above-described not-allowed registration condition. The above-described configuration according to an example embodiment can prevent such error-included workflow construction.","The distribution location management plug-in retains information (see ), and determines whether a process plug-in can be added (or registered) to a workflow in view of status of distribution location. As shown in , the distribution location management plug-in may include information on identification (ID) for identifying distribution location, address of distribution location, distribution status to the distribution location such as distribution is allowed or not-allowed. The address of distribution location may be e-mail address, path, or internet protocol (IP) address, for example, but not limited thereto.","For example, assume an example case that a given workflow is under construction. When a user instructs a distribution of information to an address of \u201cxxx@xxx.com,\u201d information distribution to the concerned distribution location can be \u201callowed\u201d as shown in . Then, the distribution location management plug-in reports to the workflow construction unit  that the registration of address of \u201cxxx@xxx.com\u201d is possible or allowed. Accordingly, with such configuration, a given distribution location cannot be added and registered when the distribution location is not allowed for information distribution.","If such configuration is not employed, a given distribution location can be added and registered even when the distribution location is not allowed for information distribution, and the given distribution location may be used as information for constructing a workflow. However, such constructed workflow includes an error condition because of the above-described not-allowed distribution location. The above-described configuration according to an example embodiment can prevent such error-included workflow construction.","The billing information management plug-in retains information (see ), and determines whether a process plug-in can be added (or registered) to a workflow in view of billing information prepared from charge money information corresponded to the process plug-in. As shown in , the billing information management plug-in may include information on identification (ID) for identifying each process plug-in, plug-in name, and billing money value which is to be charged when registering a concerned process plug-in, wherein billing money value may be set by a contract or the like, for example. Further, as shown in , the billing information management plug-in stores information of pre-paid money value, predetermined money value, and accumulated billed money value, for example. The pre-paid money value is money value paid in advance.","For example, when a registration (or adding) of \u201cplug-in a\u201d (see ) is instructed, the billing information management plug-in checks the pre-paid money value against billing money value for the \u201cplug-in a.\u201d If it is determined that the pre-paid money value is less than the billing money value of \u201cplug-in a\u201d to be added to the workflow, the billing information management plug-in reports to the workflow construction unit  that the registration of \u201cplug-in a\u201d is impossible (or not allowed).","Further, in another example case, when a registration of \u201cplug-in a\u201d (see ) is instructed, the billing information management plug-in checks the predetermined money value against an total money value composed of already accumulated billed money value and to-be-charged money value for \u201cplug-in a,\u201d wherein the total money value is computed by adding the already accumulated billed money value and to-be-charged money value. If it is determined that the total money value is greater than the predetermined money value, the billing information management plug-in reports to the workflow construction unit  that the registration of \u201cplug-in a\u201d is impossible (or not allowed). With such configuration, a given process cannot be added and registered when it is determined that an addition of the process is not allowed based on billing information.","If such configuration is not employed, a given process can be added and registered even when the process cannot be conducted, and the given process may be used as information for constructing a workflow. However, such constructed workflow includes an error condition because of the above-described not-allowable billing condition. The above-described configuration according to an example embodiment can prevent such error-included workflow construction.","A description is now given to a process of constructing a workflow according to an example embodiment, conducted using a file management system, with reference to .  is a flowchart showing a process of constructing a workflow for the file management system, and  shows an example graphical user interface (GUI) used for developing a workflow for a file management system. Hereinafter, such GUI may be referred to as \u201cworkflow construction screen\u201d as a whole.","As shown in , the workflow construction screen may include an icon arrangement window , and an icon list window , for example. The icon arrangement window is used as a display portion for displaying process plug-ins to-be-included in a workflow and icons of devices, which conduct given processes, for example. Icons displayed on the icon arrangement window can be linked to information stored in the workflow information storage  of the image processing apparatus . When a user develops a workflow using such workflow construction screen, workflow information can be stored in the workflow information storage  in a real time manner.","A user may use a pointing device such as a mouse to drag icons of plug-in or devices displayed on the icon list window , and drop the dragged-icon on the icon arrangement window , which may be referred to as a drag-and-drop process of icon. With such drag-and-drop procedure, the operation information obtaining unit  can obtain information for constructing a workflow, and then addition of process plug-in to a workflow is instructed to the workflow construction unit  (step S). Accordingly, at step S, the operation information obtaining unit  functions as a process-designation information obtaining unit, which obtains process-designation information, which designates a given process to added in a workflow. The operation information obtaining unit  inputs the obtained process-designation information to the workflow construction unit .","When the addition of process plug-in is instructed, the workflow construction unit  generates an event corresponding to the process plug-in to be added. Then, the workflow construction unit  reports the event corresponding to the adding process plug-in to the event plug-in  as \u201cadvance notice\u201d before the process plug-in is added (or registered) in the workflow (step S). At step S, the \u201cadvance notice\u201d includes information of the process plug-in, which is instructed to be added to the workflow. At step S, the \u201cadvance notice\u201d is used to notice that a given process, to be added in a workflow, is to be stored in the workflow information storage . Accordingly, at step S, the workflow construction unit  may function as an advance notice output unit.","The event plug-in  determines whether a concerned process plug-in (e.g., see ) can be added (or registered) at step S. Accordingly, at step S, the event plug-in  may function as an implementation-determination unit. The event plug-in  inputs a result of implementation-determination at step S to the workflow construction unit . Accordingly, at step S, the workflow construction unit  may function as an implementation-determination information obtaining unit.","If the event plug-in  rejects the registration of concerned process plug-in (YES at step S), the workflow construction unit  generates rejection information that the addition of process plug-in is rejected as shown in , and displays the rejection information on the display  (step S). Accordingly, at step S, the workflow construction unit  may function as a notice information generator, which generates notice information that the addition of concerned process plug-in is impossible (or not allowed), wherein the notice information may be reported to a user as an error notice, for example. With such configuration, a user can immediately recognize an error of workflow when constructing the workflow.","Further, when the notice information indicating that the addition of concerned process plug-in is impossible (or not allowed) is reported to the user, a reason of such rejection (i.e., addition is impossible) can be reported with a given message as shown in . With such a configuration, a user can recognize types of error easily, by which a countermeasure for such error can be conducted without undue burden, by which user convenience can be enhanced.","Then, the workflow construction unit  reports an after-the-fact notice to the event plug-in  at step S, in which the after-the-fact notice is a notice that the addition of process plug-in instructed at step S is rejected, and then the process ends. Accordingly, at step S, the workflow construction unit  may function as a result information output unit, which outputs result information determined from the processing at step S.","If the event plug-in  does not reject the registration of process plug-in (No at step S), the workflow construction unit  conducts the registration of process plug-in, which is instructed at step S (step S).","At step S, the concerned information is registered in the workflow information storage . Accordingly, at step S, the workflow construction unit  outputs ID information of workflow being under construction, and information of process plug-in to be added to the workflow to the image processing apparatus  via the network I\/F . Hereinafter, the ID information of workflow being under construction and information of process plug-in to be added to the workflow may be referred to as \u201cworkflow construction information,\u201d collectively. Accordingly, at step S, the workflow construction unit  may function as a process information output unit, which outputs process information of process plug-in. In the image processing apparatus , the I\/O controller  receives the \u201cworkflow construction information\u201d via the network I\/F , and then inputs the \u201cworkflow construction information\u201d to the main control unit .","When the main control unit  obtains the \u201cworkflow construction information\u201d, the main control unit  updates information in the workflow information storage , in which a designated process is added to the workflow designated by the ID at step S.","If the registration process is completed correctly (Yes at step S), the workflow construction unit  reports an after-the-fact notice indicating that the addition of process plug-in is completed successfully to the event plug-in  (step S), wherein the addition of process plug-in is instructed at step S, and then the process ends. Accordingly, at step S, the workflow construction unit  may function as a result information output unit.","At step S, the event plug-in  is reported with the after-the-fact notice indicating that the addition of process plug-in is completed successfully, and then the event plug-in  updates information shown in , , and , for example. For example, the license management plug-in and the device management plug-in increment \u201cthe present number of registration\u201d for the added process plug-in. Further, the billing information management plug-in adds \u201cbilling money value\u201d for the added process plug-in to \u201caccumulated billed money value.\u201d","If the process is not completed successfully (No at step S), the workflow construction unit  reports an after-the-fact notice indicating that the addition of process plug-in is failed to the event plug-in  (step S), wherein the addition of process plug-in is instructed at step S, and the process ends. Accordingly, at step S, the workflow construction unit  may function as a result information output unit.","As such, in example embodiment, when a workflow construction is being conducted for the file management system, before a given process plug-in is actually added and registered, a notice that such addition and registration process is to be conducted is reported to the event plug-in  in advance. If the event plug-in  does not reject the addition (or registration) of given process plug-in, the workflow construction unit  conducts a registration process of given process plug-in actually. If the event plug-in  rejects the addition (or registration) of given process plug-in, the workflow construction unit  reports rejection of registration of given process plug-in to a user.","With such a configuration, when an addition of process plug-in is instructed, a user can recognize whether addition of a given process plug-in is rejected or accepted in a real time manner when a workflow is being under construction.","If the user cannot recognize the rejected or accepted status of addition of process plug-in in a real time manner when a workflow is being under construction, the user may construct a workflow including error. If such error-included workflow is constructed, such error may become obvious when the user actually executes the workflow for the first time. In such a case, the user needs to re-construct the workflow, by which user convenience is degraded, and an administrator may need to manage such error-included workflow, which may result into a greater burden for management of system.","As above described, in the file management system according to an example embodiment, a user can recognize whether addition of a given process plug-in is rejected or accepted in a real time manner when a workflow is being under construction. Accordingly, as for such file management system, user convenience can be enhanced and a management burden of administrator can be reduced.","Further, in the file management system according to an example embodiment, the workflow construction unit  issues the after-the-fact notice when a result of the addition of process plug-in is established at step S, S, S. Accordingly, the event plug-in  increments the number of registration and\/or billing money only after the event plug-in  is received with a notice that the process for addition of process plug-in is completed (e.g., step S). With such a configuration, if the process for addition of process plug-in is not completed, the event plug-in  does not increment the number of registration and\/or billing money, by which information consistency for workflow can be maintained.","A description is now given to an example process for executing a workflow in the image processing apparatus  with reference to . A user may use the display panel  of the image processing apparatus  to instruct a workflow execution, for example.","When the user instructs a start of a given workflow (hereinafter referred to as \u201cdesignated workflow\u201d) at step S, the workflow controller obtains process information included in the designated workflow from the workflow information storage , and reports all processes included in the designated workflow to the event plug-in as \u201cadvance information\u201d before the processes are actually conducted (step S). In step S and S, the main control unit  may function as an execution instruction obtaining unit.","When the event plug-in is reported from the workflow controller , the event plug-in checks whether all processes can be conducted (step S). Step S will be described in detail later.","If it is determined that any one of processes is impossible to conduct at step S (Yes at step S), the event plug-in reports to the workflow controller that the workflow is impossible to conduct. Upon receiving such impossible-to-conduct report, the workflow controller cancels to execute the workflow instructed by the user (step S). Further, the main control unit  controls the operation unit controller  to display an error message indicating the workflow is impossible to execute on the display panel  (step S).","After canceling the workflow execution and notifying the error message to a user, the workflow controller reports an after-the-fact notice indicating cancellation of workflow execution to the event plug-in (step S), and then the process ends.","If it is determined that all processes can be conducted at step S (No at step S), the event plug-in reports to the workflow controller that the workflow execution is possible. Upon receiving the report that the workflow execution is possible, the workflow controller conducts all processes included in the designated workflow with a given sequential order (step S). In step S, the main control unit  may function as a process execution unit.","If all processes are completed successfully (Yes at step S), the workflow controller reports an after-the-fact notice indicating that workflow execution is completed successfully to the event plug-in (step S). Then, the event plug-in conducts a post-processing related to a completion of workflow execution. Such post-processing may be charging money for an actually conducted billing process, for example. If such post-processing is not conducted, information consistency for a workflow system cannot be secured. For example, if charged money is not recorded in a workflow system when a process related to billing is actually conducted, money information becomes incorrect.","If all processes are not completed successfully (No at step S), the workflow controller reports an after-the-fact notice indicating that the workflow execution is failed to the event plug-in (step S), and then the process ends.","A description is now given to the event plug-in and processing at step S with reference to . As shown in , the event plug-in may include a device management plug-in , a distribution location management plug-in , and a billing management plug-in , for example.","If a given process, to be conducted using the application server , is included in process information reported at step S, the device management plug-in checks status of the application server  at step S. When the application server  is down due to some reasons (e.g. power-off), or when the application server  cannot conduct a requested given process with a higher processing speed because of heavy workload being processed in the application server , the device management plug-in determines that workflow execution is impossible.","For example, if a given process to be conducted by the application server  is set (or integrated) at a last part of workflow, the application server  conducts the given process after other processes are completed. If the application server  cannot conduct the given process, the workflow execution cannot be completed, and an error condition occurs. In this case, a user may recognize that the workflow execution is impossible at the very end of workflow, which is a waste of time for user.","On the contrary, as above described, in an example embodiment, an \u201cadvance notice\u201d can be reported to a user, by which a user can recognize whether the workflow execution is possible at an earlier timing. Accordingly, if an impossible-to-conduct process is included in a workflow, a user can recognize that the workflow cannot be completed at an earlier timing, by which a waste of time for user can be reduced or eliminated.","At step S, the distribution location management plug-in checks distribution location or storing location of document information, which is instructed to execute as a process of workflow. The distribution location management plug-in retains information, similar to information shown in , and checks whether a document information can be distributed to a designated distribution location. If the designated distribution location is set as distribution-not-allowed condition, the distribution location management plug-in determines that workflow execution is impossible. Accordingly, as similar to an effect of the device management plug-in , a user can recognize that the workflow cannot be completed at an earlier timing, by which a waste of time for user can be reduced or eliminated.","At step S, the billing management plug-in checks billing information, which is instructed to execute as a process of a workflow. The billing management plug-in retains information, similar to information shown in , and determines whether a process for process plug-in can be conducted based on a comparison of billing money information of process plug-in that is instructed to be conducted and pre-paid money value; or based on a comparison of accumulated billed money value and predetermined money value. Accordingly, as similar to an effect of the device management plug-in , a user can recognize that the workflow cannot be completed at an earlier timing, by which a waste of time for user can be reduced or eliminated.","In the above-described example embodiment, the event plug-in  and the event plug-in may be configured as shown in , for example. However, an administrator of system can change a configuration of plug-ins using different event plug-ins having different functions.","As such, the event plug-in  and the event plug-in can be configured with any types of plug-ins. When the workflow construction unit  or the workflow controller outputs \u201cbefore-event\u201d information to the event plug-in  or the event plug-in respectively, the event plug-in  and the event plug-in may functions as an implementation-determination unit that determines whether an given process corresponded to such \u201cbefore-event\u201d information can be conducted.","For example, in the above-described example embodiment, the event plug-in  and the event plug-in may determine whether a given process corresponded to such \u201cbefore-event\u201d information can be conducted. Further, the event plug-in  and the event plug-in may determine whether an given process corresponded to such \u201cbefore-event\u201d information can be conducted using an external apparatus such as application server , file management server , or the like by accessing to such external apparatus via a network.","As above described, in an example embodiment, a method of constructing a workflow configured with a plurality of processes, using information of the processes for constructing the workflow being storable in a workflow information storage using a workflow information generation unit. The method includes the steps of a) obtaining process-designation information designating a process to be included in the workflow using a process-designation information obtaining unit; b) outputting advance notice information by using an advance notice output unit, the advance notice information notifying that information of the process designated by the obtained process-designation information is to be stored in the workflow information storage before storing the designated process in the workflow information storage;
