title: Dynamic output selection using highly optimized data structures
abstract: A node container is constructed with multiple binary tree views. A processing device creates a primary view binary tree within the node container based on a primary key. A set of records that match fields of the primary key is chained to the primary view. The processing device also creates one or more alternate views within the node container to allow access to the same set of records via one or more alternate keys, which are subsets of the fields of the primary key. The chain of records is extracted from the node container when matched to a subsequent query search.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to a heuristic search mechanism, and more specifically, to an extendable search mechanism using a node container with multiple binary tree views for fixed sized objects with limited expansion in shared storage.","Contemporary multi-image operating system environments share a single set of data amongst all operating system images. Sharing allows processes on one image to share processing capabilities and responsibilities with other images. Typically, objects within shared storage are stored in a fixed record table format. This fixed format has drawbacks when new requirements must be considered. When objects run short of reserved area they cannot be easily extended due to various members storing offsets to these objects. A resolution to this situation would be to shut down a coupled facility and perform an initialization of the shared storage to accommodate increased size. This type of disruption, however, is not acceptable on enterprise type systems with today's 24\u00d77 availability needs.","According to an embodiment, a computer program including a computer readable storage medium having computer readable program code stored thereon that, when executed, performs a method for constructing a node container including multiple binary tree views. A processing device creates a primary view binary tree within the node container based on a primary key. The method chains a set of records that match fields of the primary key to the primary view. The processing device also creates one or more alternate views within the node container to allow access to the same set of records via one or more alternate keys, which are subsets of the fields of the primary key. The chain of records is extracted from the node container when matched to a query search.","According to another embodiment, a computer system including a processor, a system memory, and a bus is configured to perform a method for constructing a node container including multiple binary tree views. A processing device creates a primary view binary tree within the node container based on a primary key. The method chains a set of records that match fields of the primary key to the primary view. The processing device also creates one or more alternate views within the node container to allow access to the same set of records via one or more alternate keys, which are subsets of the fields of the primary key. The chain of records is extracted from the node container when matched to a query search.","According to another embodiment a computer-implemented method is provided for constructing a node container including multiple binary tree views. A processing device creates a primary view binary tree within the node container based on a primary key. The method chains a set of records that match fields of the primary key to the primary view. The processing device also creates one or more alternate views within the node container to allow access to the same set of records via one or more alternate keys, which are subsets of the fields of the primary key. The chain of records is extracted from the node container when matched to a query search.","Additional features and advantages are realized through the techniques of the present invention. Other embodiments and aspects of the invention are described in detail herein and are considered a part of the claimed invention. For a better understanding of the invention with the advantages and the features, refer to the description and to the drawings.","Embodiments disclosed herein disclose an extendable search mechanism for objects with limited expansion capabilities. A node container is constructed with multiple binary tree views, including a primary view and one or more alternate views. A set of records that match fields of the primary key is chained to the primary view and the chain of records is extracted from the node container when a primary or alternate view is matched to a query search.","Processing for work selection takes a set of selection criteria associated with a device and pairs it with output element groups to see if they match. Output element groups reside within a checkpoint on a coupling facility or direct access storage device (DASD). The output element group area is a table of limited, fixed-length areas whose location within the checkpoint must not change.","Chaining the output elements together to minimize the number of elements to be examined optimizes the way in which customers can organize their output. But as time and processing has changed, this method of optimization has become less effective. This is especially true as customers move from real devices to process output to logical devices controlled by speech application programming interface (SAPI). The pairing code must be run for each potential output element in order to return the most relevant output element for the device.","An embodiment of the disclosure compiles heuristic information on selection criteria so that output elements will be chained in optimal sequence. Size of free space within the output element group is very limited and only one set of forward\/backward chaining fields are generally available. Embodiments support fast access with multiple views of similar data given limited free space. Also, due to the heuristic qualities of an embodiment, adjustments are made to dynamically satisfy changing customer requirements.","Referring now to , a block diagram of a computer system  suitable for implementing an extendable search mechanism using a node container with multiple binary tree views is shown. Computer system  is only one example of a computer system and is not intended to suggest any limitation as to the scope of use or functionality of embodiments described herein. Regardless, computer system  is capable of being implemented and\/or performing any of the functionality set forth hereinabove.","Computer system  is operational with numerous other general purpose or special purpose computing system environments or configurations. Examples of well-known computing systems, environments, and\/or configurations that may be suitable for use with computer system  include, but are not limited to, personal computer systems, server computer systems, thin clients, thick clients, handheld or laptop devices, multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based systems, set top boxes, programmable consumer electronics, network PCs, minicomputer systems, mainframe computer systems, and distributed cloud computing environments that include any of the above systems or devices, and the like.","Computer system  may be described in the general context of computer system-executable instructions, such as program modules, being executed by the computer system .

In a distributed cloud computing environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote computer system storage media including memory storage devices.","As shown in , computer system  is shown in the form of a general-purpose computing device. The components of computer system may include, but are not limited to, one or more processors or processing units , a system memory , and a bus  that couples various system components including system memory  to processor .","Bus  represents one or more of any of several types of bus structures, including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, an accelerated graphics port, and a processor or local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures.

Such media may be any available media that is accessible by computer system\/server , and it includes both volatile and non-volatile media, removable and non-removable media.","System memory  can include computer system readable media in the form of volatile memory, such as random access memory (RAM)  and\/or cache memory .

Each of the operating system, one or more application programs, other program modules, and program data or some combination thereof, may include an implementation of a networking environment.

Referring to Table 1, the node container contains one or more binary trees. Each binary tree is termed a view. According to an embodiment, the binary trees can be threaded through multiple non-contiguous node containers.","The primary view of an embodiment contains a composite key and a chain of all records or output elements that match the key. A record or output element can be on one and only one chain. The primary key consists of 1 to n key fields. In Table 1, the primary key is \u201cABC\u201d with each letter representing a key field. There is only one primary view per node container and each primary view is identified by a unique key.","A primary view of an embodiment is organized as a balanced binary tree with its own root. The primary view terms \u201cLE\u201d and \u201cRI\u201d in Table 1 denote left and right subtree node offsets of the next collated node. In Table 1, both the key value and the node container references are listed. In practice, only a node container reference may be required. The BF is a balance factor (\u22121, 0, 1) used by a known AVL tree algorithm to assure the tree is balanced at all times and, in turn, assures fast access times.","A node container of an embodiment also contains 0 to n alternate views. An alternate view allows access to the same set of records or output elements via an alternate key, which is a subset of the primary key fields. Although the alternate view is a subset of the primary view, the order of the fields in the alternate view may differ from the primary view.","Table 1 shows two alternate views. The key field for Alternate-View 1 includes primary key fields 1 and 2 and key \u201cAB\u201d. The key fields and values are only stored in the primary key and a tree node descriptor is used to define locations of primary and alternate key fields within the node container. A tree node descriptor is an object-oriented approach that allows a definition of tree and nodes so that one set of code may perform all tree operations regardless of tree specifics.","An alternate view is also organized as a balanced binary tree with its own root. Given an alternate key there may be multiple container nodes with records or output elements that may match an alternate key. By definition binary trees do not handle duplicates, so an alternate view contains a doubly linked list of container nodes with primary key of which the alternate key is a subset of. This allows limited real estate within the output element area to support multiple collating views with very fast access.","Embodiments of the container nodes do not need to be contiguous since the underlying access data structure is a binary tree. Access to the records or output elements is only through the binary tree so the container nodes do not share the offset problem of the contemporary art. Also, because the highly optimized structure of an embodiment is in the checkpoint, all members within a tightly coupled complex can see the updates.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","310","320","330","340"]},"If the processing device does not find a container node with a primary view that matches the search key of a selected record in block , a container node is acquired in block .

Table 3 shows the root offsets for the primary view, alternate view 1 and alternate view 2. Also shown in Table 3, is the chain of records associated with the primary view of each node container.","Referring to the node containers shown in Table 3, a matching record chain is extracted from a container node using a binary search when a device requests a record or an output element. For example, when a device requests a record or output element for class\/destination\/disposition with a key value of BDA, a binary search finds node container  in Table 3 and extracts one or more records or output elements from the chain. When the device requests records or output elements with a disposition of class\/destination key value \u201cAB\u201d, a binary search is performed on alternate view 1 and node container  is found. Chained to node container  is node container  and that is chained to . All the records or output elements for the three node containers are candidates for the given device query. The binary access is built on recorded heuristics and only uses six bytes of constrained output element real estate.","As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, aspects of the present invention may be embodied as a system, method or computer program product.
