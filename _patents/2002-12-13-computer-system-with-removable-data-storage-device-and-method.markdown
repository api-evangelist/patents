{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, used and\/or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to computer storage media systems and methods and more particularly to such systems and methods employing removable media devices.","2. Description of Related Art","Computer storage media devices such as floppy disks, hard disk drives, removable hard disks, compact disks (CD), digital versatile disks (DVD), tape drives, smart cards, and PCMCIA cards are employed in many computer systems. Security of these types of storage media typically involves only manual processes. Usually, several individuals in an office have access to a secure storage area where media are checked in and out. The disadvantages of such a system are many. By using only manual devices, it is very cumbersome to track a list of borrowers of media devices from a storage area. Full scale accounting of monitored items is extremely slow. It is even more onerous to account for the duration of time that individuals had these media in their possession. The combination of slow accounting of information and high speed copying and transmission of computer information allows miscreants to copy or steal the information on the storage devices and then replace the computer information storage devices in the storage rooms. The periodic nature of current record keeping systems allows miscreants to tamper with the storage devices. A manual system often does not accurately inventory nor track computer media and the accountability of media users.","Security problems can be traced to the tremendous progress made in the capacity of storage media and devices, and the information transfer rates. Early floppy disks and tape drives of the nineteen seventies were capable of storing several hundred kilobytes of information while the floppy disks of the nineteen nineties have capacities of the order of 1.4 megabytes. Current Zip drives store several hundred megabytes of information while they measure about 3.5 inches by 4 inches and are a quarter inch thick, and certain thinly dimensioned drives and carry several gigabytes of information. A decade ago only a very select group of users had access to write-capable CD-ROM drives, however most current computer systems now have capabilities to write CD-ROMs. Recent developments have provided new recording technology that could push the maximum data capacity of a single hard disk drive platter to 200 GB.","With such advancements, almost any computer user can copy nearly a terabyte of information; it can be done in less than ten seconds. In a terabyte of information, an organization can lose all its password files, a whole set of drawings for critical weapon systems, complete specification manuals, and so on. The trend in storage technology is towards greater capacities, smaller sizes, and faster speeds of transfer of information. Credit card size storage devices (smart cards) with megabytes of information capacity pose a real threat to information security.","Information resources further face virus attacks and other threats. Protection of information resources is crucial to national security and U.S. critical infrastructure protection groups are addressing these issues very seriously. This problem is the reverse of information stealing. As workers borrow data storage devices from an organization and use them on other computer systems and in the process introduce viruses and applets on to the data storage devices, which are in turn, transmitted to host computers upon return to the organization. Once introduced, applets, software agents, and other computer programs can cause an organization's critical computer information to be transmitted via a network without a user's knowledge. Compared to fixed data storage devices (hard disk drives), removable data storage devices allow users to transfer information (data and programs) from one computer to another in one organization and from one computer to another in different organizations. Organizations do not want unauthorized information introduced inadvertently, deliberately, or maliciously into their systems.","Certain media storage containers available today offer barcode recognition of interchanged drives and magazines. As an example, The Kodak Digital Science CD\/DVD Library is a CD jukebox designed for high-volume information storage, retrieval, archiving, and backup applications. The CD\/DVD library can give one access to a total of 162 CDs or DVDs, providing a maximum storage capacity of 421 gigabytes of data. An average disc exchange time of about four seconds helps assure that information is available immediately when users request it. The arrangement is a front-loading mailbox with password security key-lock and software-interlock front door access to drive and magazine bay support for \u201chot-swaps\u201d of magazines. The library device has bar code recognition of interchanged drives.","Systems such as these have several disadvantages: 1) they are always on line, 2) they do not record who accessed which device, and 3) they do not record what (copy, modify, delete) users did with those files or information. Additionally, paper barcodes suffer from the disadvantage that it is relatively easy for miscreants and adversaries to forge them. Many large storage systems have been developed in response to the explosive growth in network storage capacity requirements. They are attractive for adding storage quickly and economically. Despite their advantages, these online information storage devices are not detached storage devices, which are a requirement in the case of highly valuable and national security critical information. With lap top computers, PDAs, and other portable computing devices becoming smaller in size and more capable in memory size, theft of critical information from organizations is a real possibility. Techniques and methods are needed to safeguard information of an organization by using such portable devices as physical conveyors of computer information.","Personal computers purchased by the Defense Department since 1994 have been equipped with PCMCIA card slots, as part of a secure Defense Message System. The cards, which can hold 170 megabytes of information, can fit into a shirt pocket, so a job begun at one workstation might be continued at another location on a different computer. While this feature is an advantage for genuine workers, it is also a feature welcomed by thieves, malicious users, and agents of adversaries.","A method of securely storing data in a computer system is provided which comprises providing a removable data storage device that is able to be inserted and removed from the computer system and the step of applying a Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID) tag to the removable data storage device is performed.","A computer system for securely storing data is provided having a removable data storage device that is able to be inserted into and removed from the computer system and a Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID) tag applied to the removable data storage device is provided.","As will be shown and described herein, a computer system for securely storing data is provided. A removable data storage device that is insertable into and removable from the computer system is affixed with an identification tag, such as a Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID) tag. Referring to , a removable data storage device  is shown. A label  mounted to an associated RFID tag  are together placed on the removable data storage device  resulting in the combination  as shown. The label and tag combination does not add much thickness, bulk, or weight to the disk. In the example shown in , various removable data storage devices may be employed, including but not limited to: floppy disks, zip disks, digital versatile disks (DVD's), tape drives, smart cards (including Common Access Cards by the Department of Defense), or PCMCIA (personal computer memory card international association) cards. An identification code (such as an identification number or other code) is assigned to a respective removable data storage device . As will be described in further detail, the RFID tag  has read\/write capabilities. In one example, the RFID tag  has a silicon integrated circuit connected to carbon ink electrodes such that a storage unit to hold identification information is provided at the RFID tag . The identification code  associated with the removable data storage device  is stored at the RFID tag  attached to the storage device. Several types of RFID tags are currently available that can be applied to the data storage devices. It is also possible that the RFID devices can be deposited on to the data storage devices during manufacturing stage.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["110","112","100","110","100","112","100","104","112","100"]},"As a data storage device moves across the twin readers  and , located in reading unit , as shown in , information is transferred from the removable data storage device . Tag reader  captures the data storage device identification code, and the media reader  captures the directory information. As seen in , reading unit  of computer system  houses identification tag reader  and media reader  which are both coupled to processing device  (such as a central processing unit) that is coupled with monitor  for display of information. The identification tag reader  and media reader  transmit the identification code from the RFID tag  and the data directory from the removable data storage device  to the processing device  upon being read by the readers , . The processing device  drives the readers and stores the identification information and data directory information on the removable data storage device . Monitor  is used in conjunction with the CPU . In this example, various types of computer systems may be employed such as a personal computer, desktop, laptop etc. computer system operated by the user or for example, a computer system which controls and monitors the access to multiple stored data storage devices as seen in .","Storage system  is depicted in . In one example, it is a sealed box (safety container) comprising a first storage device holder such as an incoming\/outgoing disk carousel (incoming\/outgoing rack) , and a second storage device holder such as a storage carousel, (storage rack) . Storage device holder  provides a stack  of incoming removable data storage devices that a user is submitting to the storage system  for safe and secure keeping. Storage device holder  provides a storage stack , which receives and keeps the data storage devices  transported from the incoming stack  to the storage stack . As each data storage device  traverses the path from the input\/output location (incoming side) to the storage location (storage side), the twin readers ,  read the information on the identification tag  and the data storage device (such as a computer disk). Generally, only the directory information on the disk is read. In one example, the readers ,  are prevented from accessing and reading the content information on the removable data storage device . Another feature of the system is that if there is no identification tag on the removable data storage device , that device  will not be accepted for storage. Also, neither the contents of the data storage devices nor the directory information contained therein will be read if the tag is not validated. Such prevention of reading of data storage devices, which are not validated by a proper tag, protects a computer system from accepting viruses, Trojan horse software, or other malicious software agents. In other words, only authorized storage devices (disks)  are accepted for use or storage. The access to the storage system  of the computer system  is through the incoming disk stack . A user can feed one data storage device  at a time into the system. Several disks can be fed one after the other. The system  will log them, or catalog them and move them from the incoming rack  to the storage rack .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4","FIG. 5"],"b":["100","132","100","100","138","140","130","104","110","100","112","100"]},"Transportation device  transfers removable data storage devices  between storage device holder  and storage device holder  (and vice versa) such that the identification tag reader  reads the identification code and the media reader  reads the directory data during transfer of the removable data storage device  between storage device holder  and storage device holder . In the example of , a conveyor  and drive  are used as a transportation device, however any suitable transportation means to move the data storage devices  between the storage location and the input\/output location may be employed.","In particular, a disk (or storage data device) is released by means of a disk storage and disk traversal motor  and conveyor  coupled with and operating under control of the processing device . An authorized user inputs user identification information to the processing device (CPU) and enters the identification code of the desired disk to be retrieved. The computer controlled rack  positions itself so that the requested disk is at the traversal point. The disk  is then conveyed to the outgoing stack . The CPU  records the name of the requester and the disk  requested. The CPU  also records the directory details on that disk , which should be the same as they were when the disk was received into storage. Unauthorized users cannot access the computer system  even if they get physical access to the system, assuming they cannot break open the storage container .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 7"],"b":["120","126","122","120","100","100","150","102","104","152","104","102","120"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 6"],"b":["156","158","102","104","110","112","126","122","120","136","134","100"]},"When the user returns the data storage device  to the storage system , the data storage device is read, the particular storage device identified, the directory information gathered, and stored in the CPU . Thus, data on the removable data storage device  is read to identify the data storage device. Directory information pertaining to the data storage device  is gathered by media reader  for transmission and storage at the processing device  in response to the removable data storage device being returned to the computer system . As the reader records date and time of data storage device  deposits and retrievals, accountability of data storage device usage is maintained.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 9"],"b":["100","200","126","202","203","203","100","204","205","207","208","120"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["122","126","122"]},"It is desired that removable media be tagged and assign identification numbers as soon as they are accepted into an organization's inventory. The identified media may selectively be stored in a blank media storage, which will serve as a media issue system for the organization. Computers in the organization are to be equipped with media ID tag readers. When a media (CD-ROM or disk) is inserted into a drive, its id tag is first read. If a media carries an authorized id number then will it be read. This prevents the use of unauthorized media in connection with the secure information computer systems of an organization.","The instantly proposed use of RFID tags offer non-contact, non-line-of-sight nature of the technology. They possess read\/write capability. RFID tags can be also read from significant distances. RFID tag data is also generally not able to be copied through mechanical means, and by using encryption techniques unauthorized replication will be extremely difficult.","There are several alternative RFID tags, which may selectively be employed. One example of a RFID tag is a Motorola BiStatix\u2122 tag. The exemplary RFID tag  shown in , works on a capacitive coupling principle, wherein, electric fields are capacitively coupled to and from a reader and tag. The tag consists primarily of a silicon integrated circuit  chip connected to carbon ink electrodes  printed on a sheet of paper or label . As in an inductive system, an RFID reader\/writer  generates an excitation field, which serves as both the source of power and master clock for the tag. The tag cyclically modulates its data contents and transmits them to a receiver circuit of the reader . The reader demodulates and decodes the data signal and provides a formatted data packet to a host computer (such as processing device) for further data processing. Tags are printable by a label converter using standard industry methods. The RFID silicon is attached to the printed material. The tag can be bent, cut, torn and remains functional as long as some remnants of the electrode are connected to the silicon integrated circuit. In terms of tag orientation, inductive tags perform optimally at parallel planes of reader and tag, but monopole-coupled tags (such as BiStatix\u2122 tags) do not have this orientation constraint. They can be applied to any physical configuration, are very flexible, thin, flat, and not limited with regard to the substrate material. The tags may selectively operate at 125 KHz. The integrated circuit of the exemplary tag holds about 800 user bits of data storage\/information or about 100 characters worth of information, enough for a title\/name, classification, serial number, date\/time, or similar information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 13","b":["300","122","124","200","100","202","102","104","204","100"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 14","b":["300","122","124","210","10","212","102","104","214","100","126"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 15","b":["220","222","224","120","226","228","230","232"]},"The computer system is given directory read access to the stored media by providing a subset operating system software. The system may selectively have no other read, write, or delete access to the contents of the files on the media. The system can keep track of the status of the directory of all files on the media, while also providing user authentication, authorization, and accounting, a protocol that identifies users, authorizes them for access according to their specific profiles, and maintains accountability records to track usage for each user.","Used in conjunction with a \u201csmart card\u201d, the RFID tag approach permits contact-less physical access control (accomplished via RFID) to co-exist with contact-oriented applications such as access or authentication to secure areas. When a removable data storage device is connected to the computer system , it registers its identity and the time it is connected. The processing device  registers when a removable data storage device  is checked in and when it is checked out. The computer system also records who checked it in and who checked it out. An organization can quickly have an inventory of its removable media. The computer system keeps track of what files were created, deleted, and modified (in size) during the period the media were borrowed from the repository. This later function provides a database of people who were borrowing the media devices and using them in various ways.","The processing device of the computer system is programmed to provide the following software functionality: recognizing the identity of a removable disk drive that is connected (checked-in); recording the time a removable data storage device that is connected to the system; recognizing the identity of a removable data storage device is disconnected (checked-out); recording the time a removable data storage device is disconnected from the system; recognizing the identity of a person that checked-in a removable data storage device; recognizing the identity of a person that checked-out a removable data storage device; disposition of files on the media at check-out and at check-in. The processing device  maintains a log of information associated with the removable data storage device including information relating to the date and time the removable data storage device was inserted and retrieved from the computer system, identification of persons inserting and retrieving the removable data storage device from the computer system, and disposition of files stored at the removable data storage device at insertion and retrieval of the data storage device from the computer system.","In order to recognize persons who check in and check out the removable disks, the system will selectively have biometric user identification device connected to it. Typical devices are fingerprint identification system, face recognition system, signature recognition system, and iris or retina recognition system. Depending on the desired level of security, the use of a \u201csmart card\u201d (such as a Common Access Card (CAC) used by the US Department of Defense (DOD), or log on and password identification can also be used to identify a user of the check-in and checkout system.","The computer system  reads the directory of files on the removable data storage device and maintains a log of changes. In an alternative embodiment, the removable media may be protected from being used on a computer system (a PC, a desktop, a lap top, a PDA, or a work station) that is not validated. An RFID reader is provided with each CPU that receives the tagged removable media. Also the tags on the removable media carry a password, which provides access to the contents on the media. In operation, the following steps take place. When a user places the removable media into an authenticated computer system, the user ID and the media tag are read. The system will obtain the password from the tag. The CPU processes the password and allows the user access to the contents on the media. If a user takes the media to an unauthorized or unauthenticated CPU with no ID tag reader, the password required to gain access to the contents on the media is not available. The processing device fails to read the contents of that media. The contents of a tag, a flag to indicate the classification information (Top Secret, Secret, Confidential, FOUO, and Unclassified), may also be added. An authorized ID tag reader reads the classification flag and compared with the access level of the reader. The computer system then allows a specific user to read the contents on the media only if the access level is sufficiently higher for that user to gain access to such information as is available on that media.","The proposed system provides the advantages of tracking computer media, file changes and media users. In the case of high security military and financial systems, the knowledge of file changes and who changed what and when is extremely critical. The use of RFID tags to label media speeds up inventory and accountability. The inventory operation is fast and efficient because the reader scans the external tag as the media is removed or replaced from its slot, greatly reducing the time it takes to locate a media device. RFID technology provides identification of media (or removable data storage devices) and maintains a catalog of what media are in use and which are safely in storage. The software programmed processing device keeps track of borrowers and what they do with the information (files and databases). The benefit of such a system capability is the accountability and tracking of all highly classified media devices. This later function provides a database of people and automated mechanical handlers (robots and software agents) who are borrowing, accessing or using them in various ways. The system identifies each media\/device and keeps a catalog of what media are currently connected to it. When a user borrows a removable disk drive, for example, the system keeps a log of the tag identification number of the disk borrowed and the date and time of checkout. When the data storage device is returned, the system keeps a log of when the data storage device is returned and by whom. The storage system can be applied to safekeeping smart cards, PDAs, and cell phones. The system keeps a log of media check-ins and checkouts.","After reading the foregoing specification, one of ordinary skill will be able to effect various changes, substitutions of equivalents and various other aspects of the present invention as broadly disclosed herein. It is therefore intended that the protection granted hereon be limited only by the definition contained in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.","Having thus shown and described what is at present considered to be the preferred embodiment of the present invention, it should be noted that the same has been made by way of illustration and not limitation.
