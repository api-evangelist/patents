{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The following description was made in the performance of official duties by employees of the Department of the Navy, and, thus the claimed invention may be manufactured, used, licensed by or for the United States Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon.","The following description relates generally to an advanced bilge keel design for improved ship roll damping performance. More particularly, an advanced bilge keel design having curved upper and bottom surfaces and improved free end design for providing passive roll stabilization and improved energy dissipation.","Since the mid-1800s, ships have used bilge keels to mitigate roll motions due to waves. The use of bilge keels to minimize ship roll motion was first suggested by Froude. Historically, bilge keels have featured flat plate designs, and later also included discontinuous fin or wedge type designs along the ship's length.  shows a conventional flat bilge keel . Conventional bilge keels are used to mitigate and dampen small to moderate roll motions. As ships have increasingly expanded operations into more severe environments, conventional bilge keels have been less effective.","Older conventional bilge keels were typically constructed from a metal plate and filled with wood, and then riveted to the hull at the desired location. Modern bilge keels are constructed entirely from metal plates, and filled with foam-based materials. Due to considerations related to docking at piers and to operations in shallow waters, bilge keels are typically constrained to not protrude beyond the beam or the keel of the ship. For these reasons, the size of bilge keels is limited, and has not been increased substantially, which would provide more effectiveness. Thus, it is desired to have bilge keels that provide increased stability without increasing the width. The prior art does not teach bilge keels with curved surfaces and shaped edges for providing stability and energy dissipation optimization.","In one aspect, the invention is a ship with passive roll stabilization. In this aspect, the invention includes a hull having a forward end, an aft end, a port side, and a starboard side. The invention further includes a waterline region along the hull having a waterline that coincides with the level at which the hull floats in open water. In this aspect, the invention further includes first and second advanced bilge keels mounted along the hull within or below the waterline region. The first advanced bilge keel is positioned along a streamline on the port side of the hull extending from the forward end to the aft end, and the second advanced bilge keel is positioned along a streamline on the starboard side of the hull extending from the forward end to the aft end. Each of the first and the second advanced bilge keels include an attachment end attached to the hull, a free end, a curved upper surface extending from the attachment end to the free end, and a curved bottom surface below the curved upper surface, extending from the attachment end to the free end.","In another aspect, the invention is an advanced bilge keel mountable to a ship hull within or below a waterline region. The advanced bilge keel includes an attachment end attachable to the hull, a free end, a curved upper surface extending from the attachment end to the free end, and a curved bottom surface below the curved upper surface, extending from the attachment end to the free end.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A and 2B","b":["101","101","101","101"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A and 2B","FIG. 2A","FIG. 1"],"b":["101","111","112","113","114","150","101","150","113","101","150","114","150","150","150","101","130","150","130","150","150","10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3B","FIG. 3A","FIGS. 3A and 3B"],"b":["150","101","150","114","130","150","150","113","101","150","150","310","150","101","150","320","330","310","320","340","330","310","320"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A and 3B","FIGS. 3A and 3B"],"b":["330","335","340","345","335","345","325","330","340","325","150"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 4A","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4B","FIG. 4A","FIGS. 4A and 4B"],"b":["150","101","150","114","130","150","150","113","101","150","150","410","150","101","150","420","430","410","420","440","430","410","420"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIGS. 4A and 4B","b":["430","435","440","445","435","445","425","420","425","427","410","428","430","425","429"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 4B","FIG. 4B","FIGS. 4A and 4B"],"b":["150","425","425","150"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 5A","FIG. 5A","FIG. 5B","FIG. 5A","FIGS. 5A and 5B"],"b":["150","101","150","114","130","150","150","113","101","150","150","510","150","101","150","520","530","510","520","540","530","510","520"]},"As with the above-described embodiments,  also show the upper surface  of the advanced bilge keel being curved downwards forming a central trough region .
