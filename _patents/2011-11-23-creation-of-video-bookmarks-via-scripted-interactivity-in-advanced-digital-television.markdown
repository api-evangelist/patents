{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/479,116 filed Apr. 26, 2011, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.","Embodiments of the present invention relate to the field of communications, and in particular a triggered declarative object (TDO) that enables user interaction with multimedia content to create a video bookmark.","For many decades, traditional media distribution systems lacked an ability to effectively characterize and respond to consumer preferences in order to provide customized media content. In other words, traditional television broadcasting did not personalize the viewing experience because it did not address the undeniable fact that different viewers have different interests. With the advent of Internet-enabled television platforms, however, a wide variety of services and features directed to the individual viewer are now possible.","One current implementation of Internet-enabled television captures events such as record, play, re-play and pause. This operation is typically operated in the background. By correlating the precise timing of the event with the channel line-up and channel number, a determination can be made as to what exactly was being viewed when the event occurred.","Likewise, some players (e.g., Pandora\u00ae Internet radio players) are implemented with a function that allows the \u201cbookmarking\u201d of songs. If a song is played that is enjoyable for the listener, he or she can push a button on the player, which causes the title and\/or artist of that song to be reported to a website. Later, when the user visits the website, he or she may review the list of video bookmarked songs and possibly decide to purchase one or more of the bookmarked songs from an online store.","Advanced television systems are being designed and service launched which include interactive elements. Along with audio and video, a television service provider can provide content which is programmed by that provider to offer the user an interactive experience with the content. This interactive content typically consists of a combination of scripted and declarative (e.g. textual and graphical) content.","Currently, there is no mechanism that allows scripted interactivity with the user to create video bookmarks for later retrieval of information on subject matter perceived by the user during playing of multimedia content.","One embodiment of the invention relates to an electronic device that supports a triggered declarative object (TDO), where the TDO is adapted to enhance user interaction with multimedia content through the creation of a video bookmark.","Herein, a \u201cvideo bookmark\u201d is a recordation of information and\/or metadata pertinent to the content being viewed around the time when a user-initiated bookmark event occurs. The type of information and metadata stored as a video bookmark may include the time of the bookmark event, the channel name, the channel number, the identity of the program or advertisement being displayed, caption text, a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), an object, a pointer, or another information type.","A \u201cTDO\u201d is a downloadable object, normally created by a service or content provider in the content distribution chain. According to one embodiment of the invention, a TDO comprises declarative data (e.g., scripts, text, graphics, etc.) whose function and behavior are tied in some way to the playing of multimedia content. Herein, a TDO may be adapted with multiple functions in which one of these functions is interactive so as to (for example) provide the user with options to obtain more details about the corresponding multimedia content.","In general, one embodiment of the invention combines the TDO concept with bookmarking to allow a creator of a TDO to offer the user a way to create a video bookmark. For instance, a user may arrive at a point in a program or advertisement being displayed by an electronic platform, such as a digital television for example, where he or she would like to preserve some pertinent information about the subject matter so that a deeper exploration of the subject matter can be made at a later time. Allowing the user to create and save a \u201cvideo bookmark\u201d affords this functionality.","According to one embodiment of the invention, at the time a bookmark event occurs, a receiver within the digital television would need to store information sufficient to allow in-depth exploration of the subject matter of the content being displayed to occur later, when the user desires to explore the video bookmarked items. Such stored information could be as minimal as an Internet Uniform Resource Locator (URL) that points to a website where more information concerning the subject matter may be found. Another type of stored information may include one or more pointers to a set of files that are directed to the subject matter and provided by non-real time (NRT) broadcast delivery. These files may be audio\/video, or text\/graphics\/markup (formatted as web pages).","In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, the TDO is downloaded and played in conjunction with real-time or NRT audio\/video programming. An Application Programming Interface (API), which is available to the TDO author and supported in an electronic platform that plays the TDO, offers the ability to create a video bookmark under control of the TDO's scripting language. The TDO can pass, across the API, metadata such as a URL, time\/date, channel number, graphics, text, or the like to enhance the user experience when the video bookmark is accessed later.","One purpose of this embodiment of the invention is to increase a user's enjoyment and benefit of the interactive television experience. Broadcasters are happy to support their advertisers, and users can enjoy the benefits of access to products and services offered by advertisers without disruption of their viewing experience.","One embodiment of the invention involves defining an API for use by TDOs which would allow the author of the TDO to offer the user a way to interact with programming such that a video bookmark is created. This API, referred to as the \u201cBookmark API,\u201d would include information (or pointers to information) associated with the bookmark event. In a simple example, the information may consist of a simple URL. In a more complex example, the information could include pointers to a number of files deliverable either by NRT means or via the Internet. The files could contain multimedia content such as audio\/video content, text\/graphics\/declarative markup, or other data.","Receiver support of the API involves saving the data and\/or pointers associated with the bookmark event in memory in a \u201cbookmark queue.\u201d The receiver offers a user interface function to review the saved video bookmarks. When the user accesses the \u201cBrowse Video Bookmarks\u201d function, the receiver constructs a list of available video bookmarks and allows the user to choose one he or she would like to explore. In response to the selection of a video bookmark, the receiver uses the information as appropriate. Two examples: if the video bookmark data is a URL, the receiver receives pages or objects from the indicated location on the Internet and displays them. If the video bookmark data is an audio\/video file, the receiver plays the file.","Preferred practice is to extend the same scripting language the Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) 2.0 TDO is based on to add the necessary API functionality. API function calls to be defined for the video bookmarks may include, but are not limited or restricted to the following: (1) CREATE_BOOKMARK\u2014data passed with this function can include a video bookmark identifier (ID) and one or more URLs or pointers to objects; (2) DELETE_BOOKMARK\u2014this function can be used by the TDO to delete a video bookmark, if one had been previously created; (3) IS_BOOKMARK_PRESENT\u2014this function allows the script to query the receiver to see whether or not a given video bookmark had already been stored; and (4) UPDATE_BOOKMARK\u2014this function can be used by the TDO to update the contents of the bookmark. Another API function may include APPEND_BOOKMARK, which is used to combine functionality for different video bookmarks.","Herein, certain terminology is used to describe features for embodiments of the invention. For example, an \u201celectronic platform\u201d generally includes logic that operates to process information. Different embodiments of an electronic platform may include, but are not limited or restricted to a set-top box, a computer (e.g., tablet, laptop, desktop, server, netbook, etc.), a wireless communication device (e.g., a smartphone, personal digital assistant \u201cPDA\u201d, pager, etc.), a set-top box, or a display device (e.g., television) that comprises a receiver for example.","It is contemplated that the electronic platform may include a number of components, including one or more of the following: (i) a display (e.g., liquid crystal diode (\u201cLCD\u201d), organic LCD (OLCD), plasma, etc.) or a video output supplying a video signal to a separate display device; (ii) speakers to support audio playback or an audio output supplying an audio signal to a separate audio amplifier or speakers; or (iii) a non-transitory computer-readable storage media (e.g., a programmable circuit; a semiconductor memory such as a volatile memory such as random access memory \u201cRAM,\u201d or non-volatile memory such as read-only memory, power-backed RAM, flash memory, phase-change memory or the like; a hard disk drive; an optical disc drive; or any connector for receiving a portable memory device such as a Universal Serial Bus \u201cUSB\u201d flash drive).","Additionally, the term \u201clogic\u201d is generally defined as hardware and\/or software. As hardware, logic may include processing circuitry (e.g., a controller, a microprocessor, a programmable gate array, an application specific integrated circuit, etc.), semiconductor memory, combinatorial logic, or the like. As software, the logic may be one or more software modules, such as executable code in the form of an executable application, an application programming interface (API), a subroutine, a function, a procedure, an object method\/implementation, an applet, a servlet, a routine, a source code, an object code, a shared library\/dynamic load library, or one or more instructions. These software modules may be stored in any type of a suitable non-transitory storage medium (described above) or transitory computer-readable transmission media (e.g., electrical, optical, acoustical or other form of propagated signals such as carrier waves, infrared signals, digital signals).","Additionally, the term \u201cinterconnect\u201d is broadly defined as a logical or physical communication path such as, for instance, electrical wire, optical fiber, cable, bus trace, or a wireless channel using infrared, radio frequency (RF), or any other wireless signaling mechanism. Also, the term \u201cmessage\u201d constitutes any grouping of data in the form of a packet, an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) cell, a frame, or a series of bits.","Certain details are set forth below in order to provide a thorough understanding of various embodiments of the invention, albeit the invention may be practiced through many embodiments other that those illustrated. Well-known logic and operations are not set forth in detail in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring this description. Moreover, the illustrated embodiments of the invention, and the description associated therewith, should be considered as examples of the principles of the invention and not intended to limit the invention to those specific embodiments. In the description below, like reference numerals are used to describe the same, similar or corresponding parts in the several views of the drawings.","Lastly, the term \u201cor\u201d as used herein is to be interpreted as an inclusive or meaning any one or any combination. Therefore, \u201cA, B or C\u201d means \u201cany of the following: A; B; C; A and B; A and C; B and C; A, B and C\u201d. An exception to this definition will occur only when a combination of elements, functions, steps or acts are in some way inherently mutually exclusive.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","130","120"]},"According to one embodiment of the invention, one type of content resource  may feature a device that is adapted to store and provide NRT content upon request. In general, \u201cNRT content\u201d comprises data (e.g., video, audio, text, images, etc.) that is delivered faster or slower than delivery in real-time. In many cases, the NRT content is prompted for delivery in response to a request by the user or user access of a listing of NRT content stored at one of the content resources . Alternatively, such delivery may be automated.","With respect to , an exemplary embodiment of electronic device  that is adapted to execute TDOs that provide video bookmark capability is shown. Herein, according to this embodiment of the invention, electronic device  comprises a receiver , which is coupled to a display unit  and optional speakers .","Herein, receiver  includes a tuner\/demodulator , a demultiplexer , an audio\/video decoder , processing logic , and a storage device . Herein, tuner  receives a modulated input signal, tunes and demodulates the signal to produce an output transport stream. Demultiplexer  demultiplexes the output transport stream to produce data that is received by processing logic . In the case of real-time (linear) content, audio and video messages from tuner\/demodulator  are supplied, via demultiplexer , to A\/V decoder  for decoding. A\/V decoder  supplies an audio output signal and a video output signal to audio and video circuitry (not shown) associated with electronic platform .","Content including audio\/video, NRT files, metadata, and TDOs received at demultiplexer  is routed via processing logic  to storage device . Storage device  may include any type of non-transitory computer-readable storage media with non-volatile characteristics such as a disc drive or semiconductor memory.","When a user instructs electronic platform  to play a selected item of NRT content, according to one embodiment of the invention, that content may be retrieved from storage device  and processed by processing logic . Of course, although not shown, processing logic  may obtain addressing information to retrieve the content from a remotely located storage device.","Thereafter, after processing the content (e.g. decompression, decryption, descrambling or reformatting), processing logic  provides the processed content to demultiplexer , which produces audio and video data to A\/V decoder . Audio and video from these messages are eventually sent to speakers  and display unit , respectively.","Besides the data processing described above, processing logic  is adapted to execute one or more TDOs (N\u22671) that are stored in storage device . At least one of these TDO(s)  (e.g., TDO ), when executed by processing logic , is adapted to control bookmarking operations for electronic platform  as multimedia content is being displayed on display unit .","It is contemplated that, in lieu of being implemented with decoder  and certain circuitry, receiver  may include processing logic  with automatic content recognition (ACR) functionality that generates a \u201cfingerprint\u201d\u2014a sample of uncompressed video and\/or audio. This sample is used for retrieval, from a local or external storage source, of a larger segment of video and\/or audio for subsequent display and\/or audio rendering.","In an exemplary implementation, a viewer performs a specific action that initiates a \u201cbookmark event\u201d (e.g., depressing a button on electronic platform  or on a remote control unit that activates a bookmarking function in electronic platform , saying \u201cvideo bookmark\u201d if electronic platform  has voice recognition functionality, etc.). In response to the specific action, viewing of the multimedia content is not interrupted. Rather, electronic platform  stores all relevant information and metadata that is pertinent to the multimedia content being viewed and is temporally proximate to the time at which the bookmark event occurred.","For instance, electronic platform  may store the last several seconds of multimedia content on disk in a file associated with the video bookmark. This multimedia content may include video and its corresponding audio. However, in lieu of or in addition to storage of audio\/video, other types of content may be saved, such as any or all of the following: captured still images, caption text, \u201cscreen scraped\u201d information in which optical character recognition techniques are used to extract text from the video sampled at the time of the bookmark event, or downloadable objects.","As an illustrative example, the relevant information and metadata pertinent to the multimedia content may include (1) the time that the bookmark event occurred and (2) the channel name and\/or channel number over which the multimedia content is being received. Likewise, for retrieval of such multimedia content being played back from disk, the relevant information may include (1) a content identifier and (2) the time that the bookmark event occurred.","Referring now to , an exemplary implementation of a video bookmark system  illustrates how bookmark events are processed. According to a timeline , a video segment of a program, labeled \u201cSegment \u201d , is being displayed at the electronic platform. During the viewing of the program, at an example time marker of 12:02:07, a user performs a bookmark event  (e.g., depressing a specific button such as a \u201cTAG\u201d button, on a remote control), which prompts TDO  to create a video bookmark.","In creating a video bookmark, TDO  initiates a specific function call  to an API of Bookmark Manager  which, according to this embodiment of the invention, includes pertinent information and metadata that can be used for later retrieval of more detailed information directed to the subject matter being viewed. For instance, this API function call  may include at least one URL or pointer to data associated with objects being displayed during the bookmark event. As an optional parameter, API function call  may include a unique identifier for the video bookmark. The video bookmark identifier may be used by Bookmark Manager  to determine if (i) incoming content associated with a requested video bookmark is duplicative of any stored information or (ii) if a desired video bookmark had already been stored (e.g., using the IS_BOOKMARK_PRESENT API function call to allow the scripted TDO to determine whether or not a given video bookmark had already been stored). The video bookmark identifier and\/or URL(s) (or pointers) are stored in a bookmark queue  within storage device .","Of course, TDO  may be scripted to store a variety of other information in response to creation of a video bookmark, including a screen shot of the display at time of the bookmark event, a video and\/or audio clip (or a pointer to the clip) directed to subject matter being displayed in the multimedia content at the time of the bookmark event. Other bookmark events ,  and  occur at time marker 12:17:22 during advertisement AD , during time marker 12:39:14 during advertisement AD , and again at time marker :: during video segment (Segment ) .","In the exemplary implementation, Bookmark API  may interact with a bookmark server  via a public network  (e.g., Internet) accessible by the electronic platform, by providing information about the bookmark event to server . This information enables server  to identify the program or advertisement within which the bookmark event occurred and to respond with information that is used by logic within the electronic platform to create an interactive experience involving subject matter displayed at the time of the bookmark event.","For instance, depending on the type of bookmark event, Bookmark API  may control the storage of pertinent information for creation of a video bookmark, the deletion of information associated with an existing video bookmark, or the updating of information associated with an existing video bookmark. If the bookmark event is recorded during a television program, this information might include, but is not limited or restricted to the following:\n\n","If the bookmark is recorded during an advertising segment, the information might include, in addition to the above, metadata representing the product or service being advertised. Such metadata might include, but is not limited to, a URL the user could use to access more information about the product or service, a telephone number or contact information, a map of the location of the advertised item, etc.","Referring now to , exemplary embodiments of different types of API function calls between TDO  and Bookmark API  are shown. Herein, as shown in , in response to detection of a bookmark event, TDO  transmits a CREATE_BOOKMARK API function call  that includes information used to obtain supplemental information about the subject matter of the multimedia content being viewed. Herein, CREATE_BOOKMARK API function call  includes a video bookmark identifier (bookmark ID)  for subsequent use in identifying the video bookmark apart from other video bookmarks and addressing information  (e.g., a URL or pointer(s)) for retrieval of the supplemental information if the video bookmark is accessed later.","When content from the bookmark event is requested (e.g., user access of a Bookmark MENU, etc.), addressing information  may be retrieved to access content from one or more remotely located storage devices.","Referring now to , in response to detecting a bookmark event by the user that requests deletion of a particular video bookmark, TDO  transmits a DELETE_BOOKMARK API function call  that includes at least the video bookmark identifier  used to identify the existing video bookmark stored within bookmark queue . After deletion of the identified video bookmark, signaling  is provided to the Bookmark API  to acknowledge completion of this event. If the video bookmark could not be located, an error code is returned.","Referring to , in response to detection of a bookmark event for updating an existing video bookmark, TDO  transmits an UPDATE_BOOKMARK API function call  that includes a plurality of parameters that can be used to locate information associated with the existing video bookmark and alter such information. Herein, UPDATE_BOOKMARK API function call  includes a video bookmark identifier  used to identify the existing video bookmark along with information  that is to be substituted for or added to the current stored information for the video bookmark. After modification of the video bookmark, signaling  is provided to the Bookmark API  to acknowledge completion of the requested update. If the video bookmark could not be modified, an error code is returned.","Referring to , in response to detection of a bookmark event, TDO  may initially transmit an IS_BOOKMARK_PRESENT API function call  to Bookmark API  prior to CREATE_BOOKMARK API function call . Upon receipt of IS_BOOKMARK_PRESENT API function call , Bookmark API  communicates with bookmark queue  and TDO  to determine whether or not a specific video bookmark already has been created. This may constitute a review within bookmark queue for parameters  including name and\/or timing for programming being viewed to determine if information with such programming has been video bookmarked. Thereafter, signaling  is provided to the Bookmark API  to acknowledge the presence or lack of presence of the requested video bookmark.","Referring back to , it is contemplated that material returned from a bookmark queue  to TDO  via Bookmark API  may be a URL to a website where further information on that product or service may be found. TDO  now interacts with Bookmark API  for retrieval of one or more web pages associated with the website. Alternatively, TDO  may receive a URL that, if selected, renders information to complete a purchase of the product being offered during the bookmark event. In lieu of return of a web page associated with the URL, server  could return declarative content (e.g. text and graphics, scripts, etc.), an audio\/visual clip, interactive multimedia content or even an application.","Referring to , an exemplary implementation for user actions that may occur after storing one or more video bookmarks is shown. One of these user actions may involve reviewing of the content associated with the video bookmarks that have been previously stored. In this exemplary embodiment, video bookmarks that have been stored under the control of TDO  may be reviewed by the user. One or more of these video bookmarks may be chosen to retrieve its corresponding multimedia content. For instance, TDO may interact with stored devices to retrieve content in response to a first bookmark event , while at a later time, content associated with a third bookmark event  may be retrieved.","According to one embodiment of the invention, metadata available to the receiver at the time of the bookmark event would be stored locally, and this metadata may be used to create the user interface associated with the \u201cvideo bookmark review\u201d activity. This user interface provides the user with the ability to view the metadata or a subset thereof and take actions by making menu selections to accomplish functions such as: reviewing stored video bookmarks; displaying information from one or more URLs; downloading executable objects; reviewing video bookmarked audio or video content; reviewing stored and audio and video clips associated with the subject of the video bookmarked content; interacting with downloaded executable objects; viewing or sending email messages; or interactive purchase activities.","Referring now to , upon selection of a video bookmark that has been previously created and\/or updated by a TDO , information associated with the video bookmark is retrieved from a bookmark queue  by Bookmark Manager . According to one embodiment of the invention, Bookmark Manager  is adapted to provide an Application Programming Interface (API) for use in initiating function calls to Bookmark Manager . Bookmark Manager  processes these function calls to manage retrieval of related information via public network  such as accessing server  operating as a web server over the Internet.","Upon receiving information associated with the video bookmark and, where such information is a URL or at least one pointer to a set of files, Bookmark Manager  generates one or more requests to obtain content via public network  using the URL or pointer(s). In this exemplary implementation, the URL may be directed to content for products or services displayed during detection of a bookmark event that causes creation (or alteration) of the video bookmark, such as an extended-length video clip for example. Server  may process any URLs received with the video bookmark and associate the retrieved content for the video bookmark.","Thereafter, server  may transmit all processed video bookmark information through the public network  to a user interface (UI) generator  for inclusion in a user-oriented presentation of the processed data. Additionally, text that is scraped from a video presentation, such as in a non-limiting example, information that represents a video barcode, may be transmitted to UI generator  to be formatted and prepared for inclusion in the user oriented presentation of the processed data received from web server . The content received from web server  is used to generate a user experience  whenever the user wishes to interact with a particular video bookmark. This user experience  may have a number of forms:\n\n","Referring now to , a flowchart of the operations of a TDO for managing video bookmarks is shown. Herein, a TDO determines whether a bookmark event has occurred (block ). If so, the TDO initially determines if the bookmark event is directed to the creation of a video bookmark or the alteration of the video bookmark. This may be accomplished through the use of an IS_BOOKMARK_PRESENT API function call.","More specifically, the TDO creates and forwards an IS_BOOKMARK_PRESENT API function call to the Bookmark API (block ). This causes the Bookmark API to query the bookmark queue for a video bookmark associated with the particular bookmark event (block ). If the video bookmark is detected, the bookmark queue returns a Bookmark ID and pertinent information directed to the bookmark event. Otherwise, the bookmark queue returns information that is forwarded to the TDO to indicate that a video bookmark for the bookmark event has not been created.","Next, TDO creates and forwards a CREATE_BOOKMARK API function call to the Bookmark API to create a video bookmark associated with the bookmark event (block ). The video bookmark is identified by an identifier and may store information such as a URL, pointer or the like. The Bookmark ID is returned to the Bookmark API (blocks  and ).","If the bookmark event is directed to alteration of a video bookmark, the TDO determines whether the video bookmark is to be updated or deleted (blocks  and ). If the video bookmark is to be updated, the TDO creates and forwards an UPDATE_BOOKMARK API function call to the Bookmark API. This causes the Bookmark API to query the bookmark queue to locate an entry with the Bookmark ID within the UPDATE_BOOKMARK API function call and to alter information within the entry (blocks  & ). Such information may include, but is not limited or restricted to URLs or pointers to stored data, or the like.","If the video bookmark is to be deleted, the TDO creates and forwards a DELETE_BOOKMARK API function call to the Bookmark API (block ). This causes the Bookmark API to query the bookmark queue for the video bookmark identified by the Bookmark ID within the DELETE_BOOKMARK API function call and to delete the video bookmark from the bookmark queue (blocks  & ).","Turning now to , an exemplary embodiment of the operations initiated based on receipt by the TDO of a bookmark event to retrieve content is shown. Herein, a bookmark event to retrieve content is detected by the TDO (block ). In response, the TDO sends signaling to the Bookmark API to acquire addressing information for the content from the bookmark queue residing within local memory (block ). From such addressing information, the bookmark API generates one or more requests for content from external sources such as a remotely located server (e.g., web server) for example (block ). The content is provided to a user interface (UI) to provide a user experience to the user (block ).","It is to be understood that the above description is intended to be illustrative, and not restrictive. Many other embodiments will be apparent to those of skill in the art upon reading and understanding the above description. The scope of the invention should, therefore, be determined with reference to the appended claims, along with the full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Embodiments of the present invention are illustrated by way of example, and not by way of limitation, in the figures of the accompanying drawings and in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIGS. 4A-4D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 8"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
