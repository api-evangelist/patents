title: Dynamic mechanism for providing metadata
abstract: Dynamic metadata allows for metadata that can be configured for an application programming interface (API) after the API has shipped. Multiple entities can provide metadata for the same API or portions of an API. The metadata provided for an API can be set up for each application domain, allowing customization within a single process. Metadata can be provided in several ways, including traditional compiled code and declarative markup as well as databases and other more dynamic approaches. Metadata is separated from its runtime components, so that the metadata that is used by the runtime components can be changed. For example, metadata may be declared on the objects separately. The metadata is then tied back to the runtime components.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["One of the features common to modern object oriented frameworks is the concept of metadata. Metadata provides additional information about a file, class, or member of another component of a class hierarchy, for example. The Microsoft Common Language Runtime (CLR) is the heart of the MICROSOFT .NET framework, and provides the execution environment for .NET code. The CLR uses metadata for diverse needs that range from tool support to marshaling characteristics. The CLR supports the addition of these attributes at compile time through the use of a special syntax. For example, to indicate that a member variable should be stored in thread local storage, one may place an attribute on the variable:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0003","num":"0002"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"161pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"[ThreadStatic]"]},{"entry":[{},"private string perThreadString;"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"In this example, tying the attribute into the source code is proper, because the source code breaks if the attribute is not present. Sometimes this is not desirable, however. Consider:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0004"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"[Editor(typeof(ColorEditor))]"]},{"entry":[{},"public class Color { }"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}},"br":{}},"CLR metadata contains more than attributes as described above. Late binding mechanisms such as reflection discover types, methods, and other members through metadata. Code running in the CLR uses metadata to link members and classes of different modules. Therefore, metadata defines the contract of the application programming interface (API) of a class library.","Sometimes it may be useful to modify this contract. For example, the .NET compact framework is a strict subset of the .NET framework that is available on the desktop. The compact framework cannot be instantiated on a desktop personal computer, however. Because it is a strict subset of the desktop framework, whenever an instance of a compact framework object needs to be instantiated, applications will instead create an instance of the corresponding desktop object. This poses a problem when late bound technologies such as reflection are used to inspect the created object. Consider a class called Font that represents a system font. Reflecting on the desktop object will expose properties and lists of available fonts that are not available on the compact framework's Font class. This problem is not limited to the compact framework.","Additionally, versioning an API is another way this problem is introduced. Consider an application that allows the production of HTML files. The file may be written to correspond to HTML 4.0 or 3.2. Applications traditionally hardwire the API schema for each version. This technique breaks down when the schema is not known ahead of time, as it is for scenarios where third party extensibility is involved.","Dynamic metadata allows for metadata that can be configured for an API after the API has shipped. Multiple entities can provide metadata for the same API or portions of an API. The metadata provided for an API can be set up for each application domain, allowing customization within a single process. Metadata can be provided in several ways, including traditional compiled code and declarative markup as well as databases and other more dynamic approaches.","Metadata is separated from its runtime components, so that the metadata that is used by the runtime components can be changed.

By way of example only,  illustrates a hard disk drive  that reads from or writes to non-removable, nonvolatile magnetic media, a magnetic disk drive  that reads from or writes to a removable, nonvolatile magnetic disk , and an optical disk drive  that reads from or writes to a removable, nonvolatile optical disk , such as a CD ROM or other optical media. Other removable\/non-removable, volatile\/nonvolatile computer storage media that can be used in the example operating environment include, but are not limited to, magnetic tape cassettes, flash memory cards, digital versatile disks, digital video tape, solid state RAM, solid state ROM, and the like. The hard disk drive  is typically connected to the system bus  through a non-removable memory interface such as interface , and magnetic disk drive  and optical disk drive  are typically connected to the system bus  by a removable memory interface, such as interface .","The drives and their associated computer storage media discussed above and illustrated in  provide storage of computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules and other data for the computer . In , for example, hard disk drive  is illustrated as storing operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data . Note that these components can either be the same as or different from operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data . Operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data  are given different numbers here to illustrate that, at a minimum, they are different copies. A user may enter commands and information into the computer  through input devices such as a keyboard  and pointing device , commonly referred to as a mouse, trackball or touch pad. Other input devices (not shown) may include a microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner, or the like. These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit  through a user input interface  that is coupled to the system bus , but may be connected by other interface and bus structures, such as a parallel port, game port or a universal serial bus (USB).","A monitor  or other type of display device is also connected to the system bus  via an interface, such as a video interface . In addition to monitor , computers may also include other peripheral output devices such as speakers  and printer , which may be connected through an output peripheral interface .","The computer  may operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computer . The remote computer  may be a personal computer, a server, a router, a network PC, a peer device or other common network node, and typically includes many or all of the elements described above relative to the computer , although only a memory storage device  has been illustrated in . The logical connections depicted in  include a local area network (LAN)  and a wide area network (WAN) , but may also include other networks. Such networking environments are commonplace in offices, enterprise-wide computer networks, intranets and the Internet.","When used in a LAN networking environment, the computer  is connected to the LAN  through a network interface or adapter . When used in a WAN networking environment, the computer  typically includes a modem  or other means for establishing communications over the WAN , such as the Internet. The modem , which may be internal or external, may be connected to the system bus  via the user input interface , or other appropriate mechanism. In a networked environment, program modules depicted relative to the computer , or portions thereof, may be stored in the remote memory storage device. By way of example, and not limitation,  illustrates remote application programs  as residing on memory device . It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers may be used.","One of ordinary skill in the art can appreciate that a computer  or other client devices can be deployed as part of a computer network. In this regard, any computer system having any number of memory or storage units, and any number of applications and processes occurring across any number of storage units or volumes may be used. An embodiment may apply to an environment with server computers and client computers deployed in a network environment, having remote or local storage. An embodiment may also apply to a standalone computing device, having programming language functionality, interpretation and execution capabilities.","The various systems, methods, and techniques described herein may be implemented with hardware or software or, where appropriate, with a combination of both. Thus, the methods and apparatus, or certain aspects or portions thereof, may take the form of program code (i.e., instructions) embodied in tangible media, such as floppy diskettes, CD-ROMs, hard drives, or any other machine-readable storage medium, wherein, when the program code is loaded into and executed by a machine, such as a computer, the machine becomes an apparatus. In the case of program code execution on programmable computers, the computer will generally include a processor, a storage medium readable by the processor (including volatile and non-volatile memory and\/or storage elements), at least one input device, and at least one output device. One or more programs are preferably implemented in a high level procedural or object oriented programming language to communicate with a computer system. However, the program(s) can be implemented in assembly or machine language, if desired. In any case, the language may be a compiled or interpreted language, and combined with hardware implementations.","The methods and apparatus may also be embodied in the form of program code that is transmitted over some transmission medium, such as over electrical wiring or cabling, through fiber optics, or via any other form of transmission, wherein, when the program code is received and loaded into and executed by a machine, such as an EPROM, a gate array, a programmable logic device (PLD), a client computer, a video recorder or the like, the machine becomes an apparatus. When implemented on a general-purpose processor, the program code combines with the processor to provide a unique apparatus that operates to perform the functionality.","Although the subject matter has been described in language specific to structural features and\/or methodological acts, it is to be understood that the subject matter defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the specific features or acts described above. Rather, the specific features and acts described above are disclosed as example forms of implementing the claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 8"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
