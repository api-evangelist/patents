title: Cross-language search
abstract: Methods, systems, and apparatus, including computer program products, in which a cross-language search can be performed. A search query is received in a first language. A translated search query of the search query is obtained and evaluated to determine whether it is a candidate for cross-language searching. Upon identifying a candidate, a search can be performed using the translated search query to generate search results relevant to the translated search query.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This Application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/235,558, filed on Sep. 22, 2008, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/974,332, filed on Sep. 21, 2007.","This disclosure is related to cross-language searching.","The number of web pages written in certain languages (e.g., English) may be much larger than the number of web pages written in other languages. This disparity is due in large part to the number of speakers of the certain languages and the widespread availability of technology in the countries where those languages are spoken. Moreover, such pages are often better maintained and capable of providing more accurate and updated information about many subjects than are pages in other languages. Accordingly, people who speak a language that is not widely used on the web might nevertheless be interested in the information found on a web page available in other languages (e.g., English). Thus, searching the web pages written in the language used to submit a search query may not always satisfy a searcher's query, because relevant results might not even exist in the searcher's language.","For example, people in Egypt are sometimes interested in information about traveling to places that are outside of the Middle East, studying in foreign universities, or learning about famous non-Egyptian people. However, there might not be many pages related to these topics in the language used to submit the query, i.e., the user's native language. Moreover, the pages that are in the user's native language may be of relatively low quality, since the authors of the page may not have ample access to such topics. Additionally, such users may not be able to issue queries in another language because the users do not speak another language. Thus, these users may be unable to find relevant and\/or quality content.","In general, one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in a system that includes an input module, an evaluation module and an output module. The input module can receive an original search query in a first language, the original search query being a request for documents relevant to the original search. The evaluation module can receive a first set of relevance scores associated with results from the original search query and a second set of relevance scores associated with results from a translated search query in a second language. The evaluation module can compare the first and second sets of relevance scores to determine whether the original search query or the translated search query produces the most relevant results. The output module can provide search results including at least a portion of one or both of the results from the original search query or the results from the translated search query to a user based on the whether the original search query or the translated query has the most relevant results. Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding methods, apparatus, and computer program products.","An example method for performing cross-language searching can include: receiving an original search query in a first language; obtaining a translated search query associated with the original search query, the translated search query being in a second language; evaluating the translated search query to determine whether the translated search query is a candidate for a cross-language search based on: a relevancy score associated with the results of the translated search query, a translation confidence score associated with the translation, or a search query including an entity associated with the first or second languages; and serving a search results page based on the result of the evaluation.","The details of one or more embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.","Like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings indicate like elements.","In some implementations of this specification, systems and methods are realized that receive a search query from a client device and determine if a web page in a foreign language is a good match to the query. For example, if a user in Egypt enters a query in Arabic for a subject such as American football, there might not be many web pages in the query language that provide relevant results for the query. However, there may be relevant pages in other languages. For example, the Arabic query from the previous example can be translated to an English query, and compared to an English index of web pages. If there are more relevant results found among the web pages in the English language in this example, a list of relevant pages can be translated and provided to the user. In some implementations, a relevant web page can be translated and provided to the user based on the user selecting a web page from among the list of relevant pages. In some implementations, the list of relevant results can include both translated results and non-translated results.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["100","100","10"],"i":"a "},"In some implementations, the cross-language search system  can send the search query to a search engine . The search engine  can receive queries and identify search results. For example, the search engine  can retrieve relevant search results from an index of documents (e.g., from an index of web pages). Search results can include, for example, lists of web page titles, snippets of text extracted from those web pages, and hypertext links to those web pages, and may be grouped into a predetermined number of (e.g., ten) search results.","In some implementations, the search engine  can parse the search query (Q) into component tokens (Q, Q, . . . , Q) . In some implementations, the tokens are words (or groups of words where the group of words forms a single idea, such as, e.g., \u201cNew York City\u201d) that form the query. The component token (Q, Q, . . . , Q) can be used to identify web pages in a first language that are relevant to the search query (Q) . In some implementations, the relevant web pages are those in the first language that include more than one of the component tokens (Q, Q, . . . , Q) . Such pages can be found, for example, in an index of web pages that is limited to the first language . In some implementations, the search engine  can derive relevance scores associated with the most relevant pages. In further implementations, the search engine  can derive page rank scores associated with the quality of a web page as measured by the number of other sites linking to a page. The search engine  can also derive a score related to the search results (e.g., an information retrieval (IR) score). In some implementations, IR scores can be computed from, for example, dot products of feature vectors corresponding to a query and a document relevance, page rank scores, and\/or combinations of IR scores and page rank scores, etc.","In some implementations, the cross-language search system  determines whether any of the component tokens (Q, Q, . . . , Q) are local entities  and excludes any search query (Q) that includes a local entity from cross-language search. Entities are those words or word phrases that identify persons, places, or things. Local entities are those entities that are associated with the language in which the query is input, and the person, place or thing is indicative of a place of origin where the language is primarily spoken. There can be physical indications of places of origin in which the language is primarily spoken, logical indication of places of origin, or historical indications of places of origin. For example, the Eiffel Tower is located in France, and thus the query \u201cla Tour Eiffel\u201d is a local entity for the French language. In another example, The Continental Army has both a logical and historical indication of a place of origin in the United States and is thus a local entity for the English language. In further examples, the term \u201cM\u03ba\u00e1\u201d is a local entity for the Russian language because it identifies Moscow, which is a city located in Russia.","Lists of such entities can be derived from encyclopedias, location servers, public filings, etc., or can be provided from third-parties. Lists of local entities typically exclude individual generic terms, even if a generic term is a constituent word in a brand name. However, a multi-word brand name that includes generic terms can be included in the list of local entities (e.g., \u201cAuburn University\u201d).","Lists of local entities also typically exclude foreign entities from inclusion. In one implementations, foreign entities are those entities that are not local entities to the language used to enter the query. In other implementations, foreign entities can be entities and translations of those entities that are local to another language. An entity can be local to one language and foreign to another language. For example, the token \u201cVladimir Putin\u201d defines a local entity to the Russian language, while the same token would define a foreign entity to the English language. Thus, if a Russian user entered \u201cVladimir Putin\u201d (in Russian) as part of a search query , the entity \u201cVladimir Putin\u201d would be found in the local entities to the Russian language and the search can be excluded from performing a cross-language search. In another example, \u201cM\u03ba\u00e1\u201d (e.g., \u201cMoscow\u201d) is a local entity to the Russian language.","In some implementations, search queries that include a token that matches a local entity are not eligible for a cross-language search and the search can be served in the language used to submit the search query. For example, if a search \u201cAl-Qahira\u201d is received (e.g., correlating to an Egyptian entity \u201cCairo\u201d), the search query can be served from an index of web pages in the Arabic language because the token \u201cAl-Qahira\u201d matches a local entity to the Arabic language. Thus, the web pages authored in Arabic can be assumed to be more relevant to the search query than web pages written in another language (e.g., the web pages resulting from the translated search query \u201cCairo\u201d in English). Moreover, the web pages written in another language may be difficult to understand after translation. For example, web pages written in English that are translated to Arabic can be more difficult to read for native Arabic speakers than web pages that are written in Arabic.","In some implementations, the component tokens (Q, Q, . . . , Q) can be compared to the local entities  to determine the extent of any intersection of the set of component tokens (Q, Q, . . . , Q) with the collection of local entities . The extent of an intersection between the component tokens and the collection of local entities  can be used to determine whether to perform a cross-language search.","In other implementations, subsets of the search query (e.g., ngrams) can be compared to the collection of local entities . In such implementations, the cross-language search system  can compare each of the subsets of the search query to the collection of local entities  to determine whether any of the subsets included in the search query match a local entity from the collection of local entities . For example, if the cross-language search system  received the search query \u201cvacation homes finger lakes,\u201d the cross-language search system  could search the collection of local entities  for inclusion of any of the subsets: \u201cvacation,\u201d \u201cvacation homes,\u201d \u201cvacation homes finger,\u201d \u201cvacation homes finger lakes,\u201d \u201chomes,\u201d \u201chomes finger,\u201d \u201chomes finger lakes,\u201d \u201cfinger,\u201d and \u201cfinger lakes.\u201d In some implementations, the cross-language search system  can stop searching an subpart string if the first word of the subpart string contains no matches in the collection of local entities . In additional implementations, the cross-language search system  can discontinue the search after finding a subset that matches an entity from the collection of local entities . For example, if the cross-language search system  received the query \u201cManhattan gourmet restaurants,\u201d the cross-language search system  might immediately find the term \u201cManhattan\u201d as matching a local entity from the collection of local entities . Thus, searching for further matches can be considered unnecessary.","In those instances where a cross-language search is to be performed, the cross-language search system  can send the search query (Q) to a translator . The translator  uses the search query (Q) to derive a translated search query (Q\u2032) in a second language. In some implementations, the translator can be an automated machine translator operable to receive a search query (Q) in a first language and to output a translated query (Q\u2032) in a second language.","The translated search query (Q\u2032) can be divided into component tokens (Q\u2032, Q\u2032, . . . , Q\u2032) by a search engine . In some implementations, the search engine  or the cross-language search system  can compare the component tokens (Q\u2032, Q\u2032, . . . , Q\u2032) to a collection of foreign entities . The collection of foreign entities  can include those entities that are associated with the second language. For example, if the second language is Russian, the foreign entities could include locations (e.g., Red Square, the Kremlin, Moscow, or Siberia), as well as people (e.g., Lenin, Stalin, Gorbachev, or Yeltsin), or Russian brand names, products and companies associated with the Russian language. In those instances where the set of component tokens in the second language (Q\u2032, Q\u2032, . . . , Q\u2032) includes some intersection with foreign entities , the translated query (Q\u2032) can be considered a good candidate to perform a cross-language search. In other implementations, the translated query (Q\u2032) can be separated into subsets and compared to the entities in the collection of foreign entities  to determine whether a term included in the search query matches a foreign entity.","In further implementations, the translator can produce a translation confidence score  associated with the translated search query (Q\u2032) . The translation confidence score  associated with the translated query (Q\u2032) can be used to determine whether the translation is likely to produce relevant results. In such implementations, the translation confidence  can be compared to a translation confidence threshold to determine whether the translated query (Q\u2032) is a candidate for the cross-language search. For example, a search query (Q) can have potentially a hundred or more translations. A greater number of potential translations can produce greater uncertainty with regard to a translated search query (Q\u2032) chosen from the possible translations. Thus, there is some likelihood that the chosen translation is incorrect, and that any results generated using such a search query would be irrelevant to the original search query . Translated search queries (Q\u2032) whose translation confidence scores  do not meet a translation confidence threshold can therefore be considered poor candidates for performing a cross-language search.","In some implementations, the translator  can provide multiple translations to the search engine , based on multiple translations exceeding a translation confidence threshold. In other implementations, the translator  can provide a single translation (e.g., the translated search query (Q\u2032) ) to the cross-language search system , and the cross-language system can determine whether the translation confidence scores associated with that translated search query (Q\u2032) meet a translation confidence threshold. Translated search queries (Q\u2032) that do not meet the translation confidence threshold are excluded from cross-language search.","If the translated search query (Q\u2032) meets the confidence threshold, the translated search query (Q\u2032) can be sent to a search engine  to search for documents (e.g., web pages) relevant to the translated search query (Q\u2032) . The search engine  can use component tokens (Q\u2032, Q\u2032, . . . , Q\u2032) of the translated search query (Q\u2032) to find relevant web pages in the second language . As described previously, the search engine  can provide the cross-language search system  with IR scores associated with the relevant web pages in the second language .","In some implementations, the respective relevance scores associated with the results of the translated search query (Q\u2032) can be compared to a relevancy score threshold to determine whether to serve a translated web page as a result to the search query (Q) . For example, in some instances the results of the translated query (Q\u2032) might have such low relevance scores that they will not be served to the searcher, even if the results of the translated search query (Q\u2032) have a higher relevance scores than the results of the search query (Q) ","In some implementations, the relevance scores for the results of the translated search query (Q\u2032) can be compared to the relevance scores for the results of the search query (Q) . The more relevant results can be served to the user as results . In those instances in which the results of the translated search query (Q\u2032) have a higher relevance score than the relevance score of the results of the search query (Q) , the relevant web pages in the second language can be translated into the first language and served as results . In some implementations, the relevance scores can be biased to favor the results from the search query (Q) based on the likelihood that a translated web page is more difficult to read than a web page originally authored in the first language.","In some implementations, a translated web page result of the translated search query can include a translation confidence score. In such implementations, the translation confidence score or quality associated with the translation of a translated web page can be compared to a translation confidence threshold to determine whether a translated web page should be served as a result  to the search query . For example, in some instances it may be determined that a translation of a relevant web page or an associated portion or snippet in the second language would be practically unreadable to the searcher. In such examples, the cross-language search system  might serve only those results which are more relevant than local results and meet the translation confidence threshold.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 1B","b":["100","100","110","120","130","140","110","110","110"]},"In some implementations, the query evaluation module  can receive the search query from the input module  and can evaluate the search query to determine whether the search query is a candidate for performing a cross-language search. In these implementations, the query evaluation module  can filter the search queries to identify those queries that are more likely to have more relevant results from web pages in another language than would be found on web pages authored in the language used to input the query.","In some implementations, the query evaluation module  can communicated with a translation service . The translation service  can receive a search query in a first language and can translate the search query into a second language and generate a translation confidence score associated with the translated search query. The translated search query and the translation confidence score can be provided to the query evaluation module .","In some implementations, tokens from the search query that match entities (e.g., local entities) associated with the first language (e.g., search query language) can be identified by the query evaluation module  in conjunction with the entities data store . In some implementations, local entities can be proper nouns (e.g., cities, places, etc.) that are associated with an area local to the language used to enter the search query.","In other implementations, search queries that include a token that matches a local entity can nevertheless be eligible for cross-language search based on the relevance of web pages in the first language. In such implementations, when a search query includes a token that matches a local entity, the results associated with the local entity in the language of the query can be compared to a threshold relevancy score to determine whether the results in the first language are of poor quality. For example, a search query might include a token that matches a local entity; however, web pages in the language associated with that local entity might be sparse. Thus, it can be useful to determine whether web pages in another language might have more relevant results.","In some implementations, the cross-language search system  can identify when a token from a translated search query matches a foreign entity. A foreign entity is any entity associated with language other than the first language (e.g., \u201cCairo, Egypt\u201d is a foreign entity to the English language). In some examples, an encyclopedia for the first or second language can be used to determine whether the translated query would be a good candidate for a cross-language search. In these examples, the tokens included in a search query or a translated search query that match an entity (e.g., local or foreign) can be identified using an encyclopedia website associated with the first language or the second language, respectively. In other examples, location servers can be used to identify locations associated with the search query or the translated search query.","In compiling the entities data store , in some implementations, generic words can be identified and removed from the entities data store , even where the words represent brands or cities associated with the first or second language. Generic words, for example, are those words that do not have any particular association with that language. An example, of a generic word that also has a city or brand associated with it is \u201cauburn.\u201d In some instances, \u201cauburn\u201d generically refers to a color, in other instances it could refer to the city of Auburn, Ala., or the brand \u201cAuburn University.\u201d In another example, the term \u201capple\u201d can generically refer to the fruit, while in other instances it could refer to a company. These words are removed from the entities data store  because they can lead to irrelevant results if the user is attempting to enter the generic term instead of the city or brand.","In some implementations, the query evaluation module  can retrieve historical statistics related to entities included in the encyclopedia. Based on the statistics associated with the entities, the query evaluation module  can determine a frequency associated with an entity's inclusion in previously received search queries. For example, the more frequently an entity appears in a search query, the more popular a topic related to that entity. More popular topics are more likely to have relevant web pages associated with the topics because interest as indicated by user queries is often mirrored by interest from publishers. Moreover, when there is no relevant content for a query, that query can become unpopular because it does not result in relevant results. Entities that are queried with a threshold frequency can be included in the entities data store , because such entities can be assumed to have a relevant topic corpus in associated web pages.","In yet further implementations, query evaluation module  can determine a quality of translation of the search query. The quality of the translation can be used to determine whether the search query is a good candidate for cross-language searching. For example, if a translation is poor, e.g., a translation confidence indicates that the translation has relatively a high probability of being incorrect, then the results from the poorly translated query might also be poor, or may not be at all relevant to the original search query. Various translation services provide confidence scores for a translation to determine which word is most likely to be implicated by usage. In some implementations, the translation service can provide a confidence score for the overall translation of the search query based on a confidence associated with the translation of each word in the search query. Thus, a search query might be difficult to translate accurately, and a confidence value or quality value can be used to filter search queries that use such words from being used for cross-language searches. For example, a particular word might have multiple translations into a foreign language or might have no translation at all. Such words would be difficult to translate, and result in a lower confidence score related to the translation.","In some implementations, the translated search query can be tested to determine whether the translated search query results in relevant web page matches. In such implementations, the query evaluation module  can send the translated search query to a search engine . The search engine  can use the translated search query to identify relevant documents in document corpora  (e.g., a index in the second language). The identified documents and the translated search query can be used to derive relevance scores associated with results of the translated search query. In some implementations, the relevance score can include both a relevance component and a quality component. Upon receiving a relevance score associated with the results from a translated search query received from the search engine , the query evaluation module  can compare the relevance score associated with the results of the search query to a relevance threshold to determine whether or not the translated search query is likely to be relevant to the search query. For example, in some instances, the results from the translated search query might be so irrelevant that the results are not even offered to the searcher.","In further implementations, the activity of users with respect to the results of previous queries matching the translated query can be used to determine whether the results from similar queries were satisfactory to other users, thereby indicating that similar search queries have produced relevant results. For example, the search engine  can log when the client device requests a result, e.g., clicks on a search result and fetches a landing page associated with the result. If the client device returns to the search page to enter a new query immediately after visiting the landing page, it is likely that the results were not relevant. Conversely, if the client device dwells on one or more of the result pages for a period of time, it is more likely that the results were relevant to the search query. The query evaluation module  can thus determine whether the translated search query is likely to yield quality results based on the activity by other users that used a search query that matched the translated query.","In further implementations, the query evaluation module  can determine whether the search query in the first language has more relevant results than the translated search query in a second language. In such implementations, the query evaluation module  can send both the search query and the translated search query to a search engine . The search engine  can derive first set of relevance scores associated with a first set of results from the original search query, and a second set of relevance scores associated with the second set of results from the translated search query. In some implementations, if the search query yields better results than any of the results from the translated search query as indicated by the first and second relevance scores, respectively, the results from the search query can be served to the searcher. Alternatively, if the results from the translated search query are more relevant than the results from the search query as indicated by the respective relevance scores, the results from the translated search query can be served to the searcher. Such a comparison assumes that the relevance measures for different languages are commensurable across the respective corpora.","In some implementations, a web page (or multiple web pages) in a second language can be translated to produce a translated version of the web page in a first language. The translated version of the web page(s) in the first language, for example, can be compared to the search query in the first language to derive a relevance score. For example, a search query received in Spanish can be translated to English. If a highest ranked English web page is more relevant to the translated English query than a highest ranked Spanish web page is to the Spanish query, the English web page can be translated into Spanish. In this example, after the English web page is translated into Spanish, the Spanish query can be compared to the translated English web page. If the translated English web page is still more relevant to the Spanish query than the Spanish web page is to the Spanish query, the translated English web page can be provided as a result. If the translated English web page is not more relevant to the Spanish query than the Spanish web page is to the Spanish query, the Spanish web page can be provided to the search as a result. Thus, the relevance score of a translated search page to the original query can be compared to the relevance score of a web page written in the first language to the original search query.","In some implementations, the results served to the client device can include both translated web pages and web pages written in the first language based on the relevance scores associated with the respective results. For example, if the results from an English query have relevance scores of 10, 9, and 2, while the results from a Spanish query have relevance scores of 8, 8 and 6, the cross-language search system could provide the two most relevant results from the English query, followed by the results of the Spanish query, and ending with the least relevant result from the English query. In other implementations, the relevance scores of the results of the original search query can be aggregated to produce a first aggregate relevance score and the relevance score of the original search query can be aggregated to produce a second aggregate relevance score. In some implementations, the aggregation can include summing the respective relevance scores to produce the first and second aggregate relevance score. The first aggregate relevance score can be compared to the second aggregate relevance score to determine whether to serve the results associated with the translated search query.","The output module  is operable to receive the results from the query evaluation module  and serve the results to a client device. In some implementations, the output module  can assemble a web page containing search results for transmission to a client device. In other implementations, the output module  can serve the results to another module operable to format and transmit the results to a client device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 1C","b":["120","120","120","124","124","126"],"sub":"Q"},"The query evaluation module  can also provide the received search query to an entity filter . The entity filter  can compare the tokens (e.g., words, or groups of words that form a single concept) to entities in a local entities data store  and to entities in a foreign entities data store . If the entity filter  determines that the search query (Q) includes a token that matches an entity from the local entities data store , the query evaluation module  can determine that the search query (Q) is not eligible for cross-language search. Accordingly, only the set of search results (R)  is served to the searcher.","If the search query (Q) does not include a token that matches an entity from the local entities data store , tokens from the search query (Q) can be compared to a list of foreign entities in a foreign entities data store . If the entity filter  determines that the search query (Q) includes a token that matches a foreign entity, the query evaluation module  can respond to the received search query (Q) with results from a translated search query (Q\u2032)  using a translation service  and the search engine  as indicated by paths  and , thereby avoiding further evaluation by the query evaluation filter . However, if the entity filter  determines that the search query (Q) does not include a token that matches a foreign entity from the foreign entities data store , the entity filter  can determine that the query should undergo further evaluation and instruct the translation service  to translate the search query (Q) to produce a translated search query (Q\u2032).","While this application describes a list of local entities that is derived from an encyclopedias and other reference sources and excludes certain generic terms and terms that are local to other languages, the list of local entities and list(s) of foreign entities, in some implementations, can be generated by another system and can be provided to the cross-language search system for use in determining whether a search term includes a token that matches a local or foreign entity from the lists provided by such other system(s).","A translation evaluation filter  can receive the translated search query (Q\u2032) from the translation service . The translation evaluation filter  can also receive a translation confidence score from the translation service . The translation evaluation filter  can compare the translation confidence score from the translation service  to a threshold confidence score to determine whether the translation is of high enough quality to be a good candidate for performing a cross-language search. If the translated search query (Q\u2032) meets the confidence threshold, the translation evaluation filter  can transmit the translated search query (Q\u2032) to a search engine . In some implementations, the most likely translation of the original search query can be returned to the query evaluation module , and a translation confidence score associated with this translation can be compared to the translation confidence threshold. In other implementations, all translations of the original search query that exceed the translation confidence threshold can be returned to the query evaluation module .","The search engine  can perform a search of document corpora  associated with the second language and based on the translated search query (Q\u2032) produce a set of search results (R)  in the second language. The search engine  can provide the results (R)  of the translated search query (Q\u2032) to a relevancy results filter . The search engine  can also provide a relevancy score (e.g., IR score) associated with the results (R)  of the translated search query (Q\u2032) to the relevancy results filter .","The relevancy results filter  can determine whether the results (R)  of the translated search query (Q\u2032) are relevant enough to be served to a searcher. The relevancy results filter  can compare the results (R)  of the translated search query (Q\u2032) to a threshold relevancy to ensure that the results (R)  of the translated search query (Q\u2032) are relevant enough to be served to the searcher. In other examples, the relevancy results filter  can retrieve statistics associated with the translated search query (Q\u2032) and determine the relevancy of the results based on click analysis associated with the results (R) . In those instances where the results (R)  are determined not to meet a threshold relevancy, only the results (R)  of the original query (Q) are served to the searcher. If the results (R)  of the translated search query (Q\u2032) are determined to meet a threshold relevancy, the results (R)  of the translated search query (Q\u2032) are provided to a relevancy comparison filter .","The relevancy comparison filter  can receive the results (R)  of the original search query (Q) and the results (R)  of the translated search query (Q\u2032). The relevancy comparison filter  can also receive first relevancy scores (e.g., IR score) of the results (R)  of the original search query (Q) and second relevancy scores of the results (R)  of the translated search query (Q\u2032). The relevancy comparison filter  can compare the first and second relevancy scores to determine whether to serve the results (R)  of the original search query and\/or the results (R)  of the translated search query. For example, if the results (R)  of a translated search query (Q\u2032) have a higher aggregate relevance score than the results (R)  of the original search query, the results (R)  of the translated search query can be offered as search results  to the searcher. Otherwise, the results (R)  of the original search query are served as search results  to the user. Other serving schemes based on relevancy can also be used.","The search results  can be served to the client in a variety of ways. In some implementations, the search results  can include links to an alternative result page (e.g., including translated web page results) identified by the query evaluation module  if a cross-language search has been performed by the query evaluation module . In other implementations, the search results  can include an aggregation of the results identified by the query evaluation module . For example, the search results  can include both results (R)  of the original search query (Q) and results (R)  of the translated search query (Q\u2032). In still other implementations, the search results  can include partitioned results . For example, the search results  can include only results (R)  of the original search query or results (R)  of the translated search query, or a link to one set of results from a page presenting the other. In yet further implementations, the search results  can include translated results . For example, if the search results  include results (R)  of the translated query, the results (R) can be translated before presentation to the searcher.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["120","120","210","210","210","130","120"],"i":"a "},"In some implementations, the query evaluation module  can include a foreign entity filter . The foreign entity filter  can determine whether the search query or translated search query is related to a foreign entity (e.g., includes a token that matches a foreign entity). In some implementations, the foreign entity filter  can include a database of foreign entities, against which the tokens associated with the search query or the translated query can be compared. In those instances when the search query is related to a foreign entity (e.g., includes a token that matches a foreign entity), it is likely that the results from the web pages written in the second language will be relevant to the search query. In such instances, the query evaluation module  can serve the search results based on search engine results  from a translated search query associated with the original search query.","In some examples, the local entities data store and the foreign entities data store can be compiled to include proper nouns associated with a first language (e.g., the query language) or second language (e.g., the translated query language), respectively. For example, the local entities and foreign entities can include brand names used in the respective languages, locations associated with the languages, celebrities, television shows, products, etc. Such entities can be presumed to have better results in their respective language than they do in another language. In some implementations, the local entities data store and the foreign entities data store can be compiled, for example, using encyclopedias (e.g., electronic encyclopedias) and\/or location servers, such as those used to provide maps. In some implementations, generic terms and\/or locations local to the language used to submit the query can be removed from the local entities data store and\/or the foreign entities data store ","In some implementations, the foreign and local entities included in the database can be compared to query statistics (e.g., how many times the entity has previously been queried) to ensure that each foreign or local entity from the encyclopedia should be included in the list of entities. For example, an entity that has not appeared in many previous queries would probably not result in relevant web pages being found based on the implication that if no searchers are interested in the entity, there are likewise few publishers interested in the entity. Alternatively, the fact that an entity has not appeared in many previous queries can be an indication that the entity is a spelling or grammar mistake, and should be eliminated from consideration.","In some implementations, the query evaluation module  can be coupled to a translation service . The translation service , in some examples, can receive a search query and translate the search query to produce a translated search query. In some implementations, the translation service  can also produce a confidence value associated with the translated query. The confidence value, for example, can provide a confidence associated with a translation of the search query.","In some implementations, the query evaluation module  can include a translation quality filter . The translation quality filter  can determine the likelihood of whether a translated search query has been accurately translated. For example, if a word in a first language (e.g., the query language) has many translations in a second language, it can be difficult to determine which of the multiple words is the proper word to use in the translation. The more potential translations associated with a word, the less likely that the chosen translation is correct. Thus, in those instances where the translated web query does not meet a confidence\/quality threshold, the translation quality filter  can determine that the translated search query received from the translation service  will not result in relevant results to the original query. In such instances, the query evaluation module  can exclude the translated search query from eligibility for the cross-language search and serve the results to the original search query.","In some implementations, the query evaluation module  can include a threshold relevancy filter . The threshold relevancy filter  can send the translated search query to a search engine . The search engine can identify relevant web pages from a document corpora  and provide the relevant web pages and a relevancy score associated with relevant web pages. The threshold relevancy filter  can compare the relevancy score of the results received from the search engine  associated with the translated search query to a threshold relevancy score to determine whether or not the translated search query produces results that are relevant enough to be served to the user. For example, a user might enter a German search query. The German search query can be translated to produce an English search query. The English search query can be used to identify English web pages related to the English search query based on a relevance score associated with each of the English web pages. The relevance score of the English web pages can be compared to a threshold relevance score to determine whether the English web pages are relevant enough to be returned to the searcher. For example, if the English pages are relatively irrelevant, the English pages would not be translated for presentation as a result of the German search query. In those instances where the relevance scores associated with English web pages do not meet a threshold relevance score, German web pages that result from the German search query can be served to the searcher.","In some implementations, the query evaluation module  can include a relevancy comparison filter . The relevancy comparison filter  transmit the original search query and the translated query to a search engine . The search engine  can identify relevant web pages from a document corpora  and provide the relevant web pages to the search query and translated search query. The search engine  can also provide first relevancy scores associated with relevant web pages to the original search query and second relevancy scores associated with relevant web pages to the translated search query. In some implementations, the relevancy comparison filter  can compare the first relevancy scores to the second relevancy scores. If the second relevancy scores are higher than the first relevancy scores, the translated search query can be used. Otherwise, the original search query can be used. In some implementations, the second relevancy scores associated with the results from the translated search query can be discounted. For example, a web page in English could be translated to German, but it would probably be difficult to read. Thus, in these implementations, a readability factor associated with the translated web pages can be considered in the comparison, thereby favoring web pages in the language in which the search query was submitted.","In some implementations, such as shown in , each of the filters must be satisfied for a search query to be eligible for cross-language searching. In other implementations, any of the filters may be satisfied for the search query to be eligible for cross-language searching.","Other implementations in addition to the implementations of  and  can also be used to facilitate cross-language searching. For example,  outline different implementations in which only a single filter can be included in the query evaluation module. Combinations of any subset of the filters can also be used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","340","350","300","300","310","310","310","310"]},"The cross-language searching system  communicates with a translation service . The translation service  can receive the search query from the input module . In some implementations, the translation service  can translate the search query from a first language to produce a translated search query in a second language. In some implementations, the translation module can translate the search query to produce multiple translated search queries that can be used to perform a cross-language search. In some implementations, the translation module  can also produce a translation confidence score associated with the translation. The translation confidence score can identify a confidence associated with the translated search query.","In some implementations, the cross-language searching system can include a query evaluation module . The query evaluation module  can evaluate the search query to determine whether the search query is a candidate for performing a cross-language search. In some implementations, the query evaluation module can identify those queries that would result in relevant results when translated to language. For example, the query evaluation module  can compare a confidence score associated with the translation to a threshold confidence score. In such examples, the query evaluation module  can exclude translated search queries with confidence scores below the threshold from cross-language searching, because translated search queries whose translation confidence scores below a threshold will likely not result in relevant results.","In other examples, the query evaluation module  can determine whether the translated search query is associated with an entity (or entities) that are local to the language associated with the translated search query. In such examples, a user might enter \u201cAl Qahira,\u201d and the query evaluation module can determine that \u201cAl Qahira\u201d is a local entity to the Arabic language. Thus, the query evaluation module can determine that results in Arabic are likely to be more relevant to the search query than results from English web pages.","In still further examples, the query evaluation module  can determine if the results from the translated search query meet a minimum relevance threshold. In such examples, the query evaluation module  can transmit the translated search query to a search service . The search service  can provide the query evaluation module  with results relevant to the translated search query and a relevance score associated with results from the translated search query.","In some examples, the query evaluation module  can transmit the original search query and a translated search query to a search service . The search service  can provide a first set of results relevant to the original search query and a second set of results relevant to the translated search query to the query evaluation module .

The query evaluation module can determine if the first relevance scores are higher than the second relevance scores. In some implementations, the first relevance scores and second relevance scores can be computed similarly, such that the scores from similarly relative results in separate languages are comparable.

The foreign entities filter module  can determine if the search query is related to a foreign entity (e.g., an entity foreign to the language of the original search query). For example, if a searcher entered the equivalent of \u201cYankee Stadium\u201d in Arabic, it can be assumed that the results from English web pages would be more relevant to the search query than results from Arabic web pages. In these implementations, the foreign entities filter module  can identify whether any of the tokens included in the search query match any of the entities included in a foreign entities data store . In some implementations, if the search query is not related to any of the foreign entities included in the foreign entities database , the original search query can be transmitted to an output module (e.g., output module  of ). In other implementations, if the search query is not related to any of the local entities  and the search query is not related to any of the foreign entities , the query evaluation module  can perform further evaluation of the search query and\/or translated search query.","In some implementations, when the search query is associated with one of the foreign entities , the query evaluation module can include a query frequency module  operable to determine whether the translated search query is used frequently enough that it is likely to produce relevant results. For example, if a translated search query is not used with some frequency, it is likely that there is not much interest in the subject by either searchers or publishers. Thus, it is likely that there are not many web pages relevant to the translated search query, and the translated search query would be unlikely to yield better results than the original search query. In some implementations, the query frequency module  can derive the popularity of a search query based on query statistics retrieved from the search service . The query statistics can include the number of times that the search query has previously been issued by clients. If the query statistics associated with the translated search query meet a threshold frequency, the translated search query can be sent to an output module (e.g., output module  of ). If the query statistics associated with the translated search query do not meet a threshold frequency, the original search query can be sent to the output module.
