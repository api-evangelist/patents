{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of Korean Application No. 99-17504, filed May 15, 1999, in the Korean Industrial Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to editing and\/or reproducing of packet-structured data, and more particularly, to a method for temporary deletion and restoration of a stream object, and fast permanent deletion of temporarily deleted stream object, and a recording medium for storing additional information for restoration or permanent deletion of temporarily deleted stream object.","2. Description of the Related Art","In general, content is formed by a stream object (SOB), and an SOB is managed in SOB units (SOBUs). Here, the stream object can be, for example, data which are recorded while a user records something from the beginning to the end. More particularly, an episode of a miniseries or a film can be recorded in one or more stream objects. Since a program can be used for explanation instead of a content, the word \u201cprogram\u201d will be used hereinafter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"Particularly as for a stream object, in order to improve the physical properties of recording media and the performance and\/or convenience of management and efficiency of reproducing\/editing devices, data are grouped in predetermined units (SOBUs) for management in an SOB, and information used in accessing the SOBUs is stored in a mapping list (MAPL) of the SOBI. The SOBUs are referenced starting from the number \u201c1\u201d and the MAPL can have a plurality of items. These items have information of incremental application packet arrival time (IAPAT), which corresponds to the difference between the arrival time of the first packet of a stream object unit and the first packet of the next consecutive stream object unit.","In order to randomly access a program recorded in a storage device, generally, search information on a program to be accessed is separately prepared and used. Search information generally includes information on data location in a program, program reproducing time, and program recording time. When a recorded program is a film, characteristic scenes can be used as search information. Here, a program recording time will be used as an example of search information.","Search information can have diverse formats in accordance with application fields, and generally data are grouped into a contiguous block as a unit of searching object in order to reduce the volume of search information and enable fast searching. Such grouping into a block is usually done in a layered structure.  illustrates an example of a three-layered structure.","When search information is made in the form of a layered structure, information in an upper layer includes information on a normal immediately-lower layer. A cell is an upper layer in search information which is included in a program. A stream object is located below the cell and stream object units are located below the stream object. Each layer of search information can have diverse relationships and, here, the following is assumed.","A program is formed of one or more cells, a cell is formed of one SOB, an SOB is formed of one or more SOBUs, and an SOBU is formed of one or more data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"In addition, in order to show the range of stream objects that the search information manages, the arrival time of the first data of a cell (SC_S_APAT) and the arrival time of the last data of a cell (SC_E_APAT) are included in cell information, and the first data arrival time of a stream object (SOB_S_APAT) and the last data arrival time of a stream object (SOB_E_APAT) are included in the SOBI. A temporary erase (TE) flag represents that a stream object is temporarily deleted. Here, temporary deletion means that, after a user deletes all or some parts of a program, a chance to cancel the deletion is given to the user. In contrast, permanent deletion means a deletion for which a user is not given a chance to cancel the deletion.","Each item of the MAPL is represented by incremental AP arrival time (IAPAT) information which means the contiguous time of each corresponding SOBU. Here, AP is an abbreviated form of application packet, and means packet-structured data. IAPAT, the contiguous time of an SOBU, is defined as follows.","The degree of precision of search information expressed in time units depends on the application. For moving picture experts group-2 (MPEG-2) system, time is counted and used in units of 27 MHz. In , data is expressed in units of 0.1. In order to reduce the length of the search information MAPL, an SOB is assumed to express time in units of 1.0. When this is applied to a 48-bit register for expressing time, a portion equal to or greater than point b18, shown in , represents the integer part and a portion less than point b18 represents a decimal fraction. The location of b18, immediately upper this decimal fraction, will be expressed as MTU_SHFT.","In addition, the IAPAT of the MAPL shown in  have values of 3, 1, and 1. These values are based upon the arrival times of the first and last AP for SOBU(2), and SOBU(3). While not shown explicitly, for , the arrival time for the first AP for SOBU(2) is 2.1, the arrival time for the first AP for SOBU(3) is 3.5, and the arrival time for the last AP for SOBU(3) is 4.8. Using these values, the method used for determining the IAPAT information of an SOBU, depends on the location of an SOBU in an SOB, that is, whether or not an SOBU is the last SOBU in an SOB.","For example, when an SOB is formed of M SOBU's, the accumulated value of IAPATs from the first to the i-th SOBU except the last SOBU must not be greater than the first AP arrival time of SOBU(i+1) by 1. At this time, IAPAT is assumed to be an integer expressed in units of 1.0, and the initial value of accumulation is assumed to be \u201c0.\u201d This is expressed in the following equation 1.\n\nSOBU_S_APAT(i+1)\u2266SUM_IAPAT(i)<SOBU_S_APAT(i+1)+1.\u2003\u2003(1)\n","Here, SUM_IAPAT(i) represents the accumulated value of all the preceding SOBUs' IAPAT values, including the corresponding SOBU, that is, SOBU#i, and SOBU_S_APAT(i+1) represents the arrival time of the first AP of SOBU(i+1).","When M SOBUs exist, the accumulated value of IAPATs from the first to the M-th for SOBU(M), the last SOBU, must be greater than the arrival time of the last AP of SOBU(M) and must not be greater than the arrival time of the last AP of SOBU(M) by 1. At this time, IAPAT is assumed to be an integer expressed in units of 1.0, and the initial value of accumulation starts from \u201c0.\u201d\n\nSOBU_E_APAT(M)<SUM_IAPAT(M)\u2266SOBU_E_APAT(M)+1.\u2003\u2003(2)\n","Here, SUM_IAPAT(M) represents the accumulated value of all preceding IAPATs, including the IAPAT of a corresponding SOBU, SOBU (M), and SOBU_E_APAT(M) represents the arrival time of the last AP of SOBU(M).","Using equations (1) and (2), the IAPATs for SOBU(1), SOBU(2), and SOBU(3) shown in  is 3, 1, 1 as shown.","Referring to , the concepts of the equations 1 and 2 will now be explained in detail. For example, IAPAT(1), IAPAT(2) and IAPAT(6) can be obtained as follows.","In , for SOBU(1), the IAPAT of SOBU(1) must be equal to or greater than the arrival time of the first AP of SOBU(2), and must not be greater than the arrival time of the first AP of SOBU(2) by 1. That is, the result of accumulation must be equal to or greater than 1.9, and must be an integer less than 2.9, and therefore, the result must be 2. Accordingly, the IAPAT of SOBU(1) is 2.","As for SOBU(2), the sum of the IAPATs of SOBU(1) and SOBU(2) must be greater than or equal to the arrival time of the first AP of SOBU(3), and must not be greater than that by 1. That is, the result of accumulation must be equal to or greater than 5.5, and must be an integer less than 6.5, and therefore, the result must be 6. Since the IAPAT of SOBU(1) is 2, the IAPAT of SOBU(2) is 4.","In this way, IAPATs of the first SOBU and a middle SOBU can be obtained. However,  shows a boundary condition that needs to be more carefully handled. When the IAPAT of SOBU(2) of  is calculated and the arrival time of the first AP of SOBU(3) is integer value of 5.0, the result of accumulation to the IAPAT of SOBU(2) is not 6, but 5. As such, care must be taken if the first AP of a middle SOBU is an integer value.","As for the last SOBU, SOBU(6) in , the sum of all the IAPATs preceding and including the IAPAT of SOBU(6) must not be greater than or equal to the arrival time of the last AP of SOBU(6) than by 1. That is, the result of accumulation must be greater than 10.8, and must be an integer less than or equal to 11.8, and therefore, it must be 11. Since the result of accumulation of IAPAT to SOBU(5) is 10, the IAPAT of SOBU(6) is 1.","In this way, the IAPAT of the last SOBU in an SOB can be obtained. However,  shows a boundary condition that needs to be more carefully handled. When the IAPAT of SOBU(6) of  is calculated when the arrival time of the last AP of SOBU(6) is the integer value of 11.0, the result of accumulation to the IAPAT of SOBU(6) is not 11, but 12. As such, care must be taken if the last AP of a last SOBU is an integer.","When a program is temporarily deleted, this deletion is indicated by a temporary erase (TE) flag, which generally known. Using a TE Flag, when a part of a program is temporarily deleted, a stream object is divided into a temporarily deleted stream object and undeleted stream objects, and the TE flag is set in the temporarily deleted stream object. This division is for restoring the deleted part later by changing only the search information which links a user and data, without actually deleting data.","While a method for dividing search information is known, a method for generating search information in dividing a stream object has not been disclosed. Also, only the TE flag indicates that the temporarily deleted part has been temporarily deleted. Thus when the TE flag reset in later restoration, the reading between the previously divided cells is performed discontinuously because of the reset process. Basically, if a restoration method having a process for resetting the TE flag is used, the restored program will have two or more cells. This means that the original program of  is not restored fully because the operation between cells is not defined, though the temporarily deleted part is restored after the temporary deletion. Therefore, since, from the standpoint of a user, a restoration after temporary deletion means restoration to the original state, a method for fully restoring a stream object divided due to temporary deletion is required.","To solve the above problems, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method for storing search information for restoration of the original state when temporary deletion is performed in a packet-structured stream object.","It is another object to provide a method for storing search information for quickly performing permanent deletion of a temporarily deleted stream object in a packet-structured stream object.","It is another object to provide a method for fully restoring stream objects which are split into a plurality of fragments during temporary deletion.","It is another object to provide a method for updating mapping list (MAPL) information for each stream object unit in a normal stream object, corresponding to the boundary portion when each stream object corresponding to temporal deletion is permanently deleted.","It is another object to provide a recording medium which stores additional information for full restoration of a stream object that is split into a plurality of fragments during temporary deletion of a packet-structured stream object.","It is another object to provide a recording medium which stores search information for quickly performing permanent deletion of a temporarily deleted stream object in a packet-structured stream object.","To accomplish the above objects of the present invention, there is provided a method for deleting part of a stream object stored in a recording medium storing search information for searching a plurality of stream objects, the stream objects having information on the arrival time of packet data and link information for linking search information to actual stream object, the method having a step of updating only search information for a plurality of stream objects generated corresponding to the ranges to be temporarily deleted; and storing first additional information for indicating temporary deletion in a stream object corresponding to a temporary deletion range and second additional information for indicating the presence of a range that can be permanently deleted, when permanent deletion is performed in a stream object having the first additional information.","To accomplish another object of the present invention, there is also provided a method for restoring stream objects fragmented by editing in a recording medium storing search information for searching a plurality of stream objects having information on the arrival time of packet data, and link information for linking the search information to the actual stream objects, the method having a step of updating only search information in order to restore a plurality of stream objects generated corresponding to editing ranges, to the original stream object; and nullifying first additional information for indicating that the corresponding stream object is edited, and second additional information for indicating a range that can be permanently deleted during permanent deletion in stream objects having first additional information, both additional information stored in search information.","To accomplish another object of the present invention, there is also provided a method for permanently deleting part of some stream objects in a recording medium storing search information for searching a plurality of stream objects having information on the arrival time of packet data, and link information for linking search information to the actual stream objects, the method having the steps of updating the search information for a stream object corresponding to a permanent deletion range in each stream object divided by temporary deletion; and updating the link information and updating each mapping list information for stream object units corresponding to the boundary of normal stream objects which are not permanently deleted.","To accomplish another object of the present invention, there is also provided a recording medium in which search information is stored for searching a plurality of stream objects having information on the arrival time of packet data; link information for linking the search information to the actual stream objects; and additional information indicating a range that can be permanently deleted in the plurality of stream objects, as the search information.","Preferably, the additional information includes first additional information for indicating that the stream object corresponding to the temporary deletion range is temporarily deleted, and second additional information for indicating the presence of a range that can be permanently deleted in performing permanent deletion in a stream object having the first additional information. Also, preferably, the additional information further includes third additional information for indicating a range that can be permanently deleted when the second additional information is effective.","Additional objects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention.","Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the attached drawings. The present invention is not restricted to the following embodiments, and many variations are possible within the spirit and scope of the present invention. The embodiments of the present invention are provided in order to more completely explain the present invention to anyone skilled in the art.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["1","2","3"]},"Since a structure is used in which a range indicated by cell information does not match a range indicated by stream object information, and only search information which corresponds to cell information (the upper-level information) changes, the size of a cell can be determined as desired because it does not depend on stream object units, which are lower-level information units.","Therefore,  illustrates search information of a program divided into three cells through a temporary deletion process from x to y. Cell  represents an information structure referred to as a cell by binding the part to be temporarily deleted, and the TE flag of Cell  is set in order to indicate the temporarily deleted part. When such search information is included, and a reproducing device reproduces Cell  and Cell  contiguously, generally, a reset process is performed on the boundary between Cell  and Cell . Since Cell  is temporarily deleted, Cell  is not reproduced.","In the process of temporarily deleting the time block spanning from x to y, a cell is divided into three cells. Search information for each divided cell is shown in the table of FIG. .","The application packets (AP) in the table of  are data used in packet-structured applications. In the table, SOB related information represents incremental AP arrival time (IAPAT), the arrival time of the first AP of an SOB (SOB_S_APAT), the arrival time of the last AP of an SOB (SOB_E_APAT), etc., shown in ; stream cell type (SC_TY) includes the type of a cell, a TE flag, a permanent erase (PE) flag, etc.; start SOBU of the entry point for erasing (EP_S_SOBU) represents the first stream object unit among stream object units which are included in a temporarily deleted cell and can be permanently deleted; end SOBU of the entry point for erasing (EP_E_SOBU) represents the last stream object unit among stream object units which are included in a temporarily deleted cell and can be permanently deleted; the arrival time of the first AP of a cell (SC_S_APAT) represents the arrival time of the first data located in the first part of a cell; and the arrival time of the last AP of a cell (SC_E_APAT) represents the arrival time of the last data located in the last part of a cell.","In temporary deletion, a process for generating search information will now be explained.","As an initial matter, the SOBUs are referenced starting from the number 1. A value ix means the number of an SOBU which includes x. That is, SOBU (ix) refers to the SOBU which includes x. However, when x is the same as the arrival time of the first AP of an SOBU, ix is the number of an SOBU immediately before the SOBU which includes x. The value iy means the number of an SOBU which includes y. That is, SOBU(iy) refers to the SOBU which includes y. However, when y is the same as the arrival time of the last AP of an SOBU, iy is the number of an SOBU immediately after the SOBU which includes y. Therefore, in , SOBU(ix) is SOBU(1), and SOBU(iy) is SOBU(3). For reference, SOBU(ix+1) is SOBU(2), and SOBU(iy\u22121) is SOBU(2).","Step 1: The arrival time of the first AP of Cell org is copied and then used as the arrival time of the first AP of Cell 1.","Step 2: The arrival time of the first AP after x becomes the arrival time of the first AP of Cell 2.","Step 3: The minimum one among the arrival times of AP greater than or equal to y becomes the arrival time of the first AP of Cell .","Step 4: The maximum one among the arrival times of AP less than or equal to x becomes the arrival time of the last AP of Cell .","Step 5: The arrival time of the last AP before y becomes the arrival time of last AP of Cell .","Step 6: The arrival time of the last AP of Cell_org is copied and then used as the arrival time of the last AP of Cell .","Step 7: The TE flag of Cell , which is to be temporarily deleted, is set. Since Cell  includes SOBU(2), the SOBU which can be permanently deleted, the PE flag is also set. If a cell does not include an SOBU which can be permanently deleted, the PE flag of the cell is not set.","Step 8: In the cell whose PE flag is set, EP_S_SOBU, the first SOBU which can be permanently deleted is recorded as SOBU(ix+1).","Step 9: In the cell whose PE flag is set, EP_E_SOBU, the last SOBU which can be permanently deleted is recorded as SOBU(iy\u22121).","Examples of the steps 1 through 9 are shown in FIG. .","After dividing a stream object, a process for searching stream objects using modified search information will now be explained. Referring to Cell  shown in , the process will be explained in an expression which can include general cases.","As shown in , a user who wants to find data, that is, an application packet, on 4.5, can find the data through following steps:","Step 1: 4.5 is stored in a variable target.","Step 2: The integer part of the arrival time of the first AP of an SOB (SOB_S_APAT) becomes the initial value for accumulation.","Step 3:  is stored as the starting value for variable i.","Step 4: The accumulation of IAPAT(i) is performed \n\n","Step 5: When the variable target is less than or equal to the result of the accumulation (sum), the \u2018target\u2019 is included in SOBU(i). When the variable target is greater than the result of the accumulation (sum), i is incremented by 1, and step 4 is performed again.","In a preferred embodiment, in the process of finding a stream object unit which includes desired data, setting the integer part of the arrival time of the first packet of a stream object as the initial value of accumulation of the IAPAT of an SOBU, instead of setting the initial value to \u201c0\u201d, enables IAPAT to be kept at a smaller value, which is the merit of this method.","The block  marked by dotted lines in  shows an example of restoration in which stream objects divided by temporary deletion is restored using a simple restoration method. The simple restoration nullifies a TE flag in a stream object which cannot be seen by a user due to setting the TE flag. That is, the TE flag in the stream object information is reset in order to indicate that the cell is temporarily deleted. When this method is used, the user can read Cell , Cell , and Cell .","However, since a program which was formed by a cell is divided into three cells by partial deletion, definition of operations among cells are required when cells are restored. In order to solve the problem that reading among the cells is performed discontinuously because of a reset process inserted in the previous method, the present invention provides a method for fully restoring a cell structure shown in FIG. .","For full restoration shown in , first, it should be recalled that Cell , Cell , and Cell  were previously one cell. As such, SOB related to each cell is considered. That is, when a plurality of cells related to the same SOB exist, it means that those cells are divided by temporary deletion. When cells which can be fully restored are found, the starting time and the ending time of an integrated cell are set using the starting time of the first cell and the ending time of the last cell, respectively.

When permanent deletion is performed, link information as well as search information should be changed. Therefore, when Cell  is permanently deleted, IAPAT information of SOBU(1) should be changed because SOBU(1), the last SOBU of Cell , is the last SOBU of a stream object which is newly generated by division. IAPAT information of SOBU(3) must be changed because SOBU(3), the first SOBU of Cell , is the first SOBU of a stream object which is newly generated by division. In addition, search information of Cell  must be deleted, and link information related to SOBUs which are included in Cell  and can be permanently deleted, must be deleted too.
