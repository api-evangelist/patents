title: POI icon display method and navigation system
abstract: A Point of Interest (POI) icon display method in a navigation system is described for displaying a POI icon at a POI point on a map. For every POI in a POI category, the location point and type of POI are stored. Each POI is identified on the displayed map by the same POI icon, and when a POI icon of a POI is selected, the type of POI is displayed. Accordingly, it is possible to reduce the number of POI icons, recognize the type of POI, such as the type of food of a restaurant (classified by country, such as Japanese food, Chinese food, Italian food, and French food), and provide a guide route to a desired POI quickly.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a Point of Interest (POI) icon display method and a navigation system for displaying a POI icon at a POI position on a map, and more particularly, to a POI icon display method and a navigation system for displaying a specified category of POI by the same POI icon among the POIs and enabling a type of the POI in the specified category to be identified.","2. Description of the Related Art","An on-vehicle navigation system detects a vehicle position and reads out map data for the area around the vehicle position from a map storage medium such as a CD-ROM or a DVD. Thereafter, a map and a guide route are drawn on a display picture plane (display screen), and a vehicle position mark is overlapped and drawn on a predetermined position on the map. In accordance with the change of the present position due to the movement of the vehicle, the vehicle position mark on the picture plane is moved along a guide route. Alternatively, the vehicle position mark is fixed at a predetermined position and the map is scrolled so that a user can understand a detailed map around the vehicle position with a single glance.","The navigation system includes a function for displaying icons (POI icons) indicative of different categories of POIs, such as an ATM (Automatic Teller Machine), bank, gas station, restaurant, hotel, car park, etc. on a map. Some POI categories can be further differentiated by type within the category. For example, there are various types of restaurant POIs. As a result, inconveniently, it is difficult to discriminate the type of food in a restaurant, namely, the type of food classified by country such as Japanese food, Chinese food, Italian food, and French food. It has been considered to use a different POI icon corresponding to each type of food. However, the number of icon types is increased and it may be difficult to have the POI icon correspond to the type of food.","A road may be congested with the POI icons in a display of a downtown area, as shown by A, B, C, and D in . Moreover, if a wide area view is employed, and the icon size displayed remains the same, icon density increases, and the road is further congested with a larger number of POI icons. In this situation, if moving a cross cursor onto the road in order to confirm a road name and an address on the map or to set a destination on the road, it is difficult to avoid selecting a POI icon and this prevents a road or a point on a road from being selected. Therefore, a problem arises that the user cannot confirm the road name and address or the setting of the destination, and the road name and the address must be confirmed and the destination must be set only after executing a complicated operation to erase the icons through a set-up menu.","The number of POI icons displayed on the map is increased in a downtown area, and a plurality of the same POI icons may be included within a cursor of a predetermined size. In such a case, a problem arises to make it difficult to input a point and select a road correctly.","It is a first object of the present invention to enable the user to easily recognize the type of POI in a particular category (POI), when using POI icons in the category commonly, and thus to select a desired POI and search a route to the POI.","It is a second object of the present invention to display only POIs of a desired type by a POI icon. Thus, the number of POI icons displayed is decreased and the user can select the desired POI easily.","It is a third object of the present invention to enable a road or a point on a road to be selected easily if the road is congested with POI icons. Thus, it is possible to confirm a road name and an address or set a destination on a road.","It is a forth object of the present invention to make it easy to comprehend the displayed situation when using a cursor with a predetermined size and possible to input a point and select a road correctly.","According to the present invention, to attain the first object, (1) a point where a POI is located and the type of POI are stored for every POI in a category, (2) the POIs are displayed on a map by the same POI icon, (3) when selecting the POI icon of a predetermined POI, the type of the POI is displayed on the map by a POI icon.","According to the present invention, to attain the second object, (1) a point where a POI is located and the type of POI are stored for every POI in a category, (2) the type of a POI displayed on a map by a POI icon is preset, (3) the POI with the set type is displayed on the map by the same POI icon, and (4) when selecting the POI icon of a predetermined POI, the type of the POI is displayed.","According to the present invention, to attain the third object, (1) an index for selecting a cursor instructing point is displayed as well as a POI name (such as a restaurant name, bank name, and hotel name) of at least one POI icon, which is selected by a cursor with a predetermined size, and (2) a predetermined POI name or index is selected and the POI icon or cursor instructing point is selected.","According to the present invention, to attain the forth object, (1) a map is scrolled by an operation for moving a cursor, and (2) when a plurality of the same POI icons are included within the cursor, only one POI icon is displayed and the others are erased.","Other features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","(A) Outline of the Present Invention","(a) Display of Type of POI",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIGS. 1(A) to 1(C)"},"According to the present invention, a location position and a type of food (classified by a country such as Japanese food, Chinese food, Italian food, and French food) are preset for every restaurant. The restaurants are displayed on a map by the same POI icon. For example, as shown in FIG. (A), the restaurants are displayed by the same POI icon having symbols such as a fork and a knife.","When desiring to have a meal in a Japanese restaurant, the user scrolls a map MP by an operation for moving a circular cursor  (in ) with a cross form, a POI icon of the restaurant is displayed on a display screen, and the POI icon is selected by the cursor . After that, if an enter key is operated (not shown), the system operates as shown in :\n\n","In this state, if selecting the POI name (TOKYO RESTAURANT) by a highlight point shift key (not shown), the system displays detailed information  about the TOKYO RESTAURANT, as shown in  i.e., an address , telephone number , direction , distance , and type of food (Japanese: Japanese food) ). Therefore, the user can recognize that the restaurant indicated by the POI icon is a restaurant with Japanese food. When the user depresses the enter key and sets the restaurant as a destination, the system searches and provides a guide route from the present point to the restaurant. Note that in the case of returning to the display in  from that in , the index \u201cCursor Point\u201d may be selected by the highlight point shift key.","As mentioned above, if the POI icon of the restaurant is common, the user can recognize the type of food in the restaurant easily, and select a desired restaurant and search a guide route to the restaurant.","By presetting the types of food (such as a French restaurant and an Italian restaurant) in the restaurants displayed on the map by use of the POI icon, only the restaurants of the preset types of food are displayed on the map by the same POI icon. As a result of this operation, the displayed number of POI icons can be reduced and the restaurants of the desired French food and Italian food can be selected easily.","(b) Selection of Road","When using the cursor to select a point on a road congested with the POI icons the cross intersection of the cursor causes the road to be selected on the POI icon. Thereafter, if the enter key is depressed, the system displays the same information as that in . Incidentally, a road name is displayed in place of the address of the point. Where the index \u201cCursor Point\u201d is selected, if depressing the enter key and setting the cursor instructing point as a destination, the system searches the guide route from the present point to the cursor instructing point and executes route guidance.","Thus, if the road is congested with the POI icons (refer to A to D in ), the system is able to confirm the road name and address and set the destination easily.","When a plurality of the same POI icons , , and are included within the cursor  as shown in , only one POI icon is displayed and the other POI icons and are erased, as shown in . Consequently, it is easy to see the situation in the cursor with a predetermined size, and it is possible to select the point and road correctly by the cross intersection.","(B) Construction of Navigation System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["11","12","13","14","15","16"]},"Reference numeral  denotes a remote controller for executing a menu selection operation, an enlarging\/reducing operation, a destination input operation, etc.; and  a remote controller interface. As shown in , the remote controller  includes a joystick\/enter key ; a menu key ; a cancel key ; an MP\/RG key ; a zoom\/scroll key ; a monitor ON\/OFF key ; and so on. The joystick\/enter key has a function as a joystick key for moving the cursor or vehicle mark, etc., relatively in one of eight directions in the map or moving a menu bar (highlight point) when selecting a desired menu index, and a function as an enter key for setting and inputting the cursor point and selecting and inputting the menu. Therefore, the joystick\/enter key will be also labeled simply as a joystick key or enter key hereinafter.","The menu key is operated when displaying a main menu, and the cancel key cancels the present displayed screen or is operated when returning the screen to an initial screen of the menu. The MP\/RG key is operated when switching guiding modes (MAP GUIDE MODE and ARROW MODE), and when enlarging\/reducing the map and vertically shifting the highlight point in various lists.","Referring to  again, reference numeral  denotes a processor (CPU) for controlling the entire operation of the navigation system;  a ROM for storing various control programs such as a route search program and a map matching program necessary for navigation control;  a RAM for storing a processing result such as a guide route;  a voice guiding unit for guiding a traveling direction at a crossroad;  a display controller for generating map images (a MAP GUIDE image and an ARROW GUIDE image) on the basis of map information;  a VRAM for storing the images generated by the display controller;  a menu\/list generating unit for generating menu image\/various list images;  a synthesizing unit;  a monitor device; and  a bus.","(B) Map Information","The map information comprises: (1) a road layer; (2) a background layer for displaying an object on a map; (3) a character layer for displaying characters such as the names of cities; and (4) a POI icon layer for displaying a POI icon at the location point of a POI properly. The POI icon layer holds the POI icon data shown in  for every POI icon. The POI icon data has:\n\n","The POI database memory  stores a large number of POIs corresponding to various categories, plus an address, telephone number, location point indicated by the longitude and latitude of the POI, information peculiar to the POI, etc.  shows a POI category list;  shows a POI list of restaurants as one category; and  shows a detailed information list for BBB restaurant, which contains an address, a telephone number, open\/closed time, type of food (namely, a type classified by country such as Japanese food, Chinese food, Italian food, and French food), longitude and latitude, and the like.","(D) First Embodiment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIGS. 8(A) to 8(G)"]},"Referring to an initial picture plane or display screen in , the joystick key () is operated (step ), and the system displays the cursor  on the map MP as shown in  where the cursor  is connected to a vehicle location mark  by a directional line . Thereafter, the scrolling operation is continued and the map is scrolled (steps  and ). In this case, a restaurant is displayed by the same POI icon, for instance, a POI icon with symbols such as a fork and a knife.","Based on the map scroll, if the cursor  identifies a predetermined POI icon or a predetermined point, the scroll operation ends (step ). At the end of the scroll operation, as shown in , the system displays the longitude and latitude of the point identified by a cross intersection of the cursor , a distance (12.3 mile) from the location of the vehicle to this point, and the direction  of the point identified by the cursor  relative to the vehicle location (step ).","The enter key is depressed (step ), and then the system displays a destination set picture plane (Dest: Select Name) shown in  (step ). The destination set picture plane displays:\n\n","In this state, it is determined whether the destination is inputby the point or by the POI icon (step ). If it is determined that the destination is inputby the POI icon, a desired POI name is displayed in highlight and selected by use of the zoom\/scroll key (step ).","If selecting the desired POI name, the system checks to see if the selected POI name is a restaurant (step ). When the restaurant, i.e., the TOKYO RESTAURANT is selected, the system obtains the detailed information about the TOKYO RESTAURANT from the POI database memory  and displays the detailed information , as shown in  (step ). The detailed information  includes: an address (1232 TORRANCE . . . ); a telephone number (310-540-1234); a directional arrow; a distance (2.4 miles); and a type of food (Japanese). Based on the detailed information, the user recognizes that the TOKYO restaurant indicated by the POI icon is a restaurant having Japanese food.","If the Japanese restaurant is acceptable, the user depresses the enter key (step ). By depressing the enter key, the system displays a destination confirming picture plane (Dest: Confirmation Destination) shown in . When the destination is not changed and is acceptable as it is in the destination confirming picture plane, the user depresses the enter key and the system conducts a search a routine, setting the TOKYO RESTAURANT as the destination (step ).","If the destination is not acceptable and is to be changed in the destination confirming picture plane, the cancel key () is depressed. Based on the depression of the cancel key, the system displays the destination set picture plane shown in . After that, another POI name is selected by the zoom\/scroll key , or the cancel key is further depressed and the picture plane is returned to the map scroll picture plane shown in , thereby allowing the user to select a desired destination.","Note that when selecting the POI name (MOBILE) other than the restaurant in step , the system obtains the detailed information regarding a mobile gasoline station from the POI database memory , and displays the address, telephone number, and other information (step ). After that, process subsequent to step  is performed.","If inputting a destination by a point in step , since a destination confirming picture plane () in which the index \u201cCursor Point\u201d selected in step  has been already displayed, the user depresses the enter key (step ). Incidentally, if the destination confirming picture plane in  is not displayed and another destination confirming picture plane (e.g. ) is displayed upon the determination in step , the index \u201cCursor Point\u201d is selected by the zoom\/scroll key . The destination confirming picture plane  is displayed (step ), and thereafter the enter key is depressed (step ).","If setting the cursor instructing point as a destination by depressing the enter key , the system displays the destination confirming picture plane shown in . When the destination is not changed and the user depresses the enter key , the system sets the cursor instructing point as a destination and searches a guide route (step ).","The foregoing shows the case of setting the destination, and the similar processes and operations are also implemented in the case of selecting a point on a road by the cursor when the road is congested with the POI icons (A to D in ). That is, when identifying a point on a road, which is congested with the POI icons, by use of the cursor  the road is identified onto the POI icon by the cross intersection in the cursor . After that, by depressing the enter key , the system displays the same information as that in . Incidentally, a road name is displayed instead of the address of the location point. Additionally, the enter key is depressed and the cursor instructing point is set as a destination, and then the system searches a guide route to the cursor instructing point on the map from the present location point, thereby guiding the route.","(E) Second Embodiment","Although the first embodiment shows the case of displaying all of the restaurants on the map by the same icon, if the type of food desired in a restaurant has already been determined, the system is able to display only those restaurants by the POI icon having the desired type of food. For example, restaurants having French food and Italian food can be set for display by the POI icon and only the restaurants with French food and Italian food will be displayed on the map by the POI icon. Thus, it is possible to reduce the number of displayed POI icons and to select a desired restaurant more easily.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0074"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 4"],"b":["201","17","202","203","204","201","205","205","206","205","207"],"i":"a "},"The processes in steps  to  are conducted until the cursor  identities a predetermined POI icon or a predetermined point. If the cursor  identifies a predetermined POI icon or predetermined point, the scroll operation ends (step ). Thereafter, the destination determining process  as in the first embodiment shown in  is executed.","(F) Third Embodiment","The number of POI icons displayed on the map is greater in a downtown area, etc. and a plurality of the same POI icons can be included within the cursor. In such a case, the problem arises that it is difficult to see the inside of the cursor and select a point correctly or to select a road by the cross intersection. According to this embodiment of the invention if a plurality of the same POI icons are included within the cursor, only one POI icon is displayed and the other icons are erased.
