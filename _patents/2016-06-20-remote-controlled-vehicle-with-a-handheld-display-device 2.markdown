{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","Design Problems","Gestalt Experience Motivations","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Virtual Environment","Device Posture & Motion","Interaction Sequences","Video Pane Characteristics","Exemplary Hardware Configuration","Applicability"],"p":["This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/540,695 entitled \u201cPORTABLE PROPRIOCEPTIVE PERIPATETIC POLYLINEAR VIDEO PLAYER\u201d filed on Jul. 3, 2012, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/666,216 entitled \u201cPORTABLE PROPRIOCEPTIVE PERIPATETIC POLYLINEAR VIDEO PLAYER\u201d filed on Jun. 29, 2012, both of which are incorporated by reference herein.","The present inventors intend this invention to be understood by persons with expertise in the science of user-centered experience design (\u201cUCD\u201d) and the art of interactive media (\u201cIM\u201d), including expertise in the functional specification of human-computer interfaces for digital media involving interactions between a participant and a hardware and\/or software system. The person of ordinary skill in the art (\u201cdesign expert\u201d or \u201cdesigner\u201d) need not be trained in computer engineering matters nor be able to implement the invention single-handedly.","The functional relationship between a designer and an engineer (who is skilled in writing code and\/or building hardware) is akin to the relationship between the architect of a home and the builder of the home. The architect needs to know enough about structure and materials to be able to draft blueprints for the practical and aesthetic features of buildings, but may lack skills, credentials and equipment required to carry out the construction. Minimum qualifications for an interactive media designer include expertise in and appreciation of human factors as well as sufficient knowledge of hardware and software technology to be able to specify and\/or direct engineer(s) in the building of systems to human-computer interaction specifications.","The U.S. patent classification for this patent should prioritize expertise in UCD for interactive media, human factors (\u201cHF\u201d), user experience (\u201cUX\u201d), user interface (\u201cUI\u201d) and interaction design (\u201cIxD\u201d) over engineering. The specification is intended for understanding by practitioners who have demonstrated real-world experience and technical\/creative proficiency in the science of UCD, HF, UX, UI design and IxD for IM.","For clarity and consistency of interpretation, the following terms used herein shall have the following definitions. If the definition of a term herein is in conflict with the ordinary and customary meaning of such term, the definition herein shall be the definition applied.","The term \u201ccomputer\u201d means a device or system with at least one microprocessor. Examples of computers include but are not limited to laptop computers, tablet computers, mobile phones, digital media players, game consoles, digital wristwatches, head-mounted display systems, digital televisions, set-top boxes and file servers. The term \u201cdevice\u201d is meant to be interchangeable with the term computer where it is clear from the context that the reference is to a computer as defined herein (i.e. with at least one microprocessor).","The terms \u201chandheld device\u201d and \u201chandheld computing device\u201d can be used interchangeably to mean (a) a computer that may be held or worn by a participant during use and\/or (b) a computer that can detect motion of a participant's body in space. An example of the latter is a Microsoft X-BOX 360 equipped with Kinect motion sensing input hardware. Thus, the concepts described herein regarding detection of device postures and\/or motions should be understood as inclusive of detection of postures and\/or motions by a participant whose body is not in direct physical contact with a computer. For example, the described function of detecting the pivoting of a device around the device's x-axis is meant to be inclusive of the function of detecting the pivoting a participant's hand, for example, around an analogous x-axis of the participant or participant's hand.","The terms \u201ccomputer readable medium\u201d and \u201ccomputer readable media\u201d can be used interchangeably to mean storage that can be accessed by a computer. These terms include temporary transitory storage (such as data caches used by web browsers, streaming media players and digital video recorders), provided that neither term is intended to include any propagated signal, any carrier wave or any other non-statutory subject matter.","A \u201cparticipant\u201d means a person situated for interaction with a computer; and broadly encompasses a variety of terms commonly used to describe humans in relation to computers\u2014including the words user, player, reader, viewer, listener, visitor, audience and audient (i.e. an audience of one). The hands visible in the figures are representative of participant's hands.","The term \u201cconfigured\u201d means the state of a device with software for performing identified functions. The phrase \u201ccapable of\u201d is interchangeable with the phrase \u201cconfigured for.\u201d Thus, a device lacking software for performing a particular identified function is not capable of performing this function even though the device might have the potential to be configured for performing such function by adding the necessary software.","\u201cSoftware\u201d means a set of instructions that when installed on a computer configures that computer with the readiness to perform one or more functions. The terms \u201ccomputer program,\u201d \u201capplication\u201d and \u201capp\u201d are meant to be synonymous with the term software.","The term \u201cinformation\u201d may be used to describe either or both machine-readable data and displayable content.","The term \u201ccontent\u201d means human-perceivable information such as still images, three-dimensional objects, text, movies, audio recordings, tactile data and tangible patterns. Content for display may be retrieved from memory storage (e.g. may be fixed and predetermined before a given participant experience) or may be computationally generated in part or in whole on the fly.","\u201cGenerate\u201d means to cause something to exist\u2014whether from scratch, from stored data, or a combination thereof.","The phrase \u201con the fly\u201d means occurring in response to participant interaction, content triggers and\/or other variables during a given participant experience. The specific outcome of an on the fly computation is neither fixed nor predetermined.","The noun \u201cdisplay\u201d means an output device for conveying information to a participant, including but not limited to visual display hardware (such as LCD screens and image projectors), auditory display hardware (such as speakers and headphones), tactile display hardware (such as braille and textural haptics, piezoelectric vibration motors and force-feedback systems) and other sensory displays.","The verb \u201cdisplay\u201d means to output information (e.g. visual, auditory and\/or tactile content) for perception by a participant using one or more modalities of communication through one or more displays, thus allowing said participant to see, hear and\/or feel said information.","A \u201cproduction\u201d means a collection of machine-executable instructions and content. \u201cProduction content\u201d means the displayable portion of a production. \u201cProduction instructions\u201d means the machine-executable portion of a production. Production content and production instructions may be fixed and predetermined before a given participant experience or may be computationally established in part or in whole on the fly.","\u201cRun\u201d and \u201cexecute\u201d are used synonymously to mean to carry out machine executable instructions.","To \u201cproduce\u201d means to dispatch the displayable content of a production for display and\/or to run the executable portion of a production. To be clear, if a person inserts a DVD movie into a DVD player and presses the \u201cplay\u201d button on the DVD player and the DVD player executes instructions to play the movie, then the player is \u201cproducing\u201d the movie\u2014whether or not any screens or speakers are connected to said DVD player. Producing is distinct from displaying; and producing does not require displaying to occur.","\u201cContinuous play content\u201d (\u201cCPC\u201d) means audio and\/or video content that will play continuously from beginning to end if there is no outside intervention. If a participant does nothing, for example, continuous play content has the inherent characteristic of continuing to play from a beginning (or early) point to an end (or later) point. This is distinct from a game, wherein if the player does nothing, the action either stops until the player takes an action or stops because the player failed to achieve an objective (e.g. the character controlled by the player is killed). CPC may be read from various locations, including but not limited to local storage on a device, from a remote storage location such as a server, or may be streamed live from a broadcast (one-to-many) such as a sporting event or a live point-to-point or multi-point videoconference.","The terms \u201cvideoconference stream\u201d and \u201cvideoconference video\u201d can be used interchangeably to mean CPC of videoconference attendee(s), slide(s), shared screen(s), whiteboard(s) and\/or other CPC of a videoconference.","The noun \u201cstream\u201d means a sequence of data elements made available over time.","The verb \u201cstream\u201d means to transfer a sequence of data elements from one location to another (such as from local storage, from a remote storage location or from a live feed) for display or processing over time.","\u201cSegment\u201d means a stream or portion of a stream. Beginning and ending termini of a segment may be fixed and predetermined by a designer prior to a given participant experience, or one or both termini may be established on the fly.","A \u201csegment descriptor\u201d is information describing a segment. A segment descriptor may, but does not necessarily include information identifying parameters of a segment, such as a beginning or an ending terminus of the segment.","\u201cAudio\u201d and \u201caudio content\u201d mean a stream of auditory continuous play content. Examples include, but are not limited to, 8 bit and 16 bit linear pulse-code modulated (\u201cPCM\u201d) audio, variable bit rate (\u201cVBR\u201d) encoded audio, MP3 compressed audio files and CAFF containers with 16-bit little endian integer PCM formatted content. Audio content may also include sounds and\/or soundtracks synthesized and\/or mixed on the fly.","A \u201csprite\u201d is a graphical, auditory and\/or tactile content element (such as an animated character or informational overlay) that can be computationally modeled, managed and rendered separately from other content. Sprite animation sequences may be predetermined and\/or calculated on the fly. Sprites are widely used in two-dimensional (\u201c2D\u201d) and three-dimensional (\u201c3D\u201d) computer games\u2014moving characters and other objects independently of the game playfield. Sprites are also used in digital animation and film-making processes\u2014compositing motion-capture avatars, for example, into real or fabricated scenes. But once the frames of a digital film are rendered for storage and\/or transmission, the sprites are no longer produced as independently controllable entities.","\u201cVideo\u201d and \u201cvideo content\u201d mean a stream of continuous play content that can be produced for display through a visual display, which may include or be accompanied by an audio stream. An example is a motion picture movie stored on film or an optical disc. \u201cVideo content,\u201d as used herein, does not include video signals containing manipulable animated sprites. And while sprites may be overlaid in front of, around or otherwise produced with sequences of frames of visual CPC, a visually displayed sprite\/CPC combination is not video. The term \u201cmovie\u201d is meant to be synonymous with the term video, and is inclusive of live transmissions such as videoconference streams and broadcast television programs.","For example, one popular video format in the year 2012 is a 1920 pixel\u00d71080 pixel MPEG-4 movie storage file or live transmission stream encoded, stored and\/or transmitted with an H.264 codec (compression coder decoder) for display at 29.97 frames per second. The video may be optionally associated with one or more audio soundtracks such as a stereo 44.1 kHz MPEG-4 audio storage file or live transmission stream encoded, for example, with an AAC codec at 256 kbits per second. One or more related videos and one or more related audio tracks may be stored and\/or transmitted together in one or more bundled data file(s) or be referenced independently. Videos can be of any pixel dimensions, frame rate and compression.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,692,212 (\u201cRoach\u201d) teaches a form of digital media production called an \u201cinteractive movie\u201d that requires participant interaction to determine a course of events in a choose-your-own-adventure style game. Roach's \u201cinteractive movies\u201d comprise a narrative storyline and navigable game environment over which short videos are superimposed from time to time. Despite the occasional inclusion of such video content, this genre of production is not continuous play content capable of being played passively from beginning to end without participant interaction. Thus, such \u201cinteractive movies\u201d fall outside the definitions of \u201cmovie\u201d and \u201cvideo\u201d and \u201cvideo content\u201d used herein.","To be clear, the term video is not meant to exclude interactivity or polylinearity. Moreover, special effects and other enhancements may complement a video in a given participant experience. Such enhancements may include but are not limited to annotations, overlays, subtitles, cues and machine-readable instructions for display transformations such as transitions and video pane entrance, exit, movement, resizing or other video pane transformations to occur at preset times or in response to participant interaction. Video interactions may range from basic media transport functions (such as pause, fast-forward, rewind, skip forward and skip back) to traversing links from a video to related content (whether or not such related content is video), traversing seamless expansions (U.S. Pat. No. 6,393,158, U.S. Pat. No. 6,621,980, U.S. Pat. No. 7,467,218, U.S. Pat. No. 7,890,648, U.S. Pat. No. 8,122,143 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/348,624 by two of the three present inventors), engaging interactive advertisements or otherwise directing the flow of the video. The definition of the term video is, however, meant to be limited to a form of content that can be played from beginning\u2014once initiated\u2014to end, without further participant interaction.","To \u201cplay\u201d means to produce a stream of audio and\/or video content, whether said content is stored or live (e.g. a videoconference or broadcast show).","A \u201cvideo player\u201d or \u201cplayer\u201d is a device and\/or application capable of playing one or more videos from beginning\u2014once initiated\u2014to end, without further participant interaction. Example video players are hardware and software DVD players, Blu-ray disc players, digital video recorders (such as TiVo Inc.'s TiVo Premiere), streaming movie applications (such as Netflix, Inc.'s Internet subscription service) and videoconferencing applications such as Microsoft Corporation's Skype and Apple, Inc. (\u201cApple\u201d) iChat and iMessage.","The noun \u201ctransition\u201d means audio and\/or visual content and\/or effect(s) that is\/are produced while passing from one portion of a production to another portion of the production.","The verb \u201ctransition\u201d means to pass from one portion of a production to another portion of the production.","A \u201ccue\u201d is a prompt or guiding suggestion. A cue may act, for example, as an indicator to a participant to know what is possible to do or where it is possible to go. Cues may be communicated in any one or combination of modalities perceivable by participants, such as auditory, visual and tactile. Cues are not limited to discrete signifiers (such as an identifiable tone, textual overlay, graphical sprite or button), but may be action- or timing-based (e.g. whenever a dog in a video wags its tail for more than 2 seconds), or semantically hinted (e.g. whenever a person in a video makes reference to new possibilities).","\u201cHighlighting\u201d means to call attention to a cue or to other information using one or more of auditory, visual, tactile or other modalities.","The noun \u201clink\u201d means a rule or collection of rules that determines the selection of content to play, display or produce next. A link may be a predetermined connection or may be established on the fly. A link may contain or reference information about where it is coming from, but doesn't need to specify such information.","The verb \u201clink\u201d means to traverse a link.","\u201cPolylinear\u201d means a plurality of video and\/or audio streams that play simultaneously for at least a portion of time. The beginnings of each stream participating in polylinearity need not occur simultaneously; and the endings of each stream participating in polylinearity need not occur simultaneously.","\u201cPolyphonic\u201d means sonic polylinearity comprising audio streams that may or may not be distinguishable from one another by a listener during simultaneous playback. Audio streams that are located apart from one another in a space allow for locational distinguishability by a listener, especially when displayed through two or more speakers associated with at least two audio channels (such as a left and a right channel). Polyphonic distinguishability may also be accomplished on devices with only a single speaker by lowering the volume of sounds located far away in a virtual environment, while raising the volume of sounds located nearby in the virtual environment.","A \u201cvideo pane\u201d is a virtual visual display surface where a video is rendered in a virtual environment. The video pane needs not be 2D (i.e. flat) or rectilinear, and could be invisible when no video content is present. The video content may be rendered as opaque or it can be transparent, allowing a participant to see through it. A video pane may optionally be sized to fill the entirety of a visual display or may optionally fill the entirety of a window containing a virtual environment in a windowed computer operating system environment such as Mac OS X or Microsoft Windows.","A \u201cvirtual environment\u201d (\u201cVE\u201d) is a multi-dimensional space in which content is produced for display. \u201cVirtual camera\u201d and \u201cvirtual camera view\u201d mean the perspective from which a VE is produced for display to a participant. A \u201cvirtual speaker\u201d is a location for sound in a VE.","\u201cPerspective\u201d means a set of one or more virtual camera variables relating to the production of a VE for display. Examples include location of the virtual camera in the VE, orientation of the virtual camera, field of view, depth of field and clipping planes.","Spatial \u201clocation\u201d means the place where a point, a two-dimensionally defined region or a three-dimensionally defined region is situated in a VE or in the real world. \u201cTemporal location\u201d means a point in time or a span of time.","\u201cPosture\u201d means the position of a handheld device in relation to the Earth and\/or a participant. Posture may be absolute (e.g. perpendicular to the ground and facing due east) or relative (e.g. slid left, tipped right, pushed or pulled). Posture may be used to describe either a single variable or a collection of variables.","\u201cOrientation\u201d means the facing of a person, virtual camera or device. The orientation of a person is the general direction their chest is facing. The orientation of a virtual camera is the general direction it points into a VE, thereby enabling a participant to look in that general direction in the VE. With regards to a handheld device, orientation is used herein to describe the aspect(s) of the device's posture related to rotation around a v-axis (defined below). Elsewhere in the industry, but not in this patent, the term orientation is used to describe whether a device is being held in landscape or portrait posture.","Environmental scale refers to the relative size of a physical or virtual environment. A VE that is \u201cpersonal scale\u201d is defined herein as no larger than 3\u00d73\u00d73 meters, while \u201carchitectural scale\u201d is defined herein as larger than 3 meters in at least one dimension (width and\/or length and\/or height).","Vista complexity refers to whether participants have to travel through an environment to see, hear and\/or feel the detail necessary for navigation (e.g. to see its full layout). \u201cSingle vista\u201d VEs involve no occlusions; so all their virtual features can be perceived from a single location, even if it requires participants to rotate their orientation. In a \u201cmanifold vista\u201d VE, participants must move around the environment in order to perceive its various features.","A device's \u201cx-axis\u201d means a reference axis in a 3D Cartesian coordinate space that passes horizontally through a device, in a given grip-position, extending through the left and right edges of the device through the plane of the visual display. X values will be described herein as increasing as they go right, but any axis labels and counting systems may be used to model and build the invention.","A device's \u201cy-axis\u201d means a reference axis in a 3D Cartesian coordinate space that passes vertically through a device, in a given grip-position, extending through the top and bottom edges of the device through the plane of the visual display. Y values will be described herein as increasing as they go up, but any axis labels and counting systems may be used to model and build the invention.","A device's \u201cz-axis\u201d means a reference axis in a 3D Cartesian coordinate space that passes perpendicularly through the visual display of a device, extending through the back and front surfaces of the device. Z values will be described herein as increasing as they come from the front of a device, generally towards a participant, but any axis labels and counting systems may be used to model and build the invention.","A participant's \u201ccraniocaudal axis\u201d is a reference axis in a human-centered 3D Cartesian coordinate space that passes vertically through a participant generally along the participant's spine when standing or sitting upright. Spinning around on a barstool is an example of a rotation around the craniocaudal axis; and jumping up in the air is an example of travel along the craniocaudal axis. Craniocaudal values will be described herein as increasing as they go up from foot to head, but any axis labels and counting systems may be used to model and build the invention.","A participant's \u201canteroposterior axis\u201d is a reference axis in a human-centered 3D Cartesian coordinate space that passes through a participant extending through the back and front of the participant. A cartwheel is an example of a rotation around the participant's anteroposterior axis; and walking is an example of travel along the anteroposterior axis. Anteroposterior values will be described herein as increasing as they go from the back to the front, but any axis labels and counting systems may be used to model and build the invention.","A participant's \u201cmediolateral axis\u201d is a reference axis in a human-centered 3D Cartesian coordinate space that passes laterally through a participant extending through the left and right sides of the participant. A somersault (i.e. forward roll) is an example of a rotation around the participant's mediolateral axis; and a side-shuffle is an example of travel along the mediolateral axis. Mediolateral values will be described herein as increasing as they go right, but any axis labels and counting systems may be used to model and build the invention.","\u201cV-axis\u201d herein means a vertical reference axis in planet-centric 3D Cartesian coordinate space (i.e. expressed by a plumb line that extends perpendicular to a planet's surface between the sky and the core of the planet, notwithstanding minor deviations due to distance from the equator). Rotation of a device or person around a v-axis may be described in absolute terms (e.g. facing due-east) or relative terms (e.g. rotated 15\u00b0 counter-clockwise from a previous orientation). A standing participant's craniocaudal axis is an example of a v-axis outside a device; but a v-axis may also pass directly through a device.","\u201cX-axisometer\u201d herein means either an algorithmically fused plurality of sensors or a single sensor from a set of accelerometer(s) and gyro sensor(s) collectively capable of detecting information related to posture of and\/or rotation of a device around the device's x-axis.","\u201cX-axisometer data\u201d means data from an x-axisometer. The x-axisometer data may be raw or processed information about the absolute posture of the device or about the device's posture relative to past data or relative to other reference data.","\u201cY-axisometer\u201d herein means either an algorithmically fused plurality of sensors or a single sensor from a set of accelerometer(s) and gyro sensor(s) collectively capable of detecting information related to posture of and\/or rotation of a device around the device's y-axis.","\u201cY-axisometer data\u201d means data from an y-axisometer. The y-axisometer data may be raw or processed information about the absolute posture of the device or about the device's posture relative to past data or relative to other reference data.","\u201cZ-axisometer\u201d herein means either an algorithmically fused plurality of sensors or a single sensor from a set of accelerometer(s) and gyro sensor(s) collectively capable of detecting information related to posture of and\/or rotation of a device around the device's z-axis.","\u201cZ-axisometer data\u201d means data from a z-axisometer. The z-axisometer data may be raw or processed information about the absolute posture of the device or about the device's posture relative to past data or relative to other reference data.","\u201cV-axisometer\u201d herein means either an algorithmically fused plurality of sensors or a single sensor from a set of magnetometer(s) (e.g. digital compass), gyro sensor(s) and accelerometer(s) collectively capable of detecting information related to rotation of a device around a v-axis.","\u201cV-axisometer data\u201d means data from a v-axisometer. The v-axisometer data may be raw or processed information about the absolute posture of the device and\/or absolute orientation of the device or about the device's posture and\/or orientation relative to past data or relative to other reference data. If a device is held vertically (i.e. with the screen perpendicular to the ground), then swinging it left or right around a participant could yield the same v-axisometer data as rotating the device around the device's y-axis (as in ). If the device is laid flat (i.e. with the screen parallel to the ground), then swinging it left or right around a person could yield the same v-axisometer data as rotating the device around the device's z-axis (as in ).","\u201cSensor reference data\u201d means a value or range related to sensor-derived data from which determinations can be made about sensor data. Sensor reference data may indicate an \u201corigin\u201d\u2014a set of one or more values used to determine whether sensor-derived data diverging from the set of one or more values in one or more directions will be used to effect change to a display-related variable in one or more directions (e.g. moving a virtual camera to the right in a VE). Sensor reference data may also indicate a \u201cneutral zone\u201d\u2014a value or range of values used to determine whether sensor-derived data matching said value or falling within the bounds of said range of values will not cause changes to one or more display-related variables, thereby providing a participant the ability to comfortably hold a device in a resting posture without causing, for example, a virtual camera to change location and\/or orientation. Sensor reference data may be fixed and predetermined by a designer before a given experience, or may be established in part or in whole on the fly. To account for variability in participant resting postures and postural stability, custom origins and neutral zones may be established and\/or calibrated for each participant.","A \u201cthreshold\u201d is a value that defines a boundary of a neutral zone. A threshold may be used in determining whether or not a device's posture will cause changes in the production of a VE.","To \u201cdamp\u201d or \u201cdampen\u201d means to lessen the displayed result of a device input. This can be accomplished by applying a numerical transform function to one or more sensor-derived data variables. If applying a divide-by-five function, for example, to accelerometer-based pivot data, then a virtual camera could angle the contents of the screen by 1\u00b0 for every 5\u00b0 of device pivot instead of simply angling 5\u00b0 for every 5\u00b0 of device pivot. The numerical transform function need not be linear. Non-linear transforms and transforms that account for acceleration (e.g. relative speed of change of one or more input variable(s)) generally result in more natural participant experiences. Dampening factors related to device movement sensitivity in relation to velocities of virtual camera movement in a VE are good candidates for being set and\/or calibrated, individually or en masse, by participants in a preferences panel.","To \u201camplify\u201d means to increase the displayed result of a device input. This can be accomplished by applying a numerical transform function to one or more sensor-derived data variables. If applying a multiply-by-five function, for example, to accelerometer-based pivot data, then a virtual camera could angle the contents of the screen by 5\u00b0 for every 1\u00b0 of device pivot instead of simply angling 1\u00b0 for every 1\u00b0 of device pivot. The numerical transform function need not be linear. Non-linear transforms and transforms that account for acceleration (e.g. relative speed of change of one or more input variable(s)) generally result in more natural participant experiences.","The term \u201cgestalt,\u201d when used in reference to a user experience or participant experience, describes a coordinated set of human-computer interactions and feedback mechanisms that is perceived by a participant as more than the sum of its constituent methods and apparatus(es).","The terms \u201cpivot down,\u201d \u201cpivoted down,\u201d \u201cpivot up,\u201d \u201cpivoted up,\u201d \u201cpivot left,\u201d \u201cpivoted left,\u201d \u201cpivot right,\u201d \u201cpivoted right,\u201d \u201ctip right,\u201d \u201ctipped right,\u201d \u201ctip left,\u201d \u201ctipped left,\u201d \u201caim left,\u201d \u201caimed left,\u201d \u201caim right,\u201d \u201caimed right,\u201d \u201cslide left,\u201d \u201cslide right,\u201d \u201cslide down,\u201d \u201cslide up,\u201d \u201cpull,\u201d \u201cpush\u201d and \u201cview lock\u201d are described below.","An age-old predicament in the field of human-computer interaction is that multi-dimensional virtual spaces (a.k.a. virtual environments, \u201cVEs\u201d) are far more difficult for people to navigate than the real world. The VE's navigational interface is an important factor because it dictates the type and scope of body-based feedback provided to a participant. The Association for Computing Machinery, Inc. (\u201cACM\u201d) research paper -(\u201cRuddle\u201d) provides an informative overview of historical research and theoretical foundations [Roy A. Ruddle, Ekaterina Volkova and Heinrich H. B\u00fclthoff, ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction, v.18 n.2, p.1-20, June 2011].","A particular design challenge arises when crafting natural interactions for systems in which participants are to be afforded control over both location and orientation in a VE. This is due to the fact that there are a limited number of ordinary gestures that translate to intuitive proprioceptive and vestibular relations between people, objects and the environment. Any control variables not readily mapped to natural body movements are therefore mapped to artificial user interfaces, such as joysticks, keyboards, multi-touch gestures and on-screen buttons and slider controls.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":"FIGS. 4A-5F"},"Virtual reality (\u201cVR\u201d) applications have demonstrated different sets of tools and interaction methods in association with different types of devices for traversing fictional and\/or simulated environments. While VEs on desktop computers provide almost no body-based information, head-mounted audio-visual displays (\u201cHMDs\u201d) replace the sights and sounds of the physical world with those of a virtual world. Movement of the participant's head rotations around the x-axis (looking up\/down), the y-axis (turning head left\/right) and the z-axis (cocking head left\/right)\u2014may be detected by the system and used as input to respectively influence the drawing of the elements of the virtual world on a visual display from the perspective of a virtual camera that tracks with the participant's eyes. The body's own kinesthetic awareness in motion furnishes proprioceptive and vestibular cues\u2014boosting the participant's navigational sense.","Participants' control of their apparent locomotion within the VE has been accomplished using physical locomotion (i.e. literally walking through physical space), hand gestures (e.g. pointing in a direction to move), as well as directional and omnidirectional treadmills. Treadmills enable a 1:1 translation of directional participant movement into virtual locomotion. This is advantageous because physically moving the body supports participants' formation of mental models of distances traversed in the VE. Such interaction techniques have been shown to improve the accuracy of participant cognitive\/spatial maps.","Ruddle reported on the effect of rotational vs. translational body-based information on participants' navigational performance (distance traveled) and cognitive mapping (direction and straight line distance estimates). Ruddle's research suggested that physical locomotion for spatial translation was not only more important than physical rotation in establishing participants' sense of where they are and where they have been in VEs, but that rotational body-based information had no effect on the accuracy of participants' cognitive maps over using a joystick. Ruddle teaches away from the invention disclosed herein by prioritizing physical locomotion over physical rotation.","Augmented reality (\u201cAR\u201d) applications have demonstrated sets of tools and interaction methods for bridging the physical and virtual worlds, overlaying fictional and\/or modeled objects and information elements over live views of the physical world. This has typically been accomplished by adding a real camera to the device, enabling the device to composite rendered objects into or over the scene captured by the real-world camera. On mobile phones and tablet computing devices so configured, the participant's movement of the device drives the display of content. As the viewfinder of a camera tracks with the location and orientation of the camera's lens, the displayed environment and augmented objects and information on the device may track with the movement of the handheld computing device.","Camera-based AR applications on handheld computing devices naturally rely upon sensing rotation around a device's y-axis (as in ) and rotation around the x-axis (as in ) for enabling participants to fully rotate the camera left, right, down and up. And because AR applications rely upon the physical environment as a framework, movement though the augmented space generally depends on a participant's physical location in real space (leveraging global positioning satellite (\u201cGPS\u201d) data and magnetometer sensors).  illustrate a participant moving a device backward and forward in physical space which could translate to moving backward and forward, respectively, in augmented space.","A related class of application are stargazing astronomy guides. Stargazing app interactions operate like AR app interactions, displaying labeled stars, constellations and satellites that correspond with the location (on Earth) and posture of the handheld device. Some stargazing apps operate in an AR mode, superimposing stellar information with a live camera feed from the device. Others forgo the camera feed to dedicate the entire visual display to stellar information. A participant located in Austin, Tex. sees representations of celestial objects in virtual space relative to their location in Austin. If, however, the participant desires to see the celestial objects as they would be seen from San Francisco, Calif., the participant would need to travel to San Francisco. This is impractical in the span of a single participant experience. Yet, the interaction mappings employed by AR applications seem to logically preclude virtual locomotion based on device posture. Since pivot up and down, for example, are used to look up and down in the sky, pivot up and down might logically preclude being mapped to locomotion backward and forward.","Physical locomotion can be impractical when using a virtual environment application on a handheld computing device\u2014especially when operated in a space physically smaller than the virtual dimensions of a VE. Imagine, for example, walking around your living room in order to travel isometrically through a virtual museum. Your very real furniture and walls would present obstacles almost certainly not correlated to the galleries, corridors and three-dimensional sculptures available to be explored in the VE. Thus, a challenge is to develop techniques for providing participants as much body-based (proprioceptive and vestibular) sensory information as possible in the context of non-physical-locomotion-based interfaces for successful path traversal and path integration (i.e. cognitive mapping of a space based on navigational movements).","First-person shooter (\u201cFPS\u201d) games have made use of a subset of VR techniques, modeling a virtual world for a participant to traverse while attempting to kill the inhabitants of said virtual world. The rendered world is generally drawn from the perspective of the eyes of the protagonist, with the protagonist's weapon portrayed at the bottom of the visual display. As with VR applications, the camera tracks with the facing and point-of-view of the protagonist. Screen real estate is a limiting factor in the design of controls for FPS games on handheld devices, thus solutions that avoid touchscreen interactions are advantageous.","A \u201crail shooter\u201d or \u201con-rail game\u201d is a similar type of game where participants cannot, however, control their direction of travel through the virtual environment\u2014as if the course is confined to a fixed rail. A limited set of choices promise a choose-your-own adventure story, but the participant can neither deviate from the course nor backtrack along the way. Thus, the experience commonly focuses on shooting. Point of view is first-person or from just behind the protagonist, with a phallocentric gaze looking down the barrel of a gun as in FPS games. The participant does not need to worry about movement and generally does not have control over the camera.","In less-restrictive games, a participant may be afforded freedom to control both the location of a protagonist in space and the orientation of the protagonist's view. In such instances, the computer modifies both the coordinates and facing of the virtual camera in the virtual space to render the scene on the visual display. On handheld computing devices, motion sensors have been used to enable participants to aim weapons and simultaneously adjust the viewing orientation in the space. Movement through the virtual space, however, has generally been limited to on-screen directional controls.","Driving games on handheld devices have been designed to simulate driving real cars in a VE, providing both a physical interface for rotation and techniques for virtual locomotion not based on physical movement. Such games often use accelerometer and\/or gyro sensors to detect rotation of a device around the z-axis (i.e. like an automobile steering wheel as in ) for steering a virtual racecar. But despite the direct and seemingly obvious analogy to steering a real automobile, the present inventors have observed participants attempting to steer a virtual racecar in a racing game by swinging the device left or right around their own bodies. This performance error seems surprising, especially on the part of skilled drivers. While unsolicited, such reflex behaviors hint at the intelligence of body rotation as an actuator for rotation in more \u201cintuitive\u201d VEs.","SEGA Corporation's Super Monkey Ball 2: Sakura Edition is an example of a sensor-based navigation game that runs on Apple iPhone and iPad devices (collectively \u201ciOS devices\u201d) [available at the time of writing in the Apple iTunes app store via http:\/\/www.sega.com\/games\/super-monkey-ball-2-sakura-edition\/]. A participant controls the movement of an animated monkey sprite enclosed in a translucent ball (a \u201cmonkey ball\u201d) through a series of mazes in a VE by pivoting the device simultaneously around two axes. Pivoting up (i.e. rotating the device around its x-axis as in ) causes the monkey ball to roll forward; and the velocity of the monkey ball is related to the degree of pivot down from an origin. Pivoting down (i.e. rotating the device around its x-axis as in ) while the monkey ball is rolling forward causes the monkey ball to slow down. Pivoting down while the monkey ball is stationary causes it to turn around and face in the opposite direction. Pivoting right (i.e. rotating the device around its y-axis as in ) causes the monkey ball to rotate right; and pivoting left (i.e. rotating the device around its y-axis as in ) causes the monkey ball to rotate left.","Exemplary patent documents material to the consideration of sensor-based human interfaces for virtual space and video navigation on handheld devices include, but are not limited to U.S. Pat.

Furthermore, these citations are not to be construed as a representation that a search has been made or that additional information may or may not exist that is material or that any of the items listed constitute prior art.","Motosyuku teaches scrolling a two-dimensional document on a display screen in accordance with pivot of a device. Rotation around the device's x-axis (as in ) causes the document to scroll up or down. Rotation around the device's y-axis (as in ) causes the document to scroll right or left.","Austreng teaches a method of storing and retrieving a series of two-dimensional images of a three-dimensional object taken along different viewing angles. In response to directional input, varying two-dimensional images are displayed, thereby creating the appearance of three-dimensional rotation of the displayed object. Austreng mentions in passing that \u201cit is to be understood that the invention can be used with other digital data, such as digitized video,\u201d but it is unclear how said rotation simulation teachings could relate to video.","Lands teaches a modal use of device pivot to control operations selected from a group consisting of document paging, document zoom, device volume control and device brightness control. Sensor(s) are configured to measure changes in rotation of the device around the device's x-axis (as in ) or around the device's y-axis (as in ). Variables are changed by an amount proportional to the change in pivot of the device relative to a reference pivot.","Lapidot teaches a modal use of device movement to control selection of one of multiple options, to control panning within a document or to control zoom within a document (i.e. changing the resolution of a displayed image or the size of displayed text or picture). Lapidot teaches sensing movement of the device along the x-axis (as in ), along the y-axis (as in ) and along the z-axis (as in ) using either accelerometers or a camera mounted on the device. Lapidot also teaches ignoring movements measuring below a pre-defined threshold value, and relating the rate of change of control variables with the speed or acceleration of the movement of the device.","Mosttov teaches gesture recognition techniques for a handheld device, discriminating between and prioritizing interpretation of inertial sensor data according to a hierarchy of classes of gestures. One or more discriminators is configured to recognize a specific class of gestures and each discriminator is associated with an interpreter that identifies specific gestures in the class. In one embodiment, if a discriminator detects linear or planar motion, then motion data is transferred to a planer gesture recognizer. But if no linear or planar motion is detected, then motion data may be transferred to a pivot gesture recognizer that determines the direction and degree of pivot of the device.","Gaskell teaches interaction techniques for simultaneously zooming and scrolling a two-dimensional image on a handheld device. The image is enlarged when the device, held parallel to the ground in a horizontal posture, is moved down (i.e. along the device's z-axis (as in ) perpendicular to the ground); and reduced in size or resolution when the device is moved up (as in ). The image is scrolled in any of four directions when the device is pivoted around the device's x-axis (as in ) or y-axis (as in ). The direction of scrolling corresponds to the direction of pivot, and the speed(s) of effect(s) are responsive to the speed(s) of movement of the device. Gaskell also makes a passing remark about \u201caltering the apparent nature of the horizontal \u2018dead band\u2019 in which the moving stops\u201d without further elaboration; and it is unclear what is meant.","Nie teaches techniques for creation of a three-dimensional VE scene containing layers of two-dimensional sprite objects that are displayed in such a way as to appear three-dimensional. Visual representations of each object corresponding to different orientations are assembled from a series of still images, animations or video clips to give each two-dimensional object three-dimensional characteristics. The source content for each sprite can be a single bitmap, a bitmap image sequence, a vector image, a video track, a live stream or a source specified by a universal resource locator (\u201cURL\u201d). Nie is clear that object movies are \u201cnot truly movies\u201d and \u201cnot truly 3D.\u201d","Nie also teaches manipulation of the VE scene using desktop-computing interaction techniques (e.g. mouse movement, mouse clicking and keyboard input)\u2014to effectuate rotating, panning, pivoting and zooming of objects and\/or scenes using three-dimensional data translation vectors and rotation matrices. In this context, Nie teaches associating audio with scenes and objects, such that a soundtrack plays upon participant selection of an object. When the location of an object in the VE is changed, the three-dimensional location of the audio associated with the object may also be changed.","van Os teaches techniques for simultaneously displaying multiple video panes of videoconference streams in a single user interface designed to simulate a three-dimensional VE without the need for participant navigation or manipulation of said simulated VE. Apple first distributed this feature in the application iChat as part of Mac OS X v10.4 (a.k.a. Tiger). One participant hosts a group videoconference with up to three other participants, and everyone in the videoconference sees and hears the other participants. Video panes are displayed with orthographic projection relative to the participant so as to impart a sense of perspective. Side panes are angled inwardly towards a center location and foreground reflections are used to enhance the sense of presence of the participants, as if they are seated around a table. Animation is used to transition between events when participants enter and leave a videoconference; sliding video panes on or off screen. Otherwise, the video panes and the virtual camera remain in fixed locations.","Wehrenberg teaches techniques for performing a variety of functions in response to accelerometer-detected movement and orientation of a handheld device without a participant having to press and\/or click buttons. Exemplary functions include reorienting a displayed document, triggering display of a page of a document, navigating an object or document that normally cannot be displayed entirely at once within the visual display of the device, activating\/deactivating a device, motion compensation, impulse detection for controlled momentum transfer and other applications based on an accelerometer. With regards to navigating an image, Wehrenberg teaches zooming out in response to a participant pivoting the device up and zooming in when pivoting down.","In gaming contexts, Wehrenberg teaches holding and turning a device like a steering wheel; accelerating a vehicle when pivoting the device up and decelerating when pivoting down; aiming an airplane in a flying game up and down when pivoting up and down; and using pivot to look up, down and\/or around. With regards to a VE, Wehrenberg teaches using a handheld device as a \u201cwindow into a virtual reality image database. For example, a user holding the tablet can turn around and see the view looking backward from a position in a two or three dimensional image or object database as if the user walks into a virtual reality game space.\u201d That said, the present inventors do not believe such an interaction can be accomplished reliably, if at all, using the Wehrenberg taught accelerometer-based techniques due in part to the fact that accelerometers do not separate gravitational and inertial forces.","Cook explains another problem with Wehrenberg's enablement-lacking comment about looking backward: \u201caccelerometers suffer from an inability to detect rotation around the force vector. So, for example, a motion application that depended on measuring rotation of a stationary device around the device's Y axis would work quite well when the device is horizontal, would become less accurate as the angle between the Y axis and the horizontal plane increases, and would become unpredictable as the Y axis becomes aligned vertically with the gravity vector.\u201d To address this problem, Cook uses camera data to help detect changes in orientation.","Cook teaches interaction techniques for circumscribing a virtual object using a handheld device. Pivoting the device (i.e. rotating around the device's x-axis or y-axis, as in ) controls the angle of view of the image and moving the device perpendicular to the screen (as in ) controls the magnification. The result is analogous to orbiting around a real object in the physical world with a camera while looking through the camera's viewfinder. Yet in Cook's case, the visual display shows a virtual object that may not exist in the physical world. When the user moves the device, the view on the display moves; and when the user pivots the device, either the view pivots so that the image is displayed at an angle related to the pivot angle or the image scrolls in the direction of the pivot. A maximum pivot viewing threshold angle may be used to prevent from pivoting past a certain angle and to switch between control modes, such as between pivoting the view and scrolling the view. Cook teaches that pivot angle may be mapped to velocity using a linear, exponential or geometric equation and that \u201cit may be useful to have the viewing angle change more or less than the [pivot] angle depending on usability factors.\u201d Cook also teaches techniques for centering the virtual camera view on a desired center-point of an image, bringing the line of sight perpendicular to that point on the image\u2014using a motion of the device, a button push, a screen tap and\/or a voice command.","Piemonte teaches use of orientation data from one or more sensors to navigate a three-dimensional perspective projection without a participant touching the visual display. As the participant pivots the device left or right around its y-axis (as in ), the virtual camera view is turned left or right to reveal the left or right sides of a three-dimensional user interface VE, respectively. As the participant pivots the device down or up around its x-axis (as in ), the virtual camera view is angled down or up to reveal the floor or ceiling of the VE, respectively. Angular rotation \u201ccan be measured or estimated from data provided by gyro sensors, accelerometers, magnetometers or any combination of sensor data that can provide an estimate of the orientation of mobile device relative to a reference axis of rotation.\u201d Piemonte also teaches constraining and scaling sensor data so that small rotations cause small virtual camera view changes while large rotations or motions (such as shaking the device) result in a \u201csnap-to\u201d jump of the virtual camera view to a predetermined orientation.","Today's most popular and widespread handheld computing devices, Apple's family of iOS devices, employ an assortment of sensors (including magnetometers, gyroscopes and accelerometers) for participant input and\/or feedback. One problem confronting designers is that there are a limited number of dimensions of control and a myriad of independently taught discretely applied mapping options. The prior art teaches techniques for orbiting virtual objects, for panning and zooming documents, for controlling virtual vehicles and for navigating VEs that are generally personal scale and\/or single vista. None alone or in combination teach or provide motivation for navigating an architectural scale manifold vista VE on a handheld device. Many combinations of the taught techniques would be incompatible or require sensor-use mode switching by the participant. Other combinations would be problematic because, in part, they would require extraordinarily impractical physical locomotion. In contrast, a more natural system would enable a participant to stand in a single physical location while changing orientation and traversing a VE using device sensors for virtual locomotion and providing proprioceptive feedback.","From a purely mathematical standpoint, many combinations of previously taught techniques for mapping sensor data are possible. But when it comes to human factors, getting the user experience right is rarely obvious. The sheer number of sensor-to-result interaction mappings available to designers makes appropriate combinatorial solutions even less evident, especially if there is an interest to spare participants from dealing with hardware buttons, software user interface elements or touch screens. None of the prior art, alone or in combination, provides motivation or guidance to a person skilled in the art for simultaneously mapping multiple dimensions of sensor data to interaction results for the successful creation of a navigable virtual environment, no less one containing a plurality of simultaneously playing videos, on a handheld device.","Another design problem is that there are more variables to be controlled than there are vectors of sensor data. For example, if rotation of a device around a device's y-axis is mapped to rotating the orientation of a virtual camera left and right, then the same maneuvers cannot reasonably be used to scroll a document or pan left and right in a VE; and vice-versa. If rotation of the device around its x-axis is mapped to rotating the orientation of a virtual camera up and down, then the same maneuvers cannot reasonably be used to zoom in or out on a document or move forward or backward in a VE; and vice-versa. And if rotation of the device around its z-axis is mapped to pivoting the virtual camera clockwise and counterclockwise, then the same interactions cannot reasonably be used to steer; and vice-versa. Every sensor\/result interaction mapping choice precludes a direct mapping of the same sensor to a different result, and it is not obvious (a) which device sensor data set logically maps to which interaction result and (b) which mappings are compatible with one another for simultaneous utilization in a gestalt participant experience.","The experience designer, thus, needs to craft and resolve (i.e. invent): (1) a viable collection of sensor\/result interaction mappings, (2) techniques for overloading sensor data utilization to obtain multiple feedback results from common data and (3) appropriate thresholds, damping rules, and other interpretation algorithms to accomplish a successful user experience. A person of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate the interplay of design creativity, trial and error prototyping, and real-world usability testing required to achieve a combination that works intuitively and effortlessly for a general audience of participants diverse in factors such as age, gender, reflex responses, spatial sensibility, patience, self-confidence, VE navigation experience and competency with electronic devices.","Cinema and digital media have much to glean from architecture and place-making traditions. Places are structures of communication and collective memory. A place is an organization, and memory is often an articulation of space. The \u201cMethod of Loci\u201d practiced by ancient Greek and Roman orators, for example, was a mnemonic technique that relied upon architectural recall for the extemporaneous recitation of epic poetry or lengthy discourses stored in memory [Frances Yates, , University of Chicago, 1966]. The present invention is motivated to create a cinematic language of proprioceptive and peripatetic perception that yields new ways of experiencing the world around us\u2014merging cinematic structure with architectural space in order to leverage formal and experiential principles inherent in the definitions of place.","Using audio spatialization techniques, the acoustic dimension of an embodiment of this invention is a kind of virtual walkabout sonic sculpture whose characteristics change to reflect and emphasize spatial qualities and treatments associated with the different video components, as well as the attention states of audients. To this end, distinct keynotes, signals, soundmarks and sonic treatments are mapped to spatial locations and temporal locations (i.e. points in or spans of time) in the VE. The collection of sonic treatments extends the vocabulary, in sound-for-film terms, of backgrounds, environmental and perspective shifts, interruptions and delays in time, subjective point of view (\u201cPOV\u201d) sequences and spatial montage. Musical elements and metaphysical sounds moreover arise in a theater of the mind whose outlines emerge as participants learn to suspend disbelief within this new image sound field.","In a topographic meander, the visitor becomes aware of localized sonic regions in the process of traversing the VE. Although occurring in the vicinity of image-sound streams that a participant can see, these off-screen sound sources may remain invisible and spatially discrete. Additional sounds (such as those that issue from virtually passing motor vehicles, birds in flight, a gust of wind, the torrent of a river, or a flute player's melody carried by a tease of breeze) literally travel through the VE, with potential Doppler effects.","Departing from one-way linear cinema played on a single rectangular screen, this multi-channel virtual environment involves a cinematic paradigm that undoes habitual ways of framing things, employing architectural concepts in a polylinear video sound construction to create a kind of motion picture that lets the world reveal itself and permits discovery on the part of participants. Supporting such experiences via handheld device requires easy and comfortable techniques for peripatetic navigation through virtual space that provide sufficient navigational feedback regarding said virtual space to a participant, that leverage the participant's human spatial memory to form a proprioceptive sense of location in space, that make it easy for participants to navigate amongst a plurality of simultaneously playing videos, that make it easy for participants to center their view in front of individual video panes in said space, that make it comfortable for participants to rest in a fixed posture and orientation while selectively viewing one or another of the video streams, and that provide spatialized 3D audio cues that invite participant awareness of other content unfolding simultaneously in the virtual environment.","Polylinear video affords a language that is more akin to architecture than storytelling for capturing and articulating a kind of experience that belongs to many different dimensions. This invention supports approaches to cinematic construction that employ ambulatory, multiple and simultaneous viewpoints\u2014such as humans exercise when orienting ourselves in physical space. Responsive elements in this peripatetic cinemascape are intended for the purpose of making people conscious of their own perceptual meanders, trajectories and drifts of attention.","This invention involves a novel and non-obvious combination of input sensor data mappings that effectuate human-computer interactions readily understood and performed by participants in order to accomplish both navigation and orientation in virtual space using a handheld computing device. Another aspect of this invention pertains to the simultaneous production of a plurality of spatially distributed motion-picture videos through the visual display of a handheld computing device. Another aspect of this invention pertains to the spatialization of a plurality of soundtracks associated with a plurality of motion-picture videos for auditory display via a handheld computing device.","Like reference numerals in the various drawings indicate like elements.

For skilled 3D navigators, however, enabling movement along both axes simultaneously can provide more interaction control.","In a preferred embodiment, velocity of virtual camera movement to the left is related to tip left in the following manner using the following equations. First, data about the device's z-axis rotation posture is compared against an origin to determine whether the device is tipped left\u2014by subtracting an origin from the raw z-axisometer data to determine relative tip left (if any). Second, if the relative tip left is greater than a maximum tip left of 50\u00b0 then the relative tip left is set to 50\u00b0. Third, the relative tip left is compared against a neutral zone threshold. If the relative tip left is greater than the threshold, then the threshold is subtracted from the relative tip left to determine active tip left. The active tip left value is multiplied by (\u2212cos(((v-axisometer data)+90.0)\/180.0*Pi)) to determine a basis of travel along one vector of the floor of the VE; and the active tip left value is multiplied by (\u2212sin (((v-axisometer data)+90.0)\/180.0*Pi)) to determine a basis of travel along the other vector of the floor of the VE. These bases of travel are normalized for consistency across devices with varying processor speeds, divided by a dampening factor of 120 and then added to each of the current location point variables. If the newly calculated location is outside the bounds of the VE, then the new location is set inside the bounds of the VE.","Thus, in such an embodiment, the virtual camera moves left proportionally faster as the device is tipped left farther from the origin. In other preferred embodiments, the virtual camera moves left at a fixed rate regardless of degree of tip left. In other preferred embodiments, the leftward movement of the virtual camera is speed limited. A variety of equations may be used to translate tip left data into virtual camera leftward movement including but not limited to linear, exponential, geometric and other curved functions.","In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the above described interaction mappings are combined to result in a coherent gestalt user experience. An example interaction sequence based on the VE model illustrated in  using device  might occur as follows. Start by standing in the northwest corner of the VE close to the soccer game playing in video pane , as illustrated in . Pivot up to walk backward (south) through  to arrive at the state illustrated in . Aim right to change the orientation of the virtual camera through  to rest in the state illustrated in , revealing the active videoconference stream in video pane  and the playing bird documentary in video pane  to the northeast and east, respectively. Now, as illustrated in , game action emanating from virtual speakers  and  is only audible from the left audio display  and\/or . To view said game action, aim left through  to rest at the state illustrated by . Finally, tip right to relocate the virtual camera eastward through  to arrive at the state illustrated in . The virtual camera is now located in the southeast region of the VE and the videoconference stream video pane is centered on the visual display. The soccer match is now audible to the left and the birds are now audible to the right.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0223","num":"0222"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["130","131","133","132","134","135","136","137","133","134","132","131","136","132"]},"Video panes and virtual speakers may appear, disappear, change size or shape, or change location in space at temporal locations predetermined before a given participant experience or at temporal locations determined in part or in whole on the fly.","When a video pane is visible from more than one side, the video pane's content may be automatically flipped around the video pane's y-axis when viewed from the backside of the video pane to maintain the content's original facing. This approach would be critical in the event that words, such as subtitles, are part of the video content. Alternately, video content may be produced in reverse from the backside of the video pane.","Video panes may be opaque to other video panes and objects in the VE, or may be transparent. In one preferred embodiment, video panes are produced at 75% opacity, hinting at detail necessary for navigating a manifold vista VE without compromising the experience of the video content.","Whether transparent or not, participants may be permitted to walk directly through video panes or be blocked from such passage. If permitted to pass through video panes, audio feedback and\/or video effects may assist in participant comprehension of such transaction. Video panes and other objects in the VE may optionally be used as portals that bridge non-neighboring regions of the VE\u2014enabling a participant to travel, for example, directly from a pane located in the northwest region of a VE to a pane located in the southeast region of the VE. Portal interactions may also be used for traversing hyperlinks or for entry into and exit from a VE.","It should be understood that characteristics of, transformations of, and interactions with video panes in a VE may be generalized to other content forms including but not limited to still images, text documents, web pages, maps, graphs and 3D objects.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0229","num":"0228"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIGS. 1-12"],"b":"200"},"From a participant interaction perspective, the device can include one or more visual display(s)  coupled with one or more visual display controller(s) , one or more auditory display(s)  coupled with one or more auditory display controller(s) , and one or more tactile display(s)  coupled with one or more tactile display controller(s) .

Rather than mouse-clicking or finger-tapping on a visual display interface to move from virtual camera location to virtual camera location, the present invention enables participants to more easily navigate the map environment and experience the captured streets (or other spaces) with proprioceptive perspective.","Extemporaneous control of remote objects can be made more natural using the invention, enabling a participant to pivot, tip and aim a handheld or head mounted device to control a remote-controlled toy or full-sized military tank, for example. If the vehicle is outfitted with a camera, then the participant may see the remote location from first-person proprioceptive perspective.","A frequently expressed need in the domain of videoconferencing involves effective techniques for spatializing and navigating amongst attendee video panes and related document content. The present invention can overturn the rigid seating arrangements and unwieldy display limitations of current-day multi-party videoconferencing systems in favor of a portable experience that uses intuitive and comfortable interactions.","Other social media, such as a navigable VE-based telepresence event may be transformed by adding peripatetic proprioceptive interactions, complete with soundscape cocktail party effects.
