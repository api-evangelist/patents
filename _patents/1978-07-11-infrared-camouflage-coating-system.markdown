{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalty thereon.","This invention relates to a countermeasure system for protecting jet aircraft and missiles from detection by missile and ground-base infrared detection systems. More particularly, this invention contains itself with a high temperature, low emittance, camouflage coating system which, when applied to the strategic surfaces of aircraft jet engines and missile components, will effectively reduce their level of emitted energy and render them undetectable by missile and ground base detection systems.","Tactical aircraft are prime targets for a variety of infrared seeking missiles and other infrared detection devices. While cruising at altitude or during a low level attack, they are especially vulnerable to air launched missiles such as the Sidewinder or Falcon. In a close support mission, ground launched missiles, like Redeye, provide a very effective defense. The very low cost, ease of operation and the extremely high reliability of these IR missiles make them a threat in all categories of war where tactical aircraft are used.","The feasibility of using low emissivity coatings to suppress the infrared signature of external jet engine components has been demonstrated. The demonstration showed that a low emissivity coating on an external nozzle plug reduced the IR signature for that component significantly. It has been suggested that further suppression can be realized by controlling surface emissivities of internal exhaust system components. For application to advanced jet engines, and particularly for countermeasure purposes, a judicious selection of high and low emissivity coating surfaces on critical components is required to optimize the trade-off between emission and reflection.","The missile's capability to seek and destroy could be nullified if the intensity of engine radiation could be decreased in the missile detector's wavelength and bandwidth of response and the radiation emitted from the engine could be shifted to wavelengths outside of the response range of missile detectors. Ultimately, the reduction of the IR signature requires both the incorporation of efficient cooled exhaust system components and the development of optically, chemically, and mechanically stable emissive\/reflective surfaces for them. These must be applicable to existing as well as future turbojet or turbofan engines.","As a consequence, a considerable research effort has evolved in an attempt to develop countermeasures or camouflage materials which, when applied to the strategic surfaces of aircraft jet engines, will effectively reduce their level of emitted energy and render them undetectable by missile and ground-base detection systems. It is important that the dimunition be restricted as much as possible to the 1-6 micron wavelength region, and that the bulk of the radiation be allowed to propagate freely from the aircraft in the other wavelength regimes.","For application to advanced jet engines, and particularly for countermeasure purposes, a judicious selection of high and low emissivity surfaces on critical components is required to optimize the trade-off between emission and reflection. Also, the air-breathing environment limits the utility of coatings previously acceptable for thermal control of space oriented systems. The rigors a coating must endure to operate successfully in a jet engine environment include the influences of thermally induced stress, overtemperature, corrosion, foreign object impact, and the metallurgical instability of coatings. These factors have provided a deterring influence on the use of prior art systems.","In furtherance of the research effort referred to above, and in an attempt to provide a system for preventing infrared detection, it was found that a composite, low emissivity coating system composed of a diffusion barrier coating, a reflective metal coating and a protective overlay coating could be applied to the metal surfaces of jet engine components. The application of the composite coating of this invention to the surfaces of the engine components effectively reduces their level of emitted energy thereby rendering them undetectable by infrared detection systems.","In accordance with this invention, it has been discovered that a novel composite coating system, when applied to the strategic surfaces of jet engine components, can effectively reduce the level of emitted energy in the 1 to 6 micron wavelength range while, at the same time, allow the bulk of radiation to radiate freely from the aircraft in the other wavelength ranges. The low emittance coating system is applied to the metal surfaces of jet engine components as a multilayer coating. Generally, the engine components are composed of ferritic or nickel base alloys. The first layer of the system is applied to the alloy substrate surfaces as a stable, metal diffusion barrier of nickel aluminide. The diffusion barrier is applied by a pack cementation process, commonly referred to as the CODEP process, a proprietary process of the General Electric Company and more fully described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,668,985.","The second part of the composite coating system is a reflective silver metal layer which is deposited onto the diffusion barrier by conventional liquid metal techniques. The liquid metal consists of silver and silver-organic compounds dispersed within a volatile combination of oils in essentially paint forms. For this invention, a Degussa #242GEII liquid silver containing lead borogermanate as a flux was formulated in order to provide a specific example of the liquid silver metal suitable for use with the invention. However, other reflective liquid silver compositions could be utilized also. The liquid silver was applied by brushing onto the diffusion barrier then dried and fired at 1300\u00b0 F. by a programmed heating cycle.","The third component of the coating system comprised a protective glass-ceramic overlay which was applied to the silver reflective layer. The glass-ceramic formulation is essentially an amorphous combination containing germanium oxide, lithium oxide, potassium oxide, aluminum oxide, phosphorous pentoxide and abietic acid. This layer possesses excellent transmissivity in the 1-6 region. The components of the glass-ceramic were ground, suspended in a non-aqueous medium and then sprayed on the silvered layer by using conventional state-of-the-art techniques of ceramic enamelling. After firing by normal methods, a post heat treatment cycle was used to effect conversion of the glass by recrystallization to the desirable glass-ceramic form.","The novel composite coating combination of this invention uniquely gives emittance values on the order of 0.2 or less in the important 1-6 micron wavelength region. Except for unusually prolonged high temperature or unrealistic exposures, the coating system was stable and responded excellently to both static and dynamic tests.","Accordingly the primary object of this invention is to develop a stable coating system which, when applied to the strategic surfaces of jet engine components, will effectively reduce their level of emitted energy.","Another object of this invention is to provide a multilayer composite coating system that will effectively camouflage jet engine aircraft against detection from infrared missile and ground-base detection systems.","Still another object of this invention is to provide a low emittance, composite coating system for jet engine components that is composed of several strata of layers that give emittance values on the order of 0.2 or less in the 1-6 micron wavelength range while simultaneously allowing the bulk of radiation to propagate freely from the aircraft in the other wavelength regimes.","The above and still other objects and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent upon consideration of the following detailed disclosure thereof.","With the above-mentioned objects in mind, the present invention contemplates a novel, low emittance, composite coating system comprising a strata of layers for application to the surfaces of jet engine components. Usually the composite coating is applied to temperature resistant ferritic-base alloys such as 321 SS or temperature resistant nickel-base allows such as Rene' 41.","The coating systems is composed of a first layer applied to the surfaces of the alloy substrate and comprises a thin, metal, diffusion barrier of nickel aluminide applied by a conventional pack cementation process commonly referred to as the CODEP process. Superimposed on the diffusion barrier is a thin reflective film of silver metal with a final layer of about 2 mils of a germanium oxide containing glass-ceramic composition superimposed on the silver film. Within the confines of this mention, the diffusion barrier of nickel aluminide was about 1.2 to 1.4 mils thick. Essentially, the pack cementation process converts the surface of the alloy to an enriched nickel aluminide layer. This coating is intuitively bound with a diffusion layer of its own to the alloy substrate by a process requiring 1960\u00b0 F. Hence, the layer is continuously stable at the normal operating temperatures for jet engines. The CODEP process is a proprietary process of the General Electric Company. It was discovered that this coating prevented the diffusion of reflective metallic overlays into the substrate.","The reflective metal overlay consisted of silver metal deposited by conventional liquid metal techniques. The liquid metal consists of silver and silver-organic compounds dispersed within a volatile combination of oils in essentially paint form. The mix also contained a flux so that upon subsequent firing, adherence to metallic or ceramic bodies was obtained. For this invention, a special Degussa #242GEII liquid silver containing lead borogermanate as the flux was developed. The basic product is obtainable from Materials For Electronics, Inc., Jamaica, N.Y., as Degussa #242L which normally contains lead borosilicate. It was modified by substituting lead borogermanate. The substitution provided for improved emittance in the 1 to 6 micron region. The liquid silver was brushed onto the CODEP coated metal, then dried and fired at 1300\u00b0 F. by a programmed heating cycle. The result was a coating that adhered to the CODEP without diffusing into it and one that had excellent reflective properties per se. Since the silver layer also contained the flux, adherence of this noble metal to the thick glass-ceramic protective overlay was found to be effective.","The third component of the coating system comprised a protective overlay of an amorphous germanium oxide-containing glass formulation with abietic acid to keep the glass in reduced form. Approximately, 2 mils of overlay have been found to be effective.","The alloys chosen as substrates for the coating composite of this invention exhibit significant mechanical properties at elevated temperatures. Sufficient design data, performance experience, and metallurgical knowledge exist concerning these alloys. In addition, 321 SS and Rene' 41 are representative of classes of alloys to assure that the coating\/base metal data generated for them have applicability to similar compositions. While the requirements for the component material are diverse, a simple coating may be suitable for more than one engine component providing it satisfies the most severe requirements of them.","It is also important to recognize that the coatings of this invention are directed at the final metallurgical form of the substrates to which \u201cattachment\u201d is contemplated. \u201cAs-received\u201d material must, in general, be properly heat treated. The subsequent chemical surface treatment and coating applications are then more realistic.","For the coating applications of this invention, the following treatments were performed. All panels were heated as noted. In the first pretreatment heat procedure, Rene' 41 was heated at 1975\u00b0 F. for 30 minutes plus 1400\u00b0 F. for four hours. Complicated structures are first stabilized in temperature at 1200\u00b0 F. and then transferred to another furnace which is superheated at about 2100\u00b0 F. This allows the component to rise in temperature as rapidly as possible through the 1200-1850\u00b0 F. range. The furnace control is then adjusted to prevent the temperature of the parts from rising above 1975\u00b0 F. They are held at temperature for 30 minutes and then furnace cooled to about 500\u00b0 F. to prevent thermal gradients which lead to cracking. The parts are then taken up to 1400\u00b0 F. in a single furnace and held for 16 hours.","An alternative heat treatment maybe utilized in which the base alloy is heated to 2050\u00b0 F. for 30 minutes plus 1600\u00b0 F. for four hours. The same follow on treatment as in the above heat treatment method is employed.","The 321 SS alloy substrate is annealed at 1825\u00b0 F.\u00b125\u00b0 F. followed by an air cool as the conventional heat treatment. Thin dielectric films or intermetallic films have been used as successful barriers to the diffusion of certain noble metals, such as gold. The alloying elements in the substrate diffuse into the noble metals at elevated temperatures. The applications, in general, have been limited to space environment use. However, the oxide-type barriers previously used do not have the necessary thickness to prevent diffusion nor have the mechanical integrity under thermal cycling conditions encountered within the operational environment of jet engines.","The diffusion barriers considered ideal are those which themselves are first diffusion bonded to the substrate metal. These may be metals or intermetallic compounds, each of which are electrically conductive and allow for the superimposition of other metals, which can in turn be diffusion bonded.","Extensive development has been carried out in an attempt to provide a barrier system that would prove to be an effective component in a multilayer or multicomponent countermeasure system. Previous work has shown that pack cementation methods for producing coatings containing nickel and aluminum led to not only corrosion resistant surfaces but those whose mechanical properties did not adversely affect the substrate. More important for this invention was the indication that coated parts could be joined by high temperature noble metal-containing brazes without penetration of the coating above 1900\u00b0 F. The investigations culminated in the development of a pack cementation process for the application of a so-called CODEP series of coatings for both nickel and cobalt-base alloys. The CODEP coatings are based primarily on aluminum deposition by a halogen carrier to form the inter-metallic compounds, NiAl and NiAl, in the coatings. Chromium, molybdenum, and cobalt are found in the coating if these elements are present in the base metal.","The coating is produced in a pack mixture consisting of a Ti\u2014Al\u2014C alloy powder, an AlOfiller, and an NHCl activator. The process consists of packing the alloy metal with the above mixed reagents, heating to a specified temperature, with or without a hold at that temperature, and then cooling. The result is a surface conversion consisting of a distinct outer coating layer and a prominent diffusion zone. It is this combination which acts as a diffusion barrier to the reflective metal layer which forms the second layer of the composite coating system of this invention. The CODEP technique is a proprietary process of the General Electric Company and is more fully described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,667,985. In order to test the effectiveness of the CODEP coating, as applied to this invention, three separate runs were made on a conventionally electropolished Rene'41 and 321 SS panels (1\u00d74\u00d70.060 inch). These are tabulated in Table I. The table also records the micrometallographic mount numbers and thickness measurements after heat treatments chosen to realistically simulate upper temperature limitations in engine runs. Since the diffusion barrier coating will not \u201csee\u201d a normal oxidizing environment, the CODEP coated Rene' 41 and 321 SS panels (1\u00d74\u00d70.060 inch) were heated in a Brew vacuum furnace at 10 torr for 150 hours at 1200\u00b0 F. A separate set of coated panels were heated similarly for 50 hours at 1500\u00b0 F. The analytical results suggest a stable system under the operating conditions expected. In lieu of an electropolishing treatment for the surfaces of the alloy substrates a conventional vapor blasting treatment may be employed, if desired.","The Applied Research Laboratory EMX Electron Microprobe Analyzer was used to characterize compositional changes in the CODEP coating after the separate life testing at 1200\u00b0 F.\/150 hrs in vacuum and 1500\u00b0 F.\/50 hrs vacuum, respectively. The sample mounts from metallographical examination were used at 45\u00b0 to the 1 micrometer beam in the 10torr system.","A step scanner which types out counts\/second was used at 5 distances between recordings. For a typical example, the Rene'41 \u201cas received\u201d read-out is shown in Table II. The continuous gradation of aluminum from the outer layer inwards is noticeable. On the other hand, the nickel content on the outer layer assumes that of the substrate while dimishing in the diffusion zone. Typical analyses of Rene'41 show 55% Ni and 1.5% Al. The uncorrected values given in Table II and Table III for the matrix simulate the parent alloy composition. In Table II, the average readings of the matrix is 0005465. This value multiplied by 100 and divided by the average value of the nickel standard 0009556 equals 57.2%.","From Table III the excellent stability of the coating can be inferred from the practical constancy of the nickel and aluminum values. The 321SS (CODEPPED for the first time) indicates that the bulk of the diffusion zone (except after 50 hrs\/1500\u00b0 F.) is neither nickel nor aluminum.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"343pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE

This glass contained germania as a direct substitute for silica so as to yield favorable transmittancy at 6 microns instead of 5 microns. It was presumed that the normal fluxing agent, common to the usual liquid metal preparations, namely lead borosilicate, might contribute slightly to earlier cut-off than 6 microns. To this end an investigation followed to determine whether the substitution of silica by germania would be advantageous emittance-wise or even decrease the solubility of silver in the glasses. An apparent anomaly exists in that the reflective metal (silver, or for that matter aluminum, copper, or gold) must react somewhat with the overlay to give adherence yet at the same time occur at a very slow rate so that the dissolution does not opacify the interface in the 1-6 microns wavelength region.","For substitute preparations, three germanium-bearing compounds were used in place of the lead Borosilicate Flux present in the Degussa #242L liquid silver.

overlays on CODEPPED Rene'41 coated with the four Degussa silver preparations. As before, tests at elevated temperatures were made, that is to say, air oxidation at 500\u00b0 F. for 250 hours and another set at 1000\u00b0 F. for 150 hours. The results are given in Table VII. The data re-emphasizes the utility of #242 GEII over its silica-bearing #242L counterpart.","This position of the work coupled with the method of keeping the glass in a reduced form is considered very significant for the design of a low emittance coating system. Table VIII shows some rather remarkable results obtained in the important 1-7 micron region. The glass overlay was applied to the substrate in accordance with the following procedure.","An optimized spray mix of #1877 glass was prepared with enough \u2212100 mesh glass #1877 and acetate-cellulose solution to fill a spray gun container. It was mixed together in a glass jar and rolled on a ball mill rack. The ratio of glass to liquid was determined by the specific gravity desired. All work done in this study was with a slip having a specific gravity of 1.033 to 1.32. The ratio of glass to liquid was:\n\n","From a consideration of the foregoing, it can be seen that the present invention provides a novel system for protecting jet aircraft against detection by missile and ground-base infrared detection systems. The unique combination of coatings gives emittance values in the order of 0.2 or less in the important 1 to 6 micron wavelength region.","While the principles of the present invention have been described with particularity, it should be understood that various alterations and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit of the invention, the scope of which is defined by the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
