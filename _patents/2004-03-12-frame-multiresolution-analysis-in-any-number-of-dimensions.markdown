No. 60\/453,889 filed 12 Mar. 2003.","Subject matter disclosed herein was supported in part through the following Governmental grants: NSF-DMS 0070376, NSF Career Award CISE-9985482, NSF-CHE-0074311, and is therefore subject to certain Governmental rights and interests.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to the general field of digital signal processing.","More particularly, the present invention relates to multiresolution analysis for signals or data of any dimensionality using a non-separable, radial frame, multi-resolution analysis in multidimensions.","2. Description of the Related Art","Digital signal processing, and, in general, the manipulation of information of all types by digitization, is at the heart of the computer-based approach to a vast range of problems in science, engineering, technology, modern economics modeling, data storage and retrieval, etc. There exist many robust approaches for problems which are intrinsically one-dimensional, and the theory of how one systematically parses the information content into small, manageable \u201cchunks\u201d is well developed. The essential idea is that information can be characterized either in a \u201cphysical\u201d or \u201cmeasurement\u201d domain which, for example, we take to be the \u201ctime domain\u201d, or in a complementary, mathematical domain referred to as the \u201cFourier domain\u201d (which we shall refer to as the frequency domain). It is most useful if there are natural limitations on how much information in the measurement or time domain is required to characterize a given amount of information in the frequency domain.","In one-dimension (1-D), the best possible situation is when, e.g., only a finite range or \u201cband\u201d of data in the frequency domain is needed to characterize completely the underlying mathematical behavior. Such a situation is said to be \u201cband-limited\u201d and if one can capture, without any loss, all the frequency components contained in the band, the signal or phenomenon is exactly captured. Further, if the signal becomes \u201ccontaminated\u201d by extraneous signals with frequencies outside the band range, then these can be eliminated by sending the signal through a \u201cfilter\u201d that strains out everything except frequencies in the physical band range. This is accomplished mathematically simply by multiplying the signal (plus noise) by a function that is 1 for frequencies within the band-limit and 0 for all other frequencies. Such a filter is fundamental in all areas of signal processing and information analysis, and it is called \u201cideal filter\u201d of \u201cideal window\u201d.","The amazing fact is that when one must treat signals that are of higher dimension including the simplest case of (two dimensional (2-D) data), the only rigorous way that exists to create such an ideal window (and to shift or translate them to different frequency bands can be captured leading to a multiresolution) is by multiplying 1 -D ideal windows for each degree of freedom. Such products are said to be \u201cseparable\u201d and they are inefficient for studying data sets or signals for which there is not a natural separation of information content along orthogonal directions. It is expected that in the absence of knowledge of such a directional bias in the signal, the best approach would treat the data in the most isotropic manner possible.","Thus, there is a need in the art of signal processing for the construction of improved multi-resolution analysis techniques for extracting information from complex scientific signals, especially processing techniques that involve non-separable, radial frame, multi-resolution analysis in one or more dimensions.","The present invention provides a signal processing technique using a completely isotropic ideal filter, and then translating and dilating the filter to create a multiresolution analysis. The technique includes the following constructed components: 1) isotropic ideal windows or filters in any number of dimensions; 2) translations and dilations to create completely isotropic low pass filters, high pass filters and\/or filters that cover all frequencies and\/or frequency ranges important to any appropriate signal processing problem; 3) isotropic scaling functions with translations of the low pass scaling function; and 4) associated wavelets that can be used to resolve a multidimensional signal into various resolution levels, where the technique admits as many levels of multiresolution as desired, so that the high pass components can be further parsed into their own \u201crelative low pass\u201d and \u201crelative high pass\u201d components.","The present invention provides scaling functions, wavelets and various isotropic non-separable ideal windows or filters that are the components needed to construct completely isotropic, intrinsically non-separable low pass and high pass filters, scaling functions, and wavelets that also have the optimum localization of information in a time-frequency description.","The present invention provides an improved method to analyze signals, data, information, images as well as other items of any number of dimensions, both in terms of efficiency and complexity of problems that can be addressed. The present technique can be used to analysis: (a) data compression and storage for streaming video, seismic imaging, digital medical imaging of all types, etc.; (b) image and signal enhancement, denoising and analysis for medical imaging, seismic imaging, satellite imaging and surveillance, target acquisition, radar, sonar, pattern recognition and analysis, etc.; (c) volume rendering and segmentation, motion analysis, etc.; and (d) as a basis for digital algorithms for solving ordinary and partial differential equations in science, engineering, economics, and other disciplines.","The present invention further relates to a computer or computer readable storage medium having implemented thereon software corresponding to the signal processing techniques of this invention.","The inventors have found that a new class of frame multiresolution analysis can be used to construct ideal filters. There are no other such totally isotropic, multidimensional, and non-separable scaling and wavelet functions and low and high pass filters currently in existence. The present invention is unique. The first tests of the invention are directed to two dimensional (2D) images and data sets.","If one could pass a signal through a set of ideal, isotropic windows or filters, each window passing a different band of frequencies, this would decompose the signal into subsets of information\u2014we say the signal is resolved into a number of non-overlapping subsets and this is the basic idea behind \u201cmultiresolution analysis\u201d of signals or digital information.","We construct the new frame multiresolution analysis in any desired number of dimensions, whose core subspace is defined by the integer translations of a finite set of frame scaling functions, which have minimal support in the frequency domain. (The Fourier transform of the time domain scaling function is the characteristic function on a specific frequency range.)","The most apparent representative classes of prototypes filters are a Frame multi-resolutions defined by a single scaling frame function, whose Fourier transform is a characteristic or \u201cindicator\u201d function of a hyper sphere (i.e., a disk in two dimensions (2D), a sphere in three dimensions (3D), hypersphere in higher dimensions (nD)), centered at the origin of the coordinate system having radius \u00bd (so that 0<R<\u00bd). Since this scaling function has this form in the frequency domain, its associated low pass filter in the frequency domain will also be such a characteristic hypersphere (or \u201cball\u201d) D\/2 with radius \u00bc. A fundamental property of the obtained wavelets and filters is that they are the first ever, truly intrinsically non-separable wavelets and filters that can be realized in any number of dimensions.","Additionally, the Fourier transforms of the associated frame wavelets will be equal to the characteristic function of a \u201chyper-annulus\u201d (a difference of two disks D\/2 and D in 2D, a difference of two spheres D\/2 and D in 3D, a difference of two hyperspheres D\/2 and D in nD), modulated by a phase factor.","For the 2D case, we create up to four frame wavelets; each of these wavelets defines a high-pass filter, or a similar wavelet like form. In the time (or complementary) domain, both the scaling functions and the wavelets can be constructed as linear combinations of Bessel functions. These constructions are currently based on dyadic dilations, but other dilations are equally usable only affecting a shape of the low and high pass filters. For example, dilations induced by quincunx matrices yield low and high pass filters of the same structure.","A unique merit of our construction is that it leads to the definition and realization of low and high pass filters, which are intrinsically non-separable and isotropic to a degree that has never been achieved in the past and, which are, in fact, optimal. Our construction can be explicitly realized in any finite number of dimensions. The resulting scaling functions are interpolating in all cases.","The present invention can be implemented on any processing unit that is capable of executing instructions corresponding to the mathematical constructs and filters set forth in this application. Suitable processing units include, without limitation, analog processing units, digital processing units or mixtures or combinations thereof. These processing units are generally components of a computer of other device including a processing unit and peripherals capable of human interaction (keyboards and the like). Suitable computers include those manufacture and sold through out the industry based on chips from companies like Intel, Motorola, IBM, HP, Sun Microsystems, Cirex, AMD, or others and sold in computers manufactured and\/or sold by companies such as Dell, Apple, IBM, HP, Toshiba, Sony, or similar computers. The processing units and computers incorporating them are designed to execute software under the control of an operating system. Suitable operating systems include, without limitation, the WINDOWS operating systems from MicroSoft, the OS operating systems from Apple, the LINUX operating systems available from a variety of vendors, or other windowing operating systems. The techniques set forth in this application can be converted to software code in an number of convenient computer languages such as Fortran, C, C+, C++, or the like or newer programming languages geared to programming mathematical expressions.","Introduction and Preliminaries","Let H be a complex Hilbert space. A unitary system \u2009is a set of unitary operators acting on H which contains the identity operator I on H. Now, let D be a (dyadic) Dilation operator\n\n()()=2(2), ()\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nand Tbe a Translation operator defined by\n\n()()=(), (), k\u2208Z\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nWe refer to the unitary system :={DT: j\u2208Z, k\u2208Z} as an n-dimensional separable Affine system.\n","This system has been extensively used in wavelet analysis for the construction of separable wavelet bases. In fact, only a few non-separable wavelet bases have been constructed and all these examples were exclusively given in two dimensions. However, an important drawback of these families of wavelets is the absence of enough symmetry and differentiability and the absolute lack of isotropy. These examples were also given with respect to a small class of dilation operators and all of them are compactly supported in the time domain. Apparently the whole issue of designing wavelet bases in multidimensions still remains a mostly unexplored area, full of challenges and revealing interesting and surprising results.","The motivation for the present invention stems from the following elementary observation: The low pass filter corresponding to the scaling function of the Shannon MRA is the indicator function of the interval [\u2212\u00bd, \u00bd). This function is even and minimally supported in the frequency, i.e., its Fourier transform is of the form {circumflex over (\u03c9)}=\u03c7, where A is a measurable subset of . Keeping in mind that even functions are also radial (a function is radial if it depends only on the radial variable) one might wonder, what is the multidimensional analogue of even, minimally supported in the frequency scaling functions.","This particular problem motivated us to introduce the radial frame multiresolution analysis. Our construction is based on a very general multiresolution scheme of abstract Hilbert spaces developed by Papadakis in M. Papadakis. Generalized Frame Multiresolution Analysis of Abstract Hilbert Spaces. 2001, namely the Generalized Frame Multiresolution Analysis (GFMRA). The main characteristic of GFMRAs is that they can be generated by redundant sets of frame scaling functions. In fact, GFMRAs encompass all classical MRAs in one and multidimensions as well as the FMRAs of Benedetto and Li (see J. J. Benedetto and S. Li. The Theory of Multiresolution Analysis Frames and Applications to Filter Banks. 5:389-427, 1998).","In this invention, we construct non-separable Shannon-like GFMRAs of L() whose scaling functions are radial and are defined with respect to certain unitary systems, which we will later introduce. We also derive certain of their associated frame multiwavelet sets. Our construction is the first of its kind. Scaling functions that are radial have not been constructed in the past. However, certain classes of non separable scaling functions in two dimensions, with some continuity properties with respect to dyadic dilations or dilations induced by the Quincunx matrix only have been constructed in the past (e.g., A. Cohen and I. Daubechies. Nonseparable Bidimensional Wavelet Bases. , 9:51-137, 1993; J. Kovacevic and M. Vetterli. Nonseparable Multidimensional Perfect Reconstruction Filter-banks. , 38:533-555, 1992; W. He and M. J. Lai. Examples of Bivariate Nonseparable Compactly Supported Orthonormal Continuous Wavelets, In M. Unser, A. Aldroubi, A. Laine editor, , volume 3169 of , pages 303-314, 1997; K. Grochenig and W. Madych. Multiresolution Analysis, Haar Bases and Self-Similar Tilings. , 38:558-568, 1992; and A. Ayache, E. Belogay, and Y. Wang. Orthogonal Lifting: Constructing New (Symmetric) Orthogonal Scaling Functions. 2002.). All of them have no axial symmetries and are not smooth, except those contructed in E. Belogay and Y. Wang. Arbitrarily Smooth Orthogonal Nonseparable Wavelets in r. 30:678-697, 1999, which can be made arbitrarily smooth, but are highly asymmetric. Another construction in the spirit of digital filter design, but not directly related to wavelets can be found in E. H. Adelson, E. Simoncelli, and R. Hingoranp. Orthogonal Pyramid Transforms for Image Coding. In , Volume 845 of , pages 50-58, 1987 and E. P. Simoncelli, W. T. Freeman, E. H. Adelson, and J. P. Hager. Shiftable Multi-Scale Transforms. , 38(2):587-607, 1992. The latter construction and this of curvelets (e.g., see J. Starck, E. J. Candes, and D. L. Donoho, The Curvelet Transform for Image Denoising. 11(6): 670-684, 2002) share two properties of our Radial GFMRAs: the separability of the designed filters with respect to polar coordinates and the redundancy of the induced representations. However, our construction in contrast to those due to Simoncelli et. al. and to Starck et al. are in the spirit of classical multiresolution analysis and can be carried out to any number of dimensions and with respect to a variety of dilation matrices.","The merit of non separable wavelets and scaling functions is that the resulting processing of images is more compatible with that of human or mammalian vision, because mammals do not process images vertically and horizontally as separable filter banks resulting from separable multiresolution analyses do (M. Vetterli and J. Kovacevic. , Prentice Hall PTR, Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1995). As Marr suggests in his book D. Marr. . W. H. Freeman and Co., New York, N.Y., 1982, the human visual system critically depends on edge detection. In order to model this detection, Marr and Hildreth used the Laplacian operator, which is a \u201clowest order isotropic operator\u201d (D. Marr and E. Hildreth, The Theory of Edge Detection. , 207:187-217, 1980), because our visual system is orientation insensitive to edge detection. Thus, the most desirable property in filter design for image processing is the isotropy of the filter. Radial scaling functions for multiresolutions based on frames are the best (and, according to proposition 5, the only) type of image processing filters that meet the isotropy requirement.","Definitions","Before we proceed, we need a few definitions and results from M.

A Dilation matrix is an expanding matrix that leaves Zinvariant, i.e., A(Z)Z.","The previous definition readily yields the following observations: (a) all the entries of a dilation matrix are integers, because such a matrix leaves Zinvariant; and (b) the previous observation implies that determinant of A (detA) is an integer.","The multidimensional affine unitary systems we are interested in are the systems of the form G, where is a cyclic torsion free group generated by a dilation operator D defined by\n\n()=|det(), ()\n\nwhere A is a dilation matrix and G={T:k\u2208Z} and G is isomorphic with Z.

Since (A)=(A)and the operator norm of a matrix is equal to the operator norm of its transpose, we obtain that dilation matrices A satisfying Property D, therefore, satisfies \u2225B\u2225<1. Thus, B(D) is contained in D. Next, we let \u03bcbe the measurable function defined on such that \u03bc(\u03be)=\u03c7(\u03be), for every \u03be\u2208T, which is periodically extended on with respect to the tiling of induced by the integer translates of T.

This frequency spectrum is equal to the support of the autocorrelation function of \u03c6, because every signal in Vwill be encoded by the Analysis operator with an (Z)-sequence, whose Fourier transform has support contained in D. Therefore, the frequency spectrum subject to subband filtering induced by {V}equals D. This suggests that a pre-filtering step transforming a random digital signal into another signal whose frequency spectrum is contained in D is necessary prior to the application of the decomposition algorithm induced by {V}. This pre-filtering step is called initialization of the input signal. In the light of these remarks, one might wonder whether we may be able to increase the frequency spectrum that these FMRAs can filter by allowing r>\u00bd.

Therefore, e=ee. We now define the following functions:\n\n\u03c70, 1, 1}\u2003\u2003(15)\n\nApparently {eh:k\u2208Z,r=0, 1, . . . , p\u22121} is a Parseval frame for L(Q), thus, for \u0174as well. Therefore, {TFh:k\u2208Z,r=0, 1, . . . , p\u22121} is a Parseval frame for W, because the Fourier transform is unitary. Setting \u03c8,=Dh(r=0, 1, . . . , p\u22121), we finally have that {T\u03c8:k\u2208Z, r=0, 1, . . . , p\u22121} is a Parseval frame for W, therefore {\u03c8:r=0, 1, . . . , p\u22121} is a Parseval frame multiwavelet set associated with the FMRA {V}. This concludes the first construction of a frame multiwavelet set associated with {V}.\n","The reader might wonder whether it is possible to give a more explicit formula for the frame wavelets \u03c8. In the light of remark 2, \u03c8may not be radial as well. This may yield a rather unattractive time domain formula for all these wavelets. It is worth mentioning that \u03c8, where r>0, are never radial if \u03c8is radial.

From now on and until the end of the present section, we work with GFMRAs of L() only.","One of the instrumental tools of this construction is the square root of the autocorrelation function \u03a6, which is defined by A(\u03be)=\u03a6(\u03be), a.e. on T. Also, the inverse of A(\u03be) is defined on the range of \u03a6(\u03be) and is denoted by A(\u03be). It can also been proved that the range projection P of the Analysis operator S is defined by P\u03c9(\u03be)=P(\u03be)\u03c9(\u03be), where \u03c9\u2208L(T), and that for a.e. \u03be\u2208Tthe range projection of \u03a6(\u03be) is the projection P(\u03be). For the sake of completeness, it must be noted that P(\u2022) is a projection-valued weakly measurable function defined on T. Since \u03a6=, we deduce P(\u03be)=\u03c7(\u03be) a.e. in T. The latter observation in conjunction with the preceding argument implies that A(\u03be)=1, if \u03be\u2208D. For all other \u03be\u2208T, we have A(\u03be)=0, so for these \u03be, we adopt the notational convention A(\u03be)=0.

The kernel of \u03c1 is homeomorphically isomorphic to a dual group of the quotient group Z\/A(Z) as shown in greater detail in reference M. Papadakis.
