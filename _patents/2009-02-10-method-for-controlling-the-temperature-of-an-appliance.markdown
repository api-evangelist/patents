title: Method for controlling the temperature of an appliance
abstract: A method of controlling the temperature of a food preparation or sanitation appliance includes sensing the actual temperature of the appliance. When the temperature of the appliance is greater than a maximum threshold temperature, a compressor which supplies pressurized air to a burner is shut-off and a flame sensor, which senses the presence or absence of a flame, is overridden so the appliance acts as if a flame is present. When the actual temperature is less than a minimum threshold temperature, the compressor is started.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of provisional application 61\/027,748 filed in the United States Patent and Trademark Office on Feb. 11, 2008, the complete disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference and priority to which is claimed.","This invention relates to a method for controlling the temperature of an appliance and, in particular, to a method of controlling the temperature of an appliance which is heated by a burner.","In food preparation and sanitation applications it is desirable to maintain the temperature of the appliance constant. For appliances heated by a burner this typically requires a presence of a user to manually adjust the output of the burner though the rotation of a control knob. This may be labor intensive and inconvenient. To eliminate the need for manual adjustment to the output of the burner, some appliances are provided with thermostatically controlled fuel valves which maintain or restrict the flow of fuel to the burner based on the temperature of the appliance. However, these appliance may also require a constant flow of fuel to the burner to maintain a flame. This is both expensive and wasteful.","To conserve fuel some appliances operate on a flame on\/flame out basis. When the temperature of the appliance is greater than a maximum threshold temperature the flame is extinguished. When the temperature of the appliance is less than a minimum threshold temperature the flame is ignited. For example, in United States Patent Application Publication No. US 2006\/0172238 to Cook, there is disclosed a method for controlling a heater which comprises turning a pilotless igniter on for a first period of time and opening a fuel source valve whenever the temperature is less than or equal to a low temperature setting, and closing the fuel source valve whenever the temperature is greater than or equal to a high temperature setting or a flame sensor indicates that the flame has gone out.","Since the method disclosed by Cook is, at least in part, dependent on the presence or absence of a flame it may be limiting because the absence of a flame when the temperature of the heater to greater than the low temperature setting, but less than the high temperature setting, may result in the heater being shut down. There is therefore a need for an improved method of controlling the temperature of an appliance.","It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved method for controlling the temperature of an appliance which is heated by a burner.","It is a particular object of the present invention to provide an improved method of controlling the temperature of an appliance which is responsive only to the temperature of the appliance.","There is accordingly provided a method of controlling the temperature of a food preparation or sanitation appliance which includes sensing the actual temperature of the appliance. When the temperature of the appliance is greater than a maximum threshold temperature, a compressor which supplies pressurized air to a burner is shut-off and a flame sensor, which senses the presence or absence of a flame, is overridden so the appliance acts as if a flame is present. When the actual temperature is less than a minimum threshold temperature, the compressor is started.","Preferably a set temperature point is inputted into the appliance. The minimum threshold temperature is less than the set temperature point and the maximum threshold temperature is greater than the set temperature point. In one example, the minimum threshold temperature is between 1\u00b0 F. and 10\u00b0 F. less than the set temperature point, and the maximum threshold temperature is between 1\u00b0 F. and 10\u00b0 F. greater than the set temperature point. In a preferred example, the minimum threshold temperature is 3\u00b0 F. less than the set temperature point, and the maximum threshold temperature is 3\u00b0 F. greater than the set temperature point.","Referring to the drawings and first to , this shows a stove  and a thermostatic control device . The stove  is similar to the type disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,450,801 to Wilnecheko et al., the complete disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The stove  provides heat for a tray ration heater . In this example, the stove  and the tray ration heater  together are considered to be a single appliance . However, in other examples, the stove itself may be considered an appliance.","As best shown in , the stove  comprises a burner unit  which includes an air aspiration, infrared burner  similar to the type disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,527,180 to Robinson et al., the complete disclosure of which is also incorporated herein by reference. The burner  utilizes a two-stage combustion process which re-circulates combustion gases to achieve complete fuel vaporization. By re-circulating the combustion products and re-burning the gases within a burner head , the two-stage process burns virtually all of the hydrocarbons, approaching complete combustion. The benefits of a complete combustion are numerous, including maximum efficiency and heat transfer, little to no smoke, and very low carbon monoxide emissions. When multiple stove units are used in an enclosed kitchen, near complete combustion is necessary to ensure the health and safety of cooking staff. The infrared burner technology helps preserve clean breathable kitchen air.","The burner  is supplied with fuel by fuel delivery assembly  which is shown in greater detail in . The fuel delivery assembly  comprises a fuel block  and an air atomizing type nozzle . The purpose of the nozzle  is to transform liquid fuel into a finely atomized spray with increased surface area to promote the mixing of air and fuel, and facilitate evaporation. In this example, the nozzle  is a twin fluid air-assist type nozzle, also known as a siphon type air atomizing nozzle, in which the introduction of high velocity air into a slow-moving fuel causes the fuel to be disintegrated by mechanical energy from the air. Referring back to , a compressor  supplies pressurized air to the nozzle , shown in , through an air conduit . This creates a low pressure area inside the nozzle cavity. The low pressure is used to siphon fuel from a fuel container , through a fuel regulator  and a siphoning fuel line , to the nozzle . The nozzle  provides an atomized fuel spray which is ignited within a combustion chamber of the burner unit . A control knob  is used to regulate both the output of the compressor  and the flow of fuel to the nozzle .","As best shown in , the control knob  is coupled to both a feedback potentiometer  and a needle valve . The control knob  engages slots  and  on the feedback potentiometer . The control knob  also engages a cap  of the needle valve . The feedback potentiometer  controls the output of the compressor  and accordingly the air pressure in the nozzle . The needle valve  has male threading  which engages corresponding female threading (not shown) in the fuel block  which is shown in . As the stove  operates, fuel is siphoned from the fuel container  through the fuel regulator  and the fuel line , all of which are shown in . Fuel then flows from the fuel line  through a fuel valve  which, in this example, is a shut off solenoid valve shown in . Finally fuel flows from through the fuel valve  to the needle valve , shown in , and to the nozzle . Rotation of the control knob  causes axial movement of a valve stem (not shown) of the needle valve  which controls the flow of fuel to the nozzle . At the same time, the control knob  also rotates the feedback potentiometer  to control the speed of the compressor so that the amount of pressurized air supplied to the nozzle  is correct for the amount of fuel being supplied through the fuel line . Accordingly, when the control knob  is rotated, two fuel flow parameters are altered simultaneously. These two fuel control parameters are arranged so that a linear fuel rate is maintained.","An igniter , shown in , is mounted on the fuel block . The igniter  ignites the air fuel mixture expelled from the nozzle . The igniter  is attached to the fuel block  so its position relative to the nozzle  and fuel spray is maintained. This ensures reliable flame ignition and longer igniter life. A flame sensor , shown in , is also mounted on the fuel block . The flame sensor  views a flame in the burner  through an aperture , shown in , in the fuel block . The flame sensor  is located immediately beside the nozzle , optimizing the viewing angle. The view of the flame sensor  is generally parallel to a longitudinal axis of nozzle .","The flame sensor  measures the flame intensity and converts it to a DC voltage signal. The flame sensor  is designed to respond to changing light intensity rather than responding to steady-state light intensity. All flames have a characteristic changing light intensity or flicker frequency. The flame sensor  is tuned to respond to a specific flame flicker frequency and ignore other sources of light intensities such as sunlight or fluorescent light. The flame sensor  measures the flame intensity in the infrared spectrum. A threshold value for the DC signal is established. If the DC signal is over the threshold a flame is present. If the DC signal is below the threshold no flame is present. When no flame is present the flame sensor  signals a stove controller , shown in , to shut down the stove . The stove controller  is in the form of a micro-processor and controls all electrical and process functions of the stove . The stove controller  controls and modulates the input voltage and output voltage as constant voltage components using PWM control. In this example, each of the output circuits utilizes MOSFET style transistors with internal thermal protection to control the required devices.","The fuel delivery assembly , as shown in , further includes an air valve  which in this example is a three-way, two position solenoid valve. The air valve  selects between an air filter  and a vent assembly (not shown). This allows the compressor  to operate in two modes. In a first mode, the air valve  is in a normal position, and air is drawn through the air filter  allowing the compressor  to supply pressurized air to the nozzle . In a second mode, the air valve  is in an energized position, and air is drawn from the vent assembly to assist in re-fueling the fuel container  by drawing air from the fuel container  and drawing fuel into the fuel container  through a fuel supply line (not shown). Referring to , the vent assembly also includes a vent valve  for the fuel container  which, in this example, is a shut off solenoid valve. The vent valve  is closed during re-fueling and when the stove  is non-operational to create a low pressure area in the fuel container . When the stove  is operational the vent valve  is open to maintain the fuel at atmospheric pressure. There is also a fuel level sensor , also shown in , which signals the stove controller to stop the compressor  when the fuel container  is full. The fuel level sensor may also signal the stove controller when the fuel container  is empty.","The thermostatic control device  is best shown in  and generally comprises a control box , a temperature sensor , and a wiring harness . In this example, the control box  has an input mechanism including two input keys  and  which allow for the adjustment of a set temperature point. One input key  is used to increase the set temperature point and the other input key  is used to decrease the set temperature point. The set temperature point may be any temperature value and, preferably, between a minimum temperature of 100\u00b0 F. and a maximum temperature of 500\u00b0 F. The control box  also includes two indicators  and . Indicator  is a green RUN indicator and signifies that the thermostatic control device  is operating in a temperature control mode. Indicator  is a red SERVICE indicator  and signifies that a fault has occurred. There is an easily readable alpha-numeric display  disposed on a front of the thermostatic control device . In this example, the display  is a bright LCD upon which both the actual temperature of the appliance and set temperature point are displayed as shown. The actual temperature of the appliance is shown larger than the set temperature point and is located near the center of the display  in the illustrated example. The set temperature point is located in an upper right hand corner of the display  in the illustrated example. The display  may also relay output regarding the operation of the thermostatic control device . In other examples the display could vary.","The temperature sensor  is operatively connected by a cable  to a sealed connector (not shown) on a back of the thermostatic control device . Preferably, the temperature sensor  is able to be connected to and disconnected from the control box  without the use of tools. In this example, the temperature sensor  is a direct-connect temperature probe. However, any suitable temperature sensor may be used. The harness  is also sealedly connected to the back of the control box  and, preferably, permanently connected to the back the back of the control box . A distal end  of the harness  has a sufficient amount and style of connectors and to properly interface with various food preparation or sanitation appliances. The harness  may also be provided with a protective sheath to protect the wiring from dirt, food and other miscellaneous debris. In this example, the harness  interfaces the thermostatic control device  with the stove  as shown in . However, any other suitable means such as wireless communications may be used to interface the thermostatic control device with an appliance.","In operation, and as best shown in , the harness  operatively connects the thermostatic control device  to a control panel  of the stove . The stove  provides a power source for the thermostatic control device . In this example, the control panel  is hingedly connected to the stove  and may be opened as shown in . The control panel  also houses the stove controller  which is shown in . The temperature sensor  is retained by a bracket  mounted on the appliance  and is able to sense the actual temperature of the appliance . When the stove  is powered-up the thermostatic control device  may also be powered-up. Alternatively, when the thermostatic control device  is powered-up the stove  may also be powered-up. A user may enter a desired set temperature point into the thermostatic control device  using the input keys  and . The thermostatic control device  then operates the stove  in a flame on\/flame out fashion to maintain the actual temperature of the appliance  at or about the set temperature point. The thermostatic control device  may also be provided with a mounting bracket to allow for mounting of the thermostatic control device  on the stove , the appliance , or another support structure.","Referring now to , this is a block diagram illustrating the interface between the thermostatic control device  and stove . The thermostatic control device  is connected in-line between the stove  and select stove devices such that the thermostatic control device  can monitor and manipulate the compressor , fuel valve , flame sensor , and igniter . The thermostatic control device  has the ability to interrupt or switch off the compressor  and\/or fuel valve  outputs. Thermostatic control device  also has the ability to divert compressor output to the igniter . Finally, the thermostatic control device has the ability to drive a high analog voltage level such that a flame on signal is simulated or, alternatively, drive a low analog voltage level such that a flame out signal is simulated.","Referring to ,  and , when the actual temperature of the appliance  equals or exceeds a maximum threshold temperature, the temperature sensor  is in communication with and signals a thermostatic control device controller  which is disposed in the control box . The thermostatic control device controller  in turn diverts compressor output power to the ignitor  thereby interrupting the compressor . As a result, the compressor  is shut-off and the flame is extinguished because there is no low-pressure area to siphon fuel from the fuel tank  to the nozzle . The thermostatic control device controller  also drives a signal from the flame sensor  to a high analog voltage to simulate the presence of a flame so that the stove controller  acts as if a flame is still present. Accordingly, only the compressor  is shut-off and not the entire stove . The stove  is thereby maintained in a standby state. When the actual temperature of the appliance  is equal to or less than a minimum threshold temperature, the temperature sensor  signals the thermostatic control device controller . The thermostatic control device controller  reconnects the compressor output to the compressor  and drives a signal from the flame sensor  to a low analog voltage to simulate the absence of a flame. This causes the stove controller  to re-ignite the flame. As a result, fuel flows to the nozzle  and the flame is re-ignited. The stove  is thereby returned to a fully operational state. This cycle, shown in , is repeated as the actual temperature of the appliance  fluctuates between the maximum threshold temperature and the minimum threshold temperature.","The maximum threshold temperature is a temperature value which is greater than the set temperature point and, in this example, preferably 3\u00b0 F. above the set temperature point. The minimum threshold temperature is a temperature value which is less than the set temperature point and, in this example, preferably 3\u00b0 F. below the set temperature point. Accordingly, the thermostatic control device  is able to maintain the actual temperature of the appliance  at or about the set temperature point without requiring manual and intermittent rotation of the control knob . However, the thermostatic control device  may also have a manual setting in which the output of the burner unit  may be controlled through rotation of the control knob . The thermostatic control device  offers the further advantage that it does not interfere with control of the stove's vent valve , air valve , or fuel level sensor , thereby allowing for normal re-fueling of the stove as described herein.","Referring to , , and  the functionality of the thermostatic control device  will now be discussed.  is a state diagram illustrating the overall functionality of the thermostatic control device . Initially the stove  is powered up in a normal fashion to a POWERUP state as indicated by block . The stove  is then maintained in a STANDBY state, as indicated by blocks  and , while the thermostatic control device  monitors the actual temperature of the appliance  and stove outputs. If a fault is detected the stove  is sent to a SHUT DOWN state as indicated by block . Otherwise the thermostatic control unit completes a pre-check as indicated by block . If the actual temperature of the appliance  is below the set temperature point, the thermostatic control device  leaves all inputs and outputs unaltered, allowing the stove  to continue to provide heat in a HEAT state as indicated by block . If the actual temperature of the appliance  is equal to or exceeds the maximum threshold temperature, the thermostatic control device  prevents the burner unit  from igniting and goes straight to a COOL state indicated by block .","When the actual temperature of the appliance  is initially below the set temperature point, the stove  operates in the HEAT state indicated by block  to raise the temperature of the appliance . Once the actual temperature of the appliance  is equal to or exceeds the maximum threshold temperature, the thermostatic control device  shuts off the burner unit  by diverting compressor output power to the igniter . This provides a load to the compressor drive circuit and prevents an open circuit fault condition. The thermostatic control device  then drives the flame sensor signal to a high analog voltage to simulate the presence of a flame. This results in a SIMULATE state as indicated by block . Power to the compressor  and fuel valve  is then interrupted to halt operation of the burner unit  resulting in the COOL state indicated by block .","In the COOL state  the actual temperature of the appliance  will decrease. Once the actual temperature of the appliance  is equal to or less than the minimum threshold temperature the thermostatic control device  restarts the stove  as indicated by block . In the RESTART state, the thermostatic control device drives the flame sensor  to a low analog voltage level to stimulate the absence of a flame thereby triggering the stove to re-ignite the burner unit . This is done by temporarily turning off the fuel valve  and energizing the igniter . After a short delay fuel is re-introduced to the burner unit  by turning on the fuel valve . Reconnecting the compressor and fuel valve outputs allows the stove controller  to control the compressor  and fuel valve  resulting in an ENABLE STOVE state indicated by block . The thermostatic control device  then releases the flame sensor signal so the presence of a flame is reported to the stove controller . At this point the stove controller  re-ignites the burner . The thermostatic control unit  now stops diverting compressor output power to the igniter  resulting the HEAT state indicated by block . The stove  remains in the HEAT state  until the actual temperature of the appliance  is equal to or greater than the maximum threshold temperature at which point the cycle repeats. If at any point in the cycle a fault is detected a SHUT DOWN STOVE state, indicated by block , is triggered.","It will be understood by a person skilled in the art that although in the example provided above the thermostatic control device is interfaced with a stove, that in other examples the thermostatic control device may be interfaced with any appliance comprising a burner. Alternatively, the thermostatic control device may be integral with any appliance comprising a burner.","It will be further understood by someone skilled in the art that many of the details provided above are by way of example only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention which is to be determined with reference to the following claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Referring to the drawings:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 8"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
