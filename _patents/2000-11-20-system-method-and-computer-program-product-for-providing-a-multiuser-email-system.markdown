title: System, method, and computer program product for providing a multi-user e-mail system
abstract: A system, method, and computer program product for providing a multi-user shared e-mail system on a single computer is described. The system enables multiple users to use a single computer to provide for each user, one at a time, access to a personal secure e-mail account environment for that user. The e-mail account environment can include an inbox, an outbox and one or more folders to store received e-mail. The multiple e-mail account environments are all stored on the single computer. The single computer can be standalone, or can include an interface to a network, such as the Internet, for delivery of e-mail to users whose e-mail accounts do not reside on the single computer. The multi-user e-mail account system on a shared single computer provides cost efficient access for a large number of users which do not each need their own computer. The e-mail system includes a prioritization indicator to determine which of the multiple users of the shared e-mail system can get access first. Priority can reflect, e.g., receipt of new e-mail by an account and the urgency of received e-mail.

Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to electronic mail (e-mail) systems and more particularly, to multiple user e-mail systems.","2. Related Art","Electronic mail, also known as e-mail, is a widely used means of communicating between communication devices such as computers. A conventional e-mail system enables sending e-mail notes or e-mail messages much like a conventional postal letter from a source to a destination. For example, a sender could send an e-mail message including a return e-mail address to a receiver at the receiver's e-mail address on another computer through a network connecting the computers. E-mail messages provide several advantages over conventional postal mail, such as, for example, faster preparation time, faster delivery time, a simpler addressing scheme than using name, street address or post office box, city, state and zip code, and lower cost. E-mail systems can provide an efficient means of distributing information internal to and external from an enterprise or business. However, conventional e-mail systems have limitations when used in, e.g., a manufacturing plant or production environment such as, e.g., a hospital, or retail business. For example, conventional e-mail systems require that each user have a computer with which to access the e-mail system. In a production or manufacturing environment, a machine operator often will not have access to a computer. Also, it may be unsafe in certain environments to permit a worker to be distracted by e-mail while performing tasks such as, e.g., monitoring a mission critical operation, such as where a worker is operating heavy machinery or a nurse in a hospital. Limitations of conventional e-mail systems can prevent many users within organizations from, e.g., accessing important corporate information that is most efficiently distributed over e-mail.","Historically, e-mail messages have included primarily text. Eventually, users were able to attach files for delivery along with an e-mail textual message. Such attached files are often called \u201cattachments.\u201d Many e-mail systems support attaching multiple documents to an e-mail message. Unfortunately, when an e-mail user desires to forward an attachment, the attachment is conventionally forwarded along with the message containing it causing the forwarded e-mail with attachment to be encapsulated within the new e-mail.","One type of e-mail system is a client\/server e-mail system. The e-mail system can use a centralized post office box that resides on a server somewhere on the network to which client e-mail user computers are attached. The post office box can be used, e.g., to store a message from a sender which can then forward the message later to a temporarily disconnected addressed receiver. The centralized post office can also permit messages to be centrally backed up on a periodic basis. With a client\/server e-mail system, a portion of the e-mail generating program can reside on a client's computer (the computer of the sender or receiver), and another portion of the e-mail system can reside on a server computer. E-mail application software can run on a variety of operating systems and computer system platforms. Conventionally, e-mail messages are stored on the central server computer and are accessed via the client user computers.","Another type of client\/server e-mail system is known as \u201cgroupware.\u201d Groupware enables functions in addition to the communication capability of e-mail including, for example, project management, location independent cooperation and information accessibility links.","Examples of e-mail systems include, for example, Lotus cc:Mail available from IBM, Outlook, Exchange, and MS Mail available from MICROSOFT of Redmond, Wash., USA, PROFS and OFFICEVISION available from IBM of Armonk, N.Y., USA, All-In-One from Compaq of Houston, Tex., USA, online service provider integrated e-mail systems such as, e.g., that provided by AMERICA ONLINE (AOL) of Vienna, Va., USA, the Internet Protocol's Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), and various Internet based e-mail systems such as those available from JUNO and NETZERO. Examples of groupware include Lotus Notes available from IBM, Exchange available from MICROSOFT, Collabra Share available from NETSCAPE, and Groupwise available from NOVELL.","Early e-mail systems sent messages to users within an organization known as an intranet system, with little consideration taken to interacting with other e-mail systems or networks. An intranet is a term often used to describe a stand alone network or group of networks which includes a related group of senders and receivers, such as, for example, the employees of a commercial company.","Some intranet e-mail systems are equipped to inter-operate with other e-mail systems. Computers coupled by a network communicate by using communication software programs which in turn use a communication language or \u201cprotocol.\u201d Some e-mail systems are implemented using a so-called \u201copen systems\u201d communications method such as the transmission control protocol\/internet protocol (TCP\/IP) suite of protocols. The TCP\/IP protocol suite includes the SMTP e-mail functionality already mentioned.","An internet (i.e. with a lower case \u201ci\u201d) is a network which couples two separate networks to one another. The global Internet (i.e. with a capitalized \u201cI\u201d) is an internet that grew out of a U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) project. The Internet originally served a largely technical audience composed of the military, government agencies, and academic researchers and scientists. The original goals of the project were to allow researchers to share computing resources and to exchange information, regardless of their locations, and to create a resilient, fault-tolerant wide area network (WAN) for military communications. The global Internet implements communication using the TCP\/IP communications protocols.","On-line service providers originally provided e-mail system access to individuals via modem connections. On-line service providers include, for example, American On Line (AOL), CompuServe, and Prodigy. Online services traditionally created offerings targeted toward home computer users. These providers often provided proprietary e-mail systems to connect their users to one another. In time, users on proprietary on-line services, were able to send messages to users on other e-mail services via the Internet.","During the mid-1990's, commercial enterprises and individuals increasingly discovered the benefits of being connected to the Internet, eventually creating a mass-market phenomenon. Today, although access is limited in some areas, most countries have ties to the Internet. Thus, the Internet has enabled widespread, standardized intercommunication between users of disparate e-mail systems.","Small and medium sized businesses have many users which do not have access to a computer with which to send and receive e-mail. Workers in various professions including, e.g., healthcare workers in a hospital and retail, because of their jobs, may not have access to conventional email. It is desirable that all employees of a business have access to e-mail resources for such purposes as, e.g., for efficient distribution of information to employees from an employer. In many cases, it can be desirable that the employer not be required to purchase a computer for use by each of the employees. It is also desirable that the employer be able to filter out any junk e-mail, commonly known as \u201cspam,\u201d being sent to the employees. It is also desirable that employees such as, e.g., in a retail business, production, or operations such as a hospital, not be permitted to access their e-mail at all times in order to maintain high worker productivity.","Thus, what is needed in an improved e-mail system which can provide access to various users in a production, or operational environment such as, e.g., healthcare, retail or other professionals in an environment without individual access to a personal computer, who presently are unable to access e-mail and other useful functions.","A method, system, and computer program product are provided that enable multiple users to access e-mail through a single shared computer including password authentication, secure definable file folder storage and a user access priority indicator. In one embodiment of the invention, the e-mail can include various new and useful features, such as, e.g., human resource communication and statistics tools, timeclock in\/out, incoming mail filters, delayed receipt of e-mail, delayed message sending, auto-reply, auto-forwarding, encryption, automatic passing of a public key, advertising banners, embedded voicemail and video attachments, removal of embedded characters, direct attachment viewing, direct sending of attachments, spell-check, thesaurus, text view formatting (HTML or standard text), personal memo creation, address book, smartnames callup of addressee by typing letters of the name, user-selectable hotkey functions, remote logon to file folder from web interface, and an administration system for setup of passwords, secure folders, and filtering.","Further features and advantages of the invention, as well as the structure and operation of various embodiments of the invention, are described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the drawings, like reference numbers generally indicate identical, functionally similar, and\/or structurally similar elements. The drawing in which an element first appears is indicated by the leftmost digits in the corresponding reference number.","The preferred embodiment of the invention is discussed in detail below. While specific implementations are discussed, it should be understood that this is done for illustration purposes only. A person skilled in the relevant art will recognize that other components and configurations may be used without parting from the spirit and scope of the invention.","In many production, retail, healthcare, hospital, manufacturing or other environments, workers do not have access to a computer and e-mail, and at scheduled times go to a break room for a break. The present invention is directed to a system, method and computer program product that enables multiple users to access a single shared computer to send, receive and store e-mail messages. The system can be used continually in real-time working environment.","In one embodiment of the invention, the multiple user, shared single computer e-mail system permits these multiple users to view the computer and through a user interface identify whether new e-mail has arrived for any of the users.","In one embodiment, the users can use a touchscreen to identify themselves to the system and the system can then require entry of a password to authenticate the user. Alternatively, a conventional display monitor can be used for output of status information and a mouse or other pointing device or keyboard or other device can be used for input.","In another embodiment, the system can through its user interface identify a priority level of newly received e-mail, to prioritize which of the multiple users should gain access to the shared computer first. In one embodiment, the priority level can be identified by, e.g., providing a colored representation as to the urgency of the e-mail, such as, e.g., a colored or blinking name or button, or alphanumeric or other indication of priority such as, e.g., a ranked list.","In an embodiment of the invention, the user with the highest priority could then access the shared e-mail system first. The user with the highest priority e-mail message can then select to open his or her e-mail.","In one embodiment of the invention, a user can select to open the user's name by, e.g., using a mouse, key or highlighting a name or button with a cursor. In an embodiment, the user can then be prompted to provide authentication information such as, e.g., a password and\/or company badge, to gain access to that user's personal e-mail environment.","In one embodiment of the invention, a user's personal e-mail environment can include, e.g., an inbox, an outbox, and at least one user definable file folder into which received messages can be stored. In an embodiment of the invention, the system can store messages in file folders named by sender of the message or can permit the user to provide another name for the folder such as \u201cpersonal.\u201d In one embodiment of the invention, the file folders can include different security features such as, e.g., passwords for access to the specific file folder.","An encryption feature can be used to encrypt and decrypt the contents of e-mail messages to prevent unauthorized access to the contents of a message. In one embodiment, a public key can be automatically sent with an email. The public key can be included at the top of an email in one embodiment. Advantageously, to exchange public keys, two users can send emails to one another.","In one embodiment of the invention, a first group including a first subset of all users can use a first single shared computer and a second group including a second subset of all users can use a second single shared computer.","In another embodiment of the invention, a banner can be included onscreen to display advertising or other relevant information to users of the shared e-mail system. Advantageously, the banner can be used, e.g., to display advertising information which can be used, e.g., to offer the e-mail system for free or a discount to businesses.","The shared e-mail system can include other useful features such as, e.g., a dictionary for spellcheck, a thesaurus, a grammar checker, multiple standard replies, or standard reply lists (such as, e.g., an informal reply, a business or formal reply), address book for selecting recipients, special text viewing (e.g., permitting viewing HTML or text), smart names (e.g., permitting entry of letters of a name causing, e.g., lookup of one or more addressbook entries having those letters, a list of names, or the addressbook interface itself by a function key combination), user selectable function keys (e.g., permitting a user to assign particular functions to key combinations such as, e.g., Alt-k to bring up the address book), a memo feature (i.e., enabling preparing brief memos to oneself).","In another embodiment of the invention, a user can access the user's e-mail environment from the Internet's world wide web (\u201cweb\u201d). In one embodiment, storage of the user's e-mail environment is mirrored to a server on the world wide web and is kept in synchrony. In one embodiment, a user from the web interface can send, receive, store in folders, move and delete messages. In one embodiment of the invention, the e-mail system can use a version of the standard POP3 mail application modified for the specific features of the shared e-mail system.","The present invention can also include human resource features. For example, in one embodiment of the invention, a user can clock in and clock out via the system to provide an automated timeclock.","Another human resource feature can permit tracking user statistics by capturing user data via the system including, e.g., the number of employees, the number of hourly employees, the number of female and males workers, hours worked, whether someone is in or out.","Another human resource feature of the present invention includes provision of a company wide e-mail for use in, e.g., notifying all employees of events, company policy and other announcements. The present invention, in one embodiment, can require each employee to acknowledge that they have read an e-mail (e.g., regarding a company policy) and the system can automatically compile a single record regarding all employees indicating which employees opened the e-mail and which did not. A report referred to as a read receipt report can be generated that can track which recipients have accessed a sent file. In one embodiment, the date and time of access can be tracked also. In one embodiment the report can be continually updated.","The present invention provides several other features applicable to general e-mail systems. For example, the present invention can include an e-mail system having a function that automatically removes greater-than (\u201c>\u201d) signs that other e-mail systems could have embedded into forwarded e-mails.","Another e-mail feature includes in the window interface that presents the contents of an open e-mail, a graphical display indicating a hierarchy of forwarded e-mails and attachments. Advantageously, the graphical display enables forwarding of only an included forwarded e-mail or attachment.","Another embodiment of the present invention can filter e-mail obtained from a list of internet locations (e.g., addresses or domain names), which can be maintained by an administrator (i.e., in one embodiment of the invention for a single user version, the administrator can be the user).","In one embodiment of the invention, the filter can refuse acceptance of e-mails from those designated locations by maintaining a so-called \u201cno spam\u201d list. The filter can be used to block other e-mail based on criteria set by the administrator, such as, e.g., limiting the size of an e-mail or attachments.","In one embodiment of the invention, incoming e-mail can be queued and can be forwarded to the recipient e-mail user, only at a particular time (such as, e.g., break time, lunch time, or after hours). Advantageously, this feature can prevent employees from sneaking off at non-break times to check e-mail. In another embodiment of the invention, access to a user's e-mail box can be restricted to only particular times of the day, avoiding employee temptation to check e-mail.","In another embodiment of the invention, sending of a message can be delayed to a given time by inputting a send date and time upon creation of the e-mail. Advantageously, the delayed send e-mail feature can enable earlier entry of e-mail birthday greetings to be sent on an employee's birthday.","In another embodiment of the invention, a feature can be provided to store e-mail in a folder which can default to be titled by the sender's e-mail userid (i.e., also commonly referred to as usemrname, screenname, or e-mail address). The user can be permitted to modify the folder name such as, e.g., to replace it with the sender's company name, or department name, or other designation for the folder such as, e.g., \u201cpersonal,\u201d or \u201cconfidential.\u201d In another embodiment of the invention, the system can automatically timeout and close a user's e-mail if no action has been made for a selectable period of time, to prevent unauthorized access to the user's e-mail environment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","100","100","102","104","102","106","106","102","104","110","116","106","118","112","114","200","102","114","110","104","114","114"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 1B","b":["120","106","120","110","112","120","122","124","126","128","130","124","126","128","130","122","126","132","132","116","118","134","124","126","128","130"]},"Referring back to , mail client  can include an authentication input module which can accept a password from user  to validate that user  is authorized to access the e-mail account of user .
