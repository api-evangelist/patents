title: Method to estimate noise in data
abstract: A method for estimating uncorrelated noise in a distributed record of data including data samples that represent both signal and noise, provided that the signal is substantially in phase between adjacent data samples. The method begins with dividing the record of data into an even number of equal intervals. The method proceeds compiling a reduced data record by subtracting from every other data sample in the record of data one data sample that is adjacent to it. Finally, the method entails a step of estimating the noise power in the signal relative to the signal power by calculating the standard deviation as a measure of the magnitude of the noise.

The use of noise estimation in measurements taken from an array of receiving sensors can considerably enhance signal estimation. Indeed, estimation and statistical inference of noise are central to many disciplines that entail a series of observations, from which it is necessary to draw conclusions, estimate parameters and make forecasts.","Several conventional methods exist to suppress noise including the following:","1) The use of harmonic models.","2) Noise subspace characterization.","3) (FIR) filter modeling.","4) Data averaging.","5) Inter-epoch averaging, and.","6) Wiener filtering.","Nonlinear Time Series. Nonparametric and Parametric Methods, by J Fan and Q Yao, Springer (2003) offers a good overview of these conventional methods to handle nonlinear time series. Unfortunately, all the foregoing techniques suffer from at least one of the following limitations: the need for extended data acquisition, assumption of limited epoch-to-epoch variability, dependence on assumptions about the signal characteristics, and the inability to use conventional statistical approaches.","Data averaging is perhaps the most practical and widely used approach for estimating and reducing the noise with respect to the signal. For example, United States Patent Application 2004\/0097802 by Cohen filed May 20, 2004 shows a method and apparatus for reducing contamination of an electrical signal. The electrical signal is digitized and averaged to obtain an estimated contaminating signal that is subtracted from the digitized electrical signal. This method is shown in the context of electrophysiological signals, such as EEG, ECG, EMG and galvanic skin response, and for elimination of noise associated with methods such as MRI.","To summarize the general approach to noise estimation by averaging, we start with the assumption that we have a data record comprising a group of data samples. A data record is usually divided into N equal intervals. If the data takes the form of a time series, each data sample x(t) at time intervals consists of a signal s(t) that is assumed to be correlated over the total duration of all intervals, and a noise component n(t) that is assumed to be uncorrelated between any two intervals. Thus, at time t\n\n()=()+().\u2003\u2003(1)\n","There are two important statistics involved in the investigation of signal noise. The first is the mean, average, or expected value of a variable. This quantity is often mathematically denoted E(x), where x is a sample of the noise in question and E is called the expectation (average value) of the quantity inside the parentheses. This parameter is usually the signal that is being measured, to which noise is being added. The second statistic is the standard deviation of the noise. This is computed by subtracting the square of the mean from E(x) and taking the square root. The standard deviation is a measure of the magnitude of the noise, whatever signal is present. If we have a sequence of N samples, the mean of any sample is denoted \u03bc, where, by definition",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"\u03bc","mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"E","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"x"}},{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","mi":"N"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"N"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mi":"x","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["t","i"]}}}}}],"mo":"="}},"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]}}}}},"Let the standard deviations for the signal and noise be denoted by S and \u03c3, respectively, as follows (when both the signal and noise have zero means):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"E","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msup":{"mi":"s","mn":"2"}}},{"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","mi":"N"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"n"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"s","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["t","i"]}}}}},"mo":"=","msup":{"mi":"S","mn":"2"}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"3"}}]}}}}},"and",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"E","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msup":{"mi":"n","mn":"2"}}},{"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","mi":"N"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"N"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"n","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["t","i"]}}}}},"mo":"=","msup":{"mi":"\u03c3","mn":"2"}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"4"}}]}}}}},"If the signal is correlated between any two samples, and the noise is uncorrelated between any two samples (and the signal and noise have zero means), then",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00004","num":"00004"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","mi":"N"},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"N"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"s","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["t","i"]}}},{"mi":"n","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["t","i"]}}}],"mo":"+"}}}},"mn":"2"}},{"mrow":[{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","mi":"N"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"N"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"j","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"N"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"s","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["t","i"]}}},{"mi":"s","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["t","j"]}}}],"mo":"\u2062"}}}},{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","mi":"N"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"N"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"j","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"N"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"n","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["t","i"]}}},{"mi":"n","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["t","j"]}}}],"mo":"\u2062"}}}}],"mo":"+"}],"mo":["=","\u2062"],"mi":{}}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mo":["=","\u2062"],"mi":{},"mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"NS","mn":"2"},"mo":"+","mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"\u03c3","mn":"2"},"mo":"."}}}}}]}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"5"}}]}}}}},"The signal-to-noise ratio is thus improved over that in each individual data sample by a factor N.

Underlying the application of averaging is a trade-off between the degree of certainty achieved and the number of samples that must be taken (and the time it takes to obtain them).

Two example applications where this constraint holds true are presented below.","Raman scattering effects were used in an optical fiber to measure the temperature every \u00bd meter. Typically N is on the order of 10averages that are made in total time duration of 100 seconds. Each x(t) represents a temperature measurement made at a location along the optical fiber at time t. In each data sample, the signal s(t) is either constant or varies slowly over the 100 second measurement duration, so that it can be assumed constant with good accuracy over two adjacent data samples differing in time by 10seconds. Applying the foregoing method estimates the uncorrelated noise (both electrical and optical) in each measurement. This is especially useful because the temperature often varies from measurement to measurement (which are 100 seconds apart), and yet true transient temperature changes can thus be distinguished from noise.","In this example, an acoustic field is detected by 2M receivers in a phased array receiver system. In practice the receivers may comprise either acoustic (hydrophones or microphones) or electromagnetic arranged in a one-, two- or three-dimensional array. In this example the spatially distributed measurements are made from an array of receivers having a three-dimensional distribution. Here, the data x(t) from receiver m is time-delayed so that the signal in each receiver is in phase (and can thus be subtracted out as described above).
