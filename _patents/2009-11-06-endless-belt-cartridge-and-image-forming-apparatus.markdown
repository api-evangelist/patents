Technical Field","The present invention relates to an annular body, a cartridge, and an image forming apparatus.","2. Related Art","An annular body, which is a member having a circular shape, is used in electrophotographic devices such as electrophotographic image forming devices in many cases. Examples of the annular bodies include an image holding unit, a charging roll as a charging member, a developing roll as a developing device, a transfer belt, a transfer roll as a transfer device, and a fixing roll as a fixing device.","The invention provides an annular body comprising a resin layer, the resin layer comprising a resin and particles, the particles being at least one of conductive or magnetic, a surface of the resin layer comprising a first region and a second region, the first region being different from the second region in at least one of surface resistivity or magnetic flux density, the second region comprising a resin region and a high density region, the resin region being provided at an outer side with respect to the high density region in the thickness direction of the resin layer and being substantially free of the particles, and the high density region having a higher content of the particles compared to the resin region and the first region.","Hereinafter, preferred exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail will be detailed with reference to the drawings.","An endless belt  according to this exemplary embodiment is an annular body formed to have an endless form as illustrated in . The endless belt  of this exemplary embodiment corresponds to one exemplary embodiment of an annular body of the present invention.","The endless belt  has a resin layer  which contains a resin and conductive particles .","The resin layer  includes two areas at a surface thereof which differ in surface resistivity. Specifically, the surface of the resin layer  has a first area (hereinafter referred to as a non-detection region B) and a second area having a surface resistivity lower than that of the non-detection region B (hereinafter referred to as a detection region A).","In the endless belt , the surface resistivity of the detection region A and the surface resistivity of the non-detection region B are different from each other. Therefore, the detection region A and the non-detection region B are easily detected by measuring the surface resistivity of the endless belt . Thus, the detection region A is used to detect a position of a measured portion in the endless belt .","A difference between the common logarithm value (Log \u03a9\/\u25a1) of the surface resistivity of the detection region A and the common logarithm value (Log \u03a9\/\u25a1) of the surface resistivity of the non-detection region B is preferably from about 1.0 to about 10.0, and more preferably from about 3.0 to about 6.0.","When the difference in the common logarithm value of surface resistivity between the detection region A and the non-detection region B is in the above range, the detection region A may be substantially accurately detected by the measurement of the surface resistivity of the endless belt .","In contrast, when the difference between the common logarithm value (Log \u03a9\/\u25a1) of the surface resistivity of the detection region A and the common logarithm value (Log \u03a9\/\u25a1) of the surface resistivity of the non-detection region B is lower than about 1.0, a slight variation in the resistance of the endless belt  may be detected as a difference between the detection and non-detection regions, which may reduce detection accuracy. When the difference exceeds about 10.0, the surface resistivity may be outside the measurable range of the measuring device for measuring the surface resistivity.","As illustrated in , the detection region A has a resin region A, a high density region B, and a rear surface region C which are positioned in this order in the thickness direction from the top surface in the thickness direction.","The \u201csurface (of the endless belt )\u201d referred in this exemplary embodiment means the surface which is to be subjected to measurement of surface resistivity by a detecting device (explained below). The \u201ctop surface\u201d means an area of the outermost side of the resin layer .","When the surface resistivity is measured from the inner peripheral surface of the endless belt  by the detecting device, the \u201csurface\u201d refers to the inner peripheral surface of the endless belt . When the surface resistivity is measured from the outer peripheral surface of the endless belt  by the detecting device, the \u201csurface\u201d refers to the outer peripheral surface of the endless belt . Herein, explanation of this exemplary embodiment is made defining the \u201csurface\u201d as the peripheral outer surface of the endless belt .","The resin region A is an area where substantially no conductive particles  are present, i.e., an area where only a resin is present. The high density region B is an area where the density of the conductive particles  is higher than that of the resin region A and that of the rear surface region C, which are independent areas respectively provided along the thickness direction of the detection region A, and also higher than that of the non-detection region B. Therefore, the high density region B is a high conductive area, the conductivity of which is higher than that of the resin region A and that of the rear surface region C, which are areas other than the high density region B in the detection region A, and higher than that of the non-detection region B.","In this exemplary embodiment, the resin layer  of the endless belt  has the detection region A and the non-detection region B, which reside in the surface of the resin layer  and are differed in the surface resistivity. The detection region A has the surface resistivity lower than that of the non-detection region B. The detection region A has the resin region A where substantially no conductive particles  is present, the high density region B, and the rear surface region C, which are present in this order from the top surface along the thickness direction.","The detection region A is provided in the top surface in the thickness direction, and has the resin region A where substantially no conductive particles  is present and the high density region B which is provided at the inner side relative to the resin region A in the thickness direction and where the density of the conductive particles  is higher than that of the resin region A and the non-detection region B.","Here, \u201cthe inner side in the thickness direction\u201d refers to an inner area in the thickness direction relative to the detection region A provided on the top surface, and is not limited to the inside in the thickness direction of the endless belt  and may be the surface (bottom surface) opposite to the top surface.","The detection region A of the endless belt  of this exemplary embodiment is integrally provided in the endless belt .","The thickness of the resin region A is preferably from about 0.5 \u03bcm to about 3 \u03bcm from the viewpoint of obtaining a surface smoothing function, suppressing changes in the surface resistivity of the detection region A due to wearing and the like.","The resin region A and the high density region B may be provided in an area which ranges from the top surface of the detection region A to a depth of about 15 \u03bcm in the thickness direction. The conductivity of the high density region B is preferably about 5 or more times, more preferably from about 5 times to about 100 times, and still more preferably about 5 times to about 50 times as much as the conductivity of the rear surface region C disposed at a distance of more than about 15 \u03bcm (preferably about 10 \u03bcm) in the thickness direction from the top surface of the detection region A.","Namely, the highest current value flowing in the area which ranges from the top surface of the detection region A to a depth of about 15 \u03bcm in the thickness direction (i.e., the highest current value flowing in the high density region B) is higher than the highest current value flowing in an area from a position at a distance of more than about 15 \u03bcm in the thickness direction from the outermost surface to the innermost surface (i.e., the highest current value flowing in the rear surface region C). This relationship of the conductivities (highest current values) may lead to a suppression of reduction in the volume resistivity of the detection region A relative to the volume resistivity of the non-detection region B so that these volume resistivities are approximately the same, and effective reduction of the surface resistivity of the detection region A relative to the non-detection region B.","When the resin layer  is divided into plural portions having the same surface area, the contents of the conductive particles  in respective portions (respectively having the volume defined by the divided surface area and the depth of the resin layer  in the thickness direction) are the same value. This condition may be achieved by using the production method described below. Due to this condition, the surface resistivity of the detection region A and that of the non-detection region B are same, and the volume resistivity of the detection region A and that of the non-detection region B are different. This property may be effectively developed by giving the relationship of the conductivities (the highest current values).","In this exemplary embodiment, the expression of \u201ccontents of one material in objects are the same value\u201d and \u201csame content\u201d refer to that a content(\/contents) of the material in one of the object(\/respective objects) is(\/are respectively) in the range of from about 95% to about 105% of an average value calculated from the contents of the material in the objects. Further, in this exemplary embodiment, the expression of \u201cdensities of one material in objects are the same value\u201d and \u201csame density\u201d refer to that a density(\/densities) of the material in one of the object(\/respective objects) is(\/are respectively) in the range of from about 95% to about 105% of an average value calculated from the densities of the material in the objects. The definition of the volume resistivity is described below.","Examples of methods for observing the absence or presence of the conductive particles  in the resin region A, the high density region B, and the rear surface region C include: a method including producing a cross section piece of the belt (a piece of the endless belt ) by a focused ion beam (FIB), and then observing the cross section piece with a transmission electron microscope to directly observe the absence or presence of the particles; and a method including producing across section piece of the belt with a microtome, and then obtaining the height information from an atomic force microscope (AFM) to see the absence or presence of the particles.","The conductivity of the 15 \u03bcm area from the top surface in the thickness direction, and the area from a position at a distance of more than 15 \u03bcm from the top surface in the thickness direction to the depth equal to or more than the thickness, may be compared by producing a cross section piece of the belt with a microtome, and subjecting the cross section piece to the AFM observation in a conducting mode.","Specific examples of measurement methods therefor include a method including measuring the highest current value in each area when observing the cross section piece (sample) of the belt of 10 \u03bcm square using D3000 and NANOSCOPE III (both trade names, manufactured by Digital Instruments) under the conditions employing \u201cContact mode\u201d as a measuring mode and a Au-coated conductive cantilever as a cantilever, and setting a spring constant to 0.2 N\/m, and an applied voltage to \u22125V.","The cross section piece (sample) of the belt is produced by embedding the belt in epoxy resin, and cutting the same with a microtome. A silver paste electrode is adhered to the sample in the direction parallel to the sample depth to obtain a cantilever counter electrode. The cross section piece (sample) of the belt of 10 \u03bcm square is observed to obtain current value (conductivity) and height information.","This condition is described for the purpose of showing one exemplary embodiment, and the observation conditions are not limited to this condition. The measurement range, the applied voltage, the spring constant, etc., may be arbitrarily changed according to the cross section piece (sample) of the belt.","The conductivities may be compared based on the highest current value thus obtained.","Although the endless belt  in this exemplary embodiment has a configuration provided with a single layer of the resin layer , the configuration of the annular body, which is one aspect of the invention, is not limited thereto. In another exemplary embodiment, the annular body, which is one aspect of the invention, may have a configuration in which other functional layers are provided on the outer peripheral surface or inner peripheral surface of the resin layer . In this case, the other functional layers are layers that do not change the difference in the surface resistivity between the detection region A and the non-detection region B in the resin layer , or layers which allow detection of the difference by the detecting device even when the surface resistivity is changed by the other functional layers.","In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in , the detection regions A are provided at given intervals along the edge of the endless belt . The detection region A is not required to be provided in the entire of the surface of the resin layer . It is sufficient as long as the detection region A is provided in a part(s) of the surface of the resin layer . The detection region A may be provided at any position of the surface of the resin layer . For example, the detection region A may be provided at the center in the width direction as illustrated in . Since the detection region A is detected by measurement of the surface resistivity, the place at which the detection region A is not specified in the surface of the endless belt . In contrast to conventional arts in which the position of the detection region is limited to the peripheral edge or the like, the detection region A may be formed at any place in the surface of the endless belt .","In this exemplary embodiment, plural detection regions A are provided in the surface of the endless belt . However, it is sufficient as long as at least one detection region A is provided. Plural detection regions A may not be necessary.","A portion (area) of the detection region A revealing on the surface of the endless belt  may have any shape insofar as the shape may be easily detected by a cartridge  or an image forming apparatus  described below. Examples of the shape include a circular shape and a rectangular shape.","Hereinafter, the components and properties of the endless belt  according to this embodiment will be described.","The endless belt  has a configuration in which the resin layer  is formed into an annular shape, i.e., an endless belt.","Resin Material","A resin material, which is a resin contained in the resin layer , preferably has the Young's modulus of about 3,500 MPa or more, which is more preferably about 4,000 MPa or more, although the Young's modulus of the resin may vary according to the thickness of the belt. There is no particular limitation to the kind of the resin material as long as the condition of the Young's modulus is satisfied. Examples of the resin include a polyimide resin, a polyamide resin, a polyamide imide resin, a polyether ether ester resin, a polyarylate resin, a polyester resin, and a polyester resin to which a reinforcer is added.","The Young's modulus can be determined based on inclination of a tangent line drawn to the curve of the initial strain area of the stress-strain curve obtained by performing a tensile test according to JIS K7127 (1999), which substantially accords to ISO 527-3 1995, and the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein. The measurement can be performed using a rectangular test piece (about 6 mm in width and about 130 mm in length) and a dumbbell No. 1 at a test rate of about 500 mm\/m while adjusting the thickness to the thickness of a belt body.","Examples of the resin include a polyimide resin. A polyimide resin, which is a resin having a high Young's modulus, shows little deformation property at the time of driving (stress of a support roll, a cleaning blade, or the like) of a belt formed therefrom. Therefore, the endless belt  may be formed to one that hardly causes image defects such as misregistration of color images formed of toner when the resin layer  contains a polyimide resin as the resin material.","A polyimide resin can be usually obtained as a polyamide acid solution by polymerization-reacting an equivalent mole of tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride or a derivative thereof and a diamine in a solvent. Examples of tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride include a dianhydride represented by the following Formula (I).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"23.62mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US08229336-20120724-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"In Formula (I), R is a tetravalent organic group, and is an aromatic group, an aliphatic group, an alicyclic group, a combination of an aromatic group and an aliphatic group, or a substituted group of any one of these.","Specific examples of tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride include pyromellitic acid dianhydride, 3,3\u2032,4,4\u2032-benzophenonetetracarboxylic acid dianhydride, 3,3\u2032,4,4\u2032-biphenyltetracarboxylic acid dianhydride, 2,3,3\u2032,4-biphenyltetracarboxylic acid dianhydride, 2,3,6,7-naphthalenetetracarboxylic acid dianhydride, 1,2,5,6-naphthalenetetracarboxylic acid dianhydride, 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic acid dianhydride, 2,2\u2032-bis(3,4-dicarboxyphenyl) sulfonic acid dianhydride, perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride, bis(3,4-dicarboxyphenyl)ether dianhydride, and ethylenetetracarboxylic acid dianhydride.","Specific examples of diamine include 4,4\u2032-diaminodiphenyl ether, 4,4\u2032-diaminodiphenylmethane, 3,3\u2032-diaminodiphenylmethane, 3,3\u2032-dichlorobenzidine, 4,4\u2032-diaminodiphenyl sulfide, 3,3\u2032-diaminodiphenylsulfone, 1,5-diaminonaphthalene, m-phenylenediamine, p-phenylenediamine, 3,3\u2032-dimethyl4,4\u2032-biphenyldiamino, benzidine, 3,3\u2032-dimethylbenzidine, 3,3\u2032-dimethoxybenzidine, 4,4\u2032-diaminodiphenylsulfone, 4,4\u2032-diaminodiphenylpropane, 2,4-bis(\u03b2-aminotertiarybutyl) toluene, bis (p-\u03b2-amino-tertiarybutyl phenyl)ether, his (p-\u03b2-methyl-\u03b4-aminophenyl) benzene, bis-p-(1,1-dimethyl-5-amino-bentyl) benzene, 1-isopropyl-2,4-m-phenylenediamine, m-xylylenediamine, p-xylylenediamine, di (p-aminocyclohexyl) methane, hexamethylenediamine, heptamethylenediamine, octamethylenediamine, nonamethylenediamine, decamethylenediamine, diaminopropyltetramethylene, 3-methylheptamethylenediamine, 4,4-dimethylheptamethylenediamine, 2,11-diaminododecane, 1,2-bis-3-aminopropoxyethane, 2,2-dimethylpropylenediamine, 3-methoxyhexamethylenediamine, 2,5-dimethylheptamethylenediamine, 3-methylheptamethylenediamine, 5-methylnonamethylenediamine, 2,17-diaminoeicosadecane, 1,4-diaminocyclohexane, 1,10-diamino-1,10-dimethyldecane, 12-diaminooctadecane, 2,2-bis [4-(4-aminophenoxy) phenyl]propane, piperazine, HN(CH)O(CH)O(CH)NH, HN(CH)S(CH)NH, and HN(CH)N(CH)(CH)NH.","Preferable examples of a solvent when tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride and diamine are polymerization-reacted include a polar solvent (organic polar solvent) from a viewpoint of solubility. As a polar solvent, N,N-dialkylamides are preferable, and examples thereof include N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, N,N-diethylformamide, N,N-diethylacetamide, N,N-dimethylmethoxyacetamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, hexamethylphosphortriamide, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, pyridine, tetramethylenesulfone, and dimethyltetramethylenesulfone which have a low molecular weight. These can be used alone or in combination of plurality of them.","The solid content of the polyamic acid solution is preferably from about 5% by weight to about 40% by weight and more preferably from about 10% by weight to about 30% by weight. When the solid content is about 40% by weight or less, the solution may be easily applied and the uniformity of a coating film may be secured. When the solid content is about 5% by weight or more, the film thickness having strength may be easily obtained. Although the viscosity of the polyamic acid solution is not particularly limited, the solution having a viscosity of from about 1 Pa\u00b7s to about 500 Pa\u00b7s may be easily handled in general.","Conductive Particle","Conductive particle  is contained in the resin layer . Conductive- or semiconductive-fine powers may be used as the conductive particle. There is no particular limitation on electrical conductivity of the conductive particle as long as it facilitates stably providing a desired electrical resistance to the belt. Examples of the conductive particle include: carbon black such as Ketjenblack, acetylene black, or oxidation-treated carbon black having a pH of 5 or lower; metals such as aluminum or nickel; metal oxide compounds such as a tin oxide; and potassium titanate. These substances may be used singly or in combination, and carbon black is preferable in view of its advantage in price. The \u201cconductive\u201d used herein means that the volume resistivity is lower than about 10\u03a9cm. Further, the \u201csemiconductive\u201d means that the volume resistivity is from about 10to about 10\u03a9cm. The same meanings are applied thereto in the following description.","Two or more kinds of carbon blacks may be used in combination. Carbon blacks which are used in combination are preferably different from each other in conductivity. For example, a combination of carbon blacks which are different in physical properties such as a degree of oxidation treatment, a DBP oil absorption amount, or a specific surface area by BET method utilizing nitrogen adsorption (a method of calculating the surface area per g from the amount of adsorbed nitrogen), can be used. Here, the DBP oil absorption amount (ml\/100 g) denotes the amount of dibutyl phthalate (DBP) which can be absorbed by 100 g of carbon black and is a value defined by ASTM (U.S. standard test method) D2414-6TT. The BET method is defined by JIS K6217, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.","When two or more kinds of carbon blacks having different electrical conductivities are used in combination in the belt, a surface resistivity of the belt can be adjusted by adding carbon black manifesting high electric conductivity is added in advance and then adding carbon black having a low electric conductivity. When two or more kinds of carbon blacks are contained in the belt, mixing and dispersing of both carbon blacks can be enhanced by using acidic carbon black as at least one kind of them.","The method for producing the endless belt  constituted by the resin layer  according to this exemplary embodiment will be described.  are flow charts illustrating the method for producing the endless belt  according to this exemplary embodiment.","In the method for producing the endless belt  according to this exemplary embodiment, a coating liquid containing the conductive particles , a resin material, and a solvent is prepared first. Then, as illustrated in , the coating liquid is applied to a cylindrical metal mold  to obtain a coating film  formed from the coating liquid.","There is no particular limitation a method for applying the coating liquid to the cylindrical metal mold  to form the coating film  having an endless shape. Examples of the application method include: immersing an external circumferential surface of a cylindrical mold in the solution; coating the solution on an internal circumferential surface of a cylindrical mold and may further centrifuging the mold; and filling the solution into an injection mold. The mold may be treated to be releasable in advance of the formation of the endless belt.","An examplary embodiment of a method of producing the polyamide acid solution, in which carbon black (the conductive particle ) is dispersed, will be described below, although the method is not limited thereto.","First, purified carbon black is prepared and subjected to dispersing in an organic polar solvent. The dispersing may be preferably a method including dispersing carbon black with a disperser or a homogenizer after preliminary stirring is performed. In addition, the dispersing may be preferably a media-free dispersion method using no media, since contamination with fine media may reduce purification effect of carbon black, as is similar to the refining of carbon black. Particularly preferable examples of the media-free dispersion method include a method including utilization of a jet mill since it is capable of dispersing a high viscosity solution while suppressing unevenness in dispersing degree of carbon black.","The diamine component and the acid anhydride component are dissolved in the thus-obtained carbon black dispersion, and polymerization is performed to prepare a polyamide acid solution in which carbon black is dispersed.","The concentrations of monomers to be dissolved in the carbon black dispersion (namely, the concentration of the diamine component and the concentration of the acid anhydride component in a solvent) can be respectively determined depending on various conditions, and are respectively preferably from about 5% by weight to about 30% by weight. Further, the polymerization reaction temperature can be adjusted to preferably about 80\u00b0 C. or lower, and particularly preferably from about 5\u00b0 C. to about 50\u00b0 C. The reaction time is from about 5 hours to about 10 hours.","Since the polyamide acid solution in which carbon black is dispersed is a high viscosity solution, an air bubble is generated during preparation of the solution is not naturally removed therefrom, and defects such as projection, recess or a hole due to an air bubble may occur upon coating of the solution for forming the belt. In consideration of this, the polyamide acid solution is desirably subjected to defoaming. It is preferable that the coating of the polyamide acid solution is performed as soon as possible upon the defoaming.","Next, the coating film  applied to the cylindrical metal mold  is dried. The drying may be carried out so that a content ratio of the solvent remaining in the coating film  is about 25% or less, preferably about 20% or less, and still more preferably about 15% or less. When the content ratio of the solvent remaining in the coating film  is excessive, uneven distribution (density increasing) of the conductive particles  may be difficult to occur at the inner side in the thickness direction of the region defined as the detection region A. In contrast, when the content ratio of the solvent remaining in the coating film  is smaller, uneven distribution (density increasing) of the conductive particles  may be likely to occur. By regulating the content ratio of the solvent remaining in the coating film , i.e., by regulating the drying state of the coating film , A degree of uneven distribution (density) of the conductive particles  in the detection region A may be regulated, and the position in the thickness direction of the area (high density region B), in which the conductive particles  are localized may also be regulated, in the detection region A of the endless belt  to be obtained.","Here, the \u201ccontent ratio of the solvent remaining in the coating film  (, that is herein also referred to as the content ratio of the remaining solvent)\u201d is expressed in terms of a proportion of a weight of the solvent remaining in the coating film after drying with respect to a weight of the solvent contained in the coating film before drying. The content ratio of the remaining solvent may be determined as follows.","For example, when the amount of the solid content of the resin material (dry weight of the resin material) and that of the conductive particle are known, the total amount of the coating film before the drying is accurately weighed, and then the amount of the solvent included in the total amount of the coating film is calculated. Thereafter, the total amount of the coating film after the drying is accurately weighed. A difference between the total amount of the coating film before the drying and the total amount of the coating film after the drying (reduction amount) is defined as the amount of the lost solvent. The content ratio of the remaining solvent is determined by calculating: [(the total amount of the coating film after the drying)\u2212(the amount of the solid content of the resin material)\u2212(the amount of the conductive particle)]\/[(the total amount of the coating film before the drying)\u2212(the amount of the solid content of the resin material)\u2212(the amount of the conductive particle)].","The content ratio of the remaining solvent may be alternatively determined using a thermal extraction gas chromatography mass spectroscopy. An exemplary embodiment of this measurement will be described below. In the exemplary embodiment, about 2 mg or more to about 3 mg or less of the coating film after the drying is cut out to obtain a sample. Then, the sample is weighed, placed in a heat extractor (trade name: PY2020D, manufactured by Frontier Laboratories, Ltd.), and heated to 400\u00b0 C. Volatilized components are injected into a gas chromatogram mass spectrometer (trade name: GCMS-QP2010, manufactured by Shimadzu Corp.) through a 320\u00b0 C. interface, and then quantified. More specifically, the volatilized component is injected into the gas chromatogram mass spectrometer using helium gas as a carrier gas in an amount of 1\/51 of the component volatilized from the sample (split ratio of 50:1) in a column having an inner diameter of 0.25 \u03bcm\u00d730 m (trade name: CAPILLARY COLUMN UA-5, manufactured by Frontier Laboratories, Ltd.) at a linear velocity of 153.8 cm (a carrier gas flow rate at a column temperature of 50\u00b0 C. of 1.50 ml\/minute and a pressure of 50 kPa). Subsequently, the column is held at 50\u00b0 C. for 3 minutes, the temperature of the column is raised to 400\u00b0 C. at a rate of 8\u00b0 C.\/min, and then the column is held at the same temperature for 10 minutes so as to desorb the volatilized component. Further, the volatilized component is injected into a mass spectrometer at an interface temperature of 320\u00b0 C. to find a peak corresponding to the solvent in a chromatogram obtained by the gas chromatography, and the area of the peak is determined. A calibration curve which is prepared in advance using known amounts of the same solvent is used to quantify the amount of the solvent corresponding to the peak. The amount of the solvent thus quantified is divided by \u201c(the total amount of the coating film before the drying)\u2212(the amount of the solid content of the resin material)\u2212(the amount of the conductive particle)\u201d, which corresponds to the total amount of the solvent in the coating film before the drying, to determine the amount of the remaining solvent.","The exemplary embodiment of the measurement is described for the purpose of showing one exemplary embodiment, and the measurement conditions are not limited thereto. The measurement conditions may be changed according to decomposition behavior of the resin to be used, temperature changes of the resin to be used, the boiling point of the solvent to be used and the like.","Next, as illustrated in , an elution solvent  for eluting the resin material is applied only to a target region A\u2032, which is to be made into the detection region A, in the surface of the dried coating film . More specifically, the elution solvent  is applied only to the target region A\u2032, which is to be made into the detection region A among all the areas in the surface of the coating film , and the elution solvent  is not applied to regions other than the target region A\u2032 (regions B\u2032 in ).","Examples of methods for applying the elution solvent  only to the target region A\u2032 include a method including masking the region B\u2032, which is other than the target region A\u2032, on the surface of the dried coating film  by providing a sheet (not illustrated) insoluble in the elution solvent  so that only the target region A\u2032 is exposed to the open air. Here, the elution solvent  may be applied only to the target region A\u2032 as a result by applying the elution solvent  to the entire of the sheet. The sheet is removed after the detection region A is formed.","In the target region A\u2032 to which the elution solvent  has been applied, the elution solvent  permeates in the dried coating film . Therefore, in the coating film , the region adjacent to the interface with the permeating elution solvent  is swollen with the elution solvent . In this case, the amount of the solvent which is present in the elution solvent  adjacent to the interface is larger than the amount of the solvent which is present in a portion which is a part of the coating film  and is adjacent to the interface with the elution solvent  (namely, the former has a high solvent concentration than latter). Therefore, the resin material contained in the permeating solution in the portion which is a part of the coating film  and is adjacent to the interface with the elution solvent  is easily eluted into the side of the elution solvent .","As illustrated in , the conductive particles  are not eluted in the elution solvent . Accordingly, when the resin material is eluted into the side of the elution solvent , the density of the conductive particles  in the target region A\u2032 where the resin material has been eluted out increases as compared with the other regions which reside in the thickness direction of the target region A\u2032 according to the elution of the resin material. As a result, a localization region A, in which the conductive particles  are localized, is formed on the surface of the target region A\u2032 (a region adjacent to the interface with the elution solvent ).","The elution solvent  is a solvent for eluting the resin material. Therefore, the elution solvent is selected from solvents that dissolve the resin material. Here, the description \u201csolvent that dissolves resin materials\u201d means that the solid content of a dissolved resin based on the total amount of the solvent at 25\u00b0 C. is about 10% by weight or more.","The elution solvent may be preferably the same solvent as that used in the coating liquid. Examples of the elution solvent employed when the coating liquid is a polyamide acid solution include a polar solvent. As a polar solvent, N,N-dialkylamides are preferable, and examples thereof include N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, N,N-diethylformamide, N,N-diethylacetamide, N,N-dimethylmethoxyacetamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, hexamethylphosphortriamide, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, pyridine, tetramethylenesulfone, and di methyltetramethylenesulfone which have a low molecular weight. These can be used alone or in combination of plurality of them.","The application amount of the elution solvent  may be typically from about 0.001 g\/cmto about 1 g\/cm, preferably from about 0.01 g\/cmto about 1 g\/cm, and more preferably from about 0.01 g\/cmto about 0.5 g\/cm.","The surface resistivity of the detection region A may be adjusted by adjusting the application amount of the elution solvent  and\/or the application time of the elution solvent .","Next, as illustrated in , the elution solvent  applied to the target region A\u2032 of the coating film  is dried. The drying may be carried out so that, for example, the content ratio of the remaining solvent is about 10% or lower. The content ratio of the remaining solvent may be determined based on the kind of the resin material to be used, application purpose of the endless belt  to be obtained, strength of the endless belt  to be obtained, maintenance properties of the endless belt  to be obtained, or the like.","The elution solvent  applied to the coating film  contains eluted resin material. Therefore, the resin material precipitates by drying the elution solvent . The precipitated resin material forms a laminar structure on the localization region A in which the conductive particles  are localized. In this case, the applied elution solvent  does not contain the conductive particles . Therefore, the resin region A, which does not contain the conductive particles , is formed on the localization region A, in which the conductive particles  are localized.","As a result, the detection region A, in which the resin region A, the high density region B, and the rear surface region C are provided in this order from the surface, is produced. The resin region A basically does not contain the conductive particles , although a few conductive particles  may move to the applied elution solvent  to be contained in the resin region A due to the production method.","In the region B\u2032, to which the elution solvent  has not been applied, the dispersion state of the conductive particles  in the state where the coating film  is dried as shown in  is maintained.","The endless belt  containing the resin layer  having the detection region A and the non-detection region B, which are two areas different in the surface resistivity in the surface of the endless belt , may be produced through the above process.","The endless belt  having the resin layer  obtained by the process described above has two areas different in the surface resistivity in the plane direction of the detection region A (having a surface resistivity lower than that of the non-detection region B) and the non-detection region B. The detection region A has the resin region A where the conductive particles  are not present, the high density region B, and the rear surface region C in this order from the top surface in the thickness direction. The high density region B is an area where the density of the conductive particles  is higher than that of the resin region A, the rear surface region C, and the non-detection region B.","The resin layer  may be produced by this production method. Thus, when the resin layer  is divided into plural portions having the same surface area, the contents of the conductive particles  in respective portions are approximately the same value. Therefore, the resin layer  in which the volume resistivity is constant along the circumferential direction may be produced.","The description \u201cthe volume resistivity is constant\u201d, specifically means that the common logarithm value of volume resistivity of each region in the surface of the endless belt  is a value of about \u00b10.5 or lower and preferably a value of about \u00b10.3 or lower to the average value calculated from the common logarithm values of volume resistivity of all the regions in the surface of the endless belt  (the resin layer ) produced by the production method.","The value of \u201c\u00b10.5 or lower\u201d is within the range of slight variations in resistance generally present in various conductive or semi-conductive annular members used in electrophotographic image forming devices.","On the other hand, the detection region A and the non-detection region B, which are two kinds of regions which are different in the surface resistivity, are formed in the surface of the resin layer .","When a resin precursor such as a polyamide acid solution is used to form a polyimide resin as the resin material, the endless belt  may be produced by performing sintering after the drying of the elution solvent . The sintering (namely, the conversion of polyamide acid to imide) is generally performed by subjecting the polyamide acid to high temperature of about 200\u00b0 C. or more. The conversion may not be sufficiently achieved when the temperature is lower than about 200\u00b0 C. Although the conversion with high temperature can be advantageous for imide conversion to obtain stable properties, thermal efficiency of the conversion with high temperature may be inferior and high cost may be required due to the use of thermal energy. Thus, the heating temperature for the conversion may be determined in view of properties and productivity of the endless belt.","Cartridge",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0101","num":"0100"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},"A cartridge  according to this exemplary embodiment contains the endless belt  according to this exemplary embodiment, a detecting device , and a follower roll  and a driving roll  as support units as illustrated in .","The endless belt  is held under tension by the follower roll  and the driving roll  that are disposed facing with each other (hereinafter sometimes referred to as \u201ctensioned\u201d).

At least one of the image holding unit, the transfer unit, or the fixing unit has the configuration of the endless belt .","The charging unit, the developing unit, and the fixing unit respectively have a configuration containing the endless belt  as an annular body.","Herein, explanation is given for an exemplary embodiment in which the endless belt  is employed as the transfer unit, which may be also referred to as an intermediate transfer belt.","As shown in , the image forming apparatus  is provided with first to fourth image forming units (image forming means) Y, M, C, and K of an electrophotographic system for outputting an image of each color of yellow (Y), magenta (M), cyan (C) and black (K) based on color-separated image data.","The units Y, M, C, and K are horizontally arranged with a certain space therebetween. The units Y, M, C and K may be process cartridges attachable to and detachable from the main body of the image forming apparatus.","Above the respective units Y, M, C and K in the Figure, the endless belt  is arranged as a transfer body (that may be also referred to as an intermediate transfer belt) through the respective units. The endless belt  is arranged by being wound around a driving roll  and a follower roll  in contact with the inner surface of the endless belt , and the endless belt  runs in the direction of from the first unit Y to the fourth unit K so as to form a cartridge for the image forming apparatus. Herein, the driving roll  functions as the driving roll  in the cartridge , and a follower roll  functions as the follower roll  in the cartridge .","The driving roll  is biased with a spring or the like (not shown) so as to be apart from the follower roll , and a tension is applied to the endless belt  wound between the two rolls. An intermediate transfer body cleaning device  is provided at a side of an image holding unit of the endless belt  so as to be opposite to the driving roll .","Toners of yellow, magenta, cyan, or black-colored and held in toner cartridges Y, M, C or K are respectively supplied to developing device (developing units) Y, M, C or K for the respective units Y, M, C and K.","Each of the first to fourth units Y, M, C and K has a configuration similar to one another. Accordingly, only the first unit Y forming a yellow image, arranged on the upstream side of the endless belt , is herein explained. Explanations of the second to fifth units M, C and K are omitted by assigning reference marks given magenta (M), cyan (C) and black (K) in place of yellow (Y) given to the equivalent part of the first unit Y.","The first unit Y has an image holding unit Y which works as an image holding member. A charging roll Y, an exposure device  (a latent image forming exposure unit), a development device Y (developing unit), a primary transfer roll Y (transfer unit) and a photoreceptor cleaning device Y (cleaning unit) are sequentially provided around the image holding unit Y. The charging roll Y electrically charges the surface of the image holding unit Y. The exposure device  exposes the charged surface to laser light Y according to color-separated image signals to form an electrostatic latent image. The development device Y develops the electrostatic latent image by feeding a charged toner contained in the developer to the electrostatic latent image. The primary transfer roll Y transfers the resultant toner image onto the endless belt . The photoreceptor cleaning device Y removes a toner remaining on the surface of the image holding unit Y after primary transfer.","The primary transfer roll Y is arranged in the inside of the endless belt  and arranged in a position opposite to the image holding unit Y. A bias power source (not shown) for applying primary transfer bias is electrically connected to each of the primary transfer rollers Y, M, C and K. Each bias power source may be controlled by controller (not shown) to change the transfer bias applied to each primary transfer roller.","Hereinafter, an operation of forming a yellow image in the first unit Y is described. First, the surface of the image holding unit Y is charged at a potential of about \u2212600 V to about \u2212800V with a charging roll Y prior to operation (charging).","The image holding unit Y is formed by disposing a photosensitive layer on an electroconductive substrate having a volume resistivity at 20\u00b0 C.: 1\u00d710\u03a9cm or less. This photosensitive layer is usually highly resistant (with approximately the same resistance as that of general resin), but upon irradiation with laser ray Y, changes the specific resistance of the portion irradiated with the laser ray. According to image data for black sent from the controller (not shown), the layer ray Y is outputted from the exposure device  onto the surface of the charged image holding unit Y. The photosensitive layer as the surface portion of the image holding unit Y is irradiated with the laser ray K, whereby an electrostatic latent image in a yellow print pattern is formed on the surface of the image holding unit Y (electrostatic latent image forming).","An electrostatic latent image is an image formed on the surface of the image holding unit Y by charging. The electrostatic latent is a negative latent image that is obtained by causing the electrification charge of the surface of the image holding unit Y to flow due to a reduction in the specific resistance of the irradiated portion of the photosensitive layer, while charge remains on the portion not irradiated with laser ray Y. The electrostatic latent image thus formed on the image holding unit Y is rotated to a development position with running of the image holding unit Y. In this development position, the electrostatic latent image on the image holding unit Y is visualized (developed) with the development device Y (developing).","The yellow toner is accommodated in the development device Y. The yellow toner is stirred in the inside of the development device Y and thereby frictionally charged and retained on a developer roll (developer-holding member) and has the same polarity (negative polarity) as that of electrification charge on the image holding unit Y. Then, the surface of the image holding unit Y passes through the development device Y, thereby allowing the yellow toner to electrostatically adhere to the electrically neutralized latent image portion on the surface of the image holding unit Y, and thus developing the latent image with the yellow toner. The image holding unit Y having the resultant yellow toner image formed thereon is subsequently delivered, and the toner image developed on the image holding unit Y is sent to a primary transfer position.","When the black toner image on the image holding unit Y reaches the primary transfer position, a primary transfer bias is applied to the primary transfer roll Y, and electrostatic force from the image holding unit Y to the primary transfer roll Y acts on the toner image, and the toner image on the image holding unit Y is transferred onto the endless belt . The transfer bias to be applied has polarity (+) reverse to the polarity of the toner (\u2212), and for example, the transfer bias in the fourth unit Y is regulated at about +10 \u03bcA by the controller (not shown). On the other hand, the toner remaining on the image holding unit Y is removed and recovered by a cleaning device Y.","The primary transfer bias applied to primary transfer rollers M, C and K after second unit M is also controlled in the same manner as in the first unit.","The endless belt  having the yellow toner image transferred thereon in the first unit Y is delivered through the second to fourth units M, C and K in this order, whereby plural color toner images are transferred in a layered state.","The endless belt  having four color toner images transferred thereon through the first to fourth units reaches a secondary transfer part composed of the endless belt , the support roll  in contact with the inner surface of the endless belt , and a secondary transfer roll  (secondary transfer unit) arranged in the side of the image-holding surface of the endless belt . On one hand, a recording paper P (recording medium) is fed via a feeding mechanism with specified time into a gap between the secondary transfer roll  and the endless belt  that are contacted with each other with pressure, and a secondary transfer bias is applied to the driving roll . The transfer bias to be applied has the same polarity (\u2212) as the polarity of the toner (\u2212), and electrostatic force from the endless belt  to the recording paper P acts on the toner image, and the toner image on the endless belt  is transferred onto the recording paper P (transferring). The secondary transfer bias is determined depending on resistance detected by a resistance detecting device (not shown) for detecting the resistance of the secondary transfer part and is voltage-controlled.","Thereafter, the recording paper P is sent to a fixing device  (fixing unit) where the multiple color toner image is heated, and the multiple color toner image is coalesced and fixed on the recording paper P (fixing). After completion of the fixation of the color image, the recording paper P is delivered toward an ejection portion to finish a series of the color-image forming operations.","While the image formation apparatus  of the exemplary embodiment has a configuration of transferring a toner image via the endless belt  to the recording paper P, the configuration of the image formation apparatus is not restricted only thereto, and it may have a structure in which the toner image is directly transferred from a photoreceptor to the recording paper.","The image forming apparatus  having this configuration is provided with a controller  for controlling each unit of the device. The controller  is connected to each unit of the device so as to be able to send and\/or accept a signal. Specifically, the controller  is connected to the first to fourth units Y, M, C, and K, the exposure device , and various appliances disposed in each unit of the device so as to be able to send and\/or accept a signal. By the control of the controller , the toner images of respective colors are successively multi-transferred on the outer peripheral surface of the endless belt  by the exposure device  and the first to fourth units Y, M, C, and K, and finally a color image is formed on the recording medium P.","In the image forming apparatus  of this exemplary embodiment, the detecting device  (detecting unit) is provided between each unit of the first to fourth units Y, M, C, and K. The detecting devices  are connected to the controller  so as to be able to send and\/or accept a signal. The detecting devices  are provided at the position at which the detecting devices  can detect the detection region A provided in the endless belt .","In this exemplary embodiment, the description is given to the case where each of the detecting devices  is used for adjusting the time for transferring the toner images to the endless belt  in the unit provided adjacent to the downstream side of the rotation direction (direction indicated by the arrow Z in ) of the endless belt .","The detection region A of the endless belt  of this exemplary embodiment is a region having a surface resistivity different from that of the non-detection region B by providing the high density region B inside thereof. Therefore, the detection region A is integrally provided with the endless belt .","The image forming apparatus  of this exemplary embodiment illustrated in  is exemplified to show the case where the endless belt  is used for the transfer body, although the application of the endless belt  is not limited thereto. Further improvement in image quality may be achieved in the image forming device by detecting the detection region A with favorable accuracy over a long period of time by measuring the surface resistivity of the annular bodies to which the endless belt  is applied while using the endless belt  as various annular bodies of the image forming device and using the same for controlling times for various operations.","In this exemplary embodiment, the image forming device forms the toner image on the intermediate transfer belt (endless belt ), and then the toner image is transferred to the recording medium P is described. Alternatively, the image forming device may have a configuration in which an image is formed by directly transferring the toner images from an image holding unit to the recording medium P conveyed by using the intermediate transfer belt as a conveying belt, and then fixing the toner images. In this case, when the endless belt  is used as the conveying belt, deterioration of image quality may be effectively suppressed.","In the first exemplary embodiment, the mode where the endless belt  has the resin layer  containing the resin and the conductive particles  is described. In this exemplary embodiment, a mode in which magnetic particles  having magnetic property are used in place of the conductive particles  will be described.","The expression that \u201ca material has magnetic property\u201d means that the material has properties of generating magnetism by applying a magnetic field, and may be either paramagnetic property or ferromagnetic property.","The magnetic particle  is not particularly limited as long as it has magnetic property. The magnetic particle  may have conductivity together with magnetic property. The definition of conductivity is explained in the description of the first exemplary embodiment.","An endless belt  in this exemplary embodiment has the same configuration as the endless belt  described in the first exemplary embodiment, except that the magnetic particles  having magnetic property are used in place of the conductive particles . The same parts are designated by the same reference numerals, and the detailed descriptions therefor are omitted hereinafter.","As illustrated in , the endless belt  contains a resin and the magnetic particles .","Similarly to the resin layer  in the first exemplary embodiment, the resin layer  contains a non-detection region B and a detection region A. As illustrated in , the detection region A has a resin region A, a high density region B, and a rear surface region C which are positioned in this order in the thickness direction from the top surface in the thickness direction.","The \u201csurface (of the endless belt )\u201d referred in this exemplary embodiment means the surface which is to be subjected to measurement of the magnetic flux density by a detecting device (explained below). The \u201ctop surface\u201d means an area of the outermost side of the resin layer .","When the magnetic flux density is measured from the inner peripheral surface of the endless belt  by a detecting device , the \u201csurface\u201d refers to the inner peripheral surface of the endless belt . When the magnetic flux density is measured from the outer peripheral surface of the endless belt  by the detecting device , the \u201csurface\u201d refers to the outer peripheral surface of the endless belt . Herein, the explanation of this exemplary embodiment is made with defining the \u201csurface\u201d as the peripheral outer surface of the endless belt .","The resin region A is an area where substantially no magnetic particles  is present, i.e., an area where only a resin is present. The high density region B is an area where the density of the magnetic particles  is higher than that of the resin region A and that of the rear surface region C, which are other areas provided along the thickness direction of the detection region A, and also higher than that of the non-detection region B. Therefore, the high density region B is a highly magnetic area, the magnetism of which is higher than that of the resin region A and that of the rear surface region C, which are areas other than the high density region B in the detection region A, and higher than that of the non-detection region B.","Therefore, the magnetic flux density of the detection region A is higher than that of the non-detection region B.","The expression of \u201cmagnetic flux density of a region is higher\u201d means that an amount of magnetic flux per unit area is larger with respective to external magnetic field having a certain intensity and applied to the region.","In the endless belt , the magnetic flux density of the detection region A and the magnetic flux density of the non-detection region B are different from each other. Therefore, the detection region A and the non-detection region B are easily detected by measuring the magnetic flux density generated by application of a magnetic field having a certain intensity of the endless belt . Thus, the detection region A is used to detect a position of a measured portion in the endless belt .","The difference between the magnetic flux density of the detection region A and the magnetic flux density of the non-detection region B is at least one which enables detection of the detection region A by the detecting device , which is explained below, when a magnetic field having a certain intensity is applied to these areas.","For example, a difference in the magnetic flux density when a magnetic field having a strength of 10 kOe is applied as a predetermined magnetic field is preferably about 25 mT or more, and more preferably about 30 mT or more.","When the difference in the magnetic flux density between the detection region A and the non-detection region B is in this range, the detection region A may be preferably detected by the measurement of the magnetic flux density of the endless belt .","In contrast, when the difference in the magnetic flux density between the detection region A and the non-detection region B is less than about 25 mT, which is the lower limit of this range, the difference in the magnetic flux density between the detection region A and the magnetic flux density of the non-detection region B may be too small, which may cause erroneous detection of the non-detection region B by the detecting device .","In this exemplary embodiment, the resin layer  of the endless belt  has the detection region A and the non-detection region B, which are at the surface of the resin layer  and differ in the magnetic flux density. The detection region A has the magnetic flux density lower than that of the non-detection region B. The detection region A has the resin region A where substantially no magnetic particles  is present, the high density region B, and the rear surface region C, which are present in this order from the top surface along the thickness direction.","The detection region A of the endless belt  of this exemplary embodiment is integrally provided in the endless belt .","The conditions of the thickness of the resin region A and the positions of the resin region A and the high density region B in terms of the thickness direction are similar to those of the thickness of the resin region A and the positions of the resin region A and the high density region B in terms of the thickness direction in the first exemplary embodiment respectively, and thus detailed explanations therefor are herein omitted.","Similarly to the resin layer  in the first exemplary embodiment, when the resin layer  is divided into plural portions having the same surface area, the contents of the magnetic particles  in respective portions are the same value. This condition may be achieved by the production method which is the same as that used for producing the resin layer . The definition of the expression of \u201ccontents of one material in objects are the same value\u201d and \u201csame content\u201d is explained in the description of the first exemplary embodiment.","As is similar to the first exemplary embodiment, the absence or presence of the magnetic particles  in the resin region A, the high density region B, and the rear surface region C may be observed by: a method including producing a cross section piece of the belt (a piece of the endless belt ) by a focused ion beam (FIB), and then observing the cross section piece with a transmission electron microscope to directly observe the absence or presence of the particles; and a method including producing a cross section piece of the belt with a microtome, and then obtaining the height information from an atomic force microscope (AFM) to see the absence or presence of the particles.","Although the endless belt  in this exemplary embodiment has a configuration provided with a single layer of the resin layer , the configuration of the annular body, which is one aspect of the invention, is not limited thereto. In another exemplary embodiment, the annular body, which is one aspect of the invention, may have a configuration in which other functional layers are provided on the outer peripheral surface or inner peripheral surface of the resin layer . In this case, the other functional layers are layers that do not change the difference in the magnetic flux density between the detection region A and the non-detection region B in the resin layer , or layers which allow detection of the difference by the detecting device even when the magnetic flux density is changed by the other functional layers.","In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in , the detection regions A are provided at given intervals along the edge of the endless belt . The detection region A is not required to be provided in the entire of the surface of the resin layer . It is sufficient as long as the detection region A is provided in a part(s) of the surface of the resin layer  according to application purposes. The detection region A may be provided at any position of the surface of the resin layer . For example, the detection region A may be provided at the center in the width direction as illustrated in . Since the detection region A is detected by measurement of the magnetic flux density, the place at which the detection region A is not specified in the surface of the endless belt . In contrast to conventional arts in which the position of the detection region is limited to the peripheral edge or the like, the detection region A may be formed at any place in the surface of the endless belt .","In this exemplary embodiment, plural detection regions A are provided in the surface of the endless belt . However, it is sufficient as long as at least one detection region A is provided. Plural detection regions A may not be necessary.","A portion (area) of the detection region A revealing on the surface of the endless belt  may have any shape insofar as the shape may be easily detected by a cartridge  or an image forming apparatus  described below. Examples of the shape include a circular shape and a rectangular shape.","Hereinafter, the components and properties of the endless belt  according to this embodiment will be described.","The endless belt  has a configuration in which the resin layer  is formed into an annular shape, i.e., an endless belt.","The resin material (resin) contained in the resin layer  is similar to that contained in the resin layer .","A powder having magnetic property is used as the magnetic particle  contained in the resin layer . The magnetic particle  has magnetic property. In embodiments, the magnetic particle  may have both properties of magnetic property and conductivity.","Specific examples of a material of the magnetic particle  include triiron tetraoxide (FeO), iron oxide (FeO), gadolinium oxide, magnetite, maghematite, various ferrites (such as MnZn ferrite, NiZn ferrite, Yfe garnet, GaFe garnet, Ba ferrite, or Sr ferrite), and metals or alloys thereof (such as iron, manganese, cobalt, nickel, chromium, gadolinium, or alloys thereof). These substances may be used singly or in combination. In embodiments, triiron tetraoxide and iron oxide which are paramagnetic substances may be used from the viewpoint of improvement in dispersibility.","The endless belt  having the resin layer  in this exemplary embodiment may produced in the similar manner as the endless belt  having the resin layer  in the first exemplary embodiment, except that the magnetic particles  having magnetic property are used in place of the conductive particles  (see ).","Since details of the method for producing the endless belt  are similar to those of the method for producing the endless belt , only the outline of the method for producing the endless belt  is herein described.","In the method for producing the endless belt  according to this exemplary embodiment, a coating liquid containing the magnetic particles , a resin material, and a solvent is prepared first. Then, as illustrated in , the coating liquid is applied to a cylindrical metal mold  to obtain a coating film  formed from the coating liquid.","Next, the coating film  applied to the cylindrical metal mold  is dried.","Next, as illustrated in , an elution solvent  for eluting the resin material is applied only to a target region A\u2032, which is to be made into the detection region A, in the surface of the dried coating film . More specifically, the elution solvent  is applied only to the target region A\u2032, which is to be made into the detection region A among all the areas in the surface of the coating film , and the elution solvent  is not applied to regions other than the target region A\u2032 (regions B\u2032 in ).","As illustrated in , the magnetic particles  are not eluted in the elution solvent . Accordingly, when the resin material is eluted into the side of the elution solvent , the density of the magnetic particles  in the target region A\u2032 where the resin material has been eluted out increases as compared with the other regions which reside in the thickness direction of the target region A\u2032 according to the elution of the resin material. As a result, a localization region A, in which the magnetic particles  are localized, is formed on the surface of the target region A\u2032 (a region adjacent to the interface with the elution solvent ).","Next, as illustrated in , the elution solvent  applied to the target region A\u2032 of the coating film  is dried. The resin material precipitates by the drying of the elution solvent . The precipitated resin material forms a laminar structure on the localization region A in which the magnetic particles  are localized. In this case, the applied elution solvent  does not contain the magnetic particles . Therefore, the resin region A, which does not contain the magnetic particles , is formed on the localization region A, in which the magnetic particles  are localized.","As a result, the detection region A, in which the resin region A, the high density region B, and the rear surface region C are provided in this order from the surface, is produced.","On the other hand, in the region B\u2032, to which the elution solvent  has not been applied, the dispersion state of the magnetic particles  in the state where the coating film  is dried as shown in  is maintained.","The endless belt  containing the resin layer  having the detection region A and the non-detection region B, which are two areas different in the magnetic flux density in the surface of the endless belt , may be produced through this process.","The endless belt  having the resin layer  obtained by this process has two areas different in the magnetic flux density in the plane direction of the detection region A (having a magnetic flux density larger than that of the non-detection region B) and the non-detection region B. The detection region A has the resin region A where the magnetic particles  are not present, the high density region B, and the rear surface region C in this order from the top surface in the thickness direction. The high density region B is an area where the density of the magnetic particles  is larger than that of the resin region A, the rear surface region C, and the non-detection region B.","The resin layer  may be produced by this production method. Thus, when the resin layer  is divided into plural portions having the same surface area, the contents of the magnetic particles  in respective portions are approximately the same value. Therefore, the resin layer  in which the volume resistivity is constant along the circumferential direction may be produced.","On the other hand, the detection region A and the non-detection region B, which are two kinds of regions which are different in the magnetic flux density, are formed in the surface of the resin layer .","Cartridge","A cartridge  according to this exemplary embodiment contains the endless belt  according to this exemplary embodiment, a detecting device , and a follower roll  and a driving roll  as support units as illustrated in .","The endless belt  is held under tension by the follower roll  and the driving roll  that are disposed facing with each other (hereinafter sometimes referred to as \u201ctensioned\u201d). Then, the driving roll  is rotated in the circumferential direction by actuation of a driving unit (not illustrated), and then the follower roll  is rotated in the circumferential direction following the rotation of the driving roll . Thus, the endless belt  tensioned by the follower roll  and the driving roll  is rotated in the circumferential direction (direction indicated by the arrow Z in ).","The detecting device  is a device for detecting the detection region A provided in the resin layer  of the endless belt , and is provided at a position at which the detecting device  can detect the detection region A.","In this exemplary embodiment, the detection region A is provided so that the surface of the detection region A resides in the outer peripheral surface of the endless belt . Namely, the detection region A is provided so as to be disposed on the outer peripheral surface of the endless belt .","Therefore, the detecting device  is provided at a position where the detection regions A rotating with the rotation of the endless belt  can be successively detected when the endless belt  is rotated in the circumferential direction by the rotation of the follower roll  and the driving roll  (direction indicated by the arrow Z in ).

The strength of the magnetic field applied by the magnetic field applying device may be appropriately specified according to the type of magnetic materials of the magnetic particles  in the endless belt  to be measured or the density of the magnetic particles  in the high density region B or the non-detection region B in the detection region A of the endless belt .","The region where a magnetic field is applied by the magnetic field applying device may be adjusted in advance according to the shape of the detection region A to be measured, the position where the detection region A is formed, the dimension thereof, and the like. Specifically, in embodiments, a magnetic field may be selectively applied to at least the inside of the detection region A to be measured (namely, only to the detection region A, without including the non-detection region B). The region where the magnetic flux density is measured by the magnetic flux density measurement device may be adjusted in advance according to the shape of the detection region A to be measured, the position where the detection region A is formed, the dimension thereof, and the like. Specifically, in embodiments, only the magnetic flux density in the detection region A to be measured, to which a magnetic field has been applied by the magnetic field applying device (namely, only the detection region A, without including the non-detection region B), can be selectively measured.","When the magnetic flux density of the endless belt  generated when magnetic field is applied thereto by the magnetic field applying device is measured by the magnetic flux density measurement device, the detecting device  detects the detection region A on the endless belt . Specifically, information indicating the magnetic flux density of the detection region A generated when magnetic field having a certain intensity is applied thereto is stored (memorized) in advance, and the magnetic flux density of the rotated endless belt  generated when magnetic field is applied thereto by the magnetic field applying device is measured by the magnetic flux density measurement device. Then, when a magnetic flux density is measured which exceeds the previously-stored information indicating the magnetic flux density of the detection region A, it may be determined that the detection region A has been detected.","The detection method of the detection region A is not limited to this method. The detection region A on the endless belt  may be detected by measuring the magnetic flux density of the rotated endless belt , and detecting the time for the magnetic flux density to return to a smaller state after changing from the small state to a large state.","In the cartridge  having this configuration, the driving roll  is rotated in the circumferential direction by actuation of a driving unit (not illustrated), and the follower roll  is rotated in the circumferential direction following the rotation of the driving roll , whereby the endless belt  tensioned by the follower roll  and driving roll  is rotated in the circumferential direction (direction indicated by the arrow Z in ).

Then, the resultant is dried by heating at 120\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes while rotating the resultant at 5 rpm.","The resultant is cooled to ambient temperature, and a sheet in which an opening (10 mm\u00d710 mm) is formed at a position which corresponds to a target region for forming a detection region (corresponding to the detection region A in ) is disposed on the dry film. Then, 10 ml of the NMP solution prepared in Example 1 is dropped in the openings, and dried at ambient temperature for 5 minutes. Then, the sheet is removed. The dry film is calcinated by heating to 300\u00b0 C. for 2 hours. The resultant is cooled to ambient temperature, a polyimide tubular body is separated from the core body, and then cut to have a width of 340 mm. Thus, an endless belt A2 is prepared.","The surface resistivity of the detection region and that of a non-detection region (equivalent to the non-detection region B in ), which is a region other than the detection region in the endless belt A2, are measured. The common logarithm value of surface resistivity of the detection regions is 6.7 Log \u03a9\/\u25a1, and the common logarithm value of surface resistivity of the non-detection region is 11.3 Log \u03a9\/\u25a1. Therefore, a difference in the common logarithm value of surface resistivity between the detection region and the non-detection region is 4.6 Log \u03a9\/\u25a1.","When the volume resistivity of the endless belt A2 is measured, the common logarithm value of volume resistivity is 8.1 Log \u03a9\u00b7cm in both the non-detection region and the detection region.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0245","num":"0244"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},"Preparation of Coating Liquid A3 (Polyimide Precursor Solution)","A magnetic particle-dispersed polyamic acid solution (coating liquid A3) is prepared in the same manner and under the same conditions as those in the preparation of the coating liquid A1 (polyimide precursor solution) in Example 1, except that 23 parts by mass of triiron tetraoxide (FeO) is used in place of 23 parts by mass of the dry oxidized carbon black (SPEDIAL BLACK4, described above) used in Example 1.","An endless belt A3 having an outer diameter of 190 mm, a thickness of 80 \u03bcm, and a width of 340 mm is prepared in the same manner as the endless belt A1, except that the coating liquid A3 is used in place of the coating liquid A1 used in Example 1. The outer peripheral surface of the thus-formed endless belt A3 has a 10 mm\u00d710 mm detection region, which corresponds to the detection region A in .","The magnetic flux density of the detection region and that of a non-detection region (equivalent to the non-detection region B in ), which is a region other than the detection region in the endless belt A3, are measured. The magnetic flux density of the detection regions is 50 mT, and the magnetic flux density of the non-detection region is 20 mT. Therefore, a difference in the magnetic flux density between the detection region and the non-detection region is 30 mT.","When the volume resistivity of the endless belt A3 is measured, the common logarithm value of volume resistivity is 12.0 Log \u03a9\u00b7cm in both the non-detection region and the detection region.","A belt-shaped member is produced using the same conditions and the same method as in the endless belt A2 prepared in Example 2, except that the dropping of the NMP solution on a dry film to form the detection region A is omitted. An aluminum seal, which functions as a detection region, is attached to an area, which corresponds to the detection region A in the endless belt A2 prepared in Example 2, in the belt-shaped member. A comparative endless belt A1 is thus prepared.","The aluminum seal is formed by applying a silicone adhesive to a rear surface of an aluminum sheet (10 mm\u00d710 mm), on which aluminum has been vapor-deposited on a PET film, to have a thickness of 5 \u03bcm.","Evaluation","The belts (the endless belts A1 to A3 and the comparative endless belt A1) are respectively subjected to the following evaluation tests. Results thereof are shown in the following Tables 1 to 3.","Evaluations of Accuracy in Position Detection Based on Surface Resistivity or Magnetic Flux Density and Visual Observation of Detection Region","Each of the obtained endless belts A1 to A3 and the comparative endless belt A1 is placed, as an intermediate transfer belt, on a modified machine of DOCUCOLOR 450 (trade name, manufactured by Fuji Xerox Co., Ltd.; process speed: 500 mm\/sec, primary transfer current: 45 \u03bcA, secondary transfer voltage: 3.5 kV), and subjected to a print test under the environment of 10\u00b0 C.\/15% RH. The test performs printing on 300000 sheets of A4 size-C2 paper manufactured by Fuji Xerox Co., Ltd.","Whether or not the position of the detection region can be detected from the detection region A in the endless belt A1 produced in Example 1 and that of the endless belt A2 produced in Example 2 is evaluated by measuring the surface resistivity of the detection region A in the endless belt A1 and that of the endless belt A2. This measurement is carried out at both of before and after the print test.","Whether or not the position of the detection region can be detected from the comparative endless belt A1 produced in Comparative Example 1 is evaluated by reading light reflection from the aluminum seal as the detection region using an optical sensor.","Whether or not the position of the detection region can be detected from the detection region A in the endless belt A3 produced in Example 3 is evaluated by measuring the magnetic flux density of the detection region A in the endless belt A3.
