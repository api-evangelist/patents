No. 60\/488,589, filed Jul. 18, 2003 and entitled \u201cMethod and System for Remote Conferencing\u201d.","1. Field","Embodiments described below generally relate to systems for viewing video data. More specifically, some aspects concern systems for providing video data to a network browser.","2. Discussion","Generally, conventional videoconferencing systems allow at least one meeting participant to view another meeting participant during a meeting. Videoconferencing systems thereby allow businesses to conduct \u201cface-to-face\u201d meetings between parties that are normally located remote from one another. As a result, businesses have saved significant travel-related expenses that would have otherwise been incurred in order to conduct such meetings.","Most videoconferencing systems require the use of specialized hardware at either end of a point-to-point connection (e.g., H.323). In a typical scenario, videoconferencing equipment is professionally installed in a dedicated videoconference room in a first location and in a similarly-dedicated videoconference room in a second location. Meeting participants are summoned to their respective rooms at a scheduled meeting time, and participants in each room are able to watch a video feed of the other room during the meeting.","Webcams have been proposed as a means to provide video images of meeting participants to other meeting participants. A Webcam may connect to a Universal Serial Bus port of a personal computer and send video images to a browser that requests the images from the computer. Webcam functions are incorporated into Web-based conferencing applications such as WebEX\u2122 and LiveMeeting\u2122. These applications may be configured to display a low-resolution, low frames-per-second \u201cheadshot\u201d view of a meeting participant on the desktop of another meeting participant.","Each of the foregoing systems presents inadequacies and inefficiencies. Cost, inflexibility, and infrastructure demands are primary shortcomings of the first systems described above. The above-described Web-based systems fail to provide adequate image quality, image control, security, scheduling capability, and\/or administrative capability.","To address the foregoing, some embodiments concern a system, a method, an apparatus, a computer-readable medium storing processor-executable process steps, and means to receive a Web page request, and transmit a Web page to a user device in response to the request. The Web page may include code usable by a Web browser of the user device to transmit a request for video data to a remote video source and to receive the video data directly from the remote video source. Embodiments may also include transmission of the Web page and a token to the user device, generation of a token, and transmission of the token to the remote video source, wherein the remote video source transmits the video data directly to the user device if the received token is associated with a token received from the user device with the request for video data.","Other embodiments may include transmission of a Web page request, reception of a Web page from a server in response to the request, transmission of a request for video data to a remote video source using code of the Web page, and reception of the video data directly from the remote video source. Also included in such embodiments may be display of the video data within the frame of the Web page in a first video format, display of a video format control based on code of the Web page, receipt of a user selection of the video format control, transmission of a second Web page request based on the selected control, receipt of a second Web page from the server in response to the second request, transmission of a second request for the video data to the remote video source using code of the second Web page, receipt of the video data directly from the remote video source, and display of the video data in a frame of the second Web page in a second video format.","Some embodiments provide a system including a user device to transmit a Web page request, a server to transmit a Web page to the user device in response to the request, and a remote video source to receive a request for video data from the user device and to transmit the video data directly to the user device. The user device transmits the request using code of the Web page. Further to these embodiments, the user device may transmit the request and authorization data to the server, and the server may validates the authorization data, transmit a token to the user device, and transmit the token to the remote video source. The remote video source may receive the request for video data and a request token from the user device, determine if the request token is associated with the token received from the server, and transmit the video data directly to the user device only if the request token is associated with the token received from the server.","The claimed invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments, however, as those in the art can readily adapt the description herein to create other embodiments and applications.","System Architecture",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","100","200","300"]},"Briefly, according to some embodiments, user device  transmits a Web page request to server , server  transmits a Web page to user device  in response to the request, and video source  receives a request for video data from user device  and transmits the video data directly to user device .

In some embodiments, user device  transmits a Web page request, receives a Web page from server  in response to the request, transmits a request for video data to video source  using code embedded in the Web page, and receives the video data directly from video source . User device  may display the video data in a frame of the Web page. A more detailed description of the architecture and operation of user device  according to some embodiments is set forth below.","Video source  comprises a video camera. According to some embodiments, video source  comprises the Axis 2130 PTZ network camera, which includes a Web server. Video source  may provide an application programming interface that may be used by external devices to control its elements. Video source  may comprise any other video source capable of the functionality that is required by the embodiments in which it is employed. According to some embodiments, video source  may comprise any device or devices capable of responding to requests from a Web browser and outputting a video stream. Video source  may comprise an analog or digital video recorder coupled to an embedded or external Web server.","Server  may comprise a conventionally-equipped Linux server, or any other cuurently- or hereafter-known device capable of the functions required thereof. An architecture of server  according to some embodiments will be described below with respect to . Server  may receive a Web page request and transmit a Web page to user device  in response to the request. The Web page may include code usable by a Web browser of user device  to transmit a request for video data to video source  and to receive the video data directly from video source . According to some embodiments, server  generates a token, transmits the token to user device  along with the Web page, and transmits the token to video source . Video source  then transmits the video data directly to user device  if the token it received from server  is associated with a token that it received from user device  along with the request for video data.","Devices  through  may communicate over any number of different systems for transferring data, including but not limited to a local area network, a wide area network, a telephone network, a cellular network, a fiber-optic network, a satellite network, an infra-red network, a radio frequency network, and any other type of network which may be used to transmit information between devices. Moreover, communication between devices  through  may proceed over any one or more currently or hereafter-known transmission protocols, such as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), Internet Protocol (IP), Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Wireless Application Protocol (WAP). In some embodiments, all data is transmitted over the World Wide Web.","User Device",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["100","110","120","110","100"]},"Also in communication with communication bus  is communication port . Communication port  may be used to transmit data to and receive data from external devices such as video source  and server . Communication port  is therefore preferably configured with hardware suitable to physically interface with desired external devices and\/or network connections. For example, communication port  may comprise an Ethernet connection to a local area network through which user device  may receive and transmit information over the Web.","Input device , display  and printer  are also in communication with communication bus .

Printer  may also present text and graphics, but in hardcopy form using ink-jet, thermal, dot-matrix, laser, or other printing technologies. Input device , display  and printer  may also be used in conjunction with other applications provided by user device  which are unrelated to the present invention.","RAM  is connected to communication bus  to provide microprocessor  with fast data storage and retrieval. In this regard, processor-executable process steps being executed by microprocessor  are typically stored temporarily in RAM  and executed therefrom by microprocessor . ROM , in contrast, provides storage from which data can be retrieved but to which data cannot be stored. Accordingly, ROM  is used to store invariant process steps and other data, such as basic input\/output instructions and data used during boot-up of user device  or to control communication port . It should be noted that one or both of RAM  and ROM  may communicate directly with microprocessor  instead of over communication bus .","Storage device  may comprise a fixed disk drive or other persistent storage medium. Storage device  stores, among other data, processor-executable process steps of Web browser . The process steps may be executed by microprocessor  to provide communication with remote Web servers such as those that might be integrated with video source  and server . In some embodiments, steps of Web browser  may be executed to transmit a Web page request, receive a Web page from server  in response to the request, transmit a request for video data to video source  using code embedded in the Web page, and receive the video data directly from video source . The steps may be further executed to display the video data in a frame of the received Web page.","Processor-executable process steps of e-mail client  are also stored in storage device . The process steps of e-mail client  may be executed to receive e-mail that is transmitted to a user of user device  by server . As will be described below, such an e-mail may provide information regarding a video meeting in which the user is scheduled to participate, including authorization data, time, date, location, etc.","Storage device  may store one or more of other applications, data files, device drivers and operating system files needed to provide functions other than those directly related to the present invention. Such functions may include calendaring, word processing, accounting, presentation development and the like.","Video Source",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["200","200","210","220","210","220"]},"Pan-Tilt-Zoom motors  are capable of moving optics  to change a field of view and changing a focus of optics . The field of view and focus of video source  are fixed in some embodiments that do not include motors . Motors  may be controlled by commands received from microcontroller . In this regard, microcontroller  may execute processor-executable process steps stored in flash memory  to issue commands to motors . Flash memory  may also comprise operating system files for controlling basic processes of video source .","Flash memory  may store processor-executable process steps of a Web server as well as processor-executable process steps to handle requests received from user device  and server  via the Web server. According to some embodiments, these latter process steps comprise CGI scripts that are executed based on information included in HTTP-based communications that are received from user device  and server .","Flash memory  may also store processor-executable process steps to support an application programming interface of video source . The application programming interface may facilitate the control of video source  by external devices. Other data that may be stored in flash memory  include a table of tokens received from server  as will be described below and a table of preset pan, tilt and zoom coordinates.","Video conversion chip  receives video data from image sensor  and converts the video data into a form usable by microcontroller . According to some embodiments, chip  receives NTSC-formatted data from image sensor  and outputs MJPEG data to microcontroller . Such conversion is performed by microcontroller  according to some embodiments.","Microcontroller  outputs the video data via network interface . Incoming HTTP requests are also received by network interface , which may comprise an Ethernet connection.","Server",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["300","300","100"]},"For example, communication port  may be used to receive requests for Web pages and authorization data from user device , and to transmit Web pages to user device  and tokens to video source . Input device , display  and printer  may be used to perform maintenance tasks and installation procedures, but may also be used in conjunction with a Web browser (not shown) so that server  also performs functions of a user device according to some embodiments.","Storage device  stores, among other data, processor-executable process steps of Web-based application . Microprocessors  therefore execute the process steps of Web-based application  in order to control server  to control a browser-based meeting according to some embodiments. Web-based application  may comprise CGI scripts that are executed in response to CGI data that are received from remote Web browsers over the Web. Such CGI data may be embedded within a request for a Web page that is received by server .","Upon receiving such CGI data, Web-based application  may create an HTML-based Web page and transmit the Web page to the requesting device. As will be described below, the Web page may include a frame in which video data is to be presented. Web-based application may comprise any type of application that may be responsive to HTTP requests, including but not limited to Java\u2122-based applications.","The process steps of Web-based application  may be read from a computer-readable medium, such as a floppy disk, a CD-ROM, a DVD-ROM, a Zip\u2122 disk, a magnetic tape, or a signal encoding the process steps, and then stored in storage device  in a compressed, uncompiled and\/or encrypted format. In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of, or in combination with, processor-executable process steps for implementation of processes according to embodiments. Thus, embodiments are not limited to any specific combination of hardware and software.","Process steps of Web server  are also stored in storage device . These process steps may be executed by microprocessors  to transmit data to and to receive data from Web clients, such as Web browsers, over the Web using HTTP and\/or HTTPS protocol. The transmitted data may comprise Web pages received from application , and the received data may be passed to application  for further processing.","Password database  of storage device  includes authorization information associated with various meeting sites. Meeting database  includes details of meetings that have been scheduled using server . Camera presets database  specifies preset pan, tilt and zoom coordinates for various cameras managed by server , and camera\/site parameters database  specifies parameters used during operation of system . Much of the data within databases  through  may be modified using a browser-based interface provided by Web-based application  according to some embodiments, thereby facilitating management of system .","Also stored in storage device  may be other unshown elements that may be necessary for operation of server , such as an operating system, a database management system, other applications, other data files, and \u201cdevice drivers\u201d for allowing microprocessors  to interface with devices in communication with communication port .

For purposes of the present example, it will be assumed that a user operates user device  to execute Web browser  at step S. The user then manipulates input device  to input a URL into an address bar of an interface displayed by Web browser .","User device  transmits a request for a Web page based on the URL at step S. The request is transmitted over the Web via communication port , and known mechanisms of the Web operate to direct the request to a server hosting the Web page to which the URL points. It will be assumed that Web server  is hosting the Web page, therefore the request is received by server .","In response to the request, server  transmits a \u201clogin\u201d Web page to the requesting Web browser at step S.

A request for a Web page is therefore issued by Web browser  when \u201cproceed\u201d control  is selected. The authorization data is transmitted to server  along with the request using known protocols.","Server  validates the authorization data and generates a token at step S. The authorization may be validated by determining if the site ID, username and password included in the authorization data correspond to a user that is associated with a currently active meeting described in meeting database . It will be assumed that the transmitted site ID, username and password are RMT-1, B5TV32VQ and B46YB, and that it is Jul. 18, 2004, 9:05 am. The token may be randomly generated.","Server  then transmits a meeting Web page and a token to user device S. User device , in turn, transmits the token and a request for video data to video source  at step S. The token and a URL for requesting the video data may be embedded in the meeting Web page received by user device . While processing the meeting Web page, code of the Web page instructs Web browser  to request data from and to pass the token to the particular URL. Meanwhile, server  also transmits the token to video source  at step S.","At step S, video source  receives the request and compares the tokens received from user device  and server . The token received from user device  is validated if it is properly associated with the token received from server . According to the present embodiment, the tokens must be identical.
