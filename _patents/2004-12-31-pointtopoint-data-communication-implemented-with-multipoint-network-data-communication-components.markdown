A client device might include a portable laptop computer, a tablet PC, a handheld personal digital assistant (PDA), a cellular phone, and other similar devices that can be configured for direct communication with a host device for synchronized file updates and other data manipulation functions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0004"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","106","102","104","108","110","108","110","102","104"]},"Typically, data communication between computing devices is divided into functional layers between a software application layer, such as application layer , and a communication link, such as the point-to-point serial connection . Each functional layer provides an appropriately formatted data transfer function to an adjacent functional layer while abstracting the adjacent functional layer from the functional implementation details of a particular layer. Data transfer between the functional communication layers is communicated from higher layers to lower layers, and vice-versa, and by convention, an application layer is a higher layer that communicates information down to a lower layer, such as to a hardware connection interface and\/or driver. Accordingly, each functional layer manipulates and formats data as it is communicated from one layer to the next, and reverses the data manipulation and formatting for the data when it is communicated in an opposite direction.","Host computing device  includes a transport protocol layer  that facilitates information communication between application layer  and lower functional communication layers. Implementations of the transport protocol layer  can include the Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) which is the basic communication protocol for the Internet. TCP\/IP can also be used as a communications protocol in a private network, such as an intranet or an extranet. TCP\/IP is primarily designed for point-to-point communication, in that communication is from one point, such as from host computing device , to another point, such as to client device . Point-to-point communication is also commonly designated as \u201cPPP\u201d.","The transport protocol layer  communicates information to a point-to-point protocol layer , which in turn communicates the information to a serial port  via a serial port interface  and serial port driver . The point-to-point protocol layer  uses the Internet protocol (IP) and is designed to facilitate information communication between two computing devices via a serial interface. The PPP protocol layer  provides the services of a data-link layer and packages TCP\/IP packets received from the transport protocol layer  and forwards them to the serial port interface .","Client device  also includes a transport protocol layer  that facilitates information communication between application layer  and a point-to-point protocol layer . The PPP protocol layer  communicates the information between the transport protocol layer  and a serial port  via a serial port interface  and serial port driver .","The serial port interface  and serial port driver  at the host computing device  support the point-to-point serial connection  between serial port  at host computing device  and serial port  at client device . The serial connection  is one of the most common communication links to implement between two devices. Serial port connections, however, are relatively slow and typically communicate information at a rate of only  kilobits per second.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","202","204","206","206","106","202"]},"Host computing device  and client device  each include an application layer  and , a transport protocol layer  and , and a point-to-point protocol layer  and , respectively. Each of these components are described above with reference to .","Host computing device  also includes a virtual serial port driver  that communicates information between the point-to-point protocol layer  and a USB port . The client device  also includes a virtual serial port driver  that communicates information between the point-to-point protocol layer  and a USB port . A virtual serial port driver is also commonly known as a USB serial host driver that enables a point-to-point communication link between USB port  at host computing device  and USB port  at client device . The virtual serial port driver  exposes a standard serial interface in the host computing device  to the upper-level application  so that the application can communicate data via USB connection  as if it were a standard serial port connection.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["300","302","302","304","306","306","304","308","310"]},"Computing device  also includes multipoint network data communication components such as a Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) layer  and a miniport driver layer . The NDIS layer  is a network device driver communication protocol layer that specifies how communication protocol layers or programs, such as TCP\/IP, and network device drivers communicate with each other. The NDIS layer  provides a layer of abstraction for the development of network device drivers. The abstraction includes an application programming interface (API) to functionally identify the services provided by the NDIS layer  without requiring that adjacent layers recognize the implementation details for the NDIS layer. This provides a device-independent format for commands and data that are communicated to a network-connected device.","The NDIS layer  configures network-connected devices for communication to send and receive network data on behalf of applications executing on computing device . The applications, such as application , communicate information to the NDIS layer  through a transport protocol configured for the type of data exchanged and the underlying network used for transmission of the data, such as via TCP\/IP, NetBEUI, NWLINK, or other similar communication protocol layers. The NDIS layer  communicates with lower driver layers, such as the bus and\/or network interface , with NDIS object identifiers (OIDs) to perform network device configuration and data communication management of NDIS data packets.","The NDIS layer  supports basic types of network interface card (NIC) drivers which are also referred to as NDIS miniport drivers. The miniport driver layer  communicates information with the NDIS layer  and communicates with the bus and\/or network interface  through vendor-specific APIs. The bus and\/or network interface  is typically bus-specific or network-specific and communicates with network-connected devices through the appropriate bus or network interface. Typically, an NDIS miniport driver is specifically configured for a particular hardware device.","Both the NDIS miniport driver layer  and the bus and\/or network interface  are configured by a manufacturer (OEM) of a network-connected device to communicate via vendor-specific APIs. Thus, the NDIS miniport driver layer  conforms to an NDIS layer API to communicate with NDIS layer , and the bus and\/or network interface  conforms to the appropriate bus or network interface to communicate information to a network-connected device, or multiple network-connected devices via the LAN .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":["400","402","402","404","406","406","404","402","408","404","408","410"]},"Computing device  also includes an NDIS layer  and a Remote NDIS miniport driver layer . The NDIS layer  is described above with reference to . In , the Remote NDIS architecture replaces the NDIS miniport driver layer  and the bus and\/or network interface  of , both of which were provided by a network-connected device manufacturer, with a Remote NDIS miniport driver layer  and a bus and\/or network-specific microport . Each combination of components provides the computing devices  and  access to a LAN  and  respectively.","Remote NDIS miniport driver layer  and the bus and\/or network-specific microport  are independent of any particular network-connected device  and can be included as part of the computing device  operating system similarly to the transport protocol layer  and the NDIS protocol layer . With Remote NDIS, hardware manufacturers providing remote devices do not have to provide host-based drivers for their devices. Remote NDIS is the subject of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/302,735 entitled \u201cMethod and System for Abstracting Network Device Drivers\u201d, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.","Remote NDIS miniport driver layer  defines a connection-independent message set along with a description of how the message set operates over a particular connection, such as with a specific bus or network. A Remote NDIS interface is standardized to facilitate a defined set of host drivers to support any number of network-connected devices thereby eliminating the need to install new drivers to support a newly connected network device.","The Remote NDIS miniport driver layer  encapsulates NDIS object identifiers (OIDs) and NDIS data packets into data structures known as Remote NDIS messages that can be communicated without modification to a remotely connected device . The Remote NDIS miniport driver layer  communicates the Remote NDIS messages with the bus and\/or network-specific microport driver layer  which can include a USB bus microport, a 1394 bus microport, a Bluetooth microport, or any other similar communication protocol microport.","The bus and\/or network-specific microport driver layer  is an intermediate layer that interfaces with the specific bus or network responsible for communicating the Remote NDIS messages to the remote device . The microport driver layer  receives Remote NDIS messages and communicates them to a corresponding element of the specific bus or network driver layer. The Remote NDIS messages are communicated via the USB connection to remote device .","With the Remote NDIS architecture, the network communication protocol mechanisms are abstracted above the bus and\/or network-specific microport driver layer . Adding a new network-connected device can be accomplished by changing or modifying only the Remote NDIS miniport driver layer . The microport driver layer  remains unchanged because it is a message transport layer that passes NDIS layer OIDs and NDIS data packets encapsulated in Remote NDIS messages.","A data communication system is configured to communicatively link a host device and a client device with a point-to-point data communication link, where the point-to-point data communication link is configured with multipoint network data communication components designed for data communication over a distributed network. A data communication interface at the host device is communicatively linked with a data communication interface driver via the point-to-point data communication link between the host device and the client device.","The data communication interface at the host device can be implemented with the Remote Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS), and the data communication interface driver is a Remote NDIS driver. The Remote NDIS component communicates Remote NDIS messages with the Remote NDIS driver via the point-to-point data communication link.","The data communication interface driver (e.g., Remote NDIS driver) at the client device communicates with a virtual driver component for the client device via a virtual network. The virtual network can be implemented as a local area network (LAN) and the Remote NDIS driver communicates the Remote NDIS messages with the virtual driver component via the LAN.","The data communication system includes a connection interface to couple the point-to-point data communication link with the client device. The connection interface can be implemented with a Universal Serial Bus data communication interface, a 1394 bus data communication interface, a wireless data communication interface, a Bluetooth data communication interface, an infrared data communication interface, or other similar point-to-point data communication protocol interface.","The following describes systems and methods for point-to-point data communication between computing devices implemented with distributed network communication components intended for multipoint data communication. The described point-to-point data communication system utilizes the Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) and Remote NDIS communication interface layers that are designed for multipoint data communication over a distributed network. Inherently, NDIS and Remote NDIS are not designed to facilitate point-to-point communication between two computing devices. However, implementing a host computing device's Remote NDIS driver layer in an external client device can be utilized to establish a basic point-to-point data communication link between the two computing devices.","The described point-to-point data communication system is versatile in that a user can communicate with a host computing device configured with Remote NDIS via a point-to-point data communication link from any portable device configured with a Remote NDIS driver layer, a data communication interface for the portable device, and a virtual network coupling the Remote NDIS driver layer and the data communication interface. For example, a user with a PDA can download his or her schedule to any other user's desktop PC by simply establishing a point-to-point communication link between the two devices. The desktop PC does not need to be configured with any specific drivers or interface components to receive the schedule from the PDA. Furthermore, the point-to-point communication link can be a physical USB or 1394 connection, or a wireless Bluetooth or infrared connection, or any other similar communication protocol that can be utilized for a point-to-point communication link.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","500","502","504","506"]},"The host computing device  and the client device  each include multipoint distributed network data communication components designed to connect a computing device to a network, such as a LAN, and to communicatively link the computing device with remote network-connected devices.
