{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/386,635, filed Sep. 27, 2010, the entire content of which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference.","The present specification relates generally to computing devices and more particular relates to a method, apparatus, and system for accessing applications and content across a plurality of computers.","The evolution of computers is currently quite active in the mobile device environment. It is now well-known to include calendaring, contacts, and messaging functions in mobile devices. More recently, there has been a veritable explosion of the number and type of applications that are configured to the unique form factors and computing environments of mobile devices.","Referring now to , a system for accessing an application across a plurality of computers is indicated generally at . In a present embodiment system  comprises at least one computing device in the form of a mobile computing device  and at least one server -, - . . . -. (Generically, server , and collectively, servers . This nomenclature is used elsewhere herein).","A wireless link  connects mobile computing device  with one of a plurality of wireless base stations . In , mobile computing device  is shown as connecting to a first base station - via wireless link , but mobile computing device  can also connect to other base stations  in system . Backhaul links  connect each base station  to a network . Additional backhaul links  connect network  to each server .","Mobile computing device  can be any type of electronic device that can be used in a self-contained manner and to interact with content available on network . Interaction includes displaying of information on mobile computing device  as well as to receive input at mobile computing device  that can in turn be sent back over network . Mobile computing device  will be explained in greater detail below.","It should now be understood that the nature of network  and links , , and  associated therewith is not particularly limited and are, in general, based on any combination of architectures that will support interactions between mobile computing device  and servers . In a present embodiment network  includes the Internet as well as appropriate gateways and backhauls to links  and . For example, backhaul links  and backhaul links  can be based on a T1, T3, O3, or any other suitable wired or wireless connections. Accordingly, the links  and  between network  and the interconnected components are complementary to functional requirements of those components.","Link  may be based on, by way of non-limiting examples, a core mobile network infrastructure, such as, by way of non-limiting examples, one or more of Global System for Mobile communications (\u201cGSM\u201d); Code Division Multiple Access (\u201cCDMA\u201d); CDMA 2000); 3G; or Evolution-Data Optimized or Evolution-Data (\u201cEVDO\u201d); or successors thereto or hybrids or combinations thereof; or on a wireless local area network (\u201cWLAN\u201d) infrastructures such as, by way of non-limiting examples, the Institute for Electrical and Electronic Engineers (\u201cIEEE\u201d) 802.11 Standard (and its variants) or Bluetooth or the like or hybrids or combinations thereof. Note that in an example variation of system  it is contemplated that link  may be a wired connection.","A client machine  also connects to mobile computing device  via a link , which may be an encrypted link. In a present example implementation, client machine  is a desktop, tablet, notebook, or laptop computer and link  is a direct connection effected wirelessly or wired. Where link  is wireless, then link  can be, for example, a Bluetooth\u2122 or a peer-to-peer Wi-Fi connection between client machine  and mobile computing device . Where link  is wired, then link  can be, for example, a universal serial bus (USB) or FireWire\u2122 connection. Those skilled in the art will now recognize other types of wired or wireless connections that can be used to effect a direct connection for link . In variations, link  can be effected indirectly through, for example, a local area network or a Wi-Fi network, or even through a wide area network such as network .","Client machine  is initially configured to maintain or execute at least a web browser application , and need not have direct access to network , though in some cases such a direct connection to network  would be possible through a link . Those skilled in the art should recognize that what constitutes a \u201cweb browser application\u201d is not particularly limited to well-recognized browsers such as Firefox\u2122, Internet Explorer\u2122, Chrome\u2122, Opera\u2122 or Safari\u2122 or mini-browsers employed on portable electronic devices. The use of such well-recognized browser applications is contemplated, but likewise, so are any applications, or operating systems, or other software modules that can make HTTP requests and receive HTTP content. Thus, notwithstanding some of the specific examples discussed below, it is contemplated that web browser application  may not actually have the traditional graphical interface of a well-recognized web browser application. Accordingly, client machine  can be based on any computing environment that provides web browsing functionality. For example, such a computing environment can be based on an Intel\u2122 or AMD\u2122 or other microprocessor, with accompanying volatile storage (e.g. random access memory) and non-volatile storage (e.g. Flash, Hard disc drive), read only memory (ROM), network interface card(s), video cards that connect to one or more displays, a keyboard, a mouse (or other pointing device). Any operating system may be used, including, for example, an operating system offered by Microsoft\u2122, or a Linux\u2122 operating system, or an operating system offered by Apple Computer. Browser application  can be any browser application can be used that is executable on a respective operating system, including Firefox\u2122, Internet Explorer\u2122, Chrome\u2122, Opera\u2122 or Safari\u2122. Client machine  can have a display or a keyboard or both that are larger than that provided on mobile computing device . Client machine  may also have another configuration, such as a tablet computing device. One non-limiting example of a tablet configuration comprises a pointing device in the form of a touch screen, a WiFi network interface that communicates over link , which itself is a WiFi link. In this configuration, link  may either be a USB connection or a Bluetooth connection or a WiFi, with computing machine  and device  having suitable network interfaces for same. As a variation on the foregoing, link  may be implemented as a core mobile network link, like link . As a further variation on the foregoing, computing machine  may comprise network interfaces to accommodate a plurality of links directly to network , including a WiFi link and a core mobile network link. Other variations will now occur to those skilled in the art.","Servers  can be based on any well-known server environment including a module that houses one or more central processing units, volatile memory (e.g. random access memory), persistent memory (e.g. hard disk devices), and network interfaces to allow servers  to communicate over network . For example, each server  can be a ProLiant\u00ae Server from Hewlett-Packard Company, 3000 Hanover Street Palo Alto, Calif. 94304-1185 USA having a plurality of central processing units and having several gigabytes of random access memory. However, it is to be emphasized that this particular server is merely a non-limiting example, and a vast array of other types of computing environments for each server  is contemplated. Furthermore, it is contemplated that each server  may be implemented as a plurality of interconnected servers, in a so-called server farm, which are mirrored or otherwise configured for load balancing or failover or high availability or any or all of those.","As will be discussed further below, each server  maintains a different networking application . Networking applications  can be any application whereby a corresponding client-side application executes on mobile computing device  which accesses data or any other server functions on a given server . Networking applications can be, by way of non-limiting examples, personal information management applications, social networking applications, or messaging applications. Non-limiting examples of personal information management applications include calendaring and contact management applications. Non-limiting examples of social networking application  include Facebook\u2122, Twitter\u2122, LinkedIn\u2122, and MySpace\u2122. Networking applications  can also comprise message applications such email, BlackBerry Messenger, AOL instant messenger (AIM), Yahoo Messenger (YM), Google Talk (Gtalk), Lotus Connections, Windows Live Messenger. There are many others.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 3"],"b":["54","54","54"]},"Referring to , in a present, non-limiting example, device  comprises a chassis  that supports a display . Display  can comprise one or more light emitters such as an array of light emitting diodes (LED), liquid crystals, plasma cells, or organic light emitting diodes (OLED). Other types of light emitters are contemplated. Chassis  also support a keyboard . It is to be understood that this specification is not limited to any particular structure, spacing, pitch, or shape of keyboard , and the depiction in  is an example. For example, full or reduced \u201cQWERTY\u201d keyboards are contemplated. Other types of keyboards are contemplated. (In variations, device  may also be a touch-screen device with no physical keyboard.) Device  also comprises a pointing device  which can be implemented as a touch-pad, joystick, trackball, track-wheel, or as a touch sensitive membrane on display . Device  may also comprise a speaker  for generating audio output, and a microphone  for receiving audio input.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["54","54","162","64","168","176","162","164","168","176","100","100","100","104","108","54","104","100","108"]},"Processor  in turn is also configured to control display , speaker  and flash , also in accordance with different programming instructions and optionally responsive to different input receive from the input devices. Fewer, additional, or alternative output devices are contemplated.","Processor  also connects to a network interface , which can be implemented in a present embodiment as one or more radios configured to communicate over link  and link . Network interface  can thus be generalized as a further input\/output device that can be utilized by processor  to fulfill various programming instructions. It will be understood that interface  is configured to correspond with the network architecture that defines each link  and link . It is also contemplated each network interface  can include multiple radios to accommodate the different protocols that may be used to implement different types of links where the network architecture for each link  differs between base stations , or where link  may be based on different architectures. For example, link  may also be a wired link (e.g. USB) in which case it may not have a radio at all.","In a present embodiment, device  is also configured to maintain, within non-volatile storage , a host application , and one or more client applications  such as an email application -, a contact manager application -, a calendar application -, an instant messenger application - or one or more of a plurality of additional applications -. Non-limiting examples of additional applications  can comprise, without limitation, one or more of social networking client applications, e.g., Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, LinkedIn; other applications associated with online communities e.g., Flickr, Gtalk, etc.; document tools such as Google Docs. Any one or more of host application  and client applications  can be pre-stored in non-volatile storage  upon manufacture of device , or downloaded via network interface  and saved on non-volatile storage  at any time subsequent to manufacture of device . Each application  is also configured to interact with its corresponding network application  as needed.","Processor  is configured to execute each application , making use of input from input devices and controlling display  to generate output based on that input and according to the programming instructions of each application . In general, each application  can be based on any existing or future application  that can be executed entirely on a device such as device , even when link  is not active and device  is disconnected from client machine . For example, email application  can be a standard electronic mail application that is already commonly deployed on various devices such as device  and entirely usable on device , without any connection to client machine , and while accessing servers  as needed. Likewise contact manager application -, calendar application -, instant messenger application - and any of the additional applications -can be based on such applications that are already commonly deployed, or may be deployed in the future, and entirely usable on device  without any connection to client machine , and while accessing servers  as needed.","Processor  is also configured to execute host application  to permit access to client applications  via client machine , when link  is active, as will be explained further below.","Referring briefly to , a variation on device  is indicated generally as device . Device comprises many of the same components as device , and therefore like components bear like references except followed by the suffix \u201ca.\u201d Of note is that device excludes keyboard  and pointing device . Instead, device comprises a touch screen which provides the combined functionality of keyboard  and pointing device . Further variations on device  will now occur to those skilled in the art, but for convenience, further discussion of the present specification will focus on device  as described above. As will become apparent from further discussion herein, the lack of a full keyboard in device presents certain limitations for providing input to device , and those limitations may be mitigated by the present specification.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 1"],"b":["124","88","128","128","60","124","300","304","300","88","128","304","304","300","128","304","128","300","88","86","128","128","128","88","128","88","304","128","304","128"]},"Referring now to , a flow-chart depicting a method for provisioning a client machine to interact with a mobile electronic device is indicated generally at . Method  can be implemented using system , and for purposes of explaining method  it will be assumed that method  is performed using system . However, it is to be understood that variations are contemplated to both method  and system  and such variations are within the scope of this specification. Method  is not strictly required, but in a present implementation method  provides a proxy on client machine  such that web service  is addressable and reachable from the address bar in browser . Method  also assumes that link  is a direct link between client machine  and mobile electronic device . Again, such a direct connection for link  can be a peer-to-peer Bluetooth\u2122 connection whereby client machine  and device  are \u201cpaired\u201d using known Bluetooth\u2122 hardware and network protocols. Such a direct connection for link  can also be a USB cable connection. Other means for implementing link  will now occur to those skilled in the art. In a present implementation, it is assumed that link  is a Bluetooth\u2122 connection.","Block  comprises receiving an instruction to install a proxy application. Block  can be implemented in different ways. One factor that affects how block  is implemented is the location where the installation file for the proxy application is stored. In one implementation, the proxy application is stored on a server (possibly one or more of servers , though not necessarily) connected to network , in which case installation initiation may be effected by entering a uniform resource locator (URL) into browser  that points to the network  address of the server that stores the proxy application. In another implementation, the proxy application is stored as a data file within persistent storage  of device . In this implementation, non-volatile storage  of device  is configured to appear as an external hard-disk when link  is active\u2014this type of configuration being inherent in many operating systems and devices such as device , where link  is a USB connection. Thus, once device  appears as a hard-disk, the data file containing the proxy application can be downloaded via link  onto client machine . In variations, the proxy could be provided on a CD or other removable media.","Block  comprises receiving the proxy application for which installation was initiated at block . Where proxy application is stored on network , then block  comprises downloading the proxy application via network  and link . When proxy application is stored on device , then the proxy application is transferred via link  to client machine .","Those skilled in the art will now recognize other means of effecting block  and block .","Block  comprises installing the proxy application that was received at block . At this point it will be appreciated that the form in which proxy application is originally stored and received can vary according to the level of sophistication to be employed in the actual installation of the proxy application. It is presently contemplated that the proxy application will be an executable application that invokes an installation wizard, or the like, so that a simple series of key strokes on client machine  are all that is required to actually install the proxy application. However, proxy application can be received at block  in other forms.","Block  comprises registering the proxy application installed at block . Such registration is local to the client machine and serves to identify a URL or Internet Protocol (IP) address redirect such that entry of that URL or IP addresses that causes browser  to access web service . A representation of portions of system  is shown in , which itself is a variation on .  is thus substantially the same as , except that a proxy application  is shown as being installed on client machine  and sitting between browser  and web service  on device . Expressed another way, proxy application  configures client machine  so that entry of a given URL or other address in the address bar of browser  directs browser  to connect with web service  and to generate a web page on the display of client machine  that corresponds to a web page being offered by web service . An example of such a URL may be, http:\/\/localhost, provided such a URL is not already reserved for another proxy application on client machine . Thus, upon entry of http:\/\/localhost, browser  will be directed to proxy  and in turn browser  will connect to web service . Returning to the example where link  is based on Bluetooth\u2122, then proxy application  sits between the browser  and the Bluetooth service and drivers executing on client machine , and forms a virtual connection with device  according to the Bluetooth pairing that has been registered on the Bluetooth service of device . In turn, web service  is configured to respond to HTTP requests received via the Bluetooth service that is resident on device .","At this point it is to be reiterated that method  and the use of proxy application  is not needed in all implementations contemplated by this specification, and accordingly, certain of the following discussions may not make reference to proxy application  and . However, it is also to be understood that the following discussion is also applicable to configurations that utilize proxy application . Also, in some configurations, the proxy application  may be pre-installed on client machine , so that method  may be optional.","Referring now to , a flow-chart depicting a method for accessing an application across a plurality of computers is indicated generally at . Method  can be implemented using system , and for purposes of explaining method  it will be assumed that method  is performed using system . However, it is to be understood that variations are contemplated to both method  and system  and such variations are within the scope of this specification. Performance of method  presumes that link  is active between device  and client machine .","Block  comprises opening a web browser. In system , block  is effected at client machine  whereby browser  is opened in the usual manner. Block  comprises receiving a web services address. Block  is effected by typing an address (e.g. http:\/\/localhost) into the address bar of browser . In system , the address received at block  corresponds to the address web service  of host application . In variations, it is contemplated that system  may be configured so that browser  is automatically launched and directed to the appropriate address in a single step: for example via a desktop shortcut on client machine . In variations, it is contemplated that the address bar of browser  is not visible to the user.","Block  comprises loading a web page from the web service. In system , and during the initial performance of block , block  can comprise loading a webpage in the form of a menu that can be used to select invocation of any one of applications . An example of performance of this initial performance of block  is shown in , where browser  is open on the display of client machine , and a URL pointing to the web service  of host application  is open. Block  comprises generating the web page that was loaded at block . As can be seen in , host application  is serving a menu web page, which offers web-based access to the applications  that are available on device . Thus, as shown on the display of client machine  in , menu item one reads \u201cEmail\u201d, which is offering access to email application -; menu item two reads \u201cContact Manager\u201d, which is offering access to contact manager application -; menu item three reads \u201cCalendar\u201d, which is offering access to contact manager application -; and menu item four reads \u201cInstant Messenger\u201d, which is offering access to instant message application -. For simplicity, application -is not shown in .","Block  comprises sending any local input to the web service. Block  is affected through browser  which accepts local input from the keyboard or the mouse that is connected to client machine . As part of that locally received input, any input that is responsive to forms or links or other input that can be entered into the page generated at block  is sent to the web service that originally served the page generated at block .","According to the example in , input can be received that selects one of the four menu items being generated on the display of client machine . To give a specific example, it can be assumed that menu item one is selected, indicating an instruction to access email application -. Again, such selection can be effected via keyboard input, or by bringing a cursor into focus over the desired selection using a mouse, and then clicking the mouse to effect the selection, or via touch-screen input by touching the desired selection.","Block  comprises determining whether an instruction has been received to close the web service. Such an determination can be based on closing browser , or it can be based on entry of another URL in the address bar of browser , or it can based on any other instruction or event that instructs closing of the web service. A yes determination ends method .","A no determination leads to a return to block  where any updates to the web page are loaded. Thereafter, method  continues performance as previously described. To give further explanation, and continuing with the example above where the menu selection for email was made, then during this performance of block  and block , a web page that provides web-access to email application - will be loaded and generated. This non-limiting example is shown in , where browser application  is shown as accessing the address http:\/\/localhost\/email, which is hosted by host application  in order to provide access to email application -. When system  is configured using plug-ins , then block  and block  may likewise make appropriate use of plug-in - from  in order to generate the display shown in .","When the display shown in  is active, then block  can comprise receiving any input that is relevant to email application -, For example, such input may comprise selecting \u201cNew Message\u201d, to thereby cause generation of a dialogue box on the display of client machine  which can be used to compose a new email message. In this example, a subsequent cycle through block  and block  would result in generation of such a dialogue box for composition of a new email message. Note that such generation is effected by host application  creating a web page with such a dialogue box, based on host application  interacting with email application -, again making use of plug-in - from  when such a plug-in is employed. In variations, code to generate and display such a dialogue box may have been included in or referenced by the original web page, so a new web page may not need to be loaded in order for such a dialogue box to appear on the display.","In general, those skilled in the art will now appreciate that the data generated on the display of client machine  is under the control of device  and that client machine  is effectively a web-client while device  acts as a web-server. Furthermore, device  also uses link  to access the appropriate server  and application , as part of determining what data to display on the display of client machine . Again, in the example of email, email application - accesses application - on server - in order to send new emails generated using client machine  and by the same token, email application - accesses application - in order to receive new emails, which are in turn generated on the display of client machine . Any other functions normally associated with email application - are likewise reflected on the display of client machine  and appropriate access to server - is effected accordingly. In addition to static web pages, browser  may be configured to receive code (e.g. JavaScript code) from host application . While executing this code, browser  may, from time to time, (e.g. possibly in response to user input or some other condition), request additional resources from host application  in order to update the page currently on the display without loading an entirely new page.","In order to configure browser  to respond to changes that occur on device , or on server , an \u201copen-get\u201d or equivalent programming function is employed so that browser  will automatically receive and respond to such changes. For example, assume that a new email message arrives on server -, and that same new email message automatically arrives on device . The \u201copen-get\u201d function running on browser  will result in browser  also ascertaining the arrival of the new email message and result in the display of client machine  being updated accordingly to reflect the arrival of the new email message.","To help further illustrate the present specification,  shows a non-limiting example of the result of selecting contact manager application -. In , the URL http:\/\/localhost\/contacts is active and accordingly the web service  of host application  is accessing contact manager - so that input relative to contact manager application - can be received via client machine , and likewise, the display of client machine  can be controlled to display content relative to contact manager application . Again, changes to the contact database can be made on client machine , or they can be made on device . Such changes can then be propagated to server - in the usual manner.","Those skilled in the art will now recognize how the foregoing can extend to calendar application -, instant messenger application - and other applications -","Various advantages will now be apparent. For example, it is common that communications between device  and servers  may be effected via encrypted links. Accordingly, when link  is active, a full browsing experience, complete with full size display and full size keyboard, can be used to interact with various applications on device  but such interactions will be encrypted and secure. Furthermore, in certain situations link  may not be available, or of limited use, due to security restrictions, usage fees, or of low bandwidth and accordingly accessing data on servers  from client machine  via link  may not be possible or may be impractical. Nonetheless, it may be desired to use client machine  for such interactions, rather than device , due to the availability of the full keyboard, mouse, and regular display that is available on client machine . Accordingly, the present specification may be most useful when device  is near enough to a given client machine  in order to establish link . Such client machines  can be provided in airport lounges, hotel rooms, Internet cafes and other locations. Accordingly, for at least these reasons, this specification can be used to provide access to various applications from such client machines  in a novel, inventive and useful manner. It should also be noted that client machine  may have different configurations, and could include, for example, a tablet computer.","Variations, subsets, enhancements, and combinations of the foregoing are contemplated. For example, none of the screen shots shown in , , or  should be construed as being limiting as to exactly how data is generated on the display of client machine .","Furthermore, in relation to proxy application  in , it may be unlikely that publicly available client machines  will have proxy application  pre-installed, so as noted proxy application  may be stored in non-volatile storage  on client device . Further, it should be noted that non-volatile storage , itself, can be implemented as a removable storage media such as an SD card. Using a USB connection that proxy application  may be downloaded from the SD card to the client machine . Device  may also be configured so that it includes an auto-executable file which immediately executes on client machine  upon connection to client machine , and automatically copies proxy application  to the client machine . (Alternatively, device  can be configured so this installation is performed manually). After proxy application  has started, link  may be implemented via the USB connection or Bluetooth pairing or by other means. In the case of Bluetooth pairing, the pairing step with client machine  could happen in a number of ways. For example, a scan for Bluetooth devices may be initiated from either device  or client machine  or both in the usual way. Alternatively, as part of proxy application , the client machine  may be configured to display a barcode that can be scanned using optical capture unit . The barcode data may comprise configuration information usable by device  to establish pairing with client machine .","When a \u201cyes\u201d decision is reached at block , client machine  may be configured to clear its browser cache to ensure that private data has been cleared from the client machine's  memory. The \u201cyes\u201d determination at block  may be reached a number of ways: device  may be manually logged off from client machine : link  may be terminated by unplugging a USB cable used to establish link ; link  may be Bluetooth connection. An inactivity timer may be used to reach the \u201cyes\u201d determination at bock .","Alternatively, client machine  may operate in a no-cache mode when connected to device . In this mode, performance may be somewhat degraded since browser  may download content more often.","As noted above, device  runs a host application  that may be configured to listen to a real time communication channel, such an instant messaging conversation via instant message application -. JavaScript may be executing on browser , such JavaScript having been provided by host application . This JavaScript maintains an open connection with the host application . When an event occurs in application -, it is returned to the JavaScript so that corresponding changes occur on the display of client machine  under the control over browser . If an instant message reply is sent from the browser , then a separate parallel connection is opened and the commands are sent to host application  which then injects them into the ongoing conversation within instant message application -.","In general, it can be noted that there are many applications  (with corresponding data sources and networking applications ) on devices like device , including without limitation email, contacts, calendar, etc. Using this specification, each application  and its data may be rendered using browser  in a customized manner. Also, newly-installed and newly-created applications  may be readily added as available through browser  by creating a new application plug-in  for each new application . Host application  is configured to allow for ongoing registrations of new plug-ins . In effect, device  provides an application programming interface (API) associated with host application  that allows any application  running on the device  to register as a data source. Each application  can be assigned its own URL prefix and a handler class that implements a particular interface. All hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) requests from client machine  for URLs with that prefix may be given to the handler class to be processed. The HTTP handler may respond to each request in any way that it sees fit, so it is in control of the data rendering. Because registration of applications  with host application may be dynamic, it is not needed to compile host application  to be limited to only those applications  installed at the same time as host application  is installed. Newly-installed applications can register at which point they will dynamically appear as being available through browser . Host application  can also dynamically enumerate all of the registered applications  at the time of creating a menu screen such as the menu screen shown in .","Referring now to , a system for accessing one or more applications and content across a plurality of computers is indicated generally at . System is a variation on system  and therefore like elements bears like references, except followed by the suffix \u201cb\u201d.","Of note is that in system , link replaces link , base station -, and link - from system . Note that link may be implemented as link , base station -, and link -, or in other ways, as will now occur to those skilled in the art having regard to the discussions about the various types of links discussed herein and the state of the art. (By the same token, such other ways of implementing link can also replace link , base station -, and link - in system ).","Also of note in system , is that device is provided with a browser service - which can be used, in certain circumstances, to fetch remote resources that are embedded in email messages which are processed by email application -. Further details about browser service - will be discussed further below.","Also of note in system is that client machine is implemented, for illustrative purposes, as a tablet computer, thereby rendering the use of a separate keyboard and mouse as optional, instead offering the option of relying on a touch screen interface on the display of client machine for keyboard and pointing functions. However, it is to be understood that client machine could be implemented as a desktop computer or laptop computer or the like.","Also of note in , an email inbox is generated on the display of client machine by host application and email application -, using the general methodology discussed above in relation to system  and . In , each email in the inbox is provided with reference characters, namely email , email , and email . In system , a \u201cmailbox\u201d column is also provided which shows whether a given email in the inbox originated from a \u201cwork\u201d or \u201cpersonal\u201d email account. Such a mailbox column contemplates that a plurality of different email accounts having different names can be accessed via email application -. The multiplicity of email box accounts is discussed further below.","System also comprises a different set of network connections that system , although again the network connections shown in system could be applied to system .","In system , network  is implemented as a first network - and a second network -. In practice, the separation between first network and second network may be virtual and not physical, in that device may be configured with a security policy, or other security infrastructure, which only permits device to communicate with servers , while client machine is only configured to communicate with server --. In one possible specific, but non-limiting example of an implementation of system , link may be a home or public IEEE 802.11 network (a.k.a. a WiFi hotspot) and network - thus represents the public Internet, and server -- represents a server on the public Internet that hosts content - that is generally available over the public Internet. The nature of content - is not particularly limited, and can comprise, for example, web pages or images. Also in this specific, non-limiting example, network - represents a private network (e.g. a virtual private network) that runs over the Internet, and server -- represents a corporate server (sometimes referred to as an enterprise server) on this private network that provides access to a \u201cwork\u201d email account, while server -- represents a personal email server that hosts a personal email account that is nonetheless only accessible via device . System also comprises an enterprise content server -- that connects to enterprise server -- via a private link -. Accordingly, enterprise content server -- represents a server that is only accessible via corporate server -- and hosts content - that is only available via corporate server --. However, the nature of content - is not particularly limited, and can comprise, for example, web pages or images, and is generally analogous to the same type of content as content -.","Those skilled in the art will now recognize that those email items labeled as \u201cWork\u201d (i.e. email ) in  represent emails that originated from server --, while mail items labeled as \u201cPersonal\u201d (i.e. email  and email ) in  represent emails that originated from server --. Thus, server side application -- represents a corporate email account that manages \u201cWork\u201d email messages for device via email application -, while server side application -- represents a personal email account that manages \u201cPersonal\u201d email messages for device via email application -.","Corporate server -- also hosts a server side browser service -- that, in certain circumstances, may be accessed via browser service -, as will be discussed further below.","In general, system can be used to display emails on client machine via device , including the fetching and displaying of content that may be referenced in those emails, even where the content is maintained on a content server that is different from the email server, and even where a plurality of email servers and content servers are provided. Method , depicted in the form of a flowchart in , provides a non-limiting example of how this can be effected. Method  may execute as part of performance of various blocks of method .","Block  comprises accessing an email. The term \u201caccess\u201d should not be construed in a limiting sense. For example, may comprise the opening of an email on client machine via browser , working in conjunction with host application , and email application -.","An example performance of block  is now shown in . Email  is shown in  as open on the display of client machine . As shown in , the body of email  includes text and a uniform resource locator (URL)  that points to http:\/\/\u201c59-b-1-1\u201d\/\u201c61b-1.\u201d URL  is more generally referred to herein as a content reference, as there are other ways that content referencing may be implemented other than a URL. It is thus contemplated that the email that is accessed at block  comprises a content reference, as discussed further below.","The exact form of URL  as shown in  is for illustrative purposes only, and does not necessarily reflect the actual form that would appear within a particular email message in a practical implementation. Indeed, the actual form of URL  may include a reference (not shown) to a proxy such as proxy  shown in , so that proxy  is used as part of the actual fetching process. Indeed, it is contemplated that in certain embodiments proxy , or a variant thereon, may be incorporated into system which is configured to implement at least part of method  in system . Alternatively, the actual form of URL  may include a reference (not shown) to a proxy server (not shown) that is associated with host application or other application on device , that is configured to implement at least part of method  in system . In a present embodiment, the functionality of such a proxy server is presumed to be incorporated directly into host application ","In addition, URL  also includes an address (shown) that points to content that is available over network -. In this example, URL  points to content - which in this specific example is a picture of a baseball. Again, the exact form of this portion of URL generally corresponds to known Internet protocol (IP) addressing schemes, and thus the form shown in  is illustrative only.","At this point it bears repeating the fact that email  originated from server -- and was received via network -, but that email  ultimately includes a content reference that points to content which is accessible via network -. It can also be noted that the original version of email  as received at device , in many implementations, would not have included the proxy server reference in URL , and thus it is contemplated that URL  was modified from its original form, in order to include the proxy server reference. Such a modification of URL , to include the proxy server reference, may be effected by device , or by server --, by an intermediation server (not shown), or by client machine itself.","Block  comprises a determination as to whether to fetch the content that is referenced in the email accessed at block . A \u201cno\u201d determination ends method . A \u201cyes\u201d determination leads to block . The means by which a \u201cyes\u201d determination is made is not particularly limited, and can include a setting within device or browser that prescribes the automatic fetching of content embedded into an email message. A \u201cyes\u201d determination may also be made at block  manually, whereby a pointing device on client machine is used to \u201cpoint and click\u201d on URL  to reflect a manual instruction to fetch the content associated with URL . A \u201cno\u201d determination may be made at block  by, for example, an automatic classification operation that flags email  as potentially comprising spam, or a phishing attack, or otherwise flagging that URL  comprises malicious code.","When a \u201cyes\u201d determination is made at block , then block  is reached. Block  comprises selecting a content pathway through which to fetch the referenced content. The means by which block  is effected is also not particularly limited, and can be based on a plurality of factors including the actual topology of the various network connections in system . Thus, the actual selected content pathway may vary if the network connections in system vary. It is presently contemplated that, in one example implementation, for a network topology like that shown in system , then the selected content pathway will be automatically selected based on the server - that originated the email being accessed at block . Thus, since system comprises two servers that originate emails, (namely, server -- and server --), then two content pathways are contemplated. The first content pathway corresponds to work emails (e.g. email ) received from server --, and that first pathway comprises link , link , network -, link - and link -. The second content pathway corresponds to personal emails (e.g. email  and email ) received from server --, and that second pathway comprises link and link -. According to the foregoing example, the content pathway selected at block  will be the second content pathway comprising link ","Block  comprises fetching the content via the pathway selected at block . Performance of block , consistent with the example discussed above, is shown in . In , the image of a baseball is shown as being fetched via pathway  and ultimately generated on the display of client machine and replacing the display of URL . At this point method  ends.","A second example performance of method , in relation to email , is shown in  and .  shows the accessing of email  at block . Email  includes a URL  that points to content - stored on server --. Since content - resides behind server -, such content is not accessible via link . the selection of the pathway at block  is based on the fact that the email  originated from server --, and therefore the selected pathway comprises link , link , network -, link - and link -. Example performance of block  is shown in , as an image of a moon, stored as content  - is fetched, via pathway , and generated on the display of client machine in in the place of URL .","The foregoing examples in , , , and  contemplate a first implementation where the selection of the pathway is based on the source of the email. However, other implementations are also contemplated.  shows method , which is a variation on method . Of note is that method includes block whereby an attempt is made to fetch content via a selected link, much in the way that the actual fetching is done at block  in method . However, per block , method contemplates a possibility of a failure to complete the fetch. Block contemplates determining whether additional pathways are available and the looping back to block to try such other pathways, or the generation of an exception at block if no fetch is possible.","An initial failure could occur at block , according to the following non-limiting example, in .  shows URL  within personal email . However, URL  points to content on server --, even though email  originated from personal email server --. During an initial pass through block and block , a fetch over link will fail due to the fact that server -- is not accessible via link . Accordingly, during a subsequent cycle through block and block , the pathway comprising link , link , network -, link -, and link - will be selected so that the image of the moon can ultimately be fetched.","It is to be reiterated that the selection criteria at block , or at block , is not particularly limited. Furthermore, such selection criteria may change depend on the network configuration or security policies of device or combinations thereof. For example,  contemplates system , which is a variation on system . System bears like references for like elements, except the suffix \u201cc\u201d is used in place of the suffix \u201cb\u201d. System also comprises a link which connects server -- to network -. (Note that in system , client machine may also optionally be afforded direct connection to server -- via link , although typically with the proviso that a proper virtual private network must first be established over link and link ).","Because of link , at least two different pathways are available from client machine to network -, in order to ultimately reach content -. Those two pathways are: 1) directly via link or 2) indirectly via link , link , link - and link . Accordingly, the selection criteria at block  may favor a particular pathway based on, for example, levels of available encryption, bandwidth, pricing, processing burden or speed of the various pathways. The selection criteria at block may initially default to one of the paths, and then try the second path in the event of a failure over the first pathway.","It can be noted that when a pathway comprising server -- is chosen, then system may be configured to make use of browser service - in conjunction with browser service -- to access different content , such access being used in order to enforce security policies. However, where there are no security restrictions, then the pathway comprising link may be favored as it reduces processing burdens on device and server --. Where security restrictions are in place, then the pathway comprising server -- may be required.","Other possible selection criteria at block  or block comprises selecting a pathway based on a sender of a particular email. For example, emails from \u201cS. Claus\u201d could be configured to default to one pathway, while emails from \u201cJ. Smith\u201d could be configured to default to another pathway. Other possible selection criteria at block comprises selecting a pathway based on other characteristics of a particular email, such as a past successful pathway. According to this selection criteria, fetch failures at block are used to vary the default pathway selection at block , so that during subsequent performances of method a correct pathway is initially selected.","Other pathway selections are contemplated, depending on security policies and topologies. For example,  shows a further example topology referenced as system . System is a variant of system , so like components bear like references except followed by the suffix \u201cd\u201d. In system , link is omitted and link is provided. In system browser service - is configured to offer a public browsing service such that content on network - may be browsed on client machine via network and browser service -, Such a pathway would thus comprise link , device , link , network -, link , server --.","As a still further example topology is shown in , to further emphasize the point that multiple pathways are contemplated.  shows system , which further varies system , and so again like elements bear like references except followed by the suffix \u201ce\u201d. System does have certain variations from system . Of note, in system , an email server -- and a corporate web server -- connect to a corporate private network -, all of which is situated behind a corporate firewall . Device is provisioned for secure access to corporate network via link . Also in system , network - comprises the public Internet, which is directly connectable to device via link , and is also connected, via link , to corporate private network -, although behind firewall . Also in system , public email server -- is connected to public Internet network -. At least the following pathways are therefore available in system ","A) a public content direct pathway between client machine and server --, comprising link , network -, and link -.","B) A public content corporate indirect pathway between client machine and server --, comprising link , link , link , and link -.","C) A public content indirect pathway between client machine and server --, comprising link , link , and link -.","D) A private content corporate pathway between client machine  and server --, comprising link , link , and link -.","E) A private content direct pathway between client machine and server --, comprising link , link and link -.","In a still further variation, not shown, link may be implemented as a core mobile network link, like link . Alternatively, an additional link between client machine and network - may be provided. Where such a core mobile network link is offered between client machine and network , then the selection of a content pathway can be based on which link offers advantageous bandwidth, speed, security, or the like.","Note that additional links can be added in system , or various links can be removed to provide still further variations of topologies and pathways.","Other variations, combinations, and subsets of the foregoing will now occur to those skilled in the art. For example, a tablet computer can also be used in system  as client machine . As another example, while system (or its variants) is discussed in relation to email applications, it should be understood that system (or its variants) may be varied to accommodate other types of applications, including messaging applications. Examples of other types of messaging applications include instant messages that embed rich content, or short message service (SMS) messages that embed rich content, or messaging applications that are embedded within social networking applications such as Facebook\u2122 and Twitter\u2122."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["For a better understanding of the various embodiments described herein and to show more clearly how they may be carried into effect, reference will now be made, by way of example only, to the accompanying drawings in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6","FIG. 5"],"b":"50"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 1","FIG. 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 9","FIG. 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 9","FIG. 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 12","FIG. 13"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 12","FIG. 13"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIG. 12","FIG. 13"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 17","FIG. 12","FIG. 13"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 19","FIG. 18","FIG. 13"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 20","FIG. 12"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 21","FIG. 12"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 22","FIG. 12"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
