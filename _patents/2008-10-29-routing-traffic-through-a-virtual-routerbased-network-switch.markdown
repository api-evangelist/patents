title: Routing traffic through a virtual router-based network switch
abstract: Methods and systems are provided for routing traffic through a virtual router-based network switch. According to one embodiment, a flow data structure is established that identifies current packet flows associated with multiple virtual routers in the virtual router-based network device. When an incoming packet is received by the virtual router-based network device, it is then determined whether the incoming packet is associated with a current packet flow by accessing the flow data structure based on a header associated with the incoming packet. If it is determined that the incoming packet is associated with the current packet flow, then the incoming packet is hardware forwarded via a network interface of the virtual router-based network device without intervention by a processor of the virtual router-based network device, otherwise the incoming packet is forwarded to software on the processor for flow learning.

Field","Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to high performance network switches, and more particularly to routing traffic through a virtual router-based network switch.","2. Description of the Related Art","The use of networks, including LANs, WANs and the Internet continues to grow at ever increasing rates. Each day, more and more systems are becoming interconnected. This has created a need for high performance network switches on the part of network service providers. Many of the switches comprise multiple modules with many data flows between the modules themselves and between the interfaces to external networks. In some cases, these modules, including the processors residing on the modules can be partitioned into virtual routers, such as software running on the processors that emulates the functioning of an individual physical router. As a result of the combination of hundreds of thousands of data flows for the virtual routers in these network switches, there is a need for efficiently processing packet flows and for controlling the resources consumed within the network switch.","Methods and systems are described for routing traffic through a virtual router-based network switch. According to one embodiment, a flow data structure is established that identifies current packet flows associated with multiple virtual routers in a virtual router-based network device. An incoming packet is received by the virtual router-based network device. It is then determined whether the incoming packet is associated with a current packet flow by accessing the flow data structure based on a header associated with the incoming packet. If it is determined that the incoming packet is associated with the current packet flow, then the incoming packet is hardware forwarded via a network interface of the virtual router-based network device without intervention by a processor of the virtual router-based network device, otherwise the incoming packet is forwarded to software on the processor for flow learning.","According to another embodiment, a method is provided for validating micro-flows. A hardware accelerated micro-flow is established by configuring forwarding state information of a flow cache entry associated with the hardware accelerated micro-flow. The hardware accelerated micro-flow includes an identifier and an invalidation tag. Upon receiving an incoming packet that is part of the hardware accelerated micro-flow, the invalidation tag is compared to a value in an invalid tag table located by the identifier. The hardware accelerated micro-flow is invalidated when the value does not match the invalidation tag.","According to another embodiment, a method is provided for capping packet flow. A rate metering structure is associated with each of multiple micro-flows of a virtual router-based network device. A corresponding rate statistic is maintained for each micro-flow in the rate metering structures. Upon detecting that the corresponding rate statistic is exceeded for a micro-flow with which an incoming packet is associated, dropping the incoming packet.","According to another embodiment, a method is provided for limiting resource consumption in a virtual router-based network device. A flow metering structure is associated with a virtual router. Upon detecting a packet flow is to be assigned to the virtual router, a flow counter in the flow metering structure is incremented. The flow counter is then compared to a predetermined limit value and if the flow counter does not exceed the predetermined limit value then establishing the packet flow, otherwise refusing to establish the packet flow.","Other features of embodiments of the present invention will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and from the detailed description that follows.","Methods and systems are described for routing traffic through a virtual router-based network switch.

Examples of such line interfaces include Gigabit Ethernet, OC-12\/STM-4 POS, OC-3\/STM-1 POS and DS3C\/DS3U\/E3U interfaces. The invention is not limited to any particular type of line interface or network type.","In some embodiments, internal network interface  is a switch fabric interface. In one embodiment, the switch fabric interface is a 51.2 Gbps, 8-port, fully meshed, non-blocking switch fabric, with each port supporting a 6.4 Gpbs transfer rate. However, the invention is not limited to any particular type of switch interface or internal network interface .","In some embodiments, processing engines  provide specialized application processing within environment . In some embodiments, processing engine  can be a Virtual Routing Engine (VRE) capable of providing virtual router applications . In alternative embodiments, processing engine  can be a Virtual Service Engine (VSE) capable of providing services, such as firewall services and antivirus services. In further alternative embodiments, processing engine  can be an Advances Security Engine capable of providing data encryption services.","Processing engine , in some embodiments, includes a Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) , processor  and memory . Processor  executes computerized instructions that form the various types of applications that can be run on a processing engine . In one embodiment of the present invention, processor  is a PowerPC 750CX from IBM Corp. In an alternative embodiment, processor  is a Hi\/fn 7851. In a further alternative embodiment, processor  is a Hi\/fn 6500. The invention is not limited to any particular type of processor.

In general, PFE  analyzes packets that arrive from the internal network interface or from a DMA interface with processor . PFE  then determines whether the packet can be hardware forwarded without the intervention of processor  or whether such intervention is required. Further details on the structure of PFE  and methods implemented within PFE  will be provided below.","Memory  is a memory capable of storing data and instructions for processor  and PFE .

In some embodiments, each ingress unit  and egress unit  include six packet processors . However, the invention is not limited to any particular number of packet processors. In one embodiment, the packet processor implements a RISC-like integer instruction set with special instructions for bit field extraction and merging and for unaligned block data transfers. According to one embodiment, each packet processor  operates on a different packet and hardware interlocks maintain packet order. In some embodiments, the ingress processors share common micro-code for ingress processing and the egress processors share common micro-code for egress processing. In some embodiments, the PFE  memory maps the ingress and egress instruction stores and supports micro-code updates through Programmed Input\/Output (PIO) write transactions.","In operation, the PFE ingress unit  passes forwarding state to the DMA Engine  that incorporates this state into a packet receive descriptor. This forwarding state indicates whether the processor  should software forward the packet or the packet may bypass the processor and the PFE  can hardware forward the packet. In some embodiments, the forwarding state also includes a 20-bit index into a forwarding transform cache that describes PFE processing per packet flow. For software forwarding packets, a receive descriptor is pushed onto the DMA ingress descriptor queue. For hardware forwarded packets, the descriptor will bypass the DMA ingress queue and be pushed directly onto the DMA egress descriptor queue as a transmit descriptor.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIGS. 3-6","FIGS. 3-6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["206","302","304"]},"Next, in some embodiments of the present invention, the packet is classified (block ). Packet classification involves looking at one or more of the various protocol layer headers. As those skilled in the art will appreciate, packets are typically encapsulated with various protocol headers that define sources, destinations and applications that are to process the data in the packet. For example, layer 2 (L2) is typically a data link layer that specifies the organization of data into frames and how to send frames over a network; layer 3 (L3) is a network layer that specifies addressing assignments and how packets are forwarded and layer 4 (L4) is a transport layer that specifies how to reliably handle data transfer. For example TCP\/IP occupies L3 and L4 in this reference model. In some embodiments, layer 1 (L1, also referred to as LQ) includes a header that specifies an LQ ID and LQ protocol to use to route packets internally within a router. The LQ ID is used to identify a particular VR that is to receive the packet.","In some embodiments, the PFE ingress unit supports two basic forms of packet classification. One is flow-based, using various fields of the LQ header along with fields in the L3\/L4 headers to identify a particular VR flow (also referred to as a micro-flow). The other form uses the upper bits of the IP address or MPLS label to index a table of flow indices. According to one embodiment, the host software controls which classification form the PFE uses by programming different micro-code into the ingress instruction store. In one embodiment, in both forms of packet classification, the classification result is a 20-bit forwarding index that the hardware uses to select the correct packet transformation.","Each flow ID cache entry stores the LQ ID, LQ protocol, L3, and L4 fields that identify a particular VR flow along with state indicating whether to hardware or software forwarding packets belonging to the micro-flow. The PFE ingress unit generates an index into the flow ID cache by hashing the incoming packet's LQ ID, LQ protocol, L3, and L4 header fields. It then looks-up the indexed cache entry and compares the packet micro-flow ID fields to the cached micro-flow ID fields. On a cache hit, the FwdAction field of the cache entry indicates whether to software or hardware forward the packet. On a cache miss, the ingress controller allocates a cache entry and forwards the packet to software on processor  for flow learning.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Flow ID Cache Block"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Word","Bits","Name","Description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["0","31","Valid","Indicates the flow ID block ID is"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"valid."]},{"entry":[{},"\u200230:29","FwdAction","Indicates forwarding action:"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"0: Pending"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"1: Software forward"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"2: Hardware forward"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"3: Hardware forward SPF"]},{"entry":[{},"28","Reserved",{}]},{"entry":[{},"27","AgeEnable","Enable for Flow Aging"]},{"entry":[{},"26","Reserved",{}]},{"entry":[{},"\u200225:16","VRGroupID","The VR invalidation group ID."]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"The hardware uses this ID to select"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"an entry in the Invalidation Tag"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"table to determine if this FCB"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"should be invalidated"]},{"entry":[{},"15:0","FlowAgeTime","Software uses this field to set the"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"flow lifetime in seconds."]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"Hardware translates the flow"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"lifetime into an expiration"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"timestamp after which the flow"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"will become invalid"]},{"entry":["1","\u200231:16","PendingTag","The tag uniquely identifies a flow"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"from other flows which have"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"resided in the same FCB.

Software should issue the TCB update control packet before issuing the packet being forwarded. This ensures that the forwarded packet is processed according to the updated TCB.","In some embodiments, several fields may be used to maintain packet order and associate the TCB with a specific flow. In flow mode, where several NEW packets for a flow could be sent to the CPU, there is a danger that once the CPU updates the TCB and FCB a packet could be hardware forwarded while the CPU still has packets for that flow. In one embodiment, packet order is enforced by the TCB. When the TCB is written the DropCpuPkt bit should be zero, this will allow the CPU to send the NEW packets it has for that flow. However, when the first FWD_HW packet is seen with this bit clear, the packet forwarding engine (e.g., packet forwarding engine ) will update the TCB and set this bit. Subsequent packets from the CPU (recognized because they are marked FWD_HW_COH) will be dropped. In alternative embodiments, packet order may be maintained by a conflict cache in the DMA engine.","There is also a consistency check performed between the FCB and the TCB. On ingress the SF header, SrcChan is replaced with the PendingTag field of the FCB, on egress, the SrcChan is compared against the FCBTag field of the TCB. If the tags mismatch, the packet is dropped. For prefix mode, the SrcChan is replaced with zero and the FCBTag field is initialized to zero.","Next, a packet processor executing the method performs header transformation (block ). In its simplest form, the packet header transformation involves the replacement of some number of header bytes of an ingress packet with some number of bytes of replacement header data. Under the control of a TCB, the PFE egress unit can selectively replace and recompute specific fields in a small set of protocol headers.","The PFE egress unit begins the header transform by stripping the incoming packet's SF header along with the number of bytes indicated by the SF header offset field. At that point, the controller will begin copying bytes from the buffer pointed to by the TCB's HdrPtr field into the egress packet buffer. The PFE will copy the number of new header bytes defined by the TCB's Hdrlen field.","After performing this header replacement, the PFE then goes through the TCB enable bits to determine what other header transformations need to be made.","Next, egress rate limiting is performed (blocks , ). Further details on rate limiting are presented below.","Finally, egress statistics are updated (blocks , ) and the method returns to block  to await reception of another packet.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":"402"},"Next, the method receives a packet associated with the flow (block ). Upon receiving a packet, the method determines if the flow should be invalidated or not (block ). In some embodiments of the present invention, a flow cache block (FCB) describing the flow maintains a VR Group ID value. This value is compared to a tag entry in a VR group invalidation table. If the values are different, the flow is invalid and is marked as such (block ). The packet may be dropped or it may be forwarded to software running on processor  for reestablishment of a flow or other processing. Otherwise, the flow is valid and hardware acceleration continues for the packet (block ).","In some embodiments, the VR group invalidation is typically incremented (thereby causing the FCB value and the VR group invalidation table value to differ) upon the occurrence of one of several events. One event is flow expiration. In some embodiments a PFE ingress controller applies a flow expiration timestamp to each new flow at the time software establishes the flow. Software defines the flow lifetime by setting the FCB FlowAgeTime field with the number of seconds the flow should remain active. The FCB AgeEnable field is also set for flow aging to be applied.","When a packet arrives for a valid flow, the PFE ingress controller compares the incoming packet's assigned timestamp with the FCB expiration timestamp. If the packet's timestamp exceeds the flow's expiration timestamp, then the PFE will invalidate the flow and send the packet to software with FwdCtl\u2212FWD_New.","In addition to flow aging, the PFE microcode may support a software-initiated flow invalidation scheme. According to one embodiment, at the time software establishes a new flow with an FCB_UPDATE, it assigns the flow to one of 1024 VR invalidation groups by setting the FCB VRGroupID field. The PFE maintains an invalidation tag for each of the VR groups in a table, during the FCB_UPDATE the PFE copies the associated invalidation tag from the table and stores it into the new flow's FCB. Each time a packet arrives for the flow, the PFE ingress controller compares the FCB invalidation tag with the tag value in the associated invalidation table entry. If the PFE detects that an invalidation event has occurred for that flow, then the flow is re-established as a new flow. Software can invalidate all member flows of a VR group by changing the value of the invalidation tag in memory with a MEM_WR command to the appropriate address.","In some embodiments, VR Group index 0 is reserved for pending flows and the tag value in the invalidation table must be zero.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0089","num":"0088"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00006","num":"00006"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 6"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"VR Group Invalidation Tag Entry Format"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Word","Bits","Name","Description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"0","\u200231:16","Reserved",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"15:0","VRInvTag","VR group invalidation tag."]},{"entry":[{},"1","31:0","Reserved"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Additionally, in some embodiments, when software sets the FCB's FlowAction field to hardware forward SPF, the PFE performs special TCP header checks before hardware forwarding packets in this flow.

The packet's color is encoded into the rm field of the LQ header. The PFE increments the C and P buckets by the CIR and PIR values, respectively, in 1 ms intervals.","The PFE egress unit may optionally drop Yellow or Red packets or may color packets for a downstream dropper.

When requesting access to the data structure, the first processor performs a \u201cload-memory-lock,\u201d and when complete, the first processor performs a \u201cstore-memory-unlock.\u201d Accordingly, only one processor may update a data structure in cache at a time. Data structures include metering control blocks and status blocks. The cache lock bit is included within the cache tag store for each data element in the cache.","Systems and methods for hardware accelerated packet routing are disclosed.
