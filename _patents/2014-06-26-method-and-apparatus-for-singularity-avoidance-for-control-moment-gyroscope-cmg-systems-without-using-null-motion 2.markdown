title: Method and apparatus for singularity avoidance for control moment gyroscope (CMG) systems without using null motion
abstract: A method is described for avoiding gyroscopic singularities during attitude correction to a system, such as a spacecraft having a CMG array. The method receives a corrective torque vector μ and gimbal angle values δ for each of at least three gimbals within the CMG array. The method generates a Jacobian matrix A as a function of gimbal angle values δ. The method calculates a determinant D of Jacobian matrix A. If the determinant is not equal to zero, it is not singular, and the method calculates a gimbal rate {dot over (δ)} using a pseudo-inverse steering law equation. If the determinant is equal to zero, it is singular, and the method calculates a gimbal rate {dot over (δ)} using a singularity avoidance steering law equation. The gimbal rate {dot over (δ)} is output and can be applied to a CMG array resulting in applied torque to a spacecraft and attitude correction.

Field of the Invention","This invention relates to the field of spacecraft vehicle control and, more specifically, to a method and apparatus for avoiding gyroscope array singularities.","2. Description of the Related Art","Control moment gyroscope (CMG) arrays are used for spacecraft attitude control due to their torque-producing capability. A typical attitude control system includes an array of three or more CMGs. Each CMG within the array includes a rotor spinning about an axis mounted to an actuated gimbal. The rotational motion of the rotor and gimbal creates an angular momentum vector and a torque vector. The torque vector is orthogonal to the angular momentum vector. The rate of rotation of the gimbal controls the torque vector, producing movement in a desired direction when the torque is not zero.","Controlling attitude for a spacecraft requires at least three degrees of freedom. Thus, a typical attitude adjustment system may use an array of at least three CMGs that together output a combined torque. A corrective torque vector can be calculated by comparing the desired attitude of the spacecraft with the actual spacecraft attitude to generate a corrective torque vector \u03bc.","Corrective torque vector \u03bc may then be used to calculate the gimbal rate {dot over (\u03b4)} necessary to correct attitude. This calculation may be expressed as A{dot over (\u03b4)}=\u03bc, where A is a Jacobian matrix as a function of the gimbal angle values \u03b4 for the CMGs in the CMG array, {dot over (\u03b4)} is a gimbal rate and \u03bc is the corrective torque vector. Without performing null motion calculations, the gimbal rate {dot over (\u03b4)} can be calculated by a pseudo-inverse steering law equation {dot over (\u03b4)}=A(AA)\u03bc where {dot over (\u03b4)} is the gimbal rate, A is a Jacobian matrix determined by the gimbal angle values \u03b4 for each of the CMGs in the CMG array, Ais the Jacobian matrix A transposed, and \u03bc is the corrective torque vector.","An undesirable condition, known as a singularity or a singular state, occurs when gimbals of a CMG array are respectively oriented so that each of the torque vectors produced by moving the gimbals are parallel to each other. The pseudo-inverse steering law equation is unusable when a CMG array is in a singular state. When a CMG array is in a singular state, the determinant D of Jacobian matrix A is zero. For a CMG array using three CMGs, a Jacobian matrix A has the form",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"msub":{"mi":"L","mn":"1"}},{"msub":{"mi":"L","mn":"2"}},{"msub":{"mi":"L","mn":"3"}}]},{"mtd":[{"msub":{"mi":"M","mn":"1"}},{"msub":{"mi":"M","mn":"2"}},{"msub":{"mi":"M","mn":"3"}}]},{"mtd":[{"msub":{"mi":"N","mn":"1"}},{"msub":{"mi":"N","mn":"2"}},{"msub":{"mi":"N","mn":"3"}}]}]}},"mo":","}}},"br":{},"sub":["i ","i ","i ","1","2","3","3","2","2","1","3","3","1","3","1","2","2","1"],"sup":["th ","th ","th "]},"Various calculations are known in the art for addressing singularities. These methods include singularity-robust inverse techniques, path planning methods, preferred gimbal angle methods and the use of variable speed CMGs (VSCMGs).

No. 6,039,290 to Wie et al. teaches a method using non-zero elements in the off-diagonal element of the positive definite diagonal matrix P. However, the choice of matrix P is arbitrary and does not guarantee quick transients of singular states.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,131,056 to Bailey et al. teaches a method of using an open-loop signal when the CMG array becomes singular. This method is computationally expensive and may result in a large control error due to disturbances.","In accordance with one embodiment, a method for avoiding gyroscopic singularities during attitude correction includes: receiving a corrective torque vector \u03bc; receiving gimbal angle values \u03b4 for each of at least three gimbals within a CMG array; generating a Jacobian matrix A as a function of the gimbal angle values \u03b4; calculating a determinant D of the Jacobian matrix A; determining whether the determinant D is equal to zero; wherein when the determinant D is not equal to zero, calculating a gimbal rate {dot over (\u03b4)} using a pseudo-inverse steering law equation; otherwise, wherein when the determinant D is equal to zero, calculating a gimbal rate {dot over (\u03b4)} using a singularity avoidance steering law equation; and outputting the gimbal rate {dot over (\u03b4)}.","In accordance with another embodiment, a computer based apparatus for avoiding gyroscopic singularities during attitude correction includes a processing component configured to perform the above method.","In accordance with another embodiment, a computer program storage component has stored therein program instructions executable by a computer processing component to perform the above method.","Embodiments in accordance with the invention are further described herein with reference to the drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","10","20","21","21","21","40","30","100","20"],"i":["a","b ","c"]},"In one embodiment, computer apparatus  including method  is located on spacecraft .
