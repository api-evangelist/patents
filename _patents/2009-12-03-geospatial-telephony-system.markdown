Technical Field of the Invention","The present invention relates in general to communication systems and in particular, to conferencing systems.","2. Description of Related Art","Rapid establishment of voice communication sessions is an important requirement in modern telephony systems. Today, with the advent of buddy lists and contact lists, a user can set up a call by simply pressing a single button and almost immediately receive the ring-back signal from the called party. However, such \u201cspeed dialing\u201d still requires some manual initiation of the call, which can be tedious and error prone. In addition, a user must have some knowledge of the identity of the called party to initiate the call. If the user is only aware of the location of the called party, the user may have to first access a directory service before initiating the call or the user may simply not be able to establish a call at all with the desired called party.","Moreover, traditional \u201cspeed dialing\u201d is only able to set up a voice conversation between two parties, the single caller and the single callee. In some cases, a voice conversation between several or perhaps even numerous parties may be desired. For example, in enterprise business scenarios, people typically work on teams, and therefore, there may be a business need for the rapid establishment of multiparty voice calls to meet each team's business objectives. First-responder, emergency and government applications may also require multiparty conference calls between members of a team. In addition, multiparty calls may also be desired in consumer applications.","Many service providers offer a voice conference call service in which a group of people can simultaneously communicate with each other. Typically, in such conferencing systems, each user is provided a 10 or more digit dial-in number plus a 7 or more digit access code to join the conference. After dialing the dial-in number, interacting with an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system, and entering the additional access code digits, each of the multiple callers are bridged together so that they are able to speak to and hear each other within a conference room.","However, the process of joining each user separately to a conference call takes time. Furthermore, conventional conference bridge systems typically require coordination and scheduling between users. For example, the team must dial-in to the conference bridge at a certain, specified agreed-upon time. Thus, in addition to being inconvenient for all users due to entry of a large number of DTMF digits, conventional conference bridges do not facilitate spontaneous, ad-hoc voice conferences, which may be required in many enterprise, consumer and emergency communication scenarios.","For example, in some applications, especially those involving emergency response, telephone users at multiple geospatial locations must be notified of an event and then be placed in a conference call together to conduct a discussion, define an appropriate plan, etc. Existing solutions require an operator to first manually lookup various telephone numbers and then to manually place the parties together in the conference by providing a dial-in number or separately dialing each party. This can be a time-consuming and error-prone process.","Recently, some service providers have begun to offer a special multiparty voice service referred to as group push-to-talk. A user having a special type of cell phone, who also purchases a special group push-to-talk service from the service provider, can engage in a group push-to-talk voice communication by depressing a single key to speak to another user. However, group push-to-talk systems do not truly set up persistent conference calls. In the currently available push-to-talk service, only a single person can speak at any one time, and coordination or protocol is required in order to establish who is allowed to speak next, i.e. which single user is allowed to depress his\/her group Push-to-Talk button on the special set.","Furthermore, the other user must also have the same special type of cell phone and same special service from the same service provider. Thus, a major limitation of this walkie-talkie-like system is that all users must have the same special cell phone devices and the same service provision. Other users having standard non-special cell phones, PBX phones and POTS phones cannot participate in the call. Currently, there are no known systems or solutions that address the need for automatically conferencing together parties with various types of communication devices based on their locations.","A node within a geospatial telephony system, in one embodiment of the present invention, allows for the automatic initiation of a conference call between conference participants based on the location of at least one of the participants. The node is coupled to a communication network and includes a memory for storing a geospatial telephony application and a processor operable to execute instructions of the geospatial telephony application to receive a location at which a first communication device is geospatially located and enable a conference call to be initiated between the first communication device and at least one other communication device based on the location.","In one embodiment, the system is a static geospatial telephony system in which the location of the first communication device is provided by a second communication device and the node is further operable to access a database to retrieve a telephone number of record of the first communication device. For example, the second communication device can include a graphical user interface for displaying a map to a user to enable the user to select the location from the map.","A single location can be entered or, in other embodiments, multiple locations can be entered, each having a different communication device geospatially positioned thereat. If multiple locations are entered, the conference call is initiated between all of the communication devices. In a further embodiment, the location can include a geographic region and the node can access the database to retrieve multiple telephone numbers of record for multiple communication devices that are geospatially positioned within the geographic region for the conference call. In addition, the location can further include a filter and the node can select specific ones of the multiple telephone numbers of record based on the filter for the conference call.","In another embodiment, the system is a dynamic geospatial telephony system in which the location of the first communication device is provided by the first communication device and the node is further operable to determine an identity of at least one other communication device based on the location. For example, the memory can further store a conference policy that indicates that the conference call is to be initiated with at least one other communication device when the first communication device is geospatially positioned at the location. In addition, the first communication device can include a Global Positioning System (GPS) device operable to determine the location of the first communication device.","In a first exemplary embodiment, the node is one of the first communication device and the at least one other communication device. In a second exemplary embodiment, the node is a switch within the communication network and coupled to a conference server to facilitate the conference call between the first communication device and the at least one other communication device. In a third exemplary embodiment, the node is a web server hosting a website controlled by the processor. For example, in a static geospatial telephony system, the processor can be operable to push a web page to the at least one other communication device to enable a user of the at least one other communication device to enter the location. In a fourth exemplary embodiment, the node is a watcher of the first communication device and is coupled to a presence server to receive the location of the first communication device as presence information thereof.","In another embodiment of the present invention, a geospatial telephony system, allows for the automatic initiation of a conference call between conference participants based on the location of at least one of the participants. The system includes a node coupled to a communication network to receive a location at which a first communication device is geospatially located and enable a conference call to be initiated between the first communication device and at least one other communication device based on the location. The system further includes a conference server including a conference room operable to manage the conference call. The conference server creates the conference room and connects the first communication device and the at least one other communication device together in the conference call via the conference room.","In one embodiment, the system is a static geospatial telephony system and includes a database maintaining a list of locations and telephone numbers of record for the locations. The location of the first communication device is provided by a second communication device and the node accesses the database to retrieve the telephone number of record of the first communication device based on the location.","In another embodiment, the geospatial telephony system is a dynamic telephony system and the location is provided by the first communication device. In this embodiment, the node is further operable to determine an identity of the at least one other communication device using a conference policy that indicates that the conference call is to be initiated with the at least one other communication device when the first communication device is geospatially positioned at the location.","In a further embodiment, the conference server further creates a temporary conference room to connect the first communication device and the at least one other communication device to a recorder to play a recorded message that prompts each of the first communication device and the at least one other communication device to opt-in to join the conference call.","In yet a further embodiment, the system includes a call center coupled to a plurality of call center agents, in which one of the call center agents is associated with the first communication device or the at least one other communication device.","In still a further embodiment, the system includes a presence server coupled to the communication network and operable to register the node as a watcher of the first communication device, receive the location of the first communication device as presence information thereof and provide the presence information of the first communication device to the node.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","10"]},"For example, the geospatial telephony system  can enable a conference call to be automatically established between a first communication device and a second communication device based on the location of the first or second communication device or . By way of example, but not limitation, such communication devices  can include plain old telephone service (POTS) phones, cellular\/mobile telephones, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) phones, desktop phones, PBX phones, desktop computers, laptop computers, Portable Digital Assistants (PDAs) and Land Mobile Radio (LMR) devices (i.e., two-way radio devices).","The geospatial telephony system  includes a voice\/data conference server  providing one or more conference rooms  for conference calls. Each conference room  is associated with a particular conference call, and is responsible for establishing the different conference legs to\/from each of the conference participants (devices and ) for the conference call and for managing the leg states of the conference legs. For example, the conference room  can establish a respective conference leg for each voice and data connection to the conference call, add additional voice and\/or data conference legs to the conference call, drop one or more voice and\/or data conference legs and mute or un-mute one or more of the voice conference legs.","Although not specifically shown in , multiple conference rooms  can exist in parallel. However, voice between conference rooms  is not mixed (unless directed by an operator), so that participants in one conference room  do not unintentionally hear participants in another conference room .","In one embodiment, the conference server  creates and manages the conference rooms  in specialized conferencing hardware or circuitry. In another embodiment, the conference server  creates and manages and conference rooms  using a combination of specialized conferencing hardware or circuitry, software and\/or firmware. In yet another embodiment, the conference server  executes software routines on a standard, general-purpose personal computer (PC) to create and manage the conference rooms . In this embodiment, the conference server  is designed to enable additional separate general-purpose PCs to be stacked together for increased system scalability and redundancy. As such, no special hardware or circuitry, such as DSP chips and boards and high speed audio busses, is required, thereby minimizing manufacturing costs of the conference server .","The telephony connections for exchanging media between the communication devices and and the conference server  are routed via communication network . The communication network  can be, for example, an Internet Protocol (IP) or other packet-based network that utilizes packet-switched connections, such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), e.g., Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), a circuit-switched network that utilizes circuit-switched connections, such as Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), e.g., Primary Rate Interface (PRI) trunks, a mobile network, e.g., Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) or Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) or any other network or combination of networks. For example, the conference server  can exchange SIP commands and VoIP Real Time Protocol (RTP) media with an external SIP-to-PSTN gateway, SIP phones, and other SIP devices, such as SIP-to-Radio converters, SIP overhead speakers, etc. The conference server  can also incorporate, or interface to, an internal or external T1\/E1 telephone trunk card for the exchange of voice signaling and media via the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) with conventional POTS, PBX, and cellular telephones.","The geospatial telephony system  also includes a geospatial telephony application . The geospatial telephony application  communicates with one or more users (i.e., communication device ) to receive a location at which one or more communication devices (i.e., communication device and\/or ) are geospatially located. In addition, the geospatial telephony application  is coupled to the conference server  to enable a conference call to be initiated between communication devices and based on the location. For example, the geospatial telephony application  can issue suitable Application Programming Interface (API) commands to the conference server  to create a conference room  for a conference call, dial-out to users to join the users to the conference room , mute users, etc.","In one embodiment, the geospatial telephony application  is a software program installed on the conference server . In another embodiment, the geospatial telephony application is a software program installed on a network node, such as a PSTN switch, PBX, central office, mobile switching center (MSC), Wireless Access Point (WAP) or other node. In yet another embodiment, the geospatial telephony application  is a software program installed on a communication device or . In still another embodiment, the geospatial telephony application is a software program installed on a web server. In other embodiments, the geospatial telephony application  can be distributed among multiple nodes, including the conference server . For example, the geospatial telephony application  can be distributed between communication device and conference server , communication device and another node within the network (i.e., a switch and\/or web server) or the conference server  and a node within the network (i.e., a switch and\/or web server).","In an exemplary embodiment, the geospatial telephony system  is a static geospatial telephony system in which the location of one or more communication devices and\/or changes infrequently (i.e., the communication devices do not move significantly). In this embodiment, the geospatial telephony application  enables a user to select one or more desired locations at which communication devices are present for a conference call. Upon receiving the desired location(s), the geospatial telephony application  accesses a database  to retrieve the telephone numbers-of-record for each of the desired locations and issues commands to the conference server  to create a conference room  for a conference call between the communication devices associated with the retrieved telephone numbers-of-record. Once the communication devices accept the invitation to join the conference call, the conference room  establishes a separate conference leg for each voice and data connection for each communication device to the conference call. For example, in a simple embodiment, an operator can select multiple locations on a map (i.e., schools, police station, mayor's office, etc.), then each telephone of record (TOR) is looked up from the database , and the multiple telephones are automatically dialed and conferenced together.","In an exemplary operation, a map can be provided by the geospatial telephony application  as a user interface on communication device to enable a user of communication device to specify the location (i.e., latitude and longitude, cross roads, region, etc.) at which communication device is present. The map can be pushed to communication device from the geospatial telephony application  through network  or the map can be stored internally on communication device and accessed by geospatial telephony application  installed on communication device . Upon receiving the location of communication device , the geospatial telephony application  can retrieve the telephone number-of-record of communication device from the database  and issue a command to the conference server  to create a conference room  and establish a conference call between communication devices and via conference room  and communication network . In response, the conference server  can automatically establish a conference leg between communication device and conference room  (i.e., use the current network connections between communication device and conference server  to create a voice\/data connection) and dial-out to communication device to invite communication device to join the conference call and establish a conference leg between communication device and conference room .","In another exemplary embodiment, the geospatial telephony system  is a dynamic geospatial telephony system in which the location of one or more communication devices and\/or changes dynamically. In this embodiment, the geospatial telephony application  uses a current location (i.e., a real-time Global Positioning System (GPS) location indicating latitude and longitude, cross roads, region, etc.) of one communication device, e.g., communication device , to determine whether a conference call should be established. In particular, the geospatial telephony application  accesses a conference policy  to determine whether a conference call is required based on the location of communication device . The conference policy can be associated with communication device or can be associated with a particular location and\/or region.","The conference policy  can include, for example, a predefined list of users that are to be included in a particular conference call when communication device is at a particular location. To initiate the conference call, the geospatial telephony application  provides the list of users for the particular conference call to the conference server  to enable the conference server  to create the conference room  for the conference call and dial-out to the users in the list to attempt to join these users to the conference call. Once the users optionally accept the invitation to join the conference call, the conference room  establishes a separate conference leg for each voice and data connection for each user to the conference call.","The list of users in the conference policy  can include a single telephone number for each conference participant or multiple telephone numbers for each conference participant. For example, the conference server  can try a first number for a participant, such as his\/her cell phone, and if the participant does not answer at the first number, then a second number, such as an office phone and then perhaps a third number, such as a home phone, in an attempt to reach that conference participant. Instead of including telephone numbers, the list can include usernames of users that are to be called for a particular conference call. The geospatial telephony application  can also query a database (not shown) that maps the usernames to pre-registered telephone numbers, and then issue a dial-by-number command to the conference server . Each user can manage his\/her username to telephone number mapping.","In an exemplary operation of the dynamic geospatial telephony system , the geospatial telephony application  can receive the current location of communication device from communication device or from another network node and access a conference policy  that indicates whether a conference call involving communication device and at least one other communication device, e.g., communication device , should be established. Upon determining that a conference call should be established between communication device and communication device as a result of the current location of communication device , the geospatial telephony application  can issue a command to the conference server  to create a conference room  and establish a conference call between communication devices and via conference room  and communication network . In response, the conference server  can automatically establish a conference leg between communication device and conference room  (i.e., use the current network connections between communication device and conference server  to create a voice\/data connection) and dial-out to communication device to invite communication device to join the conference call and establish a conference leg between communication device and conference room .","Referring now to , exemplary implementations of the geospatial telephony application (GTA)  in various nodes  throughout the system are illustrated. In , the GTA  is implemented within a network switch . By way of example, but not limitation, the switch can be a central office, Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) switch, mobile switching center (MSC), private branch exchange (PBX), Local Area Network (LAN) switch, Wireless Access Point (WAP), Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) switch or any other type of network switch.","The switch includes a processor , a memory , switch fabric , input ports  and output ports . The memory maintains the GTA , and the processor is coupled to the memory to execute instructions of the GTA . For example, in embodiments in which the geospatial telephony system is static, the processor can execute instructions of the GTA  to process a request for a map from a communication device coupled to the switch , push a map to a communication device, receive a location from a communication device, retrieve a telephone number of record for the location from a database internal or external to the switch and\/or generate commands to a conference server to initiate a conference call with the communication device having the telephone number of record and another party (e.g., the communication device that transmitted the location).","In an exemplary operation, the switch can receive a request from a user operating a communication device coupled to the switch to initiate a conference call between the communication device and one more other communication devices positioned at one or more locations. The request can include the locations at which the other communication devices are known to be or assumed to be. The processor can initialize the GTA  to process the request by accessing a database stored internally within the switch or located remote from the switch to retrieve the telephone number(s) of record for the desired location(s). Upon receiving the telephone number(s) of record, the processor can generate commands to a conference server within the switch or external to the switch to initiate a conference call between the communication devices. For example, the processor can provide the retrieved telephone number(s) of record to the conference server and connect the communication device that sent the request to the conference server for the conference call.","As another example, in embodiments in which the geospatial telephony system is dynamic, the processor can execute instructions of the GTA  to request\/receive a location of a mobile communication device, access a conference policy to determine whether a conference call should be established as a result of the location of the mobile communication device and\/or generate commands to a conference server to initiate such a conference call. In an exemplary operation, the switch is coupled to a cellular telephone to receive a current location of the cellular telephone. The location can be determined, for example, by a GPS receiving device within the cellular telephone. The location can be automatically transmitted by the cellular telephone at regular intervals directly to the switch or to another node within the network, which then provides the location to the switch . For example, the cellular telephone can provide it's location to a web server which the switch can access, or a presence server which can then transmit the location to the switch ","Upon receiving the location of the cellular telephone, the switch initializes the GTA  to access a conference policy stored within the switch or external to the switch (e.g., within a conference server, external database or other network node) to determine whether the location of the cellular telephone indicates that a conference call should be established. For example, the conference policy may indicate that when the cellular telephone is at a particular geographic location (latitude, longitude) or within a particular region (e.g., defined by a radius surrounding a particular latitude, longitude), that a conference call between the cellular telephone and another party or parties should be established. If the conference policy indicates that a conference call should be established, the processor generates commands to the conference server (internal or external) to initiate a conference call between the communication devices. For example, the processor can provide the telephone number(s) of the other communication devices to be brought in on the conference call to the conference server and connect the cellular telephone to the conference server for the conference call.","The switch fabric  includes a combination of hardware and software responsible for moving data coming into to the switch via one of the input ports  to the correct output port  for transmission of the data to the next node in the network. Thus, the switch fabric  includes the switching units (individual boxes) in the switch , the integrated circuits that they contain, and the programming that allows switching paths to be controlled. For example, the switch fabric  can operate to connect a communication device coupled to the switch to the conference server in order to complete a conference call involving the communication device.","As used herein, the term \u201cprocessor\u201d is generally understood to be a device that drives a general-purpose computer, such as a PC. It is noted, however, that other processing devices, such as microcontrollers, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), or a combination thereof, can be used as well to achieve the benefits and advantages described herein. In addition, as used herein, the term \u201cmemory\u201d includes any type of data storage device, including but not limited to, a hard drive, random access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), flash memory, compact disc, floppy disc, ZIP\u00ae or disc drive, tape drive, database or other type of storage device or storage medium.","In , the GTA  is implemented within a communication device , such as communication device shown in . Thus, communication device can be, for example, a personal computer, laptop computer, VoIP phone, plain old telephone service (POTS) phone, cellular\/mobile telephone, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) phone, desktop phone, PBX phone, Portable Digital Assistant (PDA) or Land Mobile Radio (LMR) device.","The communication device includes a processor , memory , graphical user interface (GUI)  and network interface . The network interface is coupled to a communication network, as shown in , to enable the communication device to communicate with network nodes and other communication devices. For example, the network interface can be connected to transmit and receive media (e.g., circuit-switched voice, VoIP media streams and\/or data) to and from a network switch. Thus, the network interface can include one or more of a packet-switched interface for transmitting VoIP media, a circuit-switched interface for transmitted circuit-switched voice or a radio interface for transmitting media over an air interface. The GUI  includes a display  and an input device . By way of example, but not limitation, the input device  can include one or more of a mouse, keyboard, keypad, light pen, stylus, touch screen or other type of user input device.","The memory maintains the GTA , and the processor is coupled to the memory to execute instructions of the GTA . For example, in embodiments in which the geospatial telephony system is static, the processor can execute instructions of the GTA  to process a request for a map from a user received via input device , request\/receive a map from a network node via network interface , display a map to a user via display , receive a location on the map from a user via input device , retrieve a telephone number of record for the location via network interface and\/or generate commands to a conference server to initiate a conference call with the communication device having the telephone number of record and another party (e.g., the communication device ) via network interface ","In an exemplary operation, the GTA  can display to a user of the communication device a map from which the user can select one or more locations or provide a prompt (e.g., voice and\/or data entry prompt) for the user to enter one or more locations (e.g., latitude and longitude coordinates, street address, cross roads, designated regions, etc.) via the GUI . In response to the user entering one or more locations, the GTA  can access either internal memory or a remote database storing a list of locations and associated telephone numbers of record to retrieve the telephone number(s) of record for the entered location(s). In response to receiving the telephone number(s) of record, the GTA  can generate commands to a conference server to initiate a conference call between the communication device and other communication device(s) having the retrieved telephone number(s) of record.","As another example, in embodiments in which the geospatial telephony system is dynamic, the processor can execute instructions of the GTA  to determine a current location of the communication device , transmit the current location of the communication device to a network node via network interface , access a conference policy to determine whether a conference call should be established as a result of the location of the communication device and\/or generate commands to a conference server to initiate such a conference call.","In an exemplary operation, the communication device is a cellular telephone that is operable to determine its location (i.e., latitude and longitude coordinates), using, for example, a GPS receiving device (not shown) or other positioning techniques, such as triangulation based on cell phone network tower locations. The telephone's location can be determined at regular intervals or upon a request from a user or the network. Upon determining its location, the processor executes instructions of the GTA  to access a conference policy stored within the cellular telephone or within the network (e.g., within a conference server, switch, web server, external database or other network node) to determine whether the location of the cellular telephone indicates that a conference call should be established. If the conference policy indicates that a conference call should be established, the processor generates commands to the conference server via network interface to initiate a conference call between the communication devices. For example, the processor can provide its telephone number and the telephone number(s) of the other communication devices to be brought in on the conference call to the conference server.","In , the GTA  is implemented within a web server based architecture . The web server architecture includes a processor , memory , and network interface . The network interface is coupled to a communication network, as shown in , to enable the web server to communicate with network nodes and communication devices. For example, the network interface can be connected to transmit and receive media (e.g., circuit-switched voice, VoIP media streams and\/or data) to and from user communication devices and other network nodes. Thus, the network interface can include one or more of a packet-switched I\/F for transmitting VoIP media, or a circuit-switched I\/F for transmitted circuit-switched voice.","The memory maintains a web site  hosted by the web server and the GTA . The processor is coupled to the memory to execute instructions of the GTA . For example, in embodiments in which the geospatial telephony system is static, the processor can execute instructions of the GTA  to process a request for a map from a communication device or other network node received via network interface , transmit a map to a communication device or other network node via network interface , receive a location from a communication device or other network node via network interface , retrieve a telephone number of record for the location via network interface and\/or generate commands to a conference server to initiate a conference call with the communication device having the telephone number of record and another party via network interface ","In an exemplary operation, the web server can host a website  associated with the GTA  to enable users to access the services provided by the GTA . For example, the web server can push one or more web pages of the website  to a user to allow the user to request a map of a particular region. In response to the received request, the website  and GTA  can push a particular map to the user via network interface . Thereafter, the user can select one or more locations on the map and transmit the location(s) to the web server . In response to receiving the requested location(s), the GTA  can access a database stored internally within the web server or located remote from the web server to retrieve the telephone number(s) of record for the desired location(s). Upon receiving the telephone number(s) of record, the processor can execute instructions of the GTA  to generate commands to a conference server to initiate a conference call. For example, the processor can provide the retrieved telephone number(s) of record and the telephone number of the user to the conference server.","As another example, in embodiments in which the geospatial telephony system is dynamic, the processor can execute instructions of the GTA  to receive a current location of a communication device, access a conference policy to determine whether a conference call should be established as a result of the location of the communication device and\/or generate commands to a conference server to initiate such a conference call.","In an exemplary operation, the web server can host a website  associated with the GTA  to enable a mobile communication device to access the services provided by the GTA .

Upon receiving the telephone number(s) of record, the processor can execute instructions of the GTA  to initiate the conference application  and create a conference room  for a conference call. For example, the processor can provide the retrieved telephone number(s) of record and the telephone number of the communication device to the conference application  and issue one or commands\/instructions to the conference application  to dial-out to the telephone numbers provided.","As another example, in embodiments in which the geospatial telephony system is dynamic, the processor can execute instructions of the GTA  to receive a current location of a communication device, access a conference policy to determine whether a conference call should be established as a result of the location of the communication device and\/or generate commands to the conference application  to initiate such a conference call.","In an exemplary operation, the conference server can provide an Application Program Interface (API) to enable a mobile communication device to access the services provided by the GTA . For example, the processor can enable the mobile communication device to transmit its location to the conference server . In response to receiving the location, the processor can execute instructions of the GTA  to access a conference policy stored within the conference server or external to the web server to determine whether the location of the cellular telephone indicates that a conference call should be established. If the conference policy indicates that a conference call should be established, the processor can generate commands to the conference application  to initiate a conference call. For example, the processor can provide the telephone number of the mobile communication device and the telephone numbers of other communication devices to be brought in on the conference call to the conference application .","Regardless of whether the GTA  is included within the conference server or whether the geospatial telephony system is dynamic or static, upon receiving commands to initiate a conference call involving two or more conference participants, the conference application  creates a conference room  for the conference call and dials-out to the conference participants. In one embodiment, the conference application  can dial-out to all telephone numbers provided to the conference application . In another embodiment, the conference application  can connect the communication device that initiated the conference call to the conference room  and then dial-out to other conference participants. In this embodiment, the communication device that requested the conference call may be a mobile communication device that provided its location to the GTA , a communication device monitoring the location of a mobile communication device or a communication device that initiated a dial-by-location conference call.","The conference application  can sequentially dial each conference participant or place multiple calls in parallel. That is, instead of calling each participant and waiting for that participant to answer and join the conference call before dialing the next conference participant, the conference application  calls all the participants at the same time, and as each participant answers the call, he\/she is joined to the conference room  for the conference call. The conference application  can automatically join each conference participant to the conference call or wait for an acceptance from the conference participant before joining the conference call.","For example, the conference participants dialed out by the conference server  may initially receive an interactive voice response (IVR) prompt, such as \u201cYou have been invited to a conference call with participant X, please press 1 to join, or press 2 to decline,\u201d where participant X is an identifier of the user that initiated the location-based conference call or an identifier of an operator or group associated with the conference call. After receiving this IVR message, each participant who depresses 1 is joined to the conference room . All audio associated with each dialed-out leg is preferably muted until the called participant accepts the call by pressing 1. Therefore, other participants already joined to the conference call do not hear distracting superfluous sounds in the conference room , such as answering machine prompts, continuous ringing, busy signals, etc.","During the conference call, the conference room  operates to mix incoming voice (or Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) media streams) received from the conference participants and transmit the mixed media streams back out to the conference participants and provide various data conferencing services to the conference participants during the conference call, such as instant messaging, presentation sharing, desktop sharing and video. The conference room  may also implement various policies for managing the conference legs of the conference call, such as muting or un-muting one or more participants and adding and\/or dropping one or more participants, based on, for example, a pre-determined time of release, occurrence of an event or action of another participant, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["10","300","20","30","310","320","30","70","84","82","70","80","82","84","82","84","82","82"],"i":["a","a "]},"Upon retrieving the TOR  of the location  entered by communication device , at step , the GTA  issues API commands to the conference server  to initiate a conference call between communication device and the communication device having the retrieved TOR  (e.g., communication device ).
