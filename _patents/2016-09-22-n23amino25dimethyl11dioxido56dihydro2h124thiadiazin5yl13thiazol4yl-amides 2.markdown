{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a Non-Provisional application which claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62\/222,986 filed on Sep. 24, 2015, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The present invention relates to small molecule compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof that are inhibitors of \u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein (APP) Cleaving Enzyme 1 (BACE1) and inhibitors of BACE2. This invention relates to inhibiting the production of A-beta peptides that can contribute to the formation of neurological deposits of amyloid protein. The present invention also relates to the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative and\/or neurological disorders, as well as the treatment of diabetes in mammals, including humans. More particularly, this invention relates to cyclic sulfonyl guanidine compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof useful for the treatment of neurodegenerative and\/or neurological disorders, such as AD and Down's syndrome, related to A-beta peptide production.","Dementia results from a wide variety of distinctive pathological processes. The most common pathological processes causing dementia are Alzheimer's disease (\u201cAD\u201d), cerebral amyloid angiopathy (\u201cCM\u201d) and prion-mediated diseases (see, e.g., Haan et al., Clin. Neurol. Neurosurg., 1990, 92(4):305-310; Glenner et al., J. Neurol. Sci., 1989, 94:1-28). AD is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory impairment and cognitive dysfunction. AD affects nearly half of all people past the age of 85, the most rapidly growing portion of the United States population. As such, the number of AD patients in the United States is expected to increase from about 4 million to about 14 million by 2050.","The accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2 peptides) is believed to be one of the underlying causes of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most common cause of cognitive decline in the elderly (Hardy & Allsop, Trends Pharmacol Sci., 1991; 12(10):383-8; Selkoe, Behav. Brain Res., 2008; 192(1):106-13). A\u03b2, the major protein constituent of amyloid plaques, is derived from sequential cleavage of the type I integral membrane protein, amyloid precursor protein (APP) by two proteases, \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretase. Proteolytic cleavage of APP by the \u03b2-site APP cleaving enzymes (BACE1 and BACE2) generates a soluble N-terminal ectodomain of APP (sAPP\u03b2) and the C-terminal fragment C99. Subsequent cleavage of the membrane-bound C99 fragment by the \u03b3-secretase liberates the various A\u03b2 peptide species, of which A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 are the most predominant forms (Vassar et al., J. Neurosci., 2009; 29(41):12787-94; Marks & Berg, Neurochem. Res., 2010; 35:181-210). Therefore, limiting the generation of A\u03b2 directly through inhibition of BACE1 is one of the most attractive approaches for the treatment of AD, as BACE1 inhibitors could effectively inhibit the formation of all predominant A\u03b2 peptides.","In addition, it has been determined that BACE1 knock-out mice had markedly enhanced clearance of axonal and myelin debris from degenerated fibers, accelerated axonal regeneration, and earlier reinnervation of neuromuscular junctions compared with littermate controls. These data suggest BACE1 inhibition as a therapeutic approach to accelerate regeneration and recovery after peripheral nerve damage. (See Farah et al., J. Neurosci., 2011, 31(15): 5744-5754).","Insulin resistance and impaired glucose homoeostasis are important indicators of Type 2 diabetes and are early risk factors of AD. In particular, there is a higher risk of sporadic AD in patients with Type 2 diabetes and AD patients are more prone to Type 2 diabetes (Butler, Diabetes, 53:474-481, 2004.). Recently, it has also been proposed that AD should be reconsidered as Type 3 diabetes (de la Monte, J. Diabetes Sci. Technol., 2008; 2(6):1101-1113). Of special interest is the fact that AD and Type 2 diabetes share common pathogenic mechanisms and possibly treatments (Park S. A., J. Clin. Neurol., 2011; 7:10-18; Raffa, Br. J. Clin. Pharmacol 2011, 71(3):365-376). Elevated plasma levels of A\u03b2, the product of BACE activities, were recently associated with hyperglycemia and obesity in humans (see Meakin et al., Biochem J., 2012, 441(1):285-96; Martins, Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, 8 (2005) 269-282). Moreover, increased A\u03b2 production prompts the onset of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in mice (C\u00f3zar-Castellano, Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab., 302:E1373-E1380, 2012; Delibegovic, Diabetologia (2011) 54:2143-2151). Finally, it is also suggested that circulating A\u03b2 could participate in the development of atherosclerosis in both humans and mice (De Meyer, Atherosclerosis 216 (2011) 54-58; Catapano, Atherosclerosis 210 (2010) 78-87; Roher, Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1812 (2011) 1508-1514).","Therefore, it is believed that BACE1 levels may play a critical role in glucose and lipid homoeostasis in conditions of chronic nutrient excess. Specifically, BACE1 inhibitors may be potentially useful for increasing insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle and liver as illustrated by the fact that reduction in BACE1 decreases body weight, protects against diet-induced obesity and enhances insulin sensitivity in mice (see Meakin et al., Biochem. J. 2012, 441(1):285-96). Of equal interest is the identification of LRP1 as a BACE1 substrate and the potential link to atherosclerosis (Strickland, Physiol. Rev., 88: 887-918, 2008; Hyman, J. Biol. Chem., Vol. 280, No. 18, 17777-17785, 2005).","Likewise, inhibition of BACE2 is proposed as a treatment of Type 2 diabetes with the potential to preserve and restore \u03b2-cell mass and stimulate insulin secretion in pre-diabetic and diabetic patients (WO2011\/020806). BACE2 is a \u03b2-cell enriched protease that regulates pancreatic \u03b2 cell function and mass and is a close homologue of BACE1. Pharmacological inhibition of BACE2 increases \u03b2-cell mass and function, leading to the stabilization of Tmem27. (See Esterhazy et al., Cell Metabolism 2011, 14(3): 365-377). It is suggested that BACE2 inhibitors are useful in the treatment and\/or prevention of diseases associated with the inhibition of BACE2 (e.g., Type 2 diabetes, with the potential to preserve and restore \u03b2-cell mass and stimulate insulin secretion in pre-diabetic and diabetic patients) (WO2011\/020806).","Aminodihydrothiazine or thioamidine compounds are described in US2009\/0082560, WO 2009\/091016 and WO 2010\/038686 as useful inhibitors of the \u03b2-secretase enzyme. Fused heterocyclic compounds useful as inhibitors of the \u03b2-secretase enzyme are also described in WO 2011071109 and corresponding US 2012245155. Co-pending PCT application, PCT\/IB2012\/054198, filed by Pfizer Inc on Aug. 17, 2012, also describes aminodihydrothiazine compounds that are useful inhibitors of the \u03b2-secretase enzyme. The present invention is directed to novel cyclic sulfonyl guanidine compounds and their use in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, as well as the treatment of metabolic diseases and conditions such as diabetes and obesity.","A first embodiment of a first aspect of the present invention is a compound of Formula I",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0011"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"42.16mm","wi":"50.97mm","file":"US09611264-20170404-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"Ris a 5- to 6-membered heteroaryl, having one to four heteroatoms independently selected from N, O or S, wherein at least one of the heteroatoms is N and wherein said N is optionally substituted with R; and wherein said 5- to 6-membered heteroaryl is optionally substituted on carbon with one to three R;","Rand Rare each independently hydrogen, Calkyl, Ccycloalkyl or 3- to 7-membered heterocycloalkyl; wherein the Calkyl is optionally substituted with a Calkoxy or with one to three fluoro; and the Ccycloalkyl and 3- to 7-membered heterocycloalkyl are each optionally and independently substituted with one to three fluoro, Calkyl or Calkoxy;","or Rand R, taken together with the carbon to which they are attached, form a Ccycloalkyl ring or 3- to 7-membered heterocycloalkyl ring, each of which is optionally and independently substituted with one to three fluoro, Calkyl or Calkoxy;","Rat each occurrence is independently selected from the group consisting of halo, hydroxy, cyano, Calkyl, Calkoxy, Calkenyl, Calkenyloxy, Calkynyl, Calkynyloxy, Calkoxy-Calkyl, Ccycloalkoxy, Ccycloalkyl, Ccycloalkyl-Calkyl, Ccycloalkyl-Calkoxy, 4- to 6-membered heterocycloalkyl and 4- to 6-membered heterocycloalkyl-Calkyl; wherein said Calkyl, Calkoxy, Calkenyl, Calkenyloxy, Calkynyl, Calkynyloxy, Calkoxy-Calkyl, Ccycloalkoxy, Ccycloalkyl, Ccycloalkyl-Calkyl, Ccycloalkyl-Calkoxy, 4- to 6-membered heterocycloalkyl and 4- to 6-membered heterocycloalkyl-Calkyl are each optionally substituted with one to three substituents independently selected from fluoro, chloro, hydroxy, cyano, methyl, fluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, methoxy, fluoromethoxy, difluoromethoxy and trifluoromethoxy; and","Ris hydrogen or Calkyl optionally substituted with one to three fluoro; or a tautomer thereof or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of said compound or tautomer.","Another embodiment of the present invention is a pharmaceutical composition comprising compounds of Formula I, or a tautomer thereof or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of said compound or tautomer, and a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle, diluent or carrier.

Sulfinimines of Formula V are transformed to adducts of Formula VI via the addition of an appropriately metallated sulfonamide IV (generated, for example, through treatment with n-butyllithium). Sulfonamides of Formula VII are prepared through the deprotection of compound VI with a appropriate agent, such as, but not limited to, trifluoroacetic acid in 1,3-dimethoxybenzene. Compounds of Formula IX are then prepared via treatment with the appropriate isothiocyanate (such as benzoyl isothiocyanate), and subsequent ring closure of VIII using an appropriate alkylating agent such as methyl iodide with a base such as potassium carbonate. Conversion of the bromothiazole of Formula IX to the corresponding amine can be effected via a transition metal-catalyzed coupling reaction, such as a palladium-mediated amination. An example includes using a protected ammonia source, such as, but not limited to 1-(2,4-dimethoxyphenyl)methanamine and a suitable catalyst and ligand choice, for example, tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) and di-tert-butyl[2\u2032,4\u2032,6\u2032-tri(propan-2-yl)biphenyl-2-yl]phosphane or biphenyl-2-yl(di-tert-butyl)phosphane (John Phos).

Additionally, the stereochemistry of the initial product may alternatively be adjusted by further treatment with base followed by protonation with an agent such as water or aqueous ammonium chloride. Additional bases that have utility include lithium diisopropylamide or potassium tert-butoxide. Alternatively, the introduction of a group such as Ror Rwherein one of Rand Ris hydrogen may be initiated by a suitable olefination of X using a suitable base as described above and a reagent such as dimethylmethylideneammonium iodide (Eschenmoser's salt). The resulting dimethylamine adduct may be eliminated directly with base or may be treated with methyl iodide or an oxidizing agent such as perbenzoic acid or tert-butyl hydroperoxide and subjected to treatment with a base such as described above, with the formation of a methylene group. The resulting exo-olefin may be reduced by catalytic hydrogenation over a catalyst consisting of supported or unsupported palladium, nickel or platinum.

The filter cake was thoroughly washed with diethyl ether, affording the product as a white solid, which was found to be crystalline via powder X-ray diffraction. Yield: 36.95 g, 66.39 mmol, 94%. LCMS m\/z 461.3 [M+H]. H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d) \u03b4 10.87 (s, 1H), 10.40 (br s, 1H), 8.70-8.52 (br s, 2H), 8.44 (d, J=2.7 Hz, 1H), 7.78 (s, 1H), 7.75-7.73 (m, 1H), 7.45 (t, J=72.9 Hz, 1H), 4.66 (br AB quartet, J=13.9 Hz, \u0394\u03bd=81 Hz, 2H), 3.23 (s, 3H), 2.65 (s, 3H), 2.35 (s, 3H), 1.84 (br s, 3H). Recrystallization of a sample of 9 from methanol afforded a crystal that was used for X-ray crystal structure analysis (see below); this confirmed the absolute stereochemistry as that drawn.","Data collection was performed on a Bruker APEX diffractometer at room temperature. Data collection consisted of omega and phi scans. Resolution limited to 1.0 angstroms, data collection cut short, thus data to parameter ratio near 3:1.","The structure was solved by direct methods using SHELX software suite in the space group P222. The structure was subsequently refined by the full-matrix least squares method. All non-hydrogen atoms were found and refined using anisotropic displacement parameters.","The hydrogen atoms located on nitrogen were found from the Fourier difference map and refined with distances restrained. The remaining hydrogen atoms were placed in calculated positions and were allowed to ride on their carrier atoms. The final refinement included isotropic displacement parameters for all hydrogen atoms.","Analysis of the absolute structure using likelihood methods (Hooft, 2008) was performed using PLATON (Spek, 2010). The results indicate that the absolute structure has been correctly assigned. The method calculates that the probability that the structure is correct is 100.0. The Hooft parameter is reported as 0.023 with an esd of 0.07.","The final R-index was 3.0%. A final difference Fourier revealed no missing or misplaced electron density.","Pertinent crystal, data collection and refinement information is summarized in Table 1.

From the H NMR spectra, 14 and 15 are enantiomers of one another; 16 and 17 are also enantiomers of one another. NOE studies revealed that irradiation of the methine adjacent to the sulfonyl group results in an enhancement of the quaternary methyl group signal for both 16 and 17, but has no effect on that resonance in 15.
