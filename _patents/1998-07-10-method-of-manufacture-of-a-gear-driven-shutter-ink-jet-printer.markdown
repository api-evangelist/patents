applicable.","The present invention relates to the manufacture of ink jet print heads and, in particular, discloses a method of manufacture of a Gear Driven Shutter Ink Jet Printer.","Many ink jet printing mechanisms are known. Unfortunately, in mass production techniques, the production of ink jet heads is quite difficult. For example, often, the orifice or nozzle plate is constructed separately from the ink supply and ink ejection mechanism and bonded to the mechanism at a later stage (Hewlett-Packard Journal, Vol. 36 no 5, pp33-37 (1985)). These separate material processing steps required in handling such precision devices often add a substantial expense in manufacturing.","Additionally, side shooting ink jet technologies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,899,181) are often used but again, this limits the amount of mass production throughput given any particular capital investment.","Additionally, more esoteric techniques are also often utilised. These can include electroforming of nickel stage (Hewlett-Packard Journal, Vol. 36 no 5, pp33-37 (1985)), electro-discharge machining, laser ablation (U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,604), micro-punching, etc.","The utilisation of the above techniques is likely to add substantial expense to the mass production of ink jet print heads and therefore add substantially to their final cost.","It would therefore be desirable if an efficient system for the mass production of ink jet print heads could be developed.","It is an object of the present invention to provide an alternative form of ink jet printing which relies upon a gear driven shutter mechanism to block or allow the ejection of ink from a nozzle chamber.","In accordance with a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing a_print head wherein an array of nozzles are formed on a substrate utilising planar monolithic deposition, lithographic and etching processes. Preferably, multiple ink jet heads are formed simultaneously on a single planar substrate such as a silicon wafer.","The print heads can be formed utilising standard vlsi\/ulsi processing and can include integrated drive electronics formed on the same substrate. The drive electronics preferably being of a CMOS type. In the final construction, ink can be ejected from the substrate substantially normal","In the preferred embodiment, an ink jet nozzle chamber is provided having a shutter mechanism which open and closes over a nozzle chamber. The shutter mechanism includes a ratcheted drive which slides open and close. The ratcheted drive is driven by a gearing mechanism which in turn is driven by a drive actuator which is activated by passing an electric current through the drive actuator in a magnetic field. The actuator force is \u201cgeared down\u201d so as to drive a ratchet and pawl mechanism to thereby open and shut the shutter over a nozzle chamber.","Turning to , there is illustrated a single nozzle arrangement  as shown in an open position. The nozzle arrangement  includes a nozzle chamber  having an anisotropic <111> crystallographic etched pit which is etched down to what is originally a boron doped buried epitaxial layer  which includes a nozzle rim  and a nozzle ejection port  which ejects ink. The ink flows in through a fluid passage  when the aperture  is open. The ink flowing through passage  flows from an ink reservoir which operates under an oscillating ink pressure. When the shutter is open, ink is ejected from the ink ejection port . The shutter mechanism includes a plate  which is driven via means of guide slots ,  to a closed position. The driving of the nozzle plate is via a latch mechanism  with the plate structure being kept in a correct path by means of retainers  to .","The nozzle arrangement  can be constructed utilising a two level poly process which can be a standard micro-electro mechanical system production technique (MEMS). For a general introduction to a micro-electro mechanical system (MEMS) reference is made to standard proceedings in this field including the proceedings of the SPIE (International Society for Optical Engineering), volumes 2642 and 2882 which contain the proceedings for recent advances and conferences in this field. The plate  can be constructed from a first level polysilicon and the retainers  to  can be constructed from a lower first level poly portion and a second level poly portion, as it is more apparent from the exploded perspective view illustrated in FIG. .","The bottom circuit of plate  includes a number of pits  which are provided on the bottom surface of plate  so as to reduce stiction effects.","The ratchet mechanism  is driven by a gearing arrangement which includes first gear wheel , second gear wheel  and third gear wheel . These gear wheels  to  are constructed utilising two level poly which each gear wheel being constructed around a corresponding central pivot  to . The gears  to  operate to gear down the ratchet speed with the gears being driven by a gear actuator mechanism .","Turning to  there is illustrated an exploded perspective view of a single nozzle chamber . The actuator  comprises mainly a copper circuit having a drive end  which engages and drives the cogs  of the gear wheel . The copper portion includes serpentine sections ,  which concertina upon movement of the end . The end  is actuated by means of passing an electric current through the copper portions in the presence of a magnetic field perpendicular to the surface of the wafer such that the interaction of the magnetic field and circuit result in a Lorenz force acting on the actuator  so as to move the end  to drive the cogs . The copper portions are mounted on aluminum disks ,  which are connected to lower levels of circuitry on the wafer upon which actuator  is mounted.","Returning to , the actuator  can be driven at a high speed with the gear wheels  to  acting to gear down the high speed driving of actuator  so as to drive ratchet mechanism  open and closed on demand. Hence, when it is desired to eject a drop of ink from nozzle , the shutter is opened by means of driving actuator . Upon the next high pressure part of the oscillating pressure cycle, ink will be ejected from the nozzle . If no ink is to be ejected from a subsequent cycle, a second actuator  is utilised to drive the gear wheel in the opposite direction thereby resulting in the closing of the shutter plate  over the nozzle chamber  resulting in no ink being ejected in subsequent pressure cycles. The pits  act to reduce the forces required for driving the shutter plate  to an open and closed position.","Turning to , there is illustrated a top cross-sectional view illustrating the various layers making up a single nozzle chamber . The nozzle chambers can be formed as part of an array of nozzle chambers making up a single print head which in turn forms part of an array of print head fabricated on a semiconductor wafer in accordance with in accordance with the semiconductor wafer fabrication techniques well known to those skilled in the art of MEMS fabrication and construction.","The bottom boron layer  can be formed from the processing step of back etching a silicon wafer utilising a buried epitaxial boron doped layer as the etch stop. Further processing of the boron layer can be undertaken so as to define the nozzle hole  which can include a nozzle rim .","The next layer is a silicon glass layer  which normally sits on top of the boron doped layer . The silicon glass layer  includes an anisotropically etched pit  so as to define the structure of the nozzle chamber. On top of the silicon layer  is provided a glass layer  which includes the various electrical circuitry (not shown) for driving the actuators. The layer  is passivated by means of a nitride layer  which includes trenches  for passivating the side walls of glass layer .","On top of the passivation layer  is provided a first level polysilicon layer  which defines the shutter and various cog wheels. The second poly layer  includes the various retainer mechanisms and gear wheel . Next, a copper layer  is provided for defining the copper circuit actuator. The copper  is interconnected with lower portions of glass layer  for forming the circuit for driving the copper actuator.","The nozzle chamber  can be constructed utilising the standard MEMS processes including forming the various layers utilising the sacrificial material such as silicon dioxide and subsequently sacrificially etching the lower layers away.","Subsequently, wafers that contain a series of print heads can be diced into separate print heads and a print head mounted on a wall of an ink supply chamber having a piezoelectric oscillator actuator for the control of pressure in the ink supply chamber. Ink is then ejected on demand by opening the shutter plate  during periods of high oscillation pressure so as to eject ink. The nozzles being actuated by means of placing the print head in a strong magnetic field utilising permanent magnets or electro-magnetic devices and driving current through the actuators e.g. ,  as required to open and close the shutter and thereby eject drops of ink on demand.","One form of detailed manufacturing process which can be used to fabricate monolithic ink jet print heads operating in accordance with the principles taught by the present embodiment can proceed utilizing the following steps:\n\n","The presently disclosed ink jet printing technology is potentially suited to a wide range of printing systems including: color and monochrome office printers, short run digital printers, high speed digital printers, offset press supplemental printers, low cost scanning printers, high speed pagewidth printers, notebook computers with in-built pagewidth printers, portable color and monochrome printers, color and monochrome copiers, color and monochrome facsimile machines, combined printer, facsimile and copying machines, label printers, large format plotters, photograph copiers, printers for digital photographic \u2018minilabs\u2019, video printers, PhotoCD printers, portable printers for PDAs, wallpaper printers, indoor sign printers, billboard printers, fabric printers, camera printers and fault tolerant commercial printer arrays.","Ink Jet Technologies","The embodiments of the invention use an ink jet printer type device. Of course many different devices could be used. However presently popular ink jet printing technologies are unlikely to be suitable.","The most significant problem with thermal ink jet is power consumption. This is approximately 100 times that required for high speed, and stems from the energy-inefficient means of drop ejection. This involves the rapid boiling of water to produce a vapor bubble which expels the ink. Water has a very high heat capacity, and must be superheated in thermal ink jet applications. This leads to an efficiency of around 0.02%, from electricity input to drop momentum (and increased surface area) out.","The most significant problem with piezoelectric ink jet is size and cost. Piezoelectric crystals have a very small deflection at reasonable drive voltages, and therefore require a large area for each nozzle. Also, each piezoelectric actuator must be connected to its drive circuit on a separate substrate. This is not a significant problem at the current limit of around 300 nozzles per print head, but is a major impediment to the fabrication of pagewidth print heads with 19,200 nozzles.","Ideally, the ink jet technologies used meet the stringent requirements of in-camera digital color printing and other high quality, high speed, low cost printing applications. To meet the requirements of digital photography, new ink jet technologies have been created. The target features include:\n\n","All of these features can be met or exceeded by the ink jet systems described below with differing levels of difficulty. Forty-five different ink jet technologies have been developed by the Assignee to give a wide range of choices for high volume manufacture. These technologies form part of separate applications assigned to the present Assignee as set out in the table above under the heading Cross References to Related Applications.","The ink jet designs shown here are suitable for a wide range of digital printing systems, from battery powered one-time use digital cameras, through to desktop and network printers, and through to commercial printing systems","For ease of manufacture using standard process equipment, the print head is designed to be a monolithic 0.5 micron CMOS chip with MEMS post processing. For color photographic applications, the print head is 100 mm long, with a width which depends upon the ink jet type. The smallest print head designed is IJ38, which is 0.35 mm wide, giving a chip area of 35 square mm. The print heads each contain 19,200 nozzles plus data and control circuitry.","Ink is supplied to the back of the print head by injection molded plastic ink channels. The molding requires 50 micron features, which can be created using a lithographically micromachined insert in a standard injection molding tool. Ink flows through holes etched through the wafer to the nozzle chambers fabricated on the front surface of the wafer. The print head is connected to the camera circuitry by tape automated bonding.","Tables of Drop-on-Demand Ink Jets","Eleven important characteristics of the fundamental operation of individual ink jet nozzles have been identified. These characteristics are largely orthogonal, and so can be elucidated as an eleven dimensional matrix. Most of the eleven axes of this matrix include entries developed by the present assignee.","The following tables form the axes of an eleven dimensional table of ink jet types.\n\n","The complete eleven dimensional table represented by these axes contains 36.9 billion possible configurations of ink jet nozzle. While not all of the possible combinations result in a viable ink jet technology, many million configurations are viable. It is clearly impractical to elucidate all of the possible configurations. Instead, certain ink jet types have been investigated in detail. These are designated IJ01 to IJ45 which matches the docket numbers in the in the table under the heading Cross References to Related Applications.","Other ink jet configurations can readily be derived from these forty-five examples by substituting alternative configurations along one or more of the 11 axes. Most of the IJ01 to IJ45 examples can be made into ink jet print heads with characteristics superior to any currently available ink jet technology.","Where there are prior art examples known to the inventor, one or more of these examples are listed in the examples column of the tables below. The IJ01 to IJ45 series are also listed in the examples column. In some cases, a printer may be listed more than once in a table, where it shares characteristics with more than one entry.","Suitable applications for the ink jet technologies include: Home printers, Office network printers, Short run digital printers, Commercial print systems, Fabric printers, Pocket printers, Internet WWW printers, Video printers, Medical imaging, Wide format printers, Notebook PC printers, Fax machines, Industrial printing systems, Photocopiers, Photographic minilabs etc.","The information associated with the aforementioned 11 dimensional matrix are set out in the following tables.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-d0e5120","num":"00002"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"294pt","align":"center"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"ACTUATOR MECHANISM (APPLIED ONLY TO SELECTED INK DROPS)"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Description","Advantages","Disadvantages","Examples"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Thermal","An electrothermal","Large force","High power","Canon Bubblejet"]},{"entry":["bubble","heater heats the ink to","generated","Ink carrier limited","1979 Endo et al GB"]},{"entry":[{},"above boiling point,","Simple","to Water","patent 2,007,162"]},{"entry":[{},"transferring significant","construction","Low efficiency","Xerox heater-in-"]},{"entry":[{},"heat to the aqueous","No moving parts","High temperatures","pit 1990 Hawkins et"]},{"entry":[{},"ink.
