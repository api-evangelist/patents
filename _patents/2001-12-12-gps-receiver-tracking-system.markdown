Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to the field of Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers receiving transmission GPS signals from satellites and processing the GPS signals for obtaining information, and storing the information. The present invention particularly relates to a GPS receiver tracking system tracking a high dynamic vehicle in accordance with GPS data received from a translator placed on the high dynamic vehicle. The system is preferably implemented entirely using software.","2. Description of the Related Art","The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a satellite-based navigation system that continuously transmits timing, frequency and satellite position information to potential users. The GPS consists of a full constellation of four satellites in half geo-synchronous orbits. The GPS satellites continuously emit coded GPS signals The GPS signals can be received from at least four GPS satellites at any point on or near the Earth.","A GPS signal contains timing information that allows a user to determine the time elapsed for the GPS signal to transverse the distance between the GPS satellite and a receiver receiving the signal. By knowing the time the GPS signal left the GPS satellite, the time the GPS signal arrived at the user, and the speed of the GPS signal, the receiver can determine the distance from itself to the GPS satellite. The measured range is referred to as \u201cpseudorange\u201d because there is generally a time difference or offset between timing clocks on the satellites and the GPS receiver clock. Thus, for three dimensional position determinations, at least four satellite signals are needed to solve for four unknowns, i.e., the time offset and the three dimensional positions of the satellites. By knowing the orbital position of four GPS satellites (ephemeris data), and the distance from itself to each of four GPS satellites, the receiver can successfully triangulate its own position. Receiver position calculations performed using greater than four satellites generally have an improved accuracy.","The GPS signal emitted by the satellites contains an L-band carrier component (L1) transmitted at a frequency of 1575.42 MHz. The L1 carrier component is modulated by a coarse acquisition (C\/A) pseudorandom (PRN) code component unique to the satellite and a data component. The PRN code provides timing information for determining when the GPS signal was broadcast and identifying which satellite emitted the signal. The data component provides information defining the satellite ephemeris, satellite clock corrections and other GPS information. The carrier component allows a receiver to more easily acquire the GPS signal.","It is known in the art to use the Global Positioning System (GPS) for testing and evaluating purposes, such as for testing and evaluating the performance of moving vehicles. However, accurate development of test data for high dynamic vehicles has proved problematic, as well as for test data obtained from multipath GPS signals and GPS signals reflected from the ocean.","GPS receivers have been developed for testing of high dynamic vehicles. However, the receivers are limited for use with very high dynamic vehicles, such as missiles having a short time of flight and small dimensions. GPS receivers are generally too large to be fitted on a small missile, and the time needed for obtaining a first set of data may exceed the entire flight time.","Typically, use of GPS receivers for platforms such as small missiles has been replaced by the use of translators. A translator is a device capable of downlinking the complete GPS spectrum to ground recording equipment for post flight tracking and trajectory reconstruction. The translators have applications for high dynamic guidance, range safety and post-test trajectory analysis. However, translators currently available tend to be costly and highly proprietary, limiting the possibility of modifying the translator for special applications. Another drawback to available translators is the need for accessing a large bandwidth that is not always available at test ranges.","In one suggested solution, recorded data obtained from the translator and recorded data obtained by a ground receiver approximately simultaneously with the data obtained by the translator are processed by filtering and smoothing algorithms to produce a smooth trajectory. However, during the boost phase of the flight, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is very low.","Accordingly, there exists a need for a method and a system for processing recorded GPS data obtained form a translator mounted on a mobile dynamic vehicle and recorded data obtained approximately simultaneously with the data obtained by the translator by a ground receiver, in which the tracking results are accurate for all phases of movement of the vehicle, where the vehicle is a high dynamic vehicle.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and a system for processing recorded GPS data obtained from a translator and recorded data obtained approximately simultaneously with the data obtained by the translator by a ground receiver, in which the tracking results are accurate for all phases of the flight of a very high dynamic vehicle or for GPS signals reflected off the water.","It is a further object of the present invention to minimize processing time while maintaining accuracy when processing recorded data obtained from a translator and recorded data obtained approximately simultaneously with the data obtained by the translator by a ground receiver.","Yet a further object of the present invention to provide a GPS receiver which performs tracking and recovery of timing information using software instead of a combination of hardware and software.","In keeping with these and other objects of the present invention, a receiving station tracking system for receiving GPS data and tracking a mobile vehicle is provided. The receiving station tracking system includes at least one processing stage receiving and processing at least a portion of the GPS data, and a control module receiving and filtering the processed GPS data and outputting at least one control signal in accordance with filtering results. The at least one control signal controls decreasing or increasing a quantity of processing stages of the at least one processing stage.","In , a missile  equipped with a conventional translator  is shown in flight while being tracked using GPS. As is known in the art, during the flight of the missile , the translator  receives a GPS signal including an L1 carrier from at least four satellite vehicles (SVs) , where n=1-24, of 24 available SVs . The translator converts each received signal to an S band signal (approximately 2265.5 MHz), and transmits the S-band signal to a nearby ground receiving station . The receiving station  receives the S band signal, converts it back to a GPS signal and processes the GPS signal and records the processed GPS signal as translator GPS data.","During the flight of the missile , the receiving station  receives a GPS signal including an L1 carrier from at least four SVs () (the same set of SVs () due to the proximity of the missile  during flight and the receiving station ). The receiving station  and the translator  receive the GPS signals simultaneously or approximately simultaneously. The receiving station  processes and records the GPS signal as receiver station GPS data. The receiving station  performs processing on the recorded translator GPS data and the receiving station GPS data.","During the processing, described in further detail below, a series of Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) are repeatedly performed on a set of sampled translator GPS data for correlating the translator GPS data. After each repetition the results of the FFT processing and the degree of correlation are analyzed and used to reduce processing elements by reducing the set of sampled translator GPS data for the next repetition. Reduction of the number of processing elements allows the algorithm to run faster.","The object being tracked may be any vehicle located proximate the receiving station  and equipped with the translator . In the example provided in , the object being tracked is a missile , such as a Stinger, Hydra rocket or Tomahawk, having high dynamic flight qualities in which there is a high variation of velocity and acceleration values. During the boost stage of flight, the acceleration of the missile begins at nil, rapidly climbs to a high peak value, and continues to rapidly change. During the coast stage of flight the acceleration of the missile changes gradually. During the landing stage of flight the acceleration drops to nil.","Translators are known in the art. The translator  preferably multiplexes inputs from up to four dual frequency antennas, downconverts them to an intermediate frequency (IF) where they are filtered and combined with a pilot carrier. The signal is then upconverted to S-band and transmitted.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["22","22","18","210","22","214","18","214"],"i":["n","n"]},"The GPS DSF  downconverts the received receiving station and translator GPS signals each into a pair of in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) signals, samples the signals at approximately 23.333 MHz, formats them into 32-bit words, and passes them through a 32-bit high speed I\/O  to a PCI bus  as time ordered signal pairs I(t), Q(t), where t=i(\u0394t), and \u0394t=a time interval per input data sample. A computer , i.e. a computer capable of running a network operating system, such as Windows NT\u2122, controls the PCI bus  activity and routes the sampled data to a commercially available high-rate data recording system  having a software interface. The recording system  places the sampled data on a hard drive farm  in a proprietary format. The computer  may access the sampled data using the software interface of the recording system , format the sampled data into standard network operating system files, and store them on an array of removable SCSI peripheral hard drives  accessible to the computer  via a SCSI adapter .","The receiving station  further includes a tracking module  for processing the sampled data associated with the receiving station GPS data and the translator GPS data.

The tracking and Doppler aides are initial estimates specifying which satellite is in view, satellite orbit data and what carrier Doppler frequency is expected. The tracking and Doppler aides may be provided by user input, remote source input, or accessed from the aides data database . The aides data database  stores known information about the GPS signals transmitted by the SVs (). Once data, such as the navigation message and pseudorange values data, is extracted from the receiving station GPS sampled data, selected data such as navigation message bits, the absolute sample index for each C\/A code epoch, and time of week (TOW) are captured into a capture file to be provided as tracking aides for processing the high dynamic signal from the translator.","The translator data tracking module  processes the translator GPS data by accessing the capture file provided by the receiving station data tracking module  for obtaining pseudorange and Doppler data associated with the missile being tracked.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["322","322","322","410","414","418","422","426","430","434","438","410","450","454","458","462","466","470","314","314"],"sub":"i"},"M processing stages (), where s=1 to m are shown in  where a pair of translator GPS data input sample signals I,Q for a given time, tare processed relative to a PN code generated by the PN Code Generator  and a local carrier signal including periodic complex sinusoidal waves (I*(ti), Q*(ti)), for the time t, provided by the local carrier generator . The PN code is delayed by a different delay at each stage as it passes through delay modules . Each delay module  generates a delay d, where d is typically half a chip. In the example shown, at processing stage () the PN code is delayed by d=0. At the processing stage () the PN code is delayed by d=m\u22121. As described in further detail with reference to , each processing stage () includes the N-point FFT module  for performing Fast Fourier Transforms on the signals being processed and outputs N magnitude values, where N is the number of data points per FFT conversion performed by the N-point FFT module .","The capture file is used for control of the PN Code generator module . The capture file, or a portion thereof is accessed by the coordinate aides module . The coordinate aides module  receives a signal from the input control module  indicating which sample of the series of input GPS samples is currently being input, and coordinates the data in the capture file with the input translator GPS sampled data. The coordinate aides module  further recovers a C\/A Code epoch index from data in the capture file for setting the code position (timing) for processing by a reference processing stage (), such as the first processing stage (). The coordinate aides module  provides navigation message data, including polarity of the PN Code, to the PN Code generator module , and further provides a receiving station PN Code Epoch position, which is timing information encoded in data of the capture file, to the Peak Algorithm module  and to the filter and search module .","The local carrier generator  provides the local carrier signal (I*(ti), Q*(ti)) to the pair of multiplier modules , which downconverts the translator GPS signal to near baseband. The local carrier generator  includes is an oscillator, such as a number controlled oscillator (NCO). The NCO includes a phase accumulator to which a delta, which sets the oscillator frequency, is added for each input sample processed. The output of the phase accumulator is used to generate a complex sinusoid used as the local carrier signal. The rate of the NCO of the local carrier generator  is optionally controlled by a rate control signal provided by the filter and search module , or the rate of the local carrier may be fixed. Due to a Doppler effect when Fast Fourier Transform processing is performed within the processing stages , control of the rate of the local carrier generator  is typically not needed, but may be adjusted by the local carrier generator  when the filter and search module  determines that correlation of input translator data and receiving station GPS data is extremely poor.","The PN Code generator  generates a PN code having a pattern of bits, where the bits form a random number. The PN code generator  may include an oscillator such as a number-controlled oscillator (NCO). A predetermined PN code is associated with each satellite. The navigation message output by the coordinate aides module  controls the polarity of the PN Code Generator , effectively wiping off the navigation message from the receiver GPS signal, allowing the sum and dump module pair  to accumulate across message bit boundaries without degradation of performance. A phase and rate control signal generated by the filter and search module  controls the phase and rate of the NCO of the PN code generator . The phase and rate control signal provided by the filter and search module  controls the PN code by shifting the PN code and the rate of the code by controlling the rate at which the bits forming the PN code are transmitted via the NCO.","The filter and search module  uses the C\/A code to control setting the C\/A code position (timing) for the reference processing stage, i.e., first processing stage (). The filter and search module  further filters the N magnitude outputs of the M processing stages (), so that the filter and search module  filters a matrix of N*M values. The filter and search module  then searches the filtered values for a peak, processes the location of the peak and a Peak-to-Noise ratio, and determines if the results of the processing are satisfactory, i.e., if the correlation between the receiving station GPS data and the current translator GPS data input sample has been achieved.","If the filter and search module  determines that correlation has not yet been achieved, the filter and search module  then generates control signals based on the location of the peak found during the search with reference to the aides in the capture file of the receiving station, the Peak-to-Noise ratio, and the PN code epoch position signal received from the coordinate aides module . The control signals generated by the filter and search module  include at least one of the rate control signal to the local carrier generator module , the phase and rate control signal to the PN code generator module , a control signal to the stage controller module , and a control signal to the input control module . Upon determination of satisfactory processing results, the output of the processing stages  is provided to the peak interpolation module .","The filter and search module  effectively controls the size of the M*N matrix of values that it processes based on the results its search for a peak. The matrix may be enlarged by instructing the stage control module  to add selected processing stages (), or the matrix may be reduced for reducing processing steps. The processing stages () to be added or removed from the series of processing stages  are selected in order to position the expected peak towards the center of the matrix. Furthermore, the expected peak is seeked out by adjusting the phase and rate of the PN Code Generator , and the rate of the local carrier generator .","The stage controller module  receives the control signal from the filter and search module  with instructions to add or remove processing stages (). The instructions may include which processing stages () to add or remove. For example, the instructions may instruct the stage controller module  to add or remove only the processing stages () where \u201cs\u201d is a selected number of lowest possible values, highest possible values, evenly distributed among low and high values, or unevenly distributed values of \u201cs\u201d. Thus, the filter and search module  controls the number and distribution of processing stages () used during processing of each translator GPS data input sample. As processing of the translator GPS input data proceeds, the quality of peak detection typically improves, and the filter and search module  preferably instructs the stage controller module  to reduce the value of \u201cm\u201d, thus reducing the amount of processing, and therefore the processing time.","The input control module  receives the control signal from the filter and search module , accesses the translator station GPS input data samples and sequences to the next translator GPS data input sample I,Q for time t+\u0394t, where \u0394t is the time interval per input data sample, in accordance with the control signal. The local carrier generator  and the PN code generator  also advance to the next output sample based on the programmed rate. Thus, the filter and search module  controls when to proceed to the next translator GPS data input samples. Furthermore, as described above, the input control module  provides the coordinate aides module  with a signal indicating which sample of the series of input translator GPS data samples is currently being input to the processing stages ().","The peak interpolation module  is used to determine the peak value and Doppler value more precisely. The peak interpolation module  processes the receiving station PN Code Epoch position and the time of week aides together with the data output by the processing stages  and filtered by the filter and search module , and outputs the pseudorange and Doppler values for the current translator GPS data input sample being processed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["410","5"],"i":"p"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"280pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 5"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"FFT Acquisition of GPS Signals for Processing Stage 410(p)"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"231pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["I(t)","=","Received and downconverted in phase data samples"]},{"entry":["Q(t)","=","Received and downconverted quadrature data samples"]},{"entry":["t","=","I(\u0394t)"]},{"entry":["\u0394t","=","Time interval per input data sample"]},{"entry":["I*(t)","=","In phase output of the number -

High precision processing results are possible while minimizing processing steps and processing time. Additionally, since the processing involves mathematical computations, the entire GPS receiver tracking system can be implemented using only software. Furthermore, the ability to continually track while making adjustments in accordance with the control signals transmitted by the filter and search module  is useful for tracking in conditions such as multi-path GPS signals and reflected GPS signals.","What has been described herein is merely illustrative of the application of the principles of the present invention.
