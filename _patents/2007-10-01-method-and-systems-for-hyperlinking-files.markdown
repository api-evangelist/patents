title: Method and systems for hyperlinking files
abstract: A method and apparatus for hyperlinking a main file with N target files stored in a computer readable medium (Nâ‰§1). A primary filename of the main file, which is hyperlinked with N target file addresses to form a composite filename, has a form of F.E. The composite filename has a form of F(A).E, wherein F and E respectively represent a name component and an extension component of the primary filename. The N target files are denoted as T, T, . . . , Thaving the associated N target file addresses respectively denoted as A, A, . . . , A, wherein A represents A, A, . . . , A. The symbol ( between F and A denotes a first control character that separates F and A. The symbol ) between A and E denotes a second control character that separates A and E. The composite filename is stored in the computer readable medium.

No. 7,330,863 B2, issued Feb. 12, 2008.","The present invention relates to information storage and retrieval systems, and more particularly to a method and systems for creating hyperlinks from a file to source files, from which it has been copied, and\/or any other target files (source files and\/or other target files located on the same or different computer systems).","Generally, computer systems store data such as computer programs, text documents, graphics, pictures, audio, video, or other information and documents as files that may contain any combination of these kind of information. These files are typically maintained on a hard disk drive associated with a computer but may also be maintained in memory, on floppy drives, remote servers, or other types of mass storage media. To simplify their retrieval, files are generally dispatched among numerous directories or folders. Each directory or folder may have sub-directories or sub-folders. A computer system may contain hundreds of such directories or folders, and file servers, which may be a part of a computer system, may have thousands of such directories or folders. A user generally locates a file by using the file's filename, typically a short character string, e.g. \u201cmyphoto.gif\u201d, a disk drive designation and directory or folder may be prepended to the filename, e.g. \u201cC:\\photos\\myphoto.gif\u201d.","Different types of file systems are available for different operating systems. Each file system type has its own format and set of characteristics such as filename length, maximum file size and so on. For example, on Linux operating system, the most commonly used file system type is the Second Extended File system, also known as ext2fs. It allows filenames up to 256 characters. On Windows (registered trademark of Microsoft Corp.) the VFAT (Windows 95) and FAT32 (Windows 98) file system maximum length of filenames is 255 characters. NTFS and UNIX file system maximum length of filenames is 256 characters.","On the Internet, an addressing scheme is employed to identify resources e.g., HTTP servers, files or programs, and files or HTML documents to display. This addressing scheme is called Uniform Resource Locator (URL). An URL may contain the application protocol to use when accessing the server e.g., \u201chttp\u201d, the Internet domain name, also referred to as the server host name, of the site on which the server is running, the port number of the server (the port number may not be specified in the URL but is obtained by translating the server host name), and the location of the resource in the file structure of the server. For example, the URL",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"182pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"http:\/\/www.christusrex.org\/www2\/berry\/f6v.html"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}},"br":{}},"If the client request is for a file, the HTTP server locates the file and sends it to the client. Depending on the type of file retrieved, the client may activate an application to process the file. Upon reception of a file, the client browser typically examines the extension to determine how to process the file after receipt e.g., launching an application program to process the file. For example, if an HTML document is retrieved, a client's web browser may parse the HTML document and display it. Likewise, if a word processing document is retrieved, the client may activate a word processor to process the document. Alternatively, the accessed file may be saved locally (or downloaded) for a further use.","Most operating systems and file systems do not enable, once a file has been downloaded, to keep track of the relationship between a downloaded or copied file (children) and the source file (parent). For instance, when a file is copied from a network e.g., the Internet, from a server computer to a client computer, the relationship of the copy file on the client computer with the source file on the server computer is lost because the URL of the source file is not recorded with the copied file.","A serious risk associated to the exchange of electronic information on open and unsecured networks, particularly on the Internet, concerns the modification of data during the transfer. As a consequence, it is important to check files received over a network to verify that they have not been corrupted nor altered and\/or that they have not been sent by an impostor. It may also be important to keep track of the source files when documents are modified so as to recover the original ones e.g., to analyze modifications.","A file may also have descriptive and referential information i.e., file metadata, associated with it. This information may be relative to the source, content, generation date and place, ownership or copyright notice, central storage location, conditions to use, related documentation, applications associated with the file or services. However, most file systems do not enable to keep a persistent connection of a file with the associated metadata. When a file is transmitted from a computer system to another the connection of that file with associated metadata is frequently lost.","When a user receives a file through a network e.g., by clicking on the icon of a file attached to a received e-mail, he would need to get, apart from the attached file, metadata related with such file. For example, when a file is received from an Internet server, it may be necessary to verify that it has not been corrupted, altered in some manner or to verify that it has been received from the proper sender rather than by an impostor. Particularly, if the received file is a software program, it could be of the utmost importance to ensure that received file has been sent by a trustworthy party prior exposing the computer system to a program file that might include a \u201cTrojan Horse\u201d or that could infect the user's computer with a virus. To that aim, the user may require to access file metadata, particularly a digital certificate and digital signature, to verify the authenticity and integrity of the file before executing it.","Today there are different approaches for implementing the association of a file with metadata of that file. Basically, metadata of a file can be encoded onto the same filename of the file, they can be prepended or appended onto the file as part of a file wrapper structure, they can be embedded at a well-defined convenient point elsewhere within the file, or they can be created as an entirely separate file. Each approach has inherent advantages and disadvantages:\n\n","As a conclusion, there is a need for a method and systems for creating hyperlinks from a main file to target files, that could be either source or other associated files.","Thus, it is a broad object of the invention to remedy the shortcomings of the prior art as described here above.","It is another object of the invention to provide a method and systems to create hyperlinks from a main file to target files so that each target file may be accessed from the main file.","It is a further object of the invention to provide a method and a system to create an hyperlink from a main file to the source from which it has been retrieved.","It is still a further object of the invention to provide a method and systems to create hyperlinks from a main file to associated metadata.","The accomplishment of these and other related objects is achieved by a computer-like readable medium comprising a main file having a filename including a primary filename and at least one encoded target file address, the primary filename of said main file and said at least one encoded target file address being separated by a first control character and two consecutive encoded target addresses being separated by a second control character,","and by a method for hyperlinking at least one target file available at a target address to a main file having a primary filename, said method comprising the steps of:\n\n","Further advantages of the present invention will become apparent to the ones skilled in the art upon examination of the drawings and detailed description. It is intended that any additional advantages be incorporated herein.","According to the invention, the filename of a main file is used to encode the target addresses of one or several target files, using a particular lexicography. The used lexicography is determined so as to avoid particular characters that may be forbidden by the file system, e.g., \u201c\\\u201d with Microsoft Windows system, and\/or to encode the target addresses so as to reduce their sizes. The target addresses to be encoded may be of any forms e.g., local addresses, addresses in private networks or Internet addresses, however, for sake of illustration, the examples given in the following description are based on URL type of addresses.","In a first embodiment, a method for encoding the source file address from which a file is saved, is disclosed.

This kind of encoding optimisation will be discussed later.","In a second embodiment, the method for encoding the addresses of one or a plurality of associated target files is disclosed. As discussed above, a target file may consist for example, of a source file, metadata, computer programs, text documents, graphics, pictures, audio, video or other information. A target file may also provide services that may be accessed through e.g., an HTML file. In this embodiment, the method of the invention may be integrated as a module of most of software e.g., this module may be launched optionally when saving a main file, or implemented as an independent software.  shows the main steps of this embodiment. After getting the primary filename of the main file (box ) a test is performed to determine whether or not the user needs to associate target files (box ), if not the process ends. Else if the user needs to associate target files, a request is transmitted to the user to enter the address of the first target file to associate therewith (box ). To that end, the user may type the target address or determine it using a standard browsing function. Then, the address of the target file to associate is encoded (box \u2032) and merged with the primary filename using particular separators (box ). An algorithm similar to the one described by reference to may be used to encode the address of the target file to associate. A second test is performed to determine whether or not the user desires to associate more target files (box ). If there is no more target file to associate, the process ends. Else, the last four steps are repeated (boxes  to ). A control character is inserted between each encoded target addresses so that the encoded hyperlinked filename may be parsed and each target address may be retrieved. It must be noticed that the address of the source file of a copied or saved main file could be linked like any associated target files.","As an illustration, let us take again the previous example wherein the user wants now to associate, apart from the address of the source of the image, the address of a target file containing a textual description of the image. Thus, in this new example, the source file address and the address of the image description file must both be associated to the primary filename of the image.

After having selected a main file which filename contains a primary filename and encoded target addresses, and upon selection of a button or menu like \u201cview source file . . . \u201d or \u201cview associated files . . . \u201d, the filename is parsed using the same separators than those used during the encoding process (box ). Then, the number n of hyperlinks, i.e. the number of encoded target addresses, is determined (box ) and a variable i is set to zero (box ). The iencoded target address is selected (box ) and decoded using the lexicography table used for encoding this target address e.g., table , (box ). Using this decoded target address, the associated target file may be accessed (box ). As it is generally the case in Internet browser systems dealing with files, the accessed target file may be locally saved or a plug-in may be automatically launched to view the target file, depending upon selected options or software configuration. For example, if the accessed target file is an image, an image viewer or editor may be automatically launched. Preferably, the type of the target file is determined by analyzing the extension of the target address. Then variable i is incremented by one (box ) and a test is performed to determine whether or not all hyperlinks have been accessed (box ) i.e., if variable i has reached the number n of encoded target addresses, in which case the process ends.
