No. 09\/482,273, and U.S. Provisional Application Nos. 60\/092,921, 60\/092,922, and 60\/092,956 are all hereby incorporated by reference.","The present invention relates to novel proteins. More specifically, isolated nucleic acid molecules are provided encoding novel polypeptides. Novel polypeptides and antibodies that bind to these polypeptides are provided. Also provided are vectors, host cells, and recombinant and synthetic methods for producing human polynucleotides and\/or polypeptides, and antibodies. The invention further relates to diagnostic and therapeutic methods useful for diagnosing, treating, preventing and\/or prognosing disorders related to these novel polypeptides. The invention further relates to screening methods for identifying agonists and antagonists of polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention. The present invention further relates to methods and\/or compositions for inhibiting or enhancing the production and function of the polypeptides of the present invention.","Unlike bacterium, which exist as a single compartment surrounded by a membrane, human cells and other eukaryotes are subdivided by membranes into many functionally distinct compartments. Each membrane-bounded compartment, or organelle, contains different proteins essential for the function of the organelle. The cell uses \u201csorting signals,\u201d which are amino acid motifs located within the protein, to target proteins to particular cellular organelles.","One type of sorting signal, called a signal sequence, a signal peptide, or a leader sequence, directs a class of proteins to an organelle called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The ER separates the membrane-bounded proteins from all other types of proteins. Once localized to the ER, both groups of proteins can be further directed to another organelle called the Golgi apparatus. Here, the Golgi distributes the proteins to vesicles, including secretory vesicles, the cell membrane, lysosomes, and the other organelles.","Proteins targeted to the ER by a signal sequence can be released into the extracellular space as a secreted protein. For example, vesicles containing secreted proteins can fuse with the cell membrane and release their contents into the extracellular space\u2014a process called exocytosis. Exocytosis can occur constitutively or after receipt of a triggering signal. In the latter case, the proteins are stored in secretory vesicles (or secretory granules) until exocytosis is triggered. Similarly, proteins residing on the cell membrane can also be secreted into the extracellular space by proteolytic cleavage of a \u201clinker\u201d holding the protein to the membrane.","Thus there exists a clear need for identifying and using novel secreted polynucleotides and polypeptides. Identification and sequencing of human genes is a major goal of modern scientific research. For example, by identifying genes and determining their sequences, scientists have been able to make large quantities of valuable human \u201cgene products.\u201d These include human insulin, interferon, Factor VIII, tumor necrosis factor, human growth hormone, tissue plasminogen activator, and numerous other compounds. Additionally, knowledge of gene sequences can provide the key to treatment or cure of genetic diseases (such as muscular dystrophy and cystic fibrosis).","The present invention relates to novel secreted proteins. More specifically, isolated nucleic acid molecules are provided encoding novel secreted polypeptides. Novel polypeptides and antibodies that bind to these polypeptides are provided. Also provided are vectors, host cells, and recombinant and synthetic methods for producing human polynucleotides and\/or polypeptides, and antibodies. The invention further relates to diagnostic and therapeutic methods useful for diagnosing, treating, preventing and\/or prognosing disorders related to these novel polypeptides. The invention further relates to screening methods for identifying agonists and antagonists of polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention. The present invention further relates to methods and\/or compositions for inhibiting or enhancing the production and function of the polypeptides of the present invention.","Polynucleotides and Polypeptides","Description of Table 1A","Table 1A summarizes information concerning certain polypnucleotides and polypeptides of the invention. The first column provides the gene number in the application for each clone identifier. The second column provides a unique clone identifier, \u201cClone ID NO:Z\u201d, for a cDNA clone related to each contig sequence disclosed in Table 1A. Third column, the cDNA Clones identified in the second column were deposited as indicated in the third column (i.e. by ATCC\u2122 Deposit Number and deposit date). Some of the deposits contain multiple different clones corresponding to the same gene. In the fourth column, \u201cVector\u201d refers to the type of vector contained in the corresponding cDNA Clone identified in the second column. In the fifth column, the nucleotide sequence identified as \u201cNT SEQ ID NO:X\u201d was assembled from partially homologous (\u201coverlapping\u201d) sequences obtained from the corresponding cDNA clone identified in the second column and, in some cases, from additional related cDNA clones. The overlapping sequences were assembled into a single contiguous sequence of high redundancy (usually three to five overlapping sequences at each nucleotide position), resulting in a final sequence identified as SEQ ID NO:X. In the sixth column, \u201cTotal NT Seq.\u201d refers to the total number of nucleotides in the contig sequence identified as SEQ ID NO:X.\u201d The deposited clone may contain all or most of these sequences, reflected by the nucleotide position indicated as \u201c5\u2032 NT of Clone Seq.\u201d (seventh column) and the \u201c3\u2032 NT of Clone Seq.\u201d (eighth column) of SEQ ID NO:X. In the ninth column, the nucleotide position of SEQ ID NO:X of the putative start codon (methionine) is identified as \u201c5\u2032 NT of Start Codon.\u201d Similarly, in column ten, the nucleotide position of SEQ ID NO:X of the predicted signal sequence is identified as \u201c5\u2032 NT of First AA of Signal Pep.\u201d In the eleventh column, the translated amino acid sequence, beginning with the methionine, is identified as \u201cAA SEQ ID NO:Y,\u201d although other reading frames can also be routinely translated using known molecular biology techniques. The polypeptides produced by these alternative open reading frames are specifically contemplated by the present invention.","In the twelfth and thirteenth columns of Table 1A, the first and last amino acid position of SEQ ID NO:Y of the predicted signal peptide is identified as \u201cFirst AA of Sig Pep\u201d and \u201cLast AA of Sig Pep.\u201d In the fourteenth column, the predicted first amino acid position of SEQ ID NO:Y of the secreted portion is identified as \u201cPredicted First AA of Secreted Portion\u201d. The amino acid position of SEQ ID NO:Y of the last amino acid encoded by the open reading frame is identified in the fifteenth column as \u201cLast AA of ORF\u201d.","SEQ ID NO:X (where X may be any of the polynucleotide sequences disclosed in the sequence listing) and the translated SEQ ID NO:Y (where Y may be any of the polypeptide sequences disclosed in the sequence listing) are sufficiently accurate and otherwise suitable for a variety of uses well known in the art and described further below. For instance, SEQ ID NO:X is useful for designing nucleic acid hybridization probes that will detect nucleic acid sequences contained in SEQ ID NO:X or the cDNA contained in the deposited clone. These probes will also hybridize to nucleic acid molecules in biological samples, thereby enabling a variety of forensic and diagnostic methods of the invention. Similarly, polypeptides identified from SEQ ID NO:Y may be used, for example, to generate antibodies which bind specifically to proteins containing the polypeptides and the secreted proteins encoded by the cDNA clones identified in Table 1A and\/or elsewhere herein.","Nevertheless, DNA sequences generated by sequencing reactions can contain sequencing errors. The errors exist as misidentified nucleotides, or as insertions or deletions of nucleotides in the generated DNA sequence. The erroneously inserted or deleted nucleotides cause frame shifts in the reading frames of the predicted amino acid sequence. In these cases, the predicted amino acid sequence diverges from the actual amino acid sequence, even though the generated DNA sequence may be greater than 99.9% identical to the actual DNA sequence (for example, one base insertion or deletion in an open reading frame of over 1000 bases).","Accordingly, for those applications requiring precision in the nucleotide sequence or the amino acid sequence, the present invention provides not only the generated nucleotide sequence identified as SEQ ID NO:X, and the predicted translated amino acid sequence identified as SEQ ID NO:Y, but also a sample of plasmid DNA containing a human cDNA of the invention deposited with the ATCC\u2122, as set forth in Table 1A. The nucleotide sequence of each deposited plasmid can readily be determined by sequencing the deposited plasmid in accordance with known methods.","The predicted amino acid sequence can then be verified from such deposits. Moreover, the amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by a particular plasmid can also be directly determined by peptide sequencing or by expressing the protein in a suitable host cell containing the deposited human cDNA, collecting the protein, and determining its sequence.","Also provided in Table 1A is the name of the vector which contains the cDNA plasmid. Each vector is routinely used in the art. The following additional information is provided for convenience.","Vectors LAMBDA ZAP\u2122 (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,128,256 and 5,286,636), UNI-ZAP\u2122 XR (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,128,256 and 5,286,636), ZAP EXPRESS\u2122 (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,128,256 and 5,286,636), pBLUESCRIPT\u2122 (pBS) (Short, J.

M., 16:9677\u20139686 (1988) and Mead, D. et al., 9: (1991).","The present invention also relates to the genes corresponding to SEQ ID NO:X, SEQ ID NO:Y, and\/or a deposited cDNA (cDNA Clone ID). The corresponding gene can be isolated in accordance with known methods using the sequence information disclosed herein. Such methods include, but are not limited to, preparing probes or primers from the disclosed sequence and identifying or amplifying the corresponding gene from appropriate sources of genomic material.","Also provided in the present invention are allelic variants, orthologs, and\/or species homologs.

For example, allelic variants and\/or species homologs may be isolated and identified by making suitable probes or primers from the sequences provided herein and screening a suitable nucleic acid source for allelic variants and\/or the desired homologue.","The present invention provides a polynucleotide comprising, or alternatively consisting of, the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:X and\/or a cDNA contained in ATCC\u2122 Deposit No.Z. The present invention also provides a polypeptide comprising, or alternatively, consisting of, the polypeptide sequence of SEQ ID NO:Y, a polypeptide encoded by SEQ ID NO:X, and\/or a polypeptide encoded by a cDNA contained in ATCC\u2122 deposit No.Z. Polynucleotides encoding a polypeptide comprising, or alternatively consisting of the polypeptide sequence of SEQ ID NO:Y, a polypeptide encoded by SEQ ID NO:X and\/or a polypeptide encoded by the cDNA contained in ATCC\u2122 Deposit No.Z, are also encompassed by the invention. The present invention further encompasses a polynucleotide comprising, or alternatively consisting of the complement of the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:X, and\/or the complement of the coding strand of the cDNA contained in ATCC\u2122 Deposit No.Z.","Description of Table 1B","Table 1B summarizes some of the polynucleotides encompassed by the invention (including cDNA clones related to the sequences (Clone ID NO:Z), contig sequences (contig identifier (Contig ID:) and contig nucleotide sequence identifier (SEQ ID NO:X)) and further summarizes certain characteristics of these polynucleotides and the polypeptides encoded thereby. The first column provides the gene number in the application for each clone identifier. The second column provides a unique clone identifier, \u201cClone ID NO:Z\u201d, for a cDNA clone related to each contig sequence disclosed in Table 1A and\/or 1B. The third column provides a unique contig identifier, \u201cContig ID:\u201d for each of the contig sequences disclosed in Table 1B. The fourth column provides the sequence identifier, \u201cSEQ ID NO:X\u201d, for each of the contig sequences disclosed in Table 1A and\/or 1B. The fifth column, \u201cORF (From-To)\u201d, provides the location (i.e., nucleotide position numbers) within the polynucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:X that delineate the preferred open reading frame (ORF) that encodes the amino acid sequence shown in the sequence listing and referenced in Table 1B as SEQ ID NO:Y (column 6). Column 7 lists residues comprising predicted epitopes contained in the polypeptides encoded by each of the preferred ORFs (SEQ ID NO:Y). Identification of potential immunogenic regions was performed according to the method of Jameson and Wolf (CABIOS, 4; 181\u2013186 (1988)); specifically, the Genetics Computer Group (GCG) implementation of this algorithm, embodied in the program PEPTIDESTRUCTURE (Wisconsin Package v10.0, Genetics Computer Group (GCG), Madison, Wisc.). This method returns a measure of the probability that a given residue is found on the surface of the protein. Regions where the antigenic index score is greater than 0.9 over at least 6 amino acids are indicated in Table 1B as \u201cPredicted Epitopes\u201d. In particular embodiments, polypeptides of the invention comprise, or alternatively consist of, one, two, three, four, five or more of the predicted epitopes described in Table 1B. It will be appreciated that depending on the analytical criteria used to predict antigenic determinants, the exact address of the determinant may vary slightly. Column 8, \u201cTissue Distribution\u201d shows the expression profile of tissue, cells, and\/or cell line libraries which express the polynucleotides of the invention. The first number in column 8 (preceding the colon), represents the tissue\/cell source identifier code corresponding to the key provided in Table 4. Expression of these polynucleotides was not observed in the other tissues and\/or cell libraries tested. For those identifier codes in which the first two letters are not \u201cAR\u201d, the second number in column 8 (following the colon), represents the number of times a sequence corresponding to the reference polynucleotide sequence (e.g., SEQ ID NO:X) was identified in the tissue\/cell source. Those tissue\/cell source identifier codes in which the first two letters are \u201cAR\u201d designate information generated using DNA array technology. Utilizing this technology, cDNAs were amplified by PCR and then transferred, in duplicate, onto the array. Gene expression was assayed through hybridization of first strand cDNA probes to the DNA array. cDNA probes were generated from total RNA extracted from a variety of different tissues and cell lines. Probe synthesis was performed in the presence of P dCTP, using oligo(dT) to prime reverse transcription. After hybridization, high stringency washing conditions were employed to remove non-specific hybrids from the array. The remaining signal, emanating from each gene target, was measured using a Phosphorimager. Gene expression was reported as Phosphor Stimulating Luminescence (PSL) which reflects the level of phosphor signal generated from the probe hybridized to each of the gene targets represented on the array. A local background signal subtraction was performed before the total signal generated from each array was used to normalize gene expression between the different hybridizations. The value presented after \u201c[array code]:\u201d represents the mean of the duplicate values, following background subtraction and probe normalization. One of skill in the art could routinely use this information to identify normal and\/or diseased tissue(s) which show a predominant expression pattern of the corresponding polynucleotide of the invention or to identify polynucleotides which show predominant and\/or specific tissue and\/or cell expression. Column 9 provides the chromosomal location of polynucleotides corresponding to SEQ ID NO:X. Chromosomal location was determined by finding exact matches to EST and cDNA sequences contained in the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) UniGene database. Given a presumptive chromosomal location, disease locus association was determined by comparison with the Morbid Map, derived from Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, OMIM\u2122. McKusick-Nathans Institute for Genetic Medicine, Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, Md.) and National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Library of Medicine (Bethesda, Md.) 2000. World Wide Web URL: http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/omimi\/). If the putative chromosomal location of the Query overlaps with the chromosomal location of a Morbid Map entry, an OMIM identification number is disclosed in column 10 labeled \u201cOMIM Disease Reference(s)\u201d. A key to the OMIM reference identification numbers is provided in Table 5.","Description of Table 1C","Table 1C summarizes additional polynucleotides encompassed by the invention (including cDNA clones related to the sequences (Clone ID NO:Z), contig sequences (contig identifier (Contig ID:) contig nucleotide sequence identifiers (SEQ ID NO:X)), and genomic sequences (SEQ ID NO:B). The first column provides a unique clone identifier, \u201cClone ID NO:Z\u201d, for a cDNA clone related to each contig sequence. The second column provides the sequence identifier, \u201cSEQ ID NO:X\u201d, for each contig sequence. The third column provides a unique contig identifier, \u201cContig ID:\u201d for each contig sequence. The fourth column, provides a BAC identifier \u201cBAC ID NO:A\u201d for the BAC clone referenced in the corresponding row of the table. The fifth column provides the nucleotide sequence identifier, \u201cSEQ ID NO:B\u201d for a fragment of the BAC clone identified in column four of the corresponding row of the table.

Fluorometric microvolume assay technology (FMAT) is a fluorescence-based system which provides a means to perform nonradioactive cell- and bead-based assays to detect activation of cell signal transduction pathways. This technology was designed specifically for ligand binding and immunological assays. Using this technology, fluorescent cells or beads at the bottom of the well are detected as localized areas of concentrated fluorescence using a data processing system. Unbound flurophore comprising the background signal is ignored, allowing for a wide variety of homogeneous assays. FMAT technology may be used for peptide ligand binding assays, immunofluorescence, apoptosis, cytotoxicity, and bead-based immunocapture assays. See, Miraglia S et. al., \u201cHomogeneous cell and bead based assays for highthroughput screening using flourometric microvolume assay technology,\u201d Journal of Biomolecular Screening; 4:193\u2013204 (1999). In particular, FMAT technology may be used to test, confirm, and\/or identify the ability of polypeptides (including polypeptide fragments and variants) to activate signal transduction pathways. For example, FMAT technology may be used to test, confirm, and\/or identify the ability of polypeptides to upregulate production of immunomodulatory proteins (such as, for example, interleukins, GM-CSF, Rantes, and Tumor Necrosis factors, as well as other cellular regulators (e.g. insulin)).","Table 1E also describes the use of kinase assays for testing, demonstrating, or quantifying biological activity. In this regard, the phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation of specific amino acid residues (e.g. Tyrosine, Serine, Threonine) on cell-signal transduction proteins provides a fast, reversible means for activation and de-activation of cellular signal transduction pathways. Moreover, cell signal transduction via phosphorylation\/de-phosphorylation is crucial to the regulation of a wide variety of cellular processes (e.g. proliferation, differentiation, migration, apoptosis, etc.). Accordingly, kinase assays provide a powerful tool useful for testing, confirming, and\/or identifying polypeptides (including polypeptide fragments and variants) that mediate cell signal transduction events via protein phosphorylation. See e.g., Forrer, P., Tamaskovic R., and Jaussi, R. \u201cEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay for Measurement of JNK, ERK, and p38 Kinase Activities\u201d Biol.

For example, an isolated polynucleotide could be part of a vector or a composition of matter, or could be contained within a cell, and still be \u201cisolated\u201d because that vector, composition of matter, or particular cell is not the original environment of the polynucleotide. The term \u201cisolated\u201d does not refer to genomic or cDNA libraries, whole cell total or mRNA preparations, genomic DNA preparations (including those separated by electrophoresis and transferred onto blots), sheared whole cell genomic DNA preparations or other compositions where the art demonstrates no distinguishing features of the polynucleotide\/sequences of the present invention.","In the present invention, a \u201csecreted\u201d protein refers to those proteins capable of being directed to the ER, secretory vesicles, or the extracellular space as a result of a signal sequence, as well as those proteins released into the extracellular space without necessarily containing a signal sequence. If the secreted protein is released into the extracellular space, the secreted protein can undergo extracellular processing to produce a \u201cmature\u201d protein. Release into the extracellular space can occur by many mechanisms, including exocytosis and proteolytic cleavage.","As used herein, a \u201cpolynucleotide\u201d refers to a molecule having a nucleic acid sequence contained in SEQ ID NO:X (as described in column 5 of Table 1A), or cDNA clone (as described in column 2 of Table 1A and contained within a pool of plasmids deposited with the ATCC\u2122 in ATCC\u2122 Deposit No:Z).

The ATCC\u2122 deposit was made pursuant to the terms of the Budapest Treaty on the international recognition of the deposit of microorganisms for purposes of patent procedure.","A \u201cpolynucleotide\u201d of the present invention also includes those polynucleotides capable of hybridizing, under stringent hybridization conditions, to sequences contained in SEQ ID NO:X, or the complement thereof (e.g., the complement of any one, two, three, four, or more of the polynucleotide fragments described herein) and\/or sequences of the cDNA contained in the deposited clone (e.g., the complement of any one, two, three, four, or more of the polynucleotide fragments described herein). \u201cStringent hybridization conditions\u201d refers to an overnight incubation at 42 degree C. in a solution comprising 50% formamide, 5\u00d7SSC (750 mM NaCl, 75 mM trisodium citrate), 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.6), 5\u00d7 Denhardt's solution, 10% dextran sulfate, and 20 \u03bcg\/ml denatured, sheared salmon sperm DNA, followed by washing the filters in 0.1\u00d7SSC at about 65 degree C.","Also included within \u201cpolynucleotides\u201d of the present invention are nucleic acid molecules that hybridize to the polynucleotides of the present invention at lower stringency hybridization conditions. Changes in the stringency of hybridization and signal detection are primarily accomplished through the manipulation of formamide concentration (lower percentages of formamide result in lowered stringency); salt conditions, or temperature. For example, lower stringency conditions include an overnight incubation at 37 degree C. in a solution comprising 6\u00d7SSPE (20\u00d7SSPE=3M NaCl; 0.2M NaHPO; 0.02M EDTA, pH 7.4), 0.5% SDS, 30% formamide, 100 \u03bcg\/ml salmon sperm blocking DNA; followed by washes at 50 degree C. with 1\u00d7SSPE, 0.1% SDS. In addition, to achieve even lower stringency, washes performed following stringent hybridization can be done at higher salt concentrations (e.g. 5\u00d7SSC).","Note that variations in the above conditions may be accomplished through the inclusion and\/or substitution of alternate blocking reagents used to suppress background in hybridization experiments. Typical blocking reagents include Denhardt's reagent, BLOTTO, heparin, denatured salmon sperm DNA, and commercially available proprietary formulations. The inclusion of specific blocking reagents may require modification of the hybridization conditions described above, due to problems with compatibility.","Of course, a polynucleotide which hybridizes only to polyA+ sequences (such as any 3\u2032 terminal polyA+ tract of a cDNA shown in the sequence listing), or to a complementary stretch of T (or U) residues, would not be included in the definition of \u201cpolynucleotide,\u201d since such a polynucleotide would hybridize to any nucleic acid molecule containing a poly (A) stretch or the complement thereof (e.g., practically any double-stranded cDNA clone generated using oligo dT as a primer).","The polynucleotides of the present invention can be composed of any polyribonucleotide or polydeoxribonucleotide, which may be unmodified RNA or DNA or modified RNA or DNA. For example, polynucleotides can be composed of single- and double-stranded DNA, DNA that is a mixture of single- and double-stranded regions, single- and double-stranded RNA, and RNA that is mixture of single- and double-stranded regions, hybrid molecules comprising DNA and RNA that may be single-stranded or, more typically, double-stranded or a mixture of single- and double-stranded regions. In addition, the polynucleotide can be composed of triple-stranded regions comprising RNA or DNA or both RNA and DNA. A polynucleotide may also contain one or more modified bases or DNA or RNA backbones modified for stability or for other reasons. \u201cModified\u201d bases include, for example, tritylated bases and unusual bases such as inosine.

Such modifications are well described in basic texts and in more detailed monographs, as well as in a voluminous research literature. Modifications can occur anywhere in a polypeptide, including the peptide backbone, the amino acid side-chains and the amino or carboxyl termini. It will be appreciated that the same type of modification may be present in the same or varying degrees at several sites in a given polypeptide. Also, a given polypeptide may contain many types of modifications. Polypeptides may be branched, for example, as a result of ubiquitination, and they may be cyclic, with or without branching. Cyclic, branched, and branched cyclic polypeptides may result from posttranslation natural processes or may be made by synthetic methods. Modifications include acetylation, acylation, ADP-ribosylation, amidation, covalent attachment of flavin, covalent attachment of a heme moiety, covalent attachment of a nucleotide or nucleotide derivative, covalent attachment of a lipid or lipid derivative, covalent attachment of phosphotidylinositol, cross-linking, cyclization, disulfide bond formation, demethylation, formation of covalent cross-links, formation of cysteine, formation of pyroglutamate, formylation, gamma-carboxylation, glycosylation, GPI anchor formation, hydroxylation, iodination, methylation, myristoylation, oxidation, pegylation, proteolytic processing, phosphorylation, prenylation, racemization, selenoylation, sulfation, transfer-RNA mediated addition of amino acids to proteins such as arginylation, and ubiquitination.

Many snake venoms contain phospolipase A2, which prevents transmission of nerve impulses to muscles by blocking the release of acetylcholine from the neuron. Therefore, included in this invention as preferred domains are Phospholipase A2 histidine active site domains, which were identified using the ProSite analysis tool (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics). Phospholipase A2 is an enzyme which releases fatty acids from the second carbon group of glycerol.

Polypeptides encoded by these polynucleotides are also encompassed by the invention. Moreover, fragments and variants of these polypeptides (such as, for example, fragments as described herein, polypeptides at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to these polypeptides and polypeptides encoded by the polynucleotide which hybridizes, under stringent conditions, to the polynucleotide encoding these polypeptides, or the complement there of are encompassed by the invention. Antibodies that bind polypeptides of the invention are also encompassed by the invention. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention.","Also as mentioned above, even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the C-terminus of a protein results in modification of loss of one or more biological functions of the protein (e.g., ability to induce IFN gamma production), other functional activities (e.g., biological activities, ability to multimerize, ability to bind ligand, ability to generate antibodies, ability to bind antibodies) may still be retained. For example the ability of the shortened polypeptide to induce and\/or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature forms of the polypeptide generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature polypeptide are removed from the C-terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking C-terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that a polypeptide with a large number of deleted C-terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities. In fact, peptides composed of as few as six amino acid residues may often evoke an immune response.","Accordingly, the present invention further provides polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the carboxy terminus of the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide shown in  (SEQ ID NO:128), as described by the general formula 1\u2212n, where n is an integer from 6 to 611, where n corresponds to the position of the amino acid residue identified in SEQ ID NO:128.

Antibodies that bind polypeptides of the invention are also encompassed by the invention. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention.","As described herein or otherwise known in the art, the polynucleotides of the invention have uses that include, but are not limited to, serving as probes or primers in chromosome identification, chromosome mapping, and linkage analysis.","Polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention are useful as reagents for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s) present in a biological sample and for diagnosis of diseases and conditions which include, but are not limited to, brain disorders and diseases of developing systems and cancers. Similarly, polypeptides and antibodies directed to these polypeptides are useful in providing immunological probes for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s). For a number of disorders of the above tissues or cells, particularly of the central nervous system and fetal systems, expression of this gene at significantly higher or lower levels may be routinely detected in certain tissues or cell types (e.g., neural, developing, cancerous and wounded tissues) or bodily fluids (e.g., lymph, serum, plasma, urine, synovial fluid and spinal fluid) or another tissue or cell sample taken from an individual having such a disorder, relative to the standard gene expression level, i.e., the expression level in healthy tissue or bodily fluid from an individual not having the disorder.","When tested against U937 cell lines, supernatants removed from cells containing this gene activated the GAS (gamma activating sequence) promoter element. Thus, it is likely that this gene activates myeloid cells, and to a lesser extent, other immune and hematopoietic cells and tissue cell types, through the JAK-STAT signal transduction pathway. GAS is a promoter element found upstream of many genes which are involved in the Jak-STAT pathway. The Jak-STAT pathway is a large, signal transduction pathway involved in the differentiation and proliferation of cells. Therefore, activation of the Jak-STAT pathway, reflected by the binding of the GAS element, can be used to indicate proteins involved in the proliferation and differentiation of cells.","Interferons (IFNs) are a well known family of cytokines secreted by a large variety of eukaryotic cells upon exposure to various mitogens. The interferons have been classified by their chemical and biological characteristics into three groups: IFN-alpha (leukocytes), IFN-beta (fibroblasts), and IFN-gamma (lymphocytes). IFN-alpha and beta are known as Type I interferons; IFN-gamma is known as Type II or immune interferon. The IFNs exhibit anti-viral, immunoregulatory, and antiproliferative activity. The clinical potential of interferons is widely recognized.","IFNg plays a central role in the immune system and is considered to be a proinflammatory cytokine. IFNg promotes TH1 and inhibits TH2 differentiation; promotes IgG2a and inhibits IgE secretion; induces macrophage activation; and increases MHC expression. Assays for immunomodulatory proteins produced by T cells and NK cells that regulate a variety of inflammatory activities and inhibit TH2 helper cell functions are well known in the art and may be used or routinely modified to assess the ability of polypeptides of the invention (including antibodies and agonists or antagonists of the invention) to mediate immunomodulation, regulate inflammatory activities, modulate TH2 helper cell function, and\/or mediate humoral or cell-mediated immunity. Exemplary assays that test for immunomodulatory proteins evaluate the production of cytokines, such as Interferon gamma (IFNg), and the activation of T cells. Such assays that may be used or routinely modified to test immunomodulatory activity of polypeptides of the invention (including antibodies and agonists or antagonists of the invention) include the assays disclosed in Miraglia et al., J Biomolecular Screening 4:193\u2013204 (1999); Rowland et al., \u201cLymphocytes: a practical approach\u201d Chapter 6:138\u2013160 (2000); Gonzalez et al., J Clin Lab Anal 8(5):225\u2013233 (1995); Billiau et al., Ann NY Acad Sci 856:22\u201332 (1998); Boehm et al., Annu Rev Immunol 15:749\u2013795 (1997), and Rheumatology (Oxford) 38(3):214\u201320 (1999), the contents of each of which are herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Human T cells that may be used according to these assays may be isolated using techniques disclosed herein or otherwise known in the art. Human T cells are primary human lymphocytes that mature in the thymus and express a T Cell receptor and CD3, CD4, or CD8. These cells mediate humoral or cell-mediated immunity and may be preactivated to enhance responsiveness to immunomodulatory factors.","Polypeptides of the invention were found to induce secretion of IFN\u03b3 when added to PBLs in the presence of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 (See assay, Example 33). In addition, polypeptides of the invention fused to the Fc domain of IgG1 were found to induce secretion of IFN\u03b3, GM-CSF, TNFalpha, and IL-10 from activated human and murine T-cells and human PBLs. Moreover, polypeptides of the invention fused to the Fc domain of IgG1 induces IFN\u03b3 secretion from mouse spleenocytes. Therefore, it is likely that polynucleotides or polypeptides of the invention and\/or agonists and\/or antagonists thereof would be useful for the diagnosis and treatment of a variety of immune system disorders. Representative uses are described in the \u201cImmune Activity\u201d and \u201cInfectious Disease\u201d sections below, in Example 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20, and 27, and elsewhere herein. Briefly, the expression indicates a role in regulating the proliferation; survival; differentiation; and\/or activation of hematopoietic cell lineages, including blood stem cells. Involvement in the regulation of cytokine production, antigen presentation, or other processes suggests a usefulness for treatment of cancer (e.g. by boosting immune responses). Expression in cells of lymphoid origin, indicates the natural gene product would be involved in immune functions. Therefore it would also be useful as an agent for immunological disorders including arthritis, asthma, immunodeficiency diseases such as AIDS, leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatous disease, inflammatory bowel disease, sepsis, acne, neutropenia, neutrophilia, psoriasis, hypersensitivities, such as T-cell mediated cytotoxicity; immune reactions to transplanted organs and tissues, such as host-versus-graft and graft-versus-host diseases, or autoimmunity disorders, such as autoimmune infertility, lense tissue injury, demyelination, systemic lupus erythematosis, drug induced hemolytic anemia, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's disease, and scleroderma. Moreover, the protein may represent a secreted factor that influences the differentiation or behavior of other blood cells, or that recruits hematopoietic cells to sites of injury. Thus, this gene product is thought to be useful in the expansion of stem cells and committed progenitors of various blood lineages, and in the differentiation and\/or proliferation of various cell types.","Polynucleotides or polypeptides of the invention and\/or agonists and\/or antagonists thereof, are used to treat, prevent, and\/or diagnose diseases and disorders of the pulmonary system (e.g., bronchi such as, for example, sinopulmonary and bronchial infections) and conditions associated with such diseases and disorders and other respiratory diseases and disorders.

In addition, the translation product of this gene shares sequence homology with Tetraspan protein (see, for example, Genbank accession number: GI 3152703). Therefore, it is likely that the polypeptide of this gene shares some biological functions, such as cell-to-cell signaling, adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation with Tetraspan.","The polypeptide of this gene has been determined to have two transmembrane domains at about amino acid position 52\u201368 and 197\u2013213 of the amino acid sequence referenced in Table 1A for this gene. Based upon these characteristics, it is believed that the protein product of this gene shares structural features to type IIIa membrane proteins.","The transmembrane 4 superfamily (TM4SF) or tetraspan superfamily has at least 16 members (including CD9, CD20, CD37, CD53, CD63, CD81, CD82, A15, CO-029, Sm23, RDS, Uro B, Uro A, SAS, Rom-1, PETA3, and YKK8), is the second biggest subfamily among CD antigen superfamily, and activation antigen of T-cells. All TM4SF member contains four putative transmembrane domains, two extracellular loops, and two short cytoplasmic tails. They are variously expressed on Immature, early, mature, activated lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, granulocytes, platelets, eosinophils, basophils, certain leukemic and lymphoma cells, and a variety of other cells and tissues. CD9 cell surface protein is expressed by both hematopoietic and neural cells, and may play a role for CD9 in intercellular signaling in the immune and nervous system. CD63 is a 53-Kd lysosomal membrane glycoprotein that has been identified as a platelet activation molecule, which play important role in cell adhesion of platelets and endothelial cells. Increased mRNA for CD63 antigen was found in atherosclerotic lesions of Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits, suggesting a potential role of CD63 in progression of atherosclerosis. CD63 is also a mast cell marker. CD82 was originally identified as the target of several mAbs inhibitory to syncytium formation induced by human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I), the etiological agent of adult T-cell leukemia. Therefore, this gene could be a target for the development of a drug for this leukemia. CD81 is the target of an antiproliferative antibody. A diverse group of human cell lines, including hematolymphoid, neuroectodermal, and mesenchymal cells, express the CD81 protein. Many of the lymphoid cell lines, in particular those derived from large cell lymphomas, were susceptible to the antiproliferative effects of the antibody. CD81 may therefore play an important role in the regulation of lymphoma cell growth. CD9, CD20, CD37, CD63, CD81 and CD82 have been implicated in the regulation of cell growth, adhesion, and signal transduction of B, T lymphocytes and some other non-lymphoid cells. They associate with CD2, CD21, CD4, CD8, MHC Class II molecules, integrins, function as co-receptor for T, B and other lymphoid cells. Some TM4SF are leukocyte antigens, highly expressed in activated leukocytes, lymphocytes, are highly specific surface marker for lymphoblastic leukemia, lymphoma, melanoma, and neuroblastoma. CD9 has been show to be involved in cell motility and tumor metastasis. These antigens could be a valuable immunogen or target to implement active and passive immunotherapy in patients with cancer. Others have been shown to be involved in inhibition of prostate cancer metastasis. This gene has close homology to C33 antigen (CD82), whic is a member of the transmembrane 4 superfamily (TMSF) and activation antigen of T-cells. C33 Ag (CD82 was originally identified as the target of several mAbs inhibitory to syncytium formation induced by human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I), the etiological agent of adult T-cell leukemia. Therefore, this gene could be very important target for developing drug for leukemia. Other members of this family are Sm23, CO-029, R2, TAPA-1, CD9, CD37, CD53, and CD63. CD63 is a 53-Kd lysosomal membrane glycoprotein that has been identified as a platelet activation molecule. There are strong evidence indicating that CD63 and Pltgp40, a platelet membrane glycoprotein are the same molecule and that CD63\/Pltgp40 is identical to the well-characterized, stage-specific melanoma-associated antigen ME491. These antigen could be valuable immunogens or target to implement active and passive immunotherapy in patients with cancer.","This gene is expressed primarily in fetal tissue (kidney, heart, liver, spleen, brain), macrophages, dendritic cells, retina and to a lesser extent in various other tissues, mostly of lymphoid origin or epithelial cell types.

Briefly, the expression of this gene product indicates a role in regulating the proliferation; survival; differentiation; and\/or activation of hematopoietic cell lineages, including blood stem cells. This gene product is involved in the regulation of cytokine production, antigen presentation, or other processes suggesting a usefulness in the treatment of cancer (e.g. by boosting immune responses). Since the gene is expressed in cells of lymphoid origin, the natural gene product is involved in immune functions. Therefore it is also useful as an agent for immunological disorders including arthritis, asthma, immunodeficiency diseases such as AIDS, leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatous disease, inflammatory bowel disease, sepsis, acne, neutropenia, neutrophilia, psoriasis, hypersensitivities, such as T-cell mediated cytotoxicity; immune reactions to transplanted organs and tissues, such as host-versus-graft and graft-versus-host diseases, or autoimmunity disorders, such as autoimmune infertility, lense tissue injury, demyelination, systemic lupus erythematosis, drug induced hemolytic anemia, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's disease, and scleroderma. Moreover, the protein may represent a secreted factor that influences the differentiation or behavior of other blood cells, or that recruits hematopoietic cells to sites of injury. Thus, this gene product is thought to be useful in the expansion of stem cells and committed progenitors of various blood lineages, and in the differentiation and\/or proliferation of various cell types.","Moreover, the expression within embryonic tissue and other cellular sources marked by proliferating cells indicates this protein may play a role in the regulation of cellular division, and may show utility in the diagnosis, treatment, and\/or prevention of developmental diseases and disorders, including cancer, and other proliferative conditions. Representative uses are described in the \u201cHyperproliferative Disorders\u201d and \u201cRegeneration\u201d sections below and elsewhere herein. Briefly, developmental tissues rely on decisions involving cell differentiation and\/or apoptosis in pattern formation. Dysregulation of apoptosis can result in inappropriate suppression of cell death, as occurs in the development of some cancers, or in failure to control the extent of cell death, as is believed to occur in acquired immunodeficiency and certain neurodegenerative disorders, such as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Because of potential roles in proliferation and differentiation, this gene product may have applications in the adult for tissue regeneration and the treatment of cancers. It may also act as a morphogen to control cell and tissue type specification. Therefore, the polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention are useful in treating, detecting, and\/or preventing said disorders and conditions, in addition to other types of degenerative conditions. Thus this protein may modulate apoptosis or tissue differentiation and would be useful in the detection, treatment, and\/or prevention of degenerative or proliferative conditions and diseases. The protein is useful in modulating the immune response to aberrant polypeptides, as may exist in proliferating and cancerous cells and tissues. The protein can also be used to gain new insight into the regulation of cellular growth and proliferation. Furthermore, the protein may also be used to determine biological activity, to raise antibodies, as tissue markers, to isolate cognate ligands or receptors, to identify agents that modulate their interactions, in addition to its use as a nutritional supplement. Protein, as well as, antibodies directed against the protein may show utility as a tumor marker and\/or immunotherapy targets for the above listed tissues.","Features of Protein Encoded by Gene No: 32","The translation product of this gene shares limited sequence homology with VEGF which is thought to be important in regulation of endothelial cell growth. Therefore, it is likely that the protein encoded by this gene would share some similar biological functions. When tested against U937 Myeloid cell lines, supernatants removed from cells containing this gene activated the GAS assay. Thus, it is likely that this gene activates myeloid cells, and to a lesser extent, other immune and hematopoietic cells and tissue cell types, through the Jak-STAT signal transduction pathway. The gamma activating sequence (GAS) is a promoter element found upstream of many genes which are involved in the Jak-STAT pathway. The Jak-STAT pathway is a large, signal transduction pathway involved in the differentiation and proliferation of cells. Therefore, activation of the Jak-STAT pathway, reflected by the binding of the GAS element, can be used to indicate proteins involved in the proliferation and differentiation of cells.","This gene is expressed in brain.","Polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention are useful as reagents for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s) present in a biological sample and for diagnosis of diseases and conditions which include, but are not limited to, nervous system disease and\/or disorders.

By a fragment of an isolated DNA molecule having the nucleotide sequence of the deposited cDNA or the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:69 is intended DNA fragments at least about 15 nt, and more preferably at least about 20 nt, still more preferably at least about 30 nt, and even more preferably, at least about 40 nt in length which are useful as diagnostic probes and primers as discussed herein. Of course, larger fragments 50\u20131500 nt in length are also useful according to the present invention, as are fragments corresponding to most, if not all, of the nucleotide sequence of the deposited cDNA or as shown in SEQ ID NO:69.

In additional embodiments, the polynucleotides of the invention encode functional attributes of the corresponding protein.","Preferred polypeptide fragments include the secreted protein as well as the mature form. Further preferred polypeptide fragments include the secreted protein or the mature form having a continuous series of deleted residues from the amino or the carboxy terminus, or both. For example, any number of amino acids, ranging from 1\u201360, can be deleted from the amino terminus of either the secreted polypeptide or the mature form. Similarly, any number of amino acids, ranging from 1\u201330, can be deleted from the carboxy terminus of the secreted protein or mature form. Furthermore, any combination of the above amino and carboxy terminus deletions are preferred. Similarly, polynucleotides encoding these polypeptide fragments are also preferred.","Preferably, the polynucleotide fragments of the invention encode a polypeptide which demonstrates a functional activity. By a polypeptide demonstrating a \u201cfunctional activity\u201d is meant to be a polypeptide capable of displaying one or more known functional activities associated with a full-length (complete) or mature-form of the protein. Such functional activities include, but are not limited to, biological activity (e.g., ability to regulate (e.g., stimulate) hematopoiesis in vitro or in vivo), antigenicity, and immunogenicity. The functional activity of polypeptides of the invention, and fragments, variants derivatives, and analogs thereof, can be assayed by various methods described herein.","In addition, assays described herein and otherwise known in the art may routinely be applied to measure biological activity of polypeptides and fragments of the invention, variants derivatives and analogs thereof (e.g., to regulate (e.g., to stimulate or inhibit) hematopoiesis in vitro or in vivo). For example, techniques known in the art (such as for example assaying for thymidine incorporation), may be applied or routinely modified to assay for the ability of the compositions of the invention to inhibit proliferation of hematopoietic cells. Other methods will be known to the skilled artisan and are within the scope of the invention.","Even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the N-terminus of a protein results in modification of loss of one or more biological functions of the protein, other functional activities (e.g., biological activities, ability to multimerize, etc.) may still be retained. For example, the ability of shortened muteins to induce and\/or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature forms of the polypeptides generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature polypeptide are removed from the N-terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking N-terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that a mutein with a large number of deleted N-terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities. In fact, peptides composed of as few as six amino acid residues may often evoke an immune response.","Accordingly, the present invention further provides polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the amino terminus of the amino acid sequence shown in  (i.e., SEQ ID NO:69), up to the Glu residue at position number 185 and polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides.","Particularly, N-terminal deletions of the polypeptide can be described by the general formula m\u2212190, where m is an integer from 2 to 184, where m corresponds to the position of the amino acid residue identified in SEQ ID NO:162.

Similarly, polypeptides and antibodies directed to these polypeptides are useful in providing immunological probes for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s). For a number of disorders of the above tissues or cells, particularly of the immune system and hematopoeitic system, expression of this gene at significantly higher or lower levels may be routinely detected in certain tissues or cell types (e.g., immune, hematopoietic, and cancerous and wounded tissues) or bodily fluids (e.g., lymph, serum, plasma, urine, synovial fluid and spinal fluid) or another tissue or cell sample taken from an individual having such a disorder, relative to the standard gene expression level, i.e., the expression level in healthy tissue or bodily fluid from an individual not having the disorder.","This gene has been found to stimulate the proliferation of bone marrow CD34+ cells. This assay which is described in Example 53 herein is based on the ability of human CD34+ to proliferate in presence of hematopoietic growth factors and evaluates the ability of the polypeptides of the invention, and agonists and antagonists thereof, to stimulate or inhibit this proliferation.","The tissue distribution in immune and hematopoietic cells and tissues and the ability to stimulate the proliferation of bone marrow CD34+ cells indicates that polynucleotides and polypeptides corresponding to this gene are useful for the diagnosis and treatment of disorders affecting the immune system and hematopoiesis.

Briefly, the expression of this gene product indicates a role in regulating the proliferation; survival; differentiation; and\/or activation of hematopoietic cell lineages, including blood stem cells. Moreover, the protein represents a secreted factor that influences the differentiation or behavior of other blood cells, or that recruits hematopoietic cells to sites of injury. Thus, this gene product is thought to be useful in the expansion of stem cells and committed progenitors of various blood lineages, and in the differentiation and\/or proliferation of various cell types.","The polynucleotides and\/or polypeptides of the invention and\/or agonists and\/or antagonists thereof, can also be employed to inhibit the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells and therefore may be employed to protect bone marrow stem cells from chemotherapeutic agents during chemotherapy. This antiproliferative effect may allow administration of higher doses of chemotherapeutic agents and, therefore, more effective chemotherapeutic treatment.","The polynucleotides and\/or polypeptides of the invention and\/or agonists and\/or antagonists thereof, may also be employed for the expansion of immature hematopoietic progenitor cells, for example, granulocytes, macrophages or monocytes, by temporarily preventing their differentiation. These bone marrow cells may be cultured in vitro. Thus, polynucleotides and\/or polypeptides of the invention, or agonists or antagonists thereof, may be useful as a modulator of hematopoietic stem cells in vitro for the purpose of bone marrow transplantation and\/or gene therapy. Since stem cells are rare and are most useful for introducing genes into for gene therapy, polynucleotides and\/or polypeptides of the invention can be used to isolate enriched populations of stem cells. Stem cells can be enriched by culturing cells in the presence of cytotoxins, such as 5-Fu, which kills rapidly dividing cells, where as the stem cells will be protected by polynucleotides and\/or polypeptides of the invention. These stem cells can be returned to a bone marrow transplant patient or can then be used for transfection of the desired gene for gene therapy. In addition, this gene can be injected into animals which results in the release of stem cells from the bone marrow of the animal into the peripheral blood. These stem cells can be isolated for the purpose of autologous bone marrow transplantation or manipulation for gene therapy. After the patient has finished chemotherapy or radiation treatment, the isolated stem cells can be returned to the patient.","Polynucleotides and polypeptides corresponding to this gene are useful for the treatment and diagnosis of hematopoietic related disorders such as anemia, pancytopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia or leukemia since stromal cells are important in the production of cells of hematopoietic lineages. The uses include bone marrow cell ex-vivo culture, bone marrow transplantation, bone marrow reconstitution, radiotherapy or chemotherapy of neoplasia.","This gene product may also be involved in the regulation of cytokine production, antigen presentation, or other processes suggesting a usefulness in the treatment of cancer (e.g. by boosting immune responses).

Also contemplated is the use of the corresponding nucleic acid in gene therapy procedures. Based upon the proteins immune cell specific message distribution, it may be involved in many aspects of the immune response, especially its initial stages, inflammation, allograft rejection, infectious disease response etc. It is frequently found in the hematopoietic cell cDNA libraries. Thus, this factor could be involved in the control of hematopoietic cell proliferation, differentiation, and function. Based on this one can postulate its use in the management of anemias, leukemias, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, autoimmune diseases, blood tissue engraftment, and poikilothromerythromatosis. Furthermore, the protein may also be used to determine biological activity, raise antibodies, as tissue markers, to isolate cognate ligands or receptors, to identify agents that modulate their interactions, in addition to its use as a nutritional supplement.

In the first class to be characterized, called C2H2, the first pair of zinc coordinating residues are cysteines, while the second pair are histidines. A number of experimental reports have demonstrated the zinc-dependent DNA or RNA binding property of some members of this class. Some of the proteins known to include C2H2-type zinc fingers are listed below.

In addition to the conserved zinc ligand residues it has been shown that a number of other positions are also important for the structural integrity of the C2H2 zinc fingers. The best conserved position is found four residues after the second cysteine; it is generally an aromatic or aliphatic residue.

Moreover, a cytoplasmic tail encompassing amino acids 252 to 319 of this protein has also been determined. Based upon these characteristics, it is believed that the protein product of this gene shares structural features to type Ia membrane proteins.","This gene is expressed primarily in hematopoietic cells, particularly in dendritic cells, and activated monocytes and to a lesser extent in T-cells, endothelial cells, and cells associated with ulcerative colitis.","Polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention are useful as reagents for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s) present in a biological sample and for diagnosis of diseases and conditions which include, but are not limited to, leukemias, lymphomas, and diseases associated with antigen presenting cells, in addition to apoptosis dependant events. Similarly, polypeptides and antibodies directed to these polypeptides are useful in providing immunological probes for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s). For a number of disorders of the above tissues or cells, particularly of the immune system, expression of this gene at significantly higher or lower levels may be routinely detected in certain tissues or cell types (e.g., immune, hematopoietic, and cancerous and wounded tissues) or bodily fluids (e.g., lymph, serum, plasma, urine, synovial fluid and spinal fluid) or another tissue or cell sample taken from an individual having such a disorder, relative to the standard gene expression level, i.e., the expression level in healthy tissue or bodily fluid from an individual not having the disorder.","Preferred polypeptides of the present invention comprise, or alternatively consist of, one or more of the immunogenic epitopes shown in SEQ ID NO: 174 as residues: Gln-22 to Gln-44, Ala-90 to Gly-95, Lys-137 to Trp-146, Arg-171 to Asp-181, Glu-370 to Ser-380, Asp-447 to Gly-452, Gln-463 to Trp-469, Asn-504 to Ala-510, Asp-512 to His-519, Ala-541 to Val-550, Asn-558 to His-566. Polynucleotides encoding said polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention. Antibodies that bind said epitopes or other polypeptides of the invention are also encompassed.","The tissue distribution immune and hematopoietic cells and tissues, combined with the homology to the murine  gene indicates that polynucleotides and polypeptides corresponding to this gene are useful as a therapeutic and\/or diagnostic agent for hematopoietic diseases, especially those associated with antigen presenting cells. Representative uses are described in the \u201cImmune Activity\u201d and \u201cInfectious Disease\u201d sections below, in Example 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20, and 27, and elsewhere herein. Briefly, the expression of this gene product indicates a role in regulating the proliferation; survival; differentiation; and\/or activation of hematopoietic cell lineages, including blood stem cells. This gene product is involved in the regulation of cytokine production, antigen presentation, or other processes suggesting a usefulness in the treatment of cancer (e.g. by boosting immune responses). Since the gene is expressed in cells of lymphoid origin, the natural gene product is involved in immune functions. Therefore it is also useful as an agent for immunological disorders including arthritis, asthma, immunodeficiency diseases such as AIDS, leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatous disease, inflammatory bowel disease, sepsis, acne, neutropenia, neutrophilia, psoriasis, hypersensitivities, such as T-cell mediated cytotoxicity; immune reactions to transplanted organs and tissues, such as host-versus-graft and graft-versus-host diseases, or autoimmunity disorders, such as autoimmune infertility, lense tissue injury, demyelination, systemic lupus erythematosis, drug induced hemolytic anemia, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's disease, and scleroderma. Moreover, the protein may represent a secreted factor that influences the differentiation or behavior of other blood cells, or that recruits hematopoietic cells to sites of injury. Thus, this gene product is thought to be useful in the expansion of stem cells and committed progenitors of various blood lineages, and in the differentiation and\/or proliferation of various cell types. Furthermore, the protein may also be used to determine biological activity, raise antibodies, as tissue markers, to isolate cognate ligands or receptors, to identify agents that modulate their interactions, in addition to its use as a nutritional supplement. Protein, as well as, antibodies directed against the protein may show utility as a tumor marker and\/or immunotherapy targets for the above listed tissues.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0580","num":"0579"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"15"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"10","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"11","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"12","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"13","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"14","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"15","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE
