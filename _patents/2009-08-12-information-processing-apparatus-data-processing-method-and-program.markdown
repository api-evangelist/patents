title: Information processing apparatus, data processing method and program
abstract: A configuration is achieved in which content copying between media and content downloading are performed effectively and under strict management. In content copying between media, the identification information (medium ID) of a copying destination medium is obtained using an API for providing a predefined processing, then the obtained medium ID is transmitted to a server to obtain copying permission information from the server, and then content copying is performed under the management of the server. This configuration allows a copying destination medium to be managed, which can eliminate the unauthorized use of the content. Also, the configuration in which content downloading from the server is performed according to, for example, a JavaÂ® program allows a ROM disc on which the content is recorded to store the program and to be provided to a user.

More particularly, the present invention relates to an information processing apparatus, a data processing method and a program for performing content recording and copying to a recording medium.","A DVD (Digital Versatile Disc), a Blu-ray Disc\u00ae and the like are commonly used as a medium for recording various contents including music, movie and the like. These information recording media include a ROM-type medium on which data is already recorded and additional data cannot be written; and an R-type, RE-type and the like on which data can be written. A data-writable information recording medium enables a content recorded on another medium to be copied or moved. Also, the data-writable information recording medium enables a content to be downloaded for recording, for example, from a network or using an apparatus installed in a public place.","The content recording media also include a hard disk and a flash memory as well as the above-described DVD and Blu-ray Disc\u00ae.","The aspects of the process for recording a content on a recording medium may include the following, for example:","(a) copying or moving from a medium (e.g., ROM disc) on which a content is already recorded to another medium;","(b) downloading a content from a server for recording; and","(c) recording a content using a terminal installed in a store or public place.","For example, the above processes may be envisaged.","However, many of contents such as music data and image data are under copyrights, distribution rights or the like owned by their authors or distributors. Therefore, when a content is provided to a user, a certain limitation is generally imposed on the use of the content such that the user may use the content only when the user is given an authorized right to use the content, and unauthorized duplication and the like are not allowed.","For example, one known standard for content usage control is AACS (Advanced Access Content System). According to AACS standard, performing content copying between media mentioned in (a) above requires obtaining copying permission information from a management server. Thus, the copying is permitted only under predetermined management. This copying processing is referred to as Managed Copy (MC).","The content providing scheme mentioned in (b) above\u2014content providing by downloading\u2014is referred to as EST (Electric Sell Through). The content providing by a shared terminal mentioned in (c) above is referred to as MoD (Manufacturing on Demand). According to AACS standard, these processings also need to be performed according to a predetermined rule.","The overview of the following three processings is described with reference to :","(a) Managed Copy (MC),","(b) EST (Electric Sell Through) and","(c) MoD (Manufacturing on Demand).","(a) Managed Copy (MC)","Managed Copy (MC) is a processing in which, for example, as shown in (a) of , a user  sets an information recording medium (disc)  on which a content is already recorded in an information processing apparatus  for data recording\/reproducing, then the content read from the information recording medium (disc)  is copied to a second information recording medium  such as an R\/RE-type data-writable disc, hard disk and flash memory.","In order to perform this content copying, the data recording\/reproducing apparatus  needs to connect with a management server  via a network  to obtain content copying permission from the management server .","Although  shows a configuration in which one information processing apparatus, a single apparatus, performs content copying between media, another configuration may be used in which one apparatus for loading a medium as copying source and another apparatus for loading a medium as copying destination are connected by, for example, a USB cable.","(b) EST (Electric Sell Through)","The processing of downloading a content from a server and recording the content to an information recording medium is referred to as EST (Electric Sell Through). EST is a processing in which, as shown in (b) of , a user  sets a medium, for example, R- or RE-type disc  (data-writable medium) owned by the user  in an information processing apparatus  of a PC or the like owned by the user , then a content is received from a content server (EST server)  via a network  and recorded.","(c) MoD (Manufacturing on Demand).","The content providing by a shared terminal is referred to as MoD (Manufacturing on Demand). As shown in (c) of , in Mod, a user  uses a content server  as a terminal installed in, for example, a convenience store or a public place such as station to purchase a content by recording the content to a medium. More specifically, Mod is a processing in which a data-writable medium owned by the user , for example, R- or RE-type disc  is set in the content server (Mod server)  as the terminal installed in a convenience store , and a desired content is recorded to the disc  through an operation, such as content selection, by the user .","These processings (a) to (c) are described in, for example, Patent Document 1 (JP-A-2008-98765).","In this way, the user can record a content to a data-recordable medium and use (for example, reproduce) the recorded content. However, when the content is, for example, a copyright-protected content or the like, usage control needs to be performed in order to prevent illegal use.","As described above, one known standard for content copyright protection technology is AACS (Advanced Access Content System). AACS standard configures usage control in which a usage control information (Usage Rule) defined for each content and a content is used according to the usage control information (Usage Rule). Furthermore, AACS standard provides strict usage control in which a content is configured to be an encrypted content by dividing the content into units, defining a unit key for each unit, and allowing only a specified user to obtain the unit keys.","When a disc on which a content is recorded is a medium allowing only reproducing and not allowing recording of new data, such as ROM-type disc, additional recording of a new content or editing will not be performed on the medium. Thus, the content-specific usage control information (Usage Rule) for each content recorded on the medium and the unit keys can be recorded together to the medium and provided to the user.","On the other hand, when a content is recorded on a medium such as R- or RE-type data-writable disc, hard disk and flash memory, the content recorded on the medium is not fixed, and updating such as recording of a new content or deleting of a recorded content can be performed. So, usage control information and unit keys also need to be updated according to the update of the content stored in the medium.","Thus, when recording a content to a medium, the user needs to perform complicated operations such as recording various ancillary data for each recorded content as well as recording the content. So, for example, in performing Managed Copy (MC) described above, a program in which a series of processing sequences is defined in advance is generally used to perform copying.","For example, many of information processing apparatuses conforming to AACS standard store a program (a player application) for performing Managed Copy (MC) described above. When using such an AACS-certified apparatus to perform Managed Copy (MC), the user runs the player application stored in the apparatus. When the program is run, a series of processings, including connecting with a management server and obtaining copying permission information from the management server, is performed, then copying is performed with the copying permission information obtained.","Even when a content recorded on a Blu-ray Disc\u00ae is copied to another medium, Managed Copy (MC) is performed using the player application stored in the AACS-certified apparatus.","For a method for starting this player application, the followings are permitted by AACS:","(a) starting the player application from a menu presented on the UI of the apparatus, and","(b) starting BD-J (Blu-ray Disc Java\u00ae) application, which is a Java\u00ae application program stored on a disc on which a content is recorded, then starting the player application through a BD-J application.","AACS stipulates the use of one of (a) and (b) above.","The player application is a program stored in an apparatus that performs content reproducing\/recording and designed to be commonly used for various contents. On the other hand, the BD-J application can be recorded on a disc and can also be configured specific to each content recorded on the disc. In other words, the BD-J application is a program that a content author can design according to the content recorded on the disc.","Thus, the BD-J application is a program that can be designed with some freedom by the content author and can be variously configured according to various configuration of the content. So, if the BD-J application is configured to perform Managed Copy (MC), the content author can also design the BD-J application to perform processing unique to each content according to the content configuration or the like.","However, in Managed Copy (MC), when the copying destination medium of a content is, for example, a freely portable medium such as R\/RE-type data-writable disc, inadequate management of the copying destination medium may allow unauthorized use of the content.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":"Patent Document 1: JP-A-2008-98765"}},"In view of the above (for example), it is an object of the present invention to provide an information processing apparatus, a data processing method and a program in which, in performing content copying between media managed by a server, a copying destination medium for a content can be reliably managed to protect the content from unauthorized use.","For example, it is an object of the present invention to provide an information processing apparatus, a data processing method and a program in which the identification information (medium ID) of a copying destination medium, e.g., an R\/RE-type disc, is obtained using an API (Application Programming Interface) for providing a predefined processing, then the medium ID is transmitted to a server to obtain copying permission information from the server, and then content copying is performed under the management of the server.","It is another object of the present invention to provide an information processing apparatus, a data processing method and a program in which content downloading from a server is performed according to a program defining processing sequences, for example, a Java\u00ae program.","A first aspect of the present invention provides","an information processing apparatus, including a data processor for reading data from a medium and communicating with a server,","wherein the data processor performs:","medium ID reading processing of reading the medium ID of a second medium to which a content recorded on a first medium is to be copied;","medium ID transmitting processing of transmitting the medium ID to the server;

With this copying permission information obtained, content copying is performed. This configuration allows a copying destination medium to be managed, which can eliminate the unauthorized use of the content. Also, content downloading from the server is performed according to, for example, a Java\u00ae program. This configuration allows a ROM disc on which the content is recorded to store the program and to be provided to a user.","An information processing apparatus, a data processing method and a program in accordance with the invention is described in detail below with reference to the drawings.","First, a processing example of Managed Copy (MC) performed by the information processing apparatus in accordance with the invention is described with reference to . As described above, Managed Copy (MC) is a processing of copying a content to another medium with copying permission information obtained from a management server.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0104","num":"0103"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["110","120","110","150","150","140"]},"The disc  is, for example, a ROM disc such as Blu-ray Disc\u00ae.","The data-recordable, second recording medium  as content copying destination is, for example, a recording medium such as hard disk, R\/RE disc and flash memory.","The information processing apparatus  includes, for example, a PC, a recording\/reproducing device and the like, and can read data from the disc  and record the read data to the second information recording medium .","As shown in , the following data are recorded on the disc :","a BD-J application  that is a Java\u00ae application program;","a copying management file (MCMF) ;","management data ; and","an encrypted content .","The BD-J application  is a program to be executed by the information processing apparatus  when content copying (Managed Copy (MC)) is performed, and, for example, a program for performing processing such as communicating with the management server . Note that the BD-J application  may be configured as a single application program or may be configured as a combination of two or more BD-J applications each performing a specific processing.","For example, they are a BD-J application for communicating with the server, a BD-J application dedicated to billing and the like. When performing content copying, these BD-J applications are executed by the information processing apparatus .","The copying management file (MCMF)  is a file to be used when content copying is performed, and, for example, a data file written in XML including the following information:","(a) a content ID that is an identifier (ID) for uniquely identifying the content recorded on the information recording medium (disc );","(b) a URI (URL) that is information for connecting with the management server for providing copying permission, generating a token by binding or performing another processing when content copying is performed (for example, information for accessing the management server ); and","(c) a directory name\/file name that is information on names of a directory and a file storing data for permitting copying.","The management data  is, for example, management data defined by AACS (Advanced Access Content System) that is a standards management system for content copyright protection technology, and data including: a CPS unit key file storing keys (unit keys) to be used to decrypt the encrypted content ; usage control information; a content certificate (CC) for showing the validity of the content; an MIKE (Media Key Block) that is an encryption key block storing key information (Media Key) for obtaining the CPS unit keys; and the like.","The encrypted content  is, for example, an encrypted content conforming to AACS standard. For example, the encrypted content  is an AV (Audio Visual) stream of moving image content such as an HD (High Definition) movie content that is high-definition moving image data, or a content including music data, a game program, an image file, sound data, text data and the like.","The encrypted content  is, for example, an encrypted content having a configuration in which usage management for each content management unit (CPS unit) is possible and to which the unit keys (CPS unit keys) differing for each content management unit (CPS unit) are applied. The encrypted content  is encrypted with the keys (CPS unit keys) differing for each unit allocated and is stored.","The information processing apparatus  includes two data processors.","A first data processor is a BD-JVM (BD-J Virtual Machine) . The BD-JVM (BD-J Virtual Machine)  is configured to be a virtual machine as a virtual hardware environment in which the BD-J application  recorded on the disc  is executed.","A second data processor is an AACS layer . The AACS layer  is configured to be a data processor for performing data processing according to AACS standard, including the handling of highly secured information, such as obtaining an ID recorded on the disc , and the data transformation in content copying.","Thus, when a content recorded on the disc  is to be copied to another medium, the BD-JVM (BD-J Virtual Machine)  as an execution domain for the BD-J application  recorded on the disc  and the AACS layer  that is a program execution domain for performing processing according to AACS standard are configured, and passing a processing request and a processing result and the like are performed between them.","An API (Application Programming Interface) is used for such passing a processing request and a processing result and the like between the BD-J application and the AACS layer. The API is a group of functions and the like for executing various processings necessary for content copying. The API is stored in the BD-J application  or another area that can be read by the information processing apparatus . A specific example of the API is described in detail later.","The information processing apparatus  executes the BD-J application  in the BD-JVM  to communicate with the management server  and perform processing such as obtaining copying permission information .","In order to copy the content  stored on the disc  to the second information recording medium , processing such as transforming the content and usage control information (Usage Rule) to adapt to a destination medium is required.

Next, in step S, the management server  permits the processing to transmit copying permission information to the information processing apparatus .","The information processing apparatus  receives copying permission information  from the management server  and provides the copying permission information  to the AACS layer . In the AACS layer , the processings in step S and later are performed. The AACS layer  transforms the management data  read from the disc  to management data adapted to the medium type of the second recording medium , the copying destination, such as hard disk, R\/RE disc and flash memory. For example, the AACS layer  adds encryption keys (unit keys) for the content to be copied and transforms the usage control information, the content certificate and the like to data for the content to be copied. Information necessary for these data transformations is included in the copying permission information . The transformed management data  will be recorded to the second recording medium .","Furthermore, in step S, the information processing apparatus  loads the encrypted content  recorded on the disc  and outputs copied content data on which data transformation such as format transformation is performed. In this way, the copied data of the content recorded on the disc  will be recorded to the second recording medium  as encrypted content .

As described above, content copying is performed using the BD-J application and the program executed in the AACS layer. So, passing necessary information between the BD-J application and the execution program in the AACS layer is required. In order to achieve this, the API in which various processings are defined is used.","Next, processing examples using a server performed by an information processing apparatus in accordance with the invention are described with reference to .  shows the following two processings:","An information processing apparatus (user apparatus)  downloads a content A from a server  and stores the content A in a local storage ; and","The information processing apparatus  copies the content A stored in the local storage  to a data-recordable R\/RE-type disc.","Processing Example 1 represents content downloading corresponding to EST (Electric Sell Through) already described with reference to (b) of .","Processing Example 2 represents processing, corresponding to Managed Copy (MC) already described with reference to , of obtaining copying permission information from the server  and performing content copying between media.","The overview of Processing Example 1 is described.","First, the information processing apparatus  loads a ROM disc  on which a content such as a movie is recorded.

In step S, the information processing apparatus  stores the content downloaded from the server in the local storage including, e.g., a hard disk.","In this storing process, as already described with reference to , the data processor of the information processing apparatus  stores the downloaded content from the server and the copied content from another medium in different directories.","Next, the detailed sequence of the content copying described with reference to Processing Example 2 in  is described with reference to a sequence diagram shown in . This is the sequence of copying a content stored in the local storage to another medium such as an R\/RE-type disc.","The data processor of the information processing apparatus (user apparatus)  executes the program (the BD-J application program  shown in ) stored in the local storage such as a hard disk (the local storage  shown in ). The series of processings shown in  is performed by this program execution. The ED-J application program  is a Java\u00ae application program. The data processor of the information processing apparatus  executes the Java\u00ae application program on a virtual machine as a virtual hardware environment for program execution.","When the user  inputs an instruction such as a request for copying to the information processing apparatus  through the user interface displayed on the display or through another input means, the data processor of the information processing apparatus (user apparatus)  starts the program (BD-J application program) .","First, in step S, the user requests the information processing apparatus (user apparatus)  to copy a content stored in the local storage. Specifically, the user inputs an instruction to start copying a content stored in the local storage of the information processing apparatus  to another medium.","In response to the user request, the information processing apparatus  instructs the user to set a content copying destination medium in the apparatus. In step S, the user sets the copying destination medium (in this example, R\/RE-type disc). Then, in step S, the information processing apparatus  reads the identifier of the set R\/RE-type disc (medium ID).","For example, an API (Application Programming Interface) defined in the program (BD-J application program ) is used to read the medium ID. The API is a program unit defined by functions and the like for performing a predefined processing.","The API to be used here is an API [Get Media ID] that defines the reading of the medium ID of an R\/RE-type disc. The processing sequence performed by this API may be included within the program (BD-J application program)  or may be recorded in a library or the like in the memory of the information processing apparatus . Or it may be obtained from the server and recorded in the memory in advance. The information processing apparatus  performs the sequence defined by the API [Get Media ID] to read the medium ID from the R\/RE-type disc.","Next, in step S, the information processing apparatus  transmits the medium ID read from the R\/RE-type disc to the server  to request copying permission information. In this process of requesting the copying permission information, the information processing apparatus  transmits information including the content ID that is the identification information of the content to be copied as well as the medium ID of the copying destination medium.","On receiving the copying permission information from the information processing apparatus, the server  verifies and registers the received data in step S, then transmits the copying permission information to the information processing apparatus  in step S. Note that the copying permission information generated by the server  includes, for example, data (referred to as token) generated by signing with the secret key of the server  with respect to the medium ID of the copying destination medium.","After receiving the copying permission information, the information processing apparatus  performs content copying between media in step S. Specifically, the information processing apparatus  copies the content stored in the local storage to the R\/RE-type disc. In this copying, the copying permission information received from the server is also recorded to the R\/RE-type disc.","Note that content copying in step S may be performed by the program (BD-J application program)  used for obtaining the copying permission information or may be performed by another program recorded in the information processing apparatus. In order to achieve content copying, data transformation and recording according to a specific format, such as data transformation and management information recording according to the type of a recording destination medium, is required. Then, a program dedicated to these copying processings may be stored in the information processing apparatus in advance and the processings using this program may be performed in content copying.","Next, with reference to a flowchart shown in , the processing sequence for content copying is described with respect to the information processing apparatus. As described with reference to , the information processing apparatus performs Managed Copy (MC), which is performed with the copying permission information obtained, by using, for example, the program (BD-J application program) stored in the local storage. Note that, as already described, the program (BD-J application program) may be obtained from the ROM disc on which the content is recorded, and then executed.","When the user inputs a request for copying in step S, the program (BD-J application program) is executed in step S, and the medium ID of the copying destination medium (R\/RE-type disc) is read in step S.","As described above, the reading of the medium ID is performed using the API [Get Media ID]. In step S, according to the program (BD-J application program), the medium ID read from the copying destination medium (R\/RE-type disc, flash memory, HDD and the like) is transmitted to the server to request the copying permission information.","In step S, according to the program (BD-J application program), the copying permission information is obtained (downloaded) from the server. Finally, in step S, according to the program (BD-J application program), the content recorded in the local storage is recorded to the copying destination medium (R\/RE-type disc).","In this copying, the copying permission information received from the server is also recorded to the R\/RE-type disc. Note that, as described above, this content copying may be performed by a program different from the program used for obtaining the copying permission information (BD-J application program), for example, a program recorded in the memory of the information processing apparatus (resident program).","Next, with reference to , the specific sequence of the content copying between media described with reference to  and the data processing configuration of the information processing apparatus are described. As described with reference to , content copying is performed by the program (BD-J application program) stored in the local storage, executed by the information processing apparatus.","The BD-J application program is a Java\u00ae program conforming to BD (Blu-ray Disc\u00ae) standard. In order to execute the BD-J application program, an information processing apparatus  configures a BD-JVM (BD-J Virtual Machine)  as shown in . The BD-JVM (BD-J Virtual Machine)  is a virtual machine as a virtual hardware environment in which a BD-J application  that is a Java\u00ae program stored in a local storage  is executed.","The BD-JVM (BD-J Virtual Machine) , serving as a first data processor, executes the BD-J application  stored in the local storage  to communicate with a server  and obtain copying permission information from the server .","Content copying after obtaining the copying permission information may be performed in the BD-JVM  using the BD-J application , or may be performed using a dedicated program recorded in the memory of the information processing apparatus in advance. In the configuration shown in , content copying is performed in an AACS layer  as a second data processor. The AACS layer  performs BD (Blu-ray Disc\u00ae) format transformation and recording according to the type of a content recording destination medium or the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0199","num":"0198"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["350","354","310","330","320"]},"The local storage  includes, for example, a hard disk. The information processing apparatus  includes, for example, a PC, a recording\/reproducing device and the like. As shown in , the local storage  records the following data:","the BD-J application  that is a Java\u00ae application program;","a copying management file (MCMF) ;","management data ; and","the encrypted content .","The BD-J application  is a program to be executed by the information processing apparatus  when content copying (Managed Copy (MC)) is performed, and, for example, a program for performing a series of processings for content copying, such as communicating with the server . Note that the BD-J application  may be configured as a single application program or may be configured as a combination of two or more BD-J applications each performing a specific processing.","For example, they are a BD-J application for communicating with the server, a BD-J application dedicated to obtaining the copying permission information and the like. When performing content copying, these BD-J applications are executed by the information processing apparatus .","The copying management file (MCMF)  is a file to be used when content copying is performed, and, for example, a data file written in XML including the following information:","(a) a content ID that is an identifier (ID) for uniquely identifying the content recorded in the local storage ;","(b) a URI (URL) that is information for connecting with the server for providing copying permission, generating a token by binding or performing another processing when content copying is performed (for example, information for accessing the server ); and","(c) a directory name\/file name that is information on names of a directory and a file recording data for permitting copying.","The management data  is, for example, management data defined by AACS (Advanced Access Content System) that is a standards management system for content copyright protection technology, and data including: a CPS unit key file storing keys (unit keys) to be used to decrypt the encrypted content ; usage control information; a content certificate (CC) for showing the validity of the content; an MKB (Media Key Block) that is an encryption key block storing key information (Media Key) for obtaining the CPS unit keys; and the like.","The encrypted content  is a content copied from the ROM disc or downloaded from the server. For example, the encrypted content  is an encrypted content subject to usage control conforming to AACS standard. For example, the encrypted content  is an AV (Audio Visual) stream of moving image content such as an HD (High Definition) movie content that is high-definition moving image data, or a content including music data, a game program, an image file, sound data, text data and the like.","The encrypted content  is, for example, an encrypted content having a configuration in which usage management for each content management unit (CPS unit) is possible and to which the unit keys (CPS unit keys) differing for each content management unit (CPS unit) are applied. The encrypted content  is encrypted with the keys (CPS unit keys) differing for each unit allocated and is stored.","The information processing apparatus  includes two data processors.","The first data processor is the BD-JVM (BD-J Virtual Machine) . The BD-JVM (BD-J Virtual Machine)  is configured to be a virtual machine as a virtual hardware environment in which the BD-J application  recorded in the local storage  is executed.","The second data processor is the AACS layer . The AACS layer  is configured to be a data processor for performing data processing according to AACS standard, including the handling of highly secured information and the data transformation in content copying.","Thus, when a content recorded in the local storage  is to be copied to another medium, the BD-JVM (BD-J Virtual Machine)  as an execution domain for the BD-J application  stored in the local storage  and the AACS layer  that is a program execution domain for performing processing according to AACS standard are configured, and passing a processing request and a processing result and the like are performed between them.","Note that an API (Application Programming Interface) is used for such passing a processing request and a processing result and the like between the BD-J application and the ARCS layer.
