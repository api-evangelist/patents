title: Nanoprisms and method of making them
abstract: The invention is a novel photo-induced method for converting large quantities of silver nanospheres into nanoprisms, the nanoprisms formed by this method and applications in which the nanoprisms are useful. Significantly, this light driven process results in a colloid with a unique set of optical properties that directly relate to the nanoprism shape of the particles. Theoretical calculations coupled with experimental observations allow for the assignment of the nanoprism plasmon bands and the first identification of two distinct quadrupole plasmon resonances for a nanoparticle. Finally, unlike the spherical particles from which they derive and which Rayleigh light scatter in the blue, these nanoprisms exhibit scattering in the red, permitting multicolor diagnostic labels based not only on nanoparticle composition and size but also on shape.

The government has certain rights in this invention.","The invention resides in the field of nanoprisms having unique optical properties produced by a photo-induced method.","Size is an important parameter in nanoscale materials that can provide control over many of their physical and chemical properties, including luminescence, conductivity, and catalytic activity. Over the past century, colloid chemists have gained excellent control over particle size for several spherical metal and semiconductor compositions. This chemical control over particle size has led to the discovery of quantum confinement in colloidal nanocrystals and their exploitation as probes in biological diagnostic applications, LED materials, lasers, and Raman spectroscopy enhancing materials. In contrast, the challenge of synthetically controlling particle shape has been met with limited success. Nevertheless, some physical and solid-state chemical deposition methods have been developed for making semiconductor and metal nanowires, nanobelts, and dots, and there are now a variety of methods for making rods with somewhat controllable aspect ratios using electrochemical and membrane-templated syntheses.","Less is known with respect to solution synthetic methods for non-spherical particles such as triangles or cubes. However, methods do exist for making colloidal samples of Pt cubes and pyramids (Ahmandi et al., 272:1924 (1996)), and PbSe, CdS, and Ni triangles (Fendler et al., 122:4631 (2000), Pinna et al., 13:261 (2001), Klasu et al., 96:13611 (1999)). Promising recent work has resulted in methods for synthesizing BaCrO, CdSe and Co nanorods and distributions of arrow-, teardrop-, and tetrapod-shaped CdSe nanocrystals (Li et al., 402:393 (1999), Peng et al., 404:59 (2000), Puntes et al., 291:2115 (2001), Manna et al., 122:12700 (2000)). All of these solution methods are based on thermal processes, and in most cases, with the exception of rods, yield relatively small quantities of the desired particle shape. However, much like particle size-control in nanoscale materials led to the discovery of new and important fundamental science and technological applications in diagnostics, optics, catalysis, and electronics, synthetic methods that lead to control over particle shape can be expected to lead to important fundamental as well as technological advances. Therefore, the development of bulk solution synthetic methods that offer control over particle shape is of paramount importance if the full potential of these novel materials is to be realized.","One embodiment of the invention provides a method of forming nanoprisms by exposing a suspension of non-crystalline silver particles to light having a wavelength of less than about 700 nm to form silver crystals. The method uses a wavelength of light between about 350 nm and about 700 nm. The suspension may comprise a reducing agent, a stabilizing agent, and a surfactant and the light exposure may be intermittent or continue over hours, days, weeks or longer. The suspension may also be stably maintained in the absence of light having a wavelength of less than about 700 nm.","Another embodiment of the present invention is a method of forming nanoprisms by fragmenting silver nanoparticles in suspension by exposure to light, growing silver nanoprisms by continued exposure to light and then terminating the growth of the silver nanoprisms. Preferably, the light has a wavelength of between about 350 nm and about 700 nm and the growth is continued for a period of greater than 50 hours. The growth can be terminated by preventing further exposure of the suspension to light or by consuming the silver nanoparticles feeding the growth. The suspension may comprise a reducing agent, a stabilizing agent, and a surfactant and the light exposure may be intermittent or continue over hours, days, weeks or longer. The suspension may also be stably maintained in the absence of light having a wavelength of less than about 700 nm.","Another embodiment of the invention is a silver nanoprism comprising a single silver crystal having a lattice spacing of 1.44 \u212b and an edge length of between about 10 nm and about 60 nm. The nanoprism typically has a triangular shape with an atomically flat top and bottom. The nanoprism may also have an in-plane dipole plasmon resonance of 770 nm or an out-of-plane dipole plasmon resonance of 410 nm, or an in-plane quadrupole resonance of 470 nm, or an out-of-plane quadrupole resonance of 340 nm or any combination of these characteristics. A further embodiment of the present invention is a silver nanoprism having a tip of the prism is removed. These nanoprisms, may exhibit Rayleigh scattering in the red.","Another embodiment of the present invention is a nanoparticle label based on a silver nanoprism. The label has a triangular shape with an atomically flat top and bottom. The nanoprism label may also have an in-plane dipole plasmon resonance of 770 nm or an out-of-plane dipole plasmon resonance of 410 nm, or an in-plane quadrupole resonance of 470 nm, or an out-of-plane quadrupole resonance of 340 nm or any combination of these characteristics. A further embodiment of the present invention is a silver nanoprism having a tip of the prism is removed. These nanoprisms, may exhibit Rayleigh scattering in the red.","The present invention is a unique photo-induced method for synthesizing large quantities of metal nanoprisms in high yield in the form of a colloidal suspension. Importantly, this photo-mediated route has led to a colloid with a unique set of optical properties that directly relate to the shape control afforded by this novel preparatory method.","In one embodiment of the invention, nanoprisms are formed by exposing a suspension of spherical silver particles to light having a wavelength of less than 700 nm. The reaction that transforms the spherical particles into nanoprisms is initiated by the exposure to light. Exposure to light in the range of about 350 nm to about 700 nm, such as the light from a 40 W fluorescent bulb or tube, is preferred. The reaction is not initiated in the dark or by exposure to light having a wavelength greater than about 700 nm (near-IR light) and the starting suspension is stable as spherical particles for at least two months when protected from light. Therefore, the reaction which results in nanoprisms can be selectively turned on or off simply by controlling the exposure of the colloid to light of the appropriate wavelength.","The silver salt precursor forming the silver source in suspension may be any silver salt capable of dissolution in the selected suspension medium. For example, AgNOand AgClOperform comparably as a silver source for the suspension in an aqueous solution. Preferably AgNOis used in a 0.1 mM aqueous solution. Additionally, a reducing agent is optionally added to the suspension to aid in formation of the suspension. Preferably, the reducing agent is NaBHin a final concentration of 0.5 mM that may be added in dropwise increments.","The surfactant used to form the suspension of nanospheres may vary widely in concentration without affecting the extent of the conversion of nanospheres to nanoprisms. However, the reaction rate is affected by surfactant and provides an additional means of controlling the conversion reaction based on the conversion rate. Preferably, trisodium citrate is present as a surfactant in the suspension of silver nanospheres and bis(p-sulfonatophenyl) phenylphosphine dihydrate (BSPP) is added to the suspension as a particle stabilizing agent. Although the nanoprisms are formed over the entire range of surfactant concentration, the rate of the conversion reaction decreases as a function of increasing the ratio of BSPP to citrate over a range of about 0.01 to about 1. The most rapid conversion rate is obtained at a BSPP to citrate ratio of 0.3:1. Thus, the reaction rate may be optimized by varying the surfactant concentration and the ratio of the surfactant to a stabilizing agent added to the suspension.","After formation of the suspension and exposure to light of the correct wavelength the solution initially turns yellow, characteristic of the spherical particles, but over a time period that can be controlled by suspension characteristics and light exposure, the suspension turns green and then finally blue. As shown in , using UV-vis spectroscopy, the characteristic surface plasmon band for the spherical particles at \u03bb=400 nm decreases in intensity with a concomitant growth of three new bands with \u03bb=335 (weak), 470 (mediate), 670 nm (strong) respectively. As the conversion of the nanospheres to nanoprisms nears completion, the band at 400-nm completely disappears.","Using spectroscopy and electron microscopy, three distinct stages in the conversion of nanospheres to nanoprisms have been identified including induction, growth, and termination,  (inset). Detailed TEM studies reveal that during the induction period, extremely small spherical silver clusters (about 2 to about 4 nm) are formed which are not present in the solution containing the initial spherical particles as shown in FIG. B. These silver clusters form from either fragmentation or dissolution of the larger particles. Noteably, photo-induced fragmentation of silver nanoparticles (visible laser at 532 nm) has been observed by Hartland and coworkers (Kamat et al., 102:3123 (1998)). Nanoprisms form concurrently with the formation of these small clusters. As depicted in , the silver nanoprisms then act as seeds and grow as the small spherical crystals are digested. Once the spherical particles and small nanoclusters are consumed, the reaction terminates. The conversion process can be arrested at any point by stopping the light exposure, thereby providing a means of control over the shape and size of the nanoparticles in suspension. The photo-induced fragmentation of silver particle precursors into small clusters makes the use of light an efficient way to control the growth of the silver nanoprisms. It is important to note that other researchers have used visible lasers, UV, or \u03b3 irradiation to prepare spherical silver nanocrystals from silver salts in the presence of organic reducing agents (Henglein, 17:2329 (2001), Prochazka et al., 69:5103 (1997)). Typically, photo-induced reduction mechanisms are invoked to describe such processes, however, these mechanisms are in contrast with the growth mechanism proposed herein for the silver nanoprisms where the spherical silver particle precursors begin in the reduced state and are exclusively transformed into nanoprisms via the light-induced fragmentation process.","As shown by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) correlated with the time-dependent spectroscopic observations, the silver nanoprisms evolve from the initial spherical nanoparticles.  shows the initial spherical silver particles (8.0\u00b11.7 nm) are converted over the reaction period to prismatic structures, which appear in two dimensions as triangles. During the initial stages of growth, both spheres and prisms can be observed as shown in FIG. B. The latter exhibit edge lengths between about 10 nm and about 60 nm. As shown in , both the size and population of the silver prisms increase with time with a concomitant decrease in the number of spherical particles. The reaction proceeds to completion and nearly all of the initial spheres (>99%) are converted to the prismatic structures having an edge length of about 100 nm, FIG. D.","Another embodiment of the present invention includes the nanoprisms formed by the light-induced photoconversion processes described above. TEM images and electron energy loss spectroscopy analysis (EELS) show that the particles formed in this reaction are indeed silver nanoprisms and not triangular tetrahedra.  shows that each nanoprism has a flat top and bottom (FIG. A), and the triangular thickness fringes expected for triangular tetrahedra are not observed in the TEM. Upon the evaporation of solvent, the silver nanoprisms assemble into \u201cstacks\u201d on the TEM grids () allowing precise measurement of their thickness (15.6\u00b11.4 nm). These stacks appear as nanorods in the two-dimensional TEM images, but tilting experiments confirm that they are nanoprisms. Significantly, each nanoprism is a single crystal with a lattice spacing of about 1.44 \u212b, as evidenced by electron diffraction analysis shown in FIG. . Detailed TEM investigations (tilting diffraction with 3 zone axis) of individual silver nanoprisms show that the 1.44 \u212b lattice spacing corresponds to Bragg diffraction from their {220} crystal faces (face-centered cubic). Therefore, the top crystal face of each nanoprism must be (111). Interestingly, an additional set of relatively weak spots in the diffraction pattern, corresponding to 1 {422} with a 2.5 \u212b spacing is also observed. These weak diffraction spots derive from the local hexagonal-like structure observable only for a silver or gold sample that is atomically flat. This is consistent with the structural characterization of these novel particles as thin nanoprisms with atomically flat tops and bottoms.","The shape and dimensions of the nanoprism depicted in  are average representations of the triangular prisms observed in the TEM images shown in FIG. D. Because the nanoprisms have a triangular shape, the large structural anisotropy substantially influences their optical properties (i.e. light-absorption, scattering and SERS). To characterize the extinction spectrum shown in , Maxwell's equations for light interacting with a triangular prism were solved using a finite element-based method known as the Discrete Dipole Approximation (Yang et al., 103:869 (1995)). Comparing , three bands are observed which qualitatively match the wavelengths of the measured spectra. Examination of the induced polarizations associated with these peaks indicates that the 770 nm peak is the in-plane dipole plasmon resonance, while 470 nm is the in-plane quadrupole resonance, and 340 nm is the out-of-plane quadrupole resonance. The out-of-plane dipole resonance 410 nm and is sufficiently weak and broad that it is barely discernable as a shoulder on the 470 nm peak. Additional calculations indicate that the peak at 770 nm is very sensitive to the sharpness of the tips on the triangles as shown in FIG. B. For example, if an about 12 nm region at each tip of a prism is removed, the long wavelength resonance at 770 nm for the perfect prism shifts to 670 nm without significantly changing the other resonances. Referring to , TEM shows that about 20% of the nanoprisms are truncated. Therefore, these calculations not only allow identification of the important features in the spectrum of the nanoprisms but also the relationship between particle shape and frequency of the bands that make up their spectra.","The optical properties of these novel nanostructures are striking. For example, these nanoprisms provide the first observation of two distinct quadrupole plasmon resonances for a nanoparticle. Additionally, unlike the spherical particles from which they are derived, and which scatter light in the blue, as shown in , the nanoprisms of the present invention exhibit Rayleigh scattering in the red. Light scattering of metal nanoparticles probes has already been exploited in the development of many biodiagnostic applications and although conventional spherical particles made of gold or silver do not scatter in the red, their scattering properties can be tailored by adjusting their size and composition as shown in . Therefore, these novel nanoprisms and their unusual optical properties permit development of multicolor labels based on nanoparticle composition, size and shape.","The nanoparticles can be used as new diagnostic labels, lighting up when target DNA is present. Biodetectors incorporating nanoprisms can be used to quickly, easily and accurately detect biological molecules as well as a wide range of genetic and pathogenic diseases, from genetic markers for cancer and neurodegenerative diseases to HIV and sexually transmitted diseases."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The patent or application file contains at least one drawing executed in color.
