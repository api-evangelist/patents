{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","CONCLUSION"],"p":["In today's world, people are required to collect and manage information about a large number of personal and work-related contacts. Users can typically store their contact information in address books, diaries, contact managers and the like. When a user wishes to communicate with one of their contacts, they may need to consult this stored information. For example, if a user wishes to fax one of their contacts a document of some type, the user may need to consult the contact information to ascertain the contact's fax number.","If the user intends to manually fax the document, they will typically physically enter the fax number into a fax machine via some type of hard user interface. If the user is using a desktop faxing application or an Internet faxing solution, the user will typically have to convey this information to the faxing entity in some way. In these non-manual alternatives, the addressing experience exposed to the user is often non-standard and disparate as between the different alternatives. Moreover, the addressing experience is a very light, non-robust experience. For example, the user may simply be required to enter the fax number, and this may be the only option for the user to address a fax.","The described embodiments can provide a rich, robust fax addressing experience for users who utilize personal computer-based faxing. In accordance with the described embodiments, multiple different ways of addressing a fax and related functionality are exposed to a user. In at least some embodiments, a fax application can resolve recipient names and\/or numbers. For example, when a user types in a recipient name, such name can be resolved against one or more address books that can be selected by the user. Additionally, a user can type in a fax number and have that number resolved as a valid number. Further, at least some embodiments can provide a user interface that is designed to help a user compose a fax number, thus ensuring that the number is in the proper format. In at least other embodiments, the fax application can allow the user to choose from among a number of different address books and then employ the chosen address book in the fax addressing experience.","Overview","The described embodiments can provide a rich, robust fax addressing experience for users who utilize personal computer-based faxing.

In this example, the client computing device comprises bone or more processors  and one or more computer-readable media  on which executable, computer-readable instructions reside. In this example, computer-readable media  includes code that implements a fax application . In this particular example, fax application  is configured to utilize a network-accessible fax service provider, such as Internet fax service provider . One example of a network accessible fax service provider is Windows\u00ae Fax Server. Typically, to use such a provider, a user will upload their document to the provider which will thereafter fax the document to one or more intended recipients. Faxes are typically, although not always, received from such providers in the form of an email attachment.","It is to be appreciated and understood that while the computing device is illustrated as a desktop device, such device can take other forms such as a laptop or notebook computer, handheld computer, or any other type of computing device that can be used in connection with a fax application.","Exemplary Fax Application",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","302","304","306","308"]},"In at least some embodiments, the fax application includes all of the above-identified components which, collectively, provide a very robust and rich is addressing experience for the user. Further, in at least some embodiments, the fax application is intended to work with MAPI-compliant address book providers. MAPI or Messaging API is a publicly-available, well-documented API and includes programming interfaces that are used by MAPI subsystems, by client application writers, and by service provider writers. The main programming interface is an object-based interface known as the MAPI programming interface. Based on the OLE Component Object Model, the MAPI programming interface is used by the MAPI subsystem and by messaging-based client applications and service providers written in C or C++.","It is to be appreciated and understood that the inventive concepts can be employed in contexts other than MAPI contexts without departing from the spirit and scope of the claimed subject matter.","In the discussion below, intended fax recipients can assume a couple of different forms or types\u2014a composed number or an address book contact.","Composed numbers are represented using a special fax format as follows:\n\n","These can be composed using the number composition helper user interface  or just by typing the recipient in the address line manually. The Nazme part of the format is optional. The Number part of the format can be a simple sequence of digits (e.g., 4257022290) or a canonical number (e.g., +1 (425) 7022290).","Alternately or additionally, a fax recipient can take the form of a contact in an address book. Here, a contact's name can be typed in and resolved against an address book on the click of a button, or recipients can be picked by invoking the address book's user interface, as described in more detail below. This particular way of representing recipients provides for easy addition, editing and deletion of fax recipients. Further, it allows for several other features such as viewing a contact's properties, adding the contact to an address book, auto-complete and the like, at the click of a button, as will become apparent below.","Number Composition Helper User Interface","The number composition helper user interface  or simply \u201ccomposition interface\u201d is configured to enable a user to input or otherwise build addressing information in a manner that is standardized and designed to eliminate or at least reduce the chances that an erroneous format is entered. In at least some embodiments, the composition interface includes controls for entering a recipient's name and various fax number details. In at least some embodiments, one or more drop-down menu items can be provided to help the user construct the addressing information for their fax. Once the composition interface has been used to construct the addressing information, it can be added to the appropriate \u201cTo\u201d field and other fields in the fax to be sent. One specific example of a composition interface is provided below in the section entitled \u201cImplementation Example\u201d.","Resolver Component","The resolver component  can be configured to resolve information that is entered by the user in a couple of different ways.","For example, if a user enters, in the address line, the name of a particular recipient, then the resolver component can resolve this name against one or more address books that are available to the user. For example, the user may have two different address books\u2014a Windows\u00ae address book and an Outlook\u00ae address book. If the user has selected the Outlook\u00ae address book, then the resolver component  can resolve the entered name against the Outlook\u00ae address book. Accordingly, when the fax is sent, the fax application will retrieve the fax number of the intended recipient from the selected address book.","Alternately or additionally, the user may instead choose to enter, in an appropriate user interface field, a fax number instead of a recipient's name. In this case, the resolver component  can resolve the entered fax number and show the number as a valid number. In this case, the entered number can be resolved against a format to ensure that the format of the number is valid. Examples of how this can be done are given below in the section entitled \u201cImplementation Example\u201d.","In MAPI contexts in which the recipient is not represented as a composed number, this can be implemented by programmatically calling the appropriate Resolve method of the selected address book provider, given the display name of the contact. When the recipient is represented as a composed number, if the number is valid, a one-off entry is created in the address book and a dummy entry identifier is obtained and shown as a resolved address.","Multiple Address Book Support Component","In accordance with one embodiment and as alluded to above, a user can be provided with an opportunity to select from amongst a number of different address books that they may have available. That is, a user may have several different address books. At the beginning of the faxing session, a user interface can be presented to the user through which the user can search for and\/or select the particular address book that is to serve as the basis for the addressing that takes place during that session.","Encoding Component","In contexts that include MAPI-compliant contexts, fax format addresses can be encoded to prevent them from being construed as address book contacts and to prevent MIME from treating them as email addresses. For example, while saving a partially composed fax message as a draft, certain embodiments utilize the EML format which is a well-document and known format. Systems that utilize EML are tailored for email and try to parse the fax format (e.g. Name<number>) as an email address even though it is, in fact, a fax address. To prevent this situation, the fax address is encoded by pre-pending a fax-specific GUID to it. Additionally, if there is a contact with a display name, such as John<1244> in the address book, the GUID will prevent it from being resolved against the address book.","Implementation Example","The discussion below describes an implementation example. Such example is not intended to limitation application of the claimed subject matter to this particular example. Rather, this example is provided to assist the reader in understanding how one might implement the above-described functionality. In the discussion that follows, two main sections are provided: \u201cAddressing Faxes\u201d and \u201cValidation of Addresses and Address Resolution\u201d, each of which will have several subsections. In the discussion that follows, the implementation example is described in the context of the Windows\u00ae) Fax and Scan solution.","Addressing Faxes","This section describes the details of various ways in which faxes can be addressed.","Number","The first way to address a fax is simply by the number. That is, the simplest way of addressing a fax is to type a number in the \u2018To\u2019 line of the Fax Compose Form. Numbers are separated by semi-colons (;) and a valid fax number consists of the digits 0-9 and modem control characters. Multiple numbers are entered on the \u2018To\u2019 line and separated by semi-colons. Additionally, a user interface (UI) is provided to help the user compose a canonically valid fax number. This UI is launched from the \u2018To:\u2019 button by clicking on the down arrow which launches a menu that displays the \u2018Compose Fax Number\u2019 UI. An exemplary \u201cTo\u201d button and associated \u201cCompose Fax Number UI\u201d are shown in  at .","There, the \u201cCompose Fax Number UI\u201d has the following controls:\n\n","Contact","Faxes can also be addressed using the Windows\u00ae Address Book or MAPI Address Book (GAL). In implementations that do not utilize or provide the user with an option to select from multiple different address books, default address books can be utilized. For example, when Outlook\u00ae is installed on the client computer, the MAPI address book is the default address book for WFS. When Outlook\u00ae is not installed, the Windows\u00ae Address Book (WAB) is the default address book. Of course, just because a default address book is used does not mean that a user cannot opt to select another address book. In this case, the default address book would be the starting address book and the user would be free to select a different address book.","Adding Fax Number Information to an Existing Contact","With regard to adding fax number information for an existing contact, consider the following.","In the Windows Address Book scenario, fax number information can be added and the Windows Address book can store 2 fax numbers per contact in the following fields: Business fax number and Home fax number. To update a contact with his fax number, the user launches the Address Book and opens the contact as shown in  at . The Business Fax number can be added in the \u2018Business\u2019 Tab under the field \u2018Fax\u2019. There is no validation of the fax number format. The user has to make sure that the Fax number entered is valid. The Personal Fax number can be added in the \u2018Home\u2019 Tab under the field \u2018Fax\u2019. There is no in-built validation of this field.","The Business Fax number is considered the default fax number of the contact. The \u2018Summary\u2019 tab also displays the Business Fax number of the contact if entered.","In the MAPI Address Book context, fax number information can be added to existing contacts as follows. For a contact in the GAL, the relevant field is the \u2018Fax\u2019 field in the \u2018Phone\/Notes\u2019 tab of Contact Properties. Note that only the administrator can edit these settings. An associated user interface is shown in  at .","For a contact in Personal Contacts, the relevant fields are: Business Fax, Home Fax and Other Fax, as shown in  at . The Business Fax is considered the default, followed by the Home and then the Other Fax number. A non-administrative user can edit these settings because these are personal contacts stored in Outlook.","Adding a New Fax Contact","With regard to adding a new fax contact, consider the following.","In the Windows Address Book context, to create a new contact, the \u2018File|New Contact\u2019 on the Address Book Main Menu or its associated Toolbar Icon is clicked. It launches the Contact Details page. A name for the contact is filled in the \u2018Name\u2019 Tab. All the other fields are optional. To enter a fax number, the user navigates to the Business Tab and types the number in the \u2018Fax\u2019 field. To add a Personal fax number, the user navigates to the \u2018Home\u2019 tab and adds the fax number.","In the MAPI Address Book context, a new contact cannot be created in the GAL by a non-administrative user. Users can create personal contacts by navigating to the \u2018Contacts\u2019 pane in Outlook. The \u2018Phone numbers\u2019 section in the \u2018General\u2019 tab of personal contacts allows the user to enter Business Fax, Home Fax and Other Fax.","Sending a Fax","With regard to sending a fax to a contact in the Address Book, consider the following.","In the Windows Address Book context, right-clicking on a contact can provide easy task to \u2018Send Fax\u2019.","In the MAPI Address Book context, right-clicking on a contact can provide easy task to \u2018Send Fax\u2019. A fax can be sent from the Fax Compose Form or from the Address Book.","From the Fax Compose Form in the Windows Address Book context, such can be done by clicking on the icons for \u2018To\u2019 on the Fax Compose Form to bring up the Select Recipients Dialog of the Windows Address book when Outlook is not installed, as shown in  at . Here, the name of the contact and his Business Fax Number are listed as the default items in the view. The user can click on \u2018To\u2019 button to populate the To recipients of the Fax Message. Clicking on OK transfers the selected recipients to the Fax Compose Window and clicking on Cancel closes the Dialog without any changes.","If the chosen contact on the \u2018To\u2019 line does not have a fax number associated with it either in the Business Fax or the Personal Fax field, the contact is not added to the list and is displayed in a visually distinctive manner, such as by being shown in red. In the case, the fax is not sent until the user either removes the erroneous contact from the \u201cTo\u201d line or provides a valid fax number for the contact. The Fax is always sent to the primary fax number, which is the Business Fax number. If the Business fax number does not exist, the fax is sent to the Personal fax number. If that too is blank, the user is warned with an error message and is not allowed choose the contact in the \u2018To\u2019 list box.","If both the Business Fax and Personal Fax field have valid telephone numbers listed in them, the Fax is always sent only to the Primary Fax number, which is the Business Fax number. If the user wants to send a Fax to the Personal Fax number, he has to type the number in the \u2018To\u2019 field in the Compose Form, or the Address Book should provide a task to send the fax to the alternate Fax number.","From the Fax Compose Form in the MAPI Address Book context, such can be done by clicking on the icons for \u2018To\u2019 on the Fax Compose Form which brings up the Select Recipients Dialog of the MAPI Address book when Outlook is installed, as shown in  at . There, the name of the contact and the Fax number are listed. The user can double-click the contact, or choose and click on the \u2018To\u2019 button to transfer a contact to the To line in the dialog shown in .","Addition of contacts to the \u2018To\u2019 line is allowed, but validation is done on \u2018OK\u2019 if the chosen contact has a valid fax number\u2014\u2018Fax\u2019 number in the case of a GAL contact, or one of the three numbers\u2014\u2018Business Fax\u2019, \u2018Home Fax\u2019, or \u2018Other Fax\u2019 in case of a Personal Contact. If the numbers are blank, then the contact is shown in a visually distinctive manner as described above.","With respect to sending a Fax from the Address Book, consider the following.","In the Windows Address Book context, the Address book should have tasks that facilitate the sending of Faxes to Contacts. The \u2018Actions\u2019 Icon on the Main Toolbar of the Address Book and the \u2018Tools|Action\u2019 Menu item should have a task for sending a Fax, such as that shown in  at . Clicking on \u2018Send Fax\u2019 should launch the Fax Compose form with the contact on the \u2018To\u2019 line. Similarly, right-clicking context menu of a contact in the Address Book should also launch a similar menu.","In the MAPI Address Book context, the MAPI address book should have simple tasks that facilitate sending of Faxes to Contacts. For example, in the \u2018File|Send a fax\u2019\u2014the file menu should have an action to send a fax; the toolbar icon can have a corresponding icon for sending a fax; and, in the Personal contacts folder, right clicking the context menu on a contact should allow a simple task to send a fax.","Adding Fax Number Information for an Existing Group","In the Windows Address Book context, Groups can have a fax number that is entered in the \u2018Group Details\u2019 page, as indicated in  at . In the MAPI Address Book context, Groups cannot have fax numbers.","Sending a Fax to a Group in the Address Book","In the Windows Address Book context, when a group is chosen from the Windows Address Book, the group is added to the \u2018To:\u2019 line of the Compose Form. The contacts corresponding to the group are not expanded. Groups are always shown in bold. If all the recipients of the group have fax numbers, the group is shown in bold black and underlined. If some of the recipients in the group do not have fax numbers, the group is shown in bold red and underlined. When the user clicks on Send, all the members who do not have fax numbers are discarded, and the fax is sent to the rest\u2014after displaying a warning message to the user. Note that it is not possible for the user to manually or selectively remove recipients from an added group as a group is never expanded to display its constituent members.","In the MAPI Address Book context, when a group is chosen from the MAPI Address Book, the group is added to the \u2018To:\u2019 line of the Compose Form. The contacts corresponding to the group are not expanded. Groups are always shown in bold. If all the recipients of the group have fax numbers, the group is in bold black and underlined.

TAPI (Telephone API provided by Microsoft) uses a Canonical Number Format. The canonical format is intended to be a universally constant directory number. For this reason, numbers in address books are best stored using canonical format.

This leads to the following scenarios:\n\n","A number that is composed using the \u2018Compose Fax Number\u2019 is transferred to the \u2018To:\u2019 line as follows:\n\n","Note that all the numbers are marked as resolved as soon as the UI is closed and the number is transferred to the \u2018To:\u2019 line.","For anything other than a contact, double-clicking a resolved address always launches the \u2018Compose Fax Number\u2019. Take the following example:","<55113000>, <+91 (40) 55113000 >, <+1 (425)707 3000>, IDC Fax Team <+91 (40) 555113000>; <+91 (40) 55113000>;","Clicking on each launches the \u2018Compose Fax Number\u2019 UI for editing with the following pre-filled:\n\n","If the user makes any changes to the data in the \u2018Compose Fax Number\u2019 UI before clicking on OK, the changes are transferred to the \u2018To:\u2019 line. For example, if the user adds a name for the first resolved string and clicks on OK, the new Addressing looks like this:","Windows Fax Team <55113000>, <+91 (40) 55113000>, <+1 (425) 707 3000>, IDC Fax Team <+91 (40) 55113000>; <+91 (40) 55113000>;","Note that only a best-effort matching is made for the entered number to Country Code, Area Code and Fax Number fields in the \u2018Compose Fax Number\u2019 UI. If the user enters an invalid country code (for example +456), the entire number is taken and placed it in the \u2018Fax Number\u2019 field for the user to fix and submit it back to the \u2018To:\u2019 line. The name is stripped and added in the \u2018Name\u2019 field.","Contacts","Any contacts added on the \u2018To\u2019 line without invoking the Address Book are automatically treated as resolved. At the point of resolution, they are not validated for Fax numbers for the contact. The validation whether the contact has a Business (or Personal) fax number is done only on Send and an appropriate error message displayed for missing Fax numbers.","Contacts support auto-complete on part name (Display Name of the contact). Resolution of a number to contact name is not supported. What this means is that if a user enters a number, and the number matches to an entry in the Contact list, the number is not replaced by the Contact Name. The reason for this is:\n\n","Clicking on a number always launches the \u2018Compose Fax Number UI\u2019 and clicking on a contact launches the contact display pane (WAB or GAL as appropriate).","For example, if the user enters 2 contacts, here is how they look on the \u2018To:\u2019 line. Contacts are auto-resolved on addition to the \u2018To:\u2019 line.\n\n","A better way of displaying is the name followed by the associated number, such as indicated just below:","IDC Fax Team <55113000>; Ananda Sarkar <55113003>","Note that the number displayed here is the \u2018Default\u2019 fax number for that contact. If there are multiple fax numbers for a given contact, a right-click context menu on a resolved contact should drop down a list of Fax numbers which the user can choose. The resolved string gets updated on the selection. For example, if the user chooses a different number for \u2018Ananda Sarkar\u2019 in the above scenario, the \u2018To:\u2019 line looks like:","IDC Fax Team <55113000>; Ananda Sarkar <55113004>","It should be noted here that there should be a differentiation between \u2018Contacts\u2019 and added numbers. When the user double-clicks a contact, the \u2018Contact Details\u2019 pane from the default Address book (WAB\/GAL) should always be opened and not the \u2018Compose Fax Number\u2019 UI.","If the list of recipients on the \u2018To:\u2019 line cannot be prefixed by a contact icon, there is no way of identifying which recipient was chosen from the Address Book and which was added as a number on the \u2018To:\u2019 line. A number enclosed by angle brackets (< >) can always be treated as a number entered inline or via the Number helper. \u039b resolved string like \u2018IDC Fax Team\u2019 can always be treated as a contact entered via the Address Book.","The described embodiments can provide a rich, robust fax addressing experience for users who utilize faxing functionality, such as that provided by desktop fax solutions and Internet fax service providers. In accordance with the described embodiments, multiple different ways of addressing a fax and related functionality are exposed to a user and work seamlessly together to give a compelling addressing experience to the user. In at least some embodiments, a fax application can resolve recipient names and\/or numbers. For example, when a user types in a recipient name, such name can be resolved against one or more address books that can be selected by the user. Additionally, a user can type in a fax number and have that number resolved as a valid number. Further, at least some embodiments can provide a user interface that is designed to help a user compose a fax number, thus ensuring that the number is in the proper format. In at least other embodiments, the fax application can allow the user to choose from among a number of different address books and then employ the chosen address book in the fax addressing experience.","Although the invention has been described in language specific to structural features and\/or methodological steps, it is to be understood that the invention defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the specific features or steps described.
