{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["PRIORITY","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation of and claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7120 to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/424,809, filed on Jun. 16, 2006 and titled \u201cSuppressing Dialog Boxes,\u201d the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein.","This description relates generally to application programs and more specifically to browser software.","Browser application programs are often used to access information through the Internet or through company intranets. Users often have multiple pages displayed at any time. These pages may be from one web site, or from multiple web sites. To facilitate switching between multiple pages, tabbed browsers may be used.","Tabbed browsers generally allow programs on undisplayed web pages to continue processing while the tab holding that web page is inactive. This sometimes leads to items such as dialog boxes or other user interface elements to be presented to the user that are generated from web pages that are not currently being used, thus interrupting the user from his or her browsing experience in the web page currently being viewed.","For example, a page the user is not currently viewing may pop up a dialog box asking for a user name and password and the user may think the dialog box is from the currently active tab. This could lead to incorrect information being entered, or worse, a malicious site gaining access to valid username and password information for another site. Aside from those kinds of risks, it typically leads to a poor user experience to have dialog boxes from inactive tabs displayed, interrupting what the user is doing on the currently active, and viewed web page. Alternatively, a browser may switch tabs to one that is trying to display a dialog box. This may also lead to a poor user experience, since the user may not notice that the active tab has changed.","The following presents a simplified summary of the disclosure in order to provide a basic understanding to the reader. This summary is not an extensive overview of the disclosure and it does not identify key\/critical elements of the invention or delineate the scope of the invention. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts disclosed herein in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","The present example may provide a way for browser software with a tabbed interface to suppress, or delay, the display of a dialog box that is initiated by an inactive, or background, tab. An indication may be provided to the user that a dialog box needing user attention may be provided. When that tab becomes active, and the web page on that tab becomes visible, the dialog box is then displayed. This suppression method may be applied to a variety of application programs.","Many of the attendant features may be more readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description considered in connection with the accompanying drawings.","Like reference numerals are used to designate like parts in the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","120","120","110","125"]},"First server computer  may be coupled to wide area network , which is conventionally constructed and may include the Internet  or equivalent coupling methods for providing wide area networking. As shown wide area network  is coupled to conventionally constructed second server computer . In this example, second server computer  is coupled to conventionally constructed computer  over a conventionally constructed second local area network .","Local area networks  and  may include a plurality of conventional computers (not shown) and conventional peripheral equipment (not shown) coupled together utilizing topologies (token ring, star and the like) and switching equipment known to those skilled in the art. Those skilled in the art may realize that other processor equipped devices such as televisions and VCRs with electronic program guides, cellular telephones, appliances and the like may be coupled to the networks utilizing conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art.","A typical local area network  or  may include a conventionally constructed ISP network in which a number or plurality of subscribers utilize telephone dial up, ISDN, DSL, cellular telephone, cable modem, or the like connections to couple their computer to one or more server computers  or  that provide a connection to the wide area network  via the Internet .","Client computers  or  may run a tabbed browser to access the Internet, which may include a web page served by software running on second server computer . The web page may include script or other executable instructions that could cause a dialog box to be display on client computer . Those skilled in the art may realize that the computers ,  may be any number of devices, including a PC, cell phone, Internet appliance, set top box, hand-held computers, and the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","202","220"]},"Internet Browser without dialog box suppression  may have a tabbed interface  with multiple tabs. The example shows three tabs, the currently active tab , with the web page  on the first tab having a title in its tab \u201cTitle 1\u201d displayed. The other tabs, Tab  and Tab , are on web pages not currently visible having titles \u201cTitle 2\u201d and \u201cTitle 3\u201d in the tabs respectively. These pages could be viewed by clicking on the appropriate tab on the tabbed interface .","While the pages on inactive tabs  and  are not visible, they may be continuing to execute any code such as initialization routines, client-side script and third-party control executable code that are on those pages. In this example, the page having tab  has encountered code that has brought up a dialog box . This dialog box tends to pop up and distract the user. This can be confusing to the user, since it may not be clear that the dialog box is not from the page he or she is currently viewing. It could also lead to security issues.","For example, a page the user is not currently viewing may pop up a dialog box asking for a user name and password and the user may think the dialog box is from the currently active tab. This could lead to incorrect information being entered, or worse, a malicious site gaining access to valid username and password information for another site. Aside from those kinds of risks, it typically leads to a poor user experience to have dialog boxes from inactive tabs displayed, interrupting what the user is doing on the currently active, and viewed web page.","Such a browser  could be run on any number of different hardware and software platforms, including but not limited to PCs, cell phones, Internet appliances, set top boxes, hand-held computers, etc.","The present example typically provides a way to prevent interruptions and provide a better user experience, by tending to provide a way to suppress dialog boxes from web pages on inactive tabs, until such time as those tabs become active or it is desired to access these pages.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["301","300","304","300","306","310","312","314","310","312","314","314","320","310"]},"Tab  is displaying a web page on first tab , with the title \u201cTitle 1.\u201d Tabs  and  have web pages titled \u201cTitle 2\u201d and \u201cTitle 3\u201d respectively, which are currently not visible. Any of the tabs could be activated, causing the page loaded on that tab to be displayed, by clicking on the appropriate tab in the tabbed interface . In order to suppress the dialog box  as shown, a method to suppress dialog boxes from view  may be incorporated into the browser software. If Tab  is clicked, the suppressed dialog box  would be displayed in the active window with the corresponding web page titled \u201cTitle 3.\u201d",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["304","401","402","403","402","403","405","400"]},"Block , dialog box suppression decision, comprises several steps. First, block  intercepts the call to display the dialog box. Block  determines if the dialog box should be displayed now. If the dialog box should be displayed now, block  may be executed and the dialog box is displayed.","If block  determines that the dialog box should not be displayed now, block  is invoked, suppressing the dialog box. Determining if the dialog box should or should not be displayed may be determined by examining the thread ID assigned to the tab in question and comparing it to known thread IDs. The known thread IDs may be maintained in a list, table, or their equivalent. Control may then be passed to block , which may cue the user that a dialog box is waiting to be displayed. A cue may be made, possibly by flashing the relevant tab  from  or other equivalent methods. One skilled in the art may recognize that other types of cues could be used indicate the suppressed dialog box, including other visual displays, or sounds such as audible beeps, signals from other devices, such as a Bluetooth enabled phone, or combinations of various indicators, or the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["420","420","415","510","440","520","440","530","425","540","425","440"]},"An example of determining where the call to display the dialog box came from involves using multiple threads within the browser. In such a case, each tab would be given a thread, as well as the browser or frame having one. The primary indicator may be the Thread ID of the thread that is attempting to show the dialog, which can be compared against the known Thread IDs of the tabs (and top-level window). In addition to threads, other indicators may include context such as the window handle being used to parent the dialog or a token previously assigned to the tab and passed along as context. These indicators may be used independently or in conjunction with threads or each other. The outcome of this evaluation may be: Background Tab, Active Tab, Frame (or Browser), or Unknown Source.","If the source of the dialog is found to be a Background Tab then the dialog may be queued by adding it to an internal list, along with an event for that dialog. After the dialog is queued, the source's thread may be blocked, waiting for the event to get signaled. The wait may use a \u201cmodal message loop\u201d which is a method of blocking the thread while still processing a minimal set of Windows messages so that the UI thread is not completely hung, which could hang the entire application.","Next a message may be sent to the Tab Band signaling a dialog was suppressed. The Tab Band may respond by blinking the correct tab. When a tab is selected to make it active the list may be checked to see if any dialogs have been suppressed from that tab. If so the event to unblock the thread may be signaled, allowing the dialog to be shown, and then removed from the list.","If the source of the dialog is found to be an Unknown Source, meaning that the application is unable to associate the caller with any known tab, the dialog may be shown or blocked entirely based on the security risk of showing that dialog on top of the wrong tab. For example, if it is a script-initiated dialog from a web page it would be blocked to mitigate UI spoofing attacks, but if it is a dialog from an add-on within the application it would be allowed.","If the source of the dialog is found to be the Active Tab Thread or Frame Thread then the dialog may be shown right away.","One way to intercept the call to the \u201cdisplay dialog box\u201d is to capture the call directly. For example, if a web page uses script to call an API within a browser to display a dialog box, the browser can directly examine the information in the call to the API to determine the source. Another way is to hook operating system APIs for showing dialogs, capturing any calls to the API and determine the caller before passing the call on to the original operating system routine.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["301","301"]},"A peripheral drive  may accept a computer readable media ,  that includes a copy of the method to suppress dialog boxes from background tabs. The peripheral drive may be coupled to an I\/O interface  along with an I\/O device .","The I\/O interface  may be coupled to a bus structure , which also may couple to a hard disk , a processor , system memory , a video adapter  and a network adapter .","Video adapter  typically couples a display  to the CPU . Network adapter  typically couples a local area network  to the CPU .","For example the computer  can be implemented with numerous other general purpose or special purpose computing system configurations. Examples of well known computing systems, may include, but are not limited to, personal computers, hand-held or laptop devices, microprocessor-based systems, multiprocessor systems, set top boxes, gaming consoles, consumer electronics, cellular telephones, PDAs, and the like.","The computer  includes a general-purpose computing system in the form of a CPU , display , I\/O device , and peripheral drive . The CPU  can include one or more processors (including CPUs, GPUs, microprocessors and the like) , a conventional system memory , and a conventional system bus  that couples the various system components. Processor  processes various computer executable instructions, including those to control the operation of computing device  and allows communication with other electronic and computing devices (not shown). The system bus  represents any number of several types of bus structures, including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, an accelerated graphics port, and a processor or local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures.","The system memory  may include computer-readable media in the form of volatile memory, such as random access memory (RAM), and\/or non-volatile memory, such as read only memory (ROM). A basic input\/output system (BIOS) is typically stored in ROM. RAM typically contains data and\/or program modules that are immediately accessible to and\/or presently operated on by one or more of the processors . Computing device  may include other removable\/non removable, volatile\/non-volatile computer storage media.","A hard disk drive  is also a type of computer readable media that may read from and write to a non-removable, non-volatile magnetic media (not shown). Such a hard disk  may include a magnetic disk drive which reads from and writes to a removable, non volatile magnetic disk (e.g., a \u201cfloppy disk\u201d) , or an optical disk drive that reads from and\/or writes to a removable, non-volatile optical disk such as a CD ROM or the like. In this example, the hard disk drive , and disk drive  are each connected to the system bus  by one or more data media interfaces . The disk drives and associated computer readable media provide non volatile storage of computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, and other data for computing device .","Mass storage devices (or peripheral drive)  are also a type of computer readable media that may be coupled to the computing device or incorporated into the computing device by coupling to the bus .

Computer readable media (\u201cCRM\u201d) ,  typically embody computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules and the like supplied on floppy disks, CDs, portable memory sticks and the like. Such CRM may be used to produce an initialization disk.","Any number of program modules or processes can be stored on the hard disk , or peripheral drive , including by way of example, backup files, an operating system, one or more application programs, other program modules, and program data. Each of such operating system, application programs, other program modules and program data (or some combination thereof) may include an embodiment of the systems and methods described herein.","A display device  can be connected to the system bus  via an interface, such as a video adapter . A user can interface with the CPU  via any number of different input devices  such as a keyboard, pointing device, joystick, game pad, serial port, and\/or the like. These and other input devices are connected to the processors  via input\/output interfaces  that are coupled to the system bus , but may be connected by other interface and bus structures, such as a parallel port, game port, and\/or a universal serial bus (USB).","Computer  can operate in a networked environment using connections to one or more remote computers through one or more local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs) and the like. The computer  is connected to a network  via a network adapter  or alternatively by a modem, DSL, ISDN interface or the like.","The browser  with method to suppress dialog boxes from background tabs  may be disposed on Hard Disk , or on computer readable media disposed on Peripheral Drive , or the like.
