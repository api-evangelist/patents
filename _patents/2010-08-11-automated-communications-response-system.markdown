title: Automated communications response system
abstract: In one embodiment, a system provides for end-user control over the automatic recognition of communication situations by detection of unique telecommunication event characteristics and the consequential responses to those situations by invocation of related programmatic responses. The system allows an end user to specify various patterns of telecommunication event characteristics that describe various situational aspects of incoming communications, such as the timing and originator of voice calls, the content of, timing of, and author of chat messages, etc., as well as appropriate sets of programmatic response actions to be performed in response to those communications, such as initiating conference calls, sending chat messages, routing calls to other users, etc. The system monitors incoming communications, matches characteristic patterns to recognize the situations, and then invokes the matching response actions, thereby automating many functions of the communication system that previously would have had to be performed manually.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS OVERVIEW","DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority from the provisional application entitled AUTOMATED COMMUNICATIONS RESPONSE SYSTEM, application No. 61\/273,952, filed Aug. 11, 2009 which is hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes.","The present disclosure relates generally to controlling and managing VOIP and Instant Messaging (IM) applications.","Skype is a software system that allows users to make audio and video calls over the Internet. It supports conference calls, instant messaging, file transfer and video conferencing. Skype uses a proprietary Internet telecommunication (VoIP) network that works on a peer-to-peer model.","Skype includes an Application Programming Interface (API) that allows other programs to interact with Skype. The Skype API supports three types of messages: 1) commands to control Skype, 2) directives\u2014i.e. \u201cout of band\u201d commands that control the API itself, and 3) information messages that Skype sends about its status.","One of Skype's distinguishing features is that it can operate behind firewalls and Name Address Translation (NAT) routers. It achieves this by using super-nodes to relay calls between clients not directly connected to the Internet. Any Skype client can become a super-node if it connects to the Internet without NAT and\/or an appropriate firewall, which means Skype can and does \u201cborrow\u201d bandwidth and computing power.","A disadvantage of such a \u201cborrowing\u201d feature is that the end-user has little control over the conditions or timing of such borrowing. Despite the existence of APIs to provide developers with programmability of such systems, tools are not available that enable end-users to take control of the telephony and chat facilities in a way that they can automate their various functions to allow end-user control of such features as the borrowing described above, or to allow automatic detection of and response to a variety of other telecommunications circumstances that might arise.","What is needed is a system that enables the end-user to simply and precisely define a set of telecommunications circumstances, such as any set of characteristics which apply to particular classes of voice calls or chat messages, and to define appropriate programmatic responses to relevant circumstances, to allow automatic detection of and response to a wide variety of such telecommunications circumstances, thereby expanding the usefulness of telecommunications systems.","An example embodiment provides a system for end-user control over the automatic recognition of communication situations by detection of unique telecommunication event characteristics and the consequential responses to those situations by invocation of related programmatic responses. The system allows an end user to specify various patterns of telecommunication event characteristics that describe various situational aspects of incoming communications, such as the timing and originator of voice calls, the content of, timing of, and author of chat messages, etc., as well as appropriate sets of programmatic response actions to be performed in response to those communications, such as initiating conference calls, sending chat messages, routing calls to other users, etc. The system monitors incoming communications, matches characteristic patterns to recognize the situations, and then invokes the matching response actions, thereby automating many functions of the communication system that previously would have had to be performed manually.","Reference will now be made in detail to various embodiments of the invention. Examples of these embodiments are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. While the invention will be described in conjunction with these embodiments, it will be understood that it is not intended to limit the invention to any embodiment. On the contrary, it is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various embodiments. However, various embodiments may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances, well known process operations have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention. Further, each appearance of the phrase an \u201cexample embodiment\u201d at various places in the specification does not necessarily refer to the same example embodiment.","A first example embodiment is an interface software tool, named \u201cSkybot\u201d, as depicted in , and is programmed utilizing the Tool Command Language (Tcl). Referring to , in this example embodiment an Internet telecommunication platform , the Internet telecommunication platform API  and the Interface Software Tool  are implemented as software modules on a user's personal computer (PC).","The Interface Software Tool  includes an extension language module  used to specify rules and actions for interacting with an Internet telecommunication platform, a generalized state engine  that evaluates the rules and automatically triggers Tcl code in response to various events, a database  for holding rules and an interface (not shown) to the API of the Internet telecommunication platform so that actions can access state and configuration information of the Internet telecommunication platform. In this example embodiment the Internet telecommunication platform is Skype.","In this example embodiment the rules are stored in a normalized database, and presented to users as tables. There is a single maintenance screen with multiple tabs\u2014one for each table in the database.","There are three classes of rules: 1) call rules, 2) chat rules, and 3) watch rules (watch for someone changing to a particular status) used in this example embodiment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"]},"The interface includes a button for each characteristic. When creating a new rule using the interface the button for the characteristic is clicked on and the user selects a characteristic that has either been previously pre-specified or specified by the user. The specification of characteristics will be further described below.","The first thing to note is that rules may be defined but not enabled. This makes it easier to create rules without affecting the behavior of the interface software tool.","Turning now to the first rule, which specifies that Skype should not accept calls at night when the user is at home. In this example the Enable characteristic is activated by checking the box under the Enable label. With regard to the rest of the characteristics, note the following:\n\n","In this example embodiment all rules and actions are stored as data in tables, and are abstracted and normalized","The Who characteristic is defined in the \u201cGroups\u201d tab. In this example embodiment there are two groups defined by default: the all group, which is a wild card that matches all Skype users and a friends group, which is the list of people on the user's Skype contact list (as returned by the Skype API call \u201cSEARCH FRIENDS\u201d).","Alternatively, a Skype user name or a pattern (e.g.\u201ccorporate-*\u201d) can be entered or a groupings to be entered can be specified\u2014for example \u201cwheaton\u201d might expand to \u201ccyndy maury mike\u201d. Groups can be recursive, as in wheaton=\u201ccyndy maury mike\u201d or corporate=\u201cwheaton steveh stevel\u201d.","This scheme also allows convenient aliases to map to real Skype user names\u2014for example, the above names might be aliased to corporate-cyndy, corporate-maury and so on. During data entry, a check is performed to ensure a group isn't defined with the same name as an alias or a Skype name on the users contact list.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"]},"Locations are based on IP address, and are defined in the \u201cLocations\u201d tab.

In the above example, you can see the Tcl commands that are run when the event is detected. These make use of some pre-defined Tcl commands but the intention is to eventually allow definition of arbitrary Tcl procedures in the database as well.","The \u201cwhen\u201d command creates a Tcl trace on the call status variable, allowing event driven actions within rules. This means that the rules will be re-evaluated whenever the call status is changed by Skype.","The Details variable is passed in from the call\/chat\/watch rule, and will be substituted, so that any variables it contains will be expanded. This will allow rules to be parameterized. The following example would be useful in an organization that spans time zones, or where team-members are semi-nocturnal.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0044"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Who","When","Action","Details"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["corporate-*","night","reply","\u201c$firstname, I'm still sleeping\u201d"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Because rules and actions are just data stored in database tables, the interface software tool is both flexible and extensible, and can be extended by adding new rows to the tables in the database, or by modifying existing rows.","Examples of Call actions include the following:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0047"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["accept","accept the call"]},{"entry":["refuse","don't answer call"]},{"entry":["message","send Instant Message to either the user, the caller or both"]},{"entry":[{},"via an IM gateway"]},{"entry":["reply","reply to caller with pre-defined chat message"]},{"entry":["mail","send mail to me\/caller\/whoever"]},{"entry":["play","play sound clip to audio output device or caller"]},{"entry":["say","\u201cspeech to text\u201d to audio output device or caller"]},{"entry":["voice mail","send call to voice mail"]},{"entry":["log","log call details (start time, then end time)"]},{"entry":["conference","hang up call then initiate conference call with pre-defined"]},{"entry":[{},"numbers"]},{"entry":["redirect","hangs up call, then initiates conference with"]},{"entry":["mute","mute speakers"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"For example, to refuse all incoming calls when in a meeting, but let Mike know that the user is available via chat, use something like the following Calls definitions (abbreviated for clarity)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0049"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Who","When","Action","Details"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"all","morning","refuse",{}]},{"entry":[{},"mike","morning","Reply","I'm available via chat"]},{"entry":[{},"default","morning","Reply","I'm unavailable"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"The \u201cdefault\u201d rule will only match if there is no other matching response.

Skype client and communicate with it, and a Command Protocol Layer, which is a text-based \u201clanguage\u201d that external applications can use to speak to the Skype client, once a communication channel is established by the Communication Layer.","Additionally, there are several Skype API wrapper libraries that encapsulate the functionality of the Skype API. Such wrappers can act as optional third layers.","The Communication Layer provides a mechanism for external application to communicate with Skype. This layer is platform-dependent, and the transport mechanism to exchange data with Skype is different on Windows, Linux and Mac operating systems.","There are two types of information available to the interface software tool via the Skype API: data that is \u201cpushed\u201d from Skype to the interface software tool when certain events occur, and data that may be \u201cpulled\u201d by the interface software tool from Skype when required.","Messages \u201cpushed\u201d from Skype to the interface software tool include, in part, notification of an incoming call or chat message, the chat topic, the call duration on completion or a call failure reason if there was a problem, but all data may potentially be pushed by Skype and so must be recognized by interface software tool.","Data that may be \u201cpulled\u201d by the software interface software tool includes information about the call or chat message, e.g., when an incoming call is detected the interface software tool needs to pull information about the call type and the caller ID.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0067"},"figref":["FIG. 5A","FIG. 5A"],"b":"502"},"In process block - the interface software tool checks if Skype is running and (if necessary) starts it. In process block  the interface software tool attaches itself to Skype, and registers to receive messages from Skype via the Skype API.","In process block , the location is initialized. If the user's location cannot be automatically recognized by using the IP address, the user will be prompted (e.g. home, office, etc) and information received will be saved. The extensible design of the software interface tool allows for additional location methods to be incorporated, such as using RFID or GPS devices.","The interaction routine then enters a loop where messages from Skype will be recognized and the appropriate response will be performed. In process block , the interaction routine waits for a message from Skype. As specified by the Skype API definition, each of the messages from Skype is either: a command (from the software interface tool to Skype) and a corresponding response (from Skype to the software interface tool) or a notification (a \u201cpushed\u201d message from Skype to the software interface tool). These messages are textual messages like \u201cCALL\u201d or \u201cCHAT\u201d followed by additional information, e.g. \u201cCALL 25069 STATUS RINGING\u201d.","The software interface tool contains rules that map between Skype API messages and internal software interface tool commands. These rules may be viewed and maintained by the user through the Skype tab on the software interface tool UI, thus allowing users to extend the software interface tool if required. In process block , when a notification message is sent from Skype to the software interface tool the message is matched against the list of patterns in the software interface tool's Skype tab.","When there is an incoming call Skype sends the interface software tool a message like the following CALL $id STATUS RINGING where $id is the Skype message identifier. The pattern matching recognizes the message and calls the command \u201ccall $id $property $value\u201d, where property is STATUS and value is RINGING.","The call procedure sees that there is not an existing call $id, and so creates a new one, creating a separate interpreter to hold its state.","In process block  the software interface tool then pulls any required extra data from Skype (e.g., the PARTNER_HANDLE property which contains the Skype username of the incoming call) which is extracted and stored within the software interface tool.","For example, the software interface tool then requests extra information about the call from Skype, such as the Caller ID, e.g. \u201cGET CALL 25069 PARTNER_HANDLE\u201d and Skype returns this information as a response, e.g. \u201cCALL 25069 PARTNER_HANDLE+61812345678\u201d, which is again matched against the Skype rules in the software interface tool.","If there is no match then processing returns to process block .","In processing block , the data pulled from Skype and the data previously pushed from Skype are used to recognize a situation defined by the user when creating a rule. The recognition process will be described more fully below with reference to .","In process block , the appropriate rule-defined response based on the recognized situation is performed.","The RECOGNIZE SITUATION () and PERFORM RESPONSE () process blocks of  will now be described more fully with reference to  and  respectively. These subroutines match the information obtained from Skype to the rule characteristics, defined for example as described above with reference to , and if a match occurs, the interface software tool performs the action specified in the rule.","Turning to , in process block  the recognition subroutine is entered. At this point the software interface tool knows several pieces of information about the call or chat, such as the person or number the incoming call\/chat came from, the time of day the call\/chat arrived, and where the user is currently located.","In process blocks - this information is further processed according to the rules in the Groups and Time tabs. In process block  the \u201cWho\u201d value (that is, the person or number making a call or chat) is first matched against the Groups tab, allowing rules to be specified for multiple people for brevity. Default rules exist for \u201call\u201d and \u201cfriends\u201d (i.e. Skype friends). In process block  \u201cWho\u201d is set for the message.","In process block  the \u201cTime\u201d value is matched against a range of times, such as morning, night, afternoon, and so on, these can be modified by the user as required. In process block  \u201cWhen\u201d is set for the message.","Once the extra processing defined in process blocks - occurs, the recognition subroutine has all it needs to recognize a situation and decide on an appropriate response. In process blocks - searches are made through enabled rules to match characteristics of the received message to characteristics of enabled rules.","In process block  the type of call (call, chat, watch) is matched, in process block  who made the call is matched, in process block  when the call was made is matched, in process block  where the user is located is matched, in process block  the type of event (ringing, connection, finish) is matched and in process block  the direction of the call or chat (incoming, outgoing) is matched.","Once the matching process determines the \u201csituation\u201d defined by an enabled rule then the action defined in the enabled rule is performed in process block  and the subroutine exits in process block .","The response operation will now be described in more detail with reference to . When a situation is recognized (i.e. a rule in the Calls, Chats or Watch tab matches) the associated action is run by the software interface tool. Actions are specified in the Action tab, and can be modified or extended by users using a spreadsheet paradigm as described above with reference to .","Actions can relate to either calls, chats, watches or all three, are named (e.g. mail, message, mute) and may have one or more corresponding commands within the software interface tool. Commands can be Skype commands, software interface tool commands or any arbitrary command to be run on the computer hosting Skype. This allows the situation-specific combination of arbitrary Skype and non-Skype functionality","The Actions tab specifies optional information that is passed to the action by the interface software tool, as per the Details information associated with each entry in the Calls, Chats and Watch tabs.","The Input column in the Actions tab specifies the optional information expected by each action. For example, the mail action expects three pieces of information\u2014the email addressee, the subject (a text value) and the contents of the message (another text value)","Many different default actions can be appropriate for calls and chats, including, for example, to accept the incoming call\/chat, refuse the call, respond using a speech to text subsystem, send to voice mail, redirect to another number, or initiate a conference call.","As depicted in , corresponding to each entry in the actions tab is a list of the command(s) to be run to implement the response.","By way of example,  illustrates the interaction between Skype and the software interface tool via the Skype API when performing the \u201cconference\u201d action depicted in . The \u201cconference\u201d action can be specified to automatically set up a conference call between designated parties when a particular set of characteristics are matched from an incoming message.","In this example, the conference call action accepts two inputs, both phone numbers for the conference call attendees, and gets response data from the database in process steps -, and then performs six steps in responding.","In process block  the response subroutine instructs the interface software tool to convert the message \u201cYou will be called back soon\u201d from text to speech, and instructs Skype to play the sound to the originating caller.","In process block  the response subroutine instructs Skype to HANG UP CALL and in process block  Skype finishes the call","In process block  the response subroutine instructs Skype to CALL NUMBERS and utilizes the numbers obtained in process blocks  and . In process blocks  and  Skype calls the two conference call attendees. In this example, one would be the original caller and one would be the interface software tool user's cell phone number.","In process block  the response subroutine instructs Skype to MUTE SPEAKERS and in process block  Skype itself is muted so that no sound comes from the speakers during the call.","In process block  the response subroutine gives Skype \u201cfocus\u201d so that Skype is brought to the front on the computer running the interface software tool so that it is apparent a conference call is in progress.","In process blocks - the response subroutine waits for the call to finish and, when the call finishes, Skype is un-muted.
