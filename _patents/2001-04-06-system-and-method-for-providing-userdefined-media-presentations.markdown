{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention is generally related to television systems, and, more particularly, is related to a method and apparatus for enabling a user to define and present media presentations tailored to individual preferences.","With recent advances in digital transmission technology, subscriber television systems are now capable of providing much more than the traditional analog broadcast video. In implementing enhanced programming, the home communication terminal device (\u201cHCT\u201d), otherwise known as the set-top box, has become an important computing device for accessing media services (and media within those services) and navigating a user through a maze of available services. In addition to supporting traditional analog broadcast video\/audio functionality, HCTs now also support an increasing number of one-way digital and two-way digital services such as video-on-demand.","Typically, an HCT is connected to a cable or satellite television network and includes hardware and software necessary to provide the functionality of the digital television system at the user's site. Preferably, some of the software executed by an HCT is downloaded and\/or updated via the subscriber television network. Each HCT also typically includes a processor, communication components, and memory, and is connected to a television or other display device, such as a personal computer. While many conventional HCTs are stand-alone devices that are externally connected to a television, an HCT and\/or its functionality may be integrated into a television or personal computer or even an audio device such as a radio, as will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art.","As more and more services and applications are provided, subscriber television systems are providing media information to the HCT so that the user can view such information on the display connected to the HCT or a remote device such as the television. The media information allows the viewer to learn more about the available media by including such information as name and title and start and end times of the media. This media information has traditionally been organized for presentation purposes into a media guide format that presents the media information by time and channel only. The media guide can, for instance, automatically scroll the available television channels to present the media information.","Many subscriber television system operators, for instance, cable system operators, include one or more dedicated channels that scroll through the channel list displaying information about programs delivered from the cable headend that not only are currently on the cable network, but also are scheduled to be on in the future. These types of passive displays lack interactive functionality from the user. For example, the user typically must view the media information as it scrolls on the display and wait for either the desired channel and\/or the desired time to search for the media that may be available for viewing. However, adding user interactivity involves two-way communication between the user set-top box and the head end, which comes at a cost of increased back office operation and additional bandwidth to support one-to-one, on demand content delivery.","As a result, there is a need for a media system that enables viewers to easily and efficiently locate media that they are seeking without requiring excessive bandwidth or increased operational demands at the head end.","Thus, a heretofore unaddressed need exists in the industry to address the aforementioned deficiencies and inadequacies.","The preferred embodiment of the present invention can be viewed as a media system for providing user-defined media presentations received from a remote location. This media system includes a memory to store media information received from a remote location wherein the media information characterizes the media for the media presentations. Also, this media system includes a processor configured by the memory to provide a user interface to enable a user to define the media presentations from the media information, wherein the processor is further configured by the memory to continually segue media stream changes among a plurality of broadcast media streams containing the media for the media presentations defined by the user.","The preferred embodiment of the present invention can also be viewed as a method for presenting user-defined media presentations. This method includes providing a user interface to a user to receive user input corresponding to the desired media information, wherein the media information characterizes the media for the user defined media presentations. This method also includes searching for the media corresponding to the user-defined media information among a plurality of media streams. This method also includes presenting the media corresponding to the media information, including segueing media stream changes among a plurality of media streams to present the media corresponding to the desired media information.","Other systems, methods, features, and advantages of the present invention will be or become apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following drawings and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems, methods, features, and advantages be included within this description, be within the scope of the present invention, and be protected by the accompanying claims.","The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Furthermore, all \u201cexamples\u201d given herein are intended to be non-limiting.","One preferred embodiment of the present invention is generally implemented as part of a subscriber television system such as, for a non-limiting example, a cable television system (CTS). Hence, an illustrative CTS and its operation will be described initially.  shows a block diagram view of a cable television system (CTS) , which is generally a high quality, reliable and integrated network system that is preferably capable of delivering video, audio, voice and data services to home communication terminal devices (HCTs) . Although  depicts a high level view of a CTS , it should be appreciated that a plurality of cable television systems can tie together a plurality of regional networks into an integrated global network so that HCT users can receive media provided from anywhere in the world.","The CTS  preferably delivers broadcast video signals as digitally formatted signals in addition to delivering traditional broadcast analog video signals. Furthermore, the system can preferably support one way broadcast services as well as both one-way data services and two-way media and data services. The two-way operation of the network preferably allows for user interactivity with services, such as Pay-Per-View programming, Near Video-On-Demand (NVOD) programming according to any of several known NVOD implementation methods, View-on-Demand (VOD) programming (according to any of several known VOD implementation methods), and interactive applications, such as Internet connections.","The CTS  also provides the interfaces, network control, transport control, session control, and servers to access media from media services, and distributes media to HCT users. As shown in , a typical CTS  comprises a head end , hubs , an HFC access network , and HCTs . It should be appreciated that although a single component (e.g. a head end) is illustrated in , a CTS  can feature a plurality of any one of the illustrated components or may be configured with alternative embodiments for any one of the individual components or with yet other additional components not enumerated above.","Media provided by one or more content providers (not shown) is communicated by the content providers to one or more head ends . From those head ends  the content is then communicated over a communications network  that includes a plurality of HFC access networks  (only one HFC access network  is illustrated). The HFC access network  typically comprises a plurality of HFC nodes , each of which may serve a local geographical area. The hub  connects to the HFC node  through a fiber portion of the HFC access network . The HFC node  is connected to a tap  which is connected to a network interface unit (NIU)  which is connected to a home communication terminal device (HCT) . The NIU  is normally located at a user's property and provides a transparent interface between the HFC node  and the users' internal wiring. Coaxial cables are typically used to couple nodes , taps  and NIUs  because the electrical signals can be easily repeated with radio frequency (RF) amplifiers.","As the high-level operations of many of the functions of the cable television system (CTS)  are well known to those of skill in the art, further high level description of the overall CTS  of  will not be contained herein. It will be appreciated, however, that the CTS  shown in  is merely illustrative and should not be construed as implying any limitations upon the scope of the present invention. For instance, subscriber television systems also included within the scope of the invention include systems not utilizing physical structured cabling for transmission, such as, but not limited to, satellite systems. Further, transmission mediums included within the scope of the invention include, but are not limited to, HFC, optical, satellite, RF, FM, and microwave. Further, data provided from the head end  to the HCTs  and programming necessary to perform the functions discussed below will be understood to be present in the CTS , in accordance with the description below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["16","11","241","273","16","16","242","11","18","11","18"]},"The home communication terminal (HCT)  further includes a processor  for controlling operations of the HCT , an output system  for driving the television display , and a tuner system  for tuning into one or more particular media streams for retrieving media and media information to be presented and for sending and receiving various types of data from the head end . The output system  also preferably includes other conventional outputs, including, but not limited to, conventional audio outputs for a conventional attached stereo system (not shown), etc. The tuner system  includes, in one non-limiting example implementation, an out-of-band tuner for bi-directional quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) data communication and a quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) tuner for receiving television signals.","The HCT  may be coupled to a personal video recorder  through a communications port . A personal video recorder (PVR)  is a video recorder for recording media, preferably via a digital recording mechanism. A PVR  comprises a local storage device in which media can be written to and stored and later read from and retrieved for presentation.","A receiver  receives externally-generated information, such as user inputs or commands from other devices. The user inputs may, for example, be provided via a remote control device , an infrared (IR) or wired keyboard (not shown), keys in the front panel of HCT  (not shown), or mouse (not shown), or some other input device.","In one implementation, the HCT  includes system memory , which includes flash memory  and dynamic random access memory (DRAM) , for storing various applications, modules and data for execution and use by the processor  of the HCT . Both the flash memory  and the DRAM memory  are coupled to the processor  for storing configuration data and operational parameters, such as commands that are recognized by the processor . Basic functionality of the HCT  is provided by an operating system  that is contained in flash memory . Among other things, the operating system  includes at least one resource manager  that provides an interface to resources of the HCT  such as, for example, computing resources.","One or more programmed software applications, herein referred to as applications, is executed by utilizing the computing resources in the HCT . The application executable program stored in flash memory  or DRAM memory  is executed by processor  (e.g., a central processing unit or digital signal processor) under the auspices of the operating system . Data required as input by the application is stored in DRAM memory  or flash memory  and read by processor  as need be during the course of application execution. Input data may be data stored in DRAM memory  by a secondary application or other source, either internal or external to the HCT , or possibly anticipated by the application and thus created with the application at the time it was generated as a software application program. Data may be received via any of the communication ports of the HCT , from the head end  via the HCTs network communication interface  in coordination with the tuner system  or as user input via receiver . Data generated by the application is stored in DRAM memory  by processor  during the course of application program execution.","An application referred to as a navigator  is resident in flash memory  for providing a navigation framework for services provided by the HCT . The navigator  registers for and in some cases reserves certain user inputs related to navigational keys such as channel increment\/decrement, last channel, favorite channel, etc. The applications may be resident in flash memory  or downloaded into DRAM . The navigator  also provides users with television related menu options that correspond to HCT functions such as, for example, adding a channel to a favorites list, blocking or excluding a channel or a group of channels from being presented, activating parental control, and displaying media titles, etc. Some of the functionality performed by applications executed in the HCT  (such as the broadcast music application ) may instead be performed at the head end , and vice versa, in some embodiments of the present invention.","The flash memory  also contains a platform library . The platform library  is a collection of utilities useful to applications, such as a timer manager, a compression manager, a configuration manager, an HTML parser, a database manager, a widget toolkit, a string manager, and other utilities (not shown). These utilities are accessed by applications via application programming interfaces (APIs) as necessary so that each application does not have to contain these utilities. Two components of the platform library  that are shown in  are a window manager  and a client service application manager (SAM) .","The window manager  provides a mechanism for implementing the sharing of the screen regions and user input. The window manager  on the HCT  is responsible for, as directed by one or more applications, implementing the creation, display, and de-allocation of the limited HCT  screen resources. It allows multiple applications to share the screen by assigning ownership of screen regions, or windows. The window manager  also maintains, among other things, a user input registry  in DRAM  so that when a user enters a key or a command via the remote control device  or another input device such as a keyboard or mouse, the user input registry  is accessed to determine which of various applications running on the HCT  should receive data corresponding to the input key and in which order. As an application is executed, it registers a request to receive certain user input keys or commands. When the user selects a key corresponding to one of the commands on the remote control device , the command is received by the receiver  and relayed to the processor . The processor  dispatches the event to the operating system  where it is forwarded to the window manager  which ultimately accesses the user input registry  and routes data corresponding to the incoming command to the appropriate application.","The SAM client  is a client component of a client-server pair of components, with the server component being located on the head end . The SAM client  is a part of the platform library . The client SAM  also interfaces with the resource manager , as discussed below, to control resources of the HCT .","Many media services can be defined using the same application component, with different media parameters. Examples of media services include, without limitation and in accordance with one implementation, presenting broadcast music programs (via a broadcast music application ), television programs (via a WATCHTV application ), pay-per-view (PPV) events (via a PPV application ), video-on-demand (via a VOD application ). The term \u201cmedia\u201d is herein understood to include, among others, any audio and\/or visual information or event recognized for its informational or entertainment value. By way of non-limiting example, media may include a movie or a song, etc. Media information is characterizing information about the media, including but not limited to titles, start and end times, channel location, etc. The term \u201cmedia stream\u201d is herein defined to include a sequential supply of media provided by a media service, such as, by way of non-limiting example, a channel of broadcast music. In general, the identification of a media service includes the identification of an executable application that affects the media service and also includes a set of application-dependent parameters or identifiers that indicate to the application the specific media stream to be provided.","Applications may be downloaded into DRAM  at the request of the client service application manager (SAM) , typically in response to a request by the user or in response to a message from the head end . In this non-limiting example DRAM  contains a broadcast music application , VOD application , an e-mail application , a PVR application , and a web browser application . It should be clear to one with ordinary skill in the art that these applications are not limiting and merely serve as examples for this present embodiment of the invention. DRAM  also includes application memory  that various applications may use for storing and retrieving data. Furthermore, one or more DRAM  based applications, as an alternative embodiment, may be resident in flash memory  or vice versa. These applications, and others provided by the cable system operator, are top level software entities on the network for providing media services to the user. In addition, the scope of the present invention includes embodiments in which applications are combined or divided in other combinations to accomplish one or more of the discussed functions.","In one implementation, applications executing on the HCT  work with the navigator  by abiding by several guidelines. First, an application utilizes the Client SAM  for the provision, activation, and suspension of services. Second, an application shares HCT  resources with other applications and abides by the resource management policies of the Client SAM , the operating system , and the HCT . Third, an application handles situations where resources are unavailable without navigator  intervention. Fourth, when an application loses service authorization while providing a service, the application suspends the service via the Client SAM  (the navigator  will reactivate an individual service application when it later becomes authorized). Finally, an application is designed to not have access to certain user input keys reserved by the navigator  (i.e., power, channel +\/\u2212, volume +\/\u2212, etc.).","An executable program or algorithm corresponding to an operating system (OS) component, or to a client platform component, or to an application, or to respective parts thereof, can reside in and execute out of DRAM  and\/or flash memory . Likewise, data input into or output from any executable program can reside in DRAM  or flash memory . Furthermore, an executable program or algorithm corresponding to an OS component, or to a client platform component, or to an application, or to respective parts thereof, can reside in flash memory , or in a local storage device connected to HCT  and can be transferred into DRAM  for execution. Likewise, data input for an executable program can reside in flash memory  or a storage device and can be transferred into DRAM  for use by an executable program or algorithm. In addition, data output by an executable program can be written into DRAM  by an executable program or algorithm and can be transferred into flash memory  or into a storage device for storage purposes. The present invention is not limited by where or how data and\/or applications are stored or retrieved.","In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the segue application  and segue database  are downloaded by the head end  as part of a sub-program within the broadcast music application . Alternatively, the segue application  and segue database  may be downloaded by the head end  as a separate application stored in system memory  that interacts with the broadcast music application  or any other application, such as but not limited to WatchTV . Alternatively, the segue application  and segue database  may be an application integrated into the HCT , stored in, for non-limiting example, system memory . In other embodiments, at least part of the segue application  functionality may occur at the headend . In other embodiments, the segue application  may play a more limited role. Although the preferred embodiment is described herein, it is understood by those skilled in the art that the segue application  and the segue database  may serve any other media application (for non-limiting example, WatchTV ) as an integral part of the media application or external to the media application.","The segue application , in communication with the processor  and tuner system  and segue database , functions to provide the segueing capability for the broadcast music application , as well as the configuring of user interface screens at the HCT  for the broadcast music application . In the conventional subscriber network distribution system, for a non-limiting example, it is most efficient to distribute media in a broadcast manner, that is, several \u201cchannels\u201d or media streams segmented by category broadcast such that any authorized subscriber with access to the network can tune to the channel to receive media. The broadcast approach allows a subscriber to pick a preferred category of media on a static basis while minimizing the back office operation and additional bandwidth that is required with a one-to-one, on-demand media delivery scheme. It does not, however, allow for customization or tailoring the media presentation to the subscribers' desires. The segue application  enables the subscriber to specify his\/her preferences to, by way of non-limiting example, the HCT  and to deliver a service which dynamically extracts media corresponding to the preferences from the broadcast channels. This approach provides a richer subscriber experience than that delivered by statically tuned channels, but preserves the efficiency of distributing the media in a broadcast fashion.","The segue database  includes at least two primary data structures. One data structure is the program information\/schedule data structure . The program information\/schedule data structure stores media information received from the head end  for media available though an application, for non-limiting example, broadcast music . The application is configured to receive media and media information from the head end , as will be described in greater detail in association with . By way of non-limiting example, the program information\/schedule data structure  may store the media information for all of the songs available through the broadcast music application . This media information is categorized under media information categories which may include, among others, song genre, song title, song artist, composer, data of composition, and other timing descriptor data such as start and end times of the songs and their frequency or channel location.","Another data structure resident within the segue database  is the define\/priority data structure . The define\/priority data structure  stores the user's configurations and their corresponding rank or priority within a custom media presentation. By way of non-limiting example, songs available through the broadcast music application  may have their corresponding media information characterized for display to a user in a user interface screen at the television. Media information is retrieved by the segue application  from the program information\/schedule data structure . When the user selects and prioritizes the media information corresponding to the desired media or song from the display screen, this configuration is transferred by the segue application  to the define\/priority data structure . The segue application , based on the user's configurations, searches for the media corresponding to available media information stored in the program information\/schedule data structure  of the segue database  that meet the user's configurations. The segue application  will use the media information to segue media stream changes to provide a custom presentation, as will be described in greater detail later.","In an alternative embodiment, applications such as, for non-limiting example, the broadcast music application , may store the data structures of the segue database  in application memory , wherein the segue application  interacts directly with application memory . Furthermore, if an electronic program guide (EPG) application and respective database exist, the EPG application may store relevant information in the EPG database, and the segue application  may conduct search operations in this database (not shown) as well. The present invention is not limited by where or how the media information is stored or retrieved. In one embodiment, the segue application  may play a more limited role of providing a user interface for user input, but software with segue application  functionality at the headend  searches for the user defined media presentation selections among the plurality of media streams and communicates to the HCT  which media stream to tune to. In other embodiments, the functionality of the segue application  may be an application operated at the headend  in a browser-type embodiment, wherein the headend  generates and sends to the HCT  screens with media information choices for presentation to the user, and the user makes selections that are stored in a database similar to the segue database  at the head end . The headend  may then process the selections and priorities defined by the user and deliver tuning instructions to the HCT . The segue application  functionality at the HCT  is limited, and most of the segue application  functionality is provided by an application at the headend , wherein the headend  communicates to the HCT  which channel to tune to segue into the media presentation desired. This communication may be, by way of non-limiting example, executed in accordance with the head end  directing the HCT  tuner system  as to what MPEG-2 stream to tune to, as in described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,600,378 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["380","16","382","383","384","385","386","387","388","389","390","395","395"]},"The flow chart of  shows one preferred method for defining and presenting media presentations according to the media information. In this regard, each block represents a step for defining and presenting media presentations according to the preference of the user. It should also be noted that in some alternative implementations, the functions noted in the blocks might occur out of the order noted in . For example, two blocks shown in succession in  may in fact be executed substantially concurrently or the blocks may sometimes be executed in the reverse order, depending upon the functionality involved, as will be further clarified below. Step  is the step of providing a user interface for the broadcast music application . In the preferred embodiment, this screen may be displayed as a result of the user selecting the broadcast music application  from an electronic service guide generated by an electronic service guide application resident in the HCT . Other methods of introducing the user interface of the preferred embodiment are also included within the scope of the present invention. Step  is interacting with the user to define, or configure, the media presentation or media presentations via interaction with the user interface. Note that although one user is described here, it is understood that there may be more than one user. Further, it is understood that one user may have more than one custom media presentation (or \u201cmy channels\u201d). The user interface screen may display several selection options and instructions to guide the user in defining the custom media presentation. The user interface display may prompt the user  to decide whether the user is ready to begin a media presentation or whether the user needs to define a media presentation. If further definition is needed, the user may make further selections from one or more display options. If the user is ready for the media presentation, then step  is commenced to search through media information corresponding to media in a plurality of media streams for media in progress and upcoming meeting the user definition for the media presentation. Step  segues media stream changes among the plurality of media streams to present the user-defined media presentation.","With continued reference to  and ,  illustrates the concept of media streams. Step  () includes searching through media information corresponding to media in a plurality of media streams, wherein the media information searched for corresponds to the configurations made by the user from pre-determined media information categories. These configurations are stored in data fields located in the define\/priority data structure  located in the segue database  of the broadcast music application , or in alternative embodiments as described previously in association with the discussion for . As illustrated in , the media streams are a sequential supply of media provided by a media service, such as, by way of non-limiting example, a channel of broadcast music from a head end . For a non-limiting example, media stream # () may include a sequential supply of songs. Although the media streams are continual, assume a snapshot where a first media instance of media stream#  is entitled Huckle Bop instance . Note that the Huckle Bop instance  has a start-time  and end time . Other media instances have different start and stop times generally, for music, but video and other media may be more synchronized with programming starting and stopping on the half-hour. The media information for the Huckle Bop instance  and other media among the media streams includes the start and end times and frequency (and\/or other identifiers as necessary to distinguish the media among the media streams) for the corresponding media to enable the segue application , in cooperation with processor  and tuner system , to segue to the appropriate media instance. The media information is preferably sent via the QAM or QPSK channel in a separate transport stream such as MPEG-2 stream, or as a packet as in TCP\/IP protocol, or any other manner of media transport as is well known to those skilled in the art. The media information may be downloaded from a media services server device to the broadcast music application , and updated either continually or, alternatively, as needed to remain current. The broadcast music application  stores the media information in the program information\/schedule data structure  of the segue database  or alternatively in other locations as described previously in connection with .","For a non-limiting example, the user may have defined his or her media presentation in one or more user interface screens, as will be described later, with the following priority or rank: song titles ranked 1, with selections under song titles Huckle Bop first and Kissing Cousins second within the song title category. New Age music is ranked second among the song genre media information category. New Age song Pleasant Day is excluded due to content deemed inappropriate by the user. These configurations are stored in the define\/priority data structure  of the segue database . When the user starts the presentation, the segue application , based on these definitions or configurations stored in the define\/priority data structure , will search the program information\/schedule data structure  of the segue database  for media that has media information that corresponds to the media presentation the user defined. Specifically, the segue application  will search the program information\/schedule data structure  for the desired or defined media that is currently in progress and upcoming among the plurality of media streams (Step  of ). Note the distinction between methods employed in the computer arts, wherein the user manually searches through, for example, pre-configured favorites. The segue application  enables the user to define or configure one or more favorites, and then the segue application  automatically seeks these favorites out in the broadcast media streams and automatically tunes to these user defined favorites. For non-limiting example, assume the search by the segue application  resulted in the discovery of the user's first choice, i.e. Huckle Bop. The segue application  configures the processor  and the tuner system  to segue to media stream # () to enable the presentation of the Huckle Bop instance  (step ).","The Huckle Bop instance  is now the current media or song of the media presentation in session. Segue application  also searches for the upcoming media corresponding to the user's custom media presentation. If no media matching any of the user's configurations are available by the end of the current media instance (e.g. the Huckle Bop instance ) at end time , the current media stream continues with presentation of the Guitar Gallop instance  until a selected media is available, such as after the gap between  and . Since a genre selection (i.e. New Age music) was made in the present example, a switch to media stream #  takes place at time  to begin the presentation of the Wind instance . Note that no switch to the Pleasant Day instance  in media stream #  occurred after  since Pleasant Day is an excluded song. If Pleasant Day had not been excluded, the transition to media stream #  would have happened at . The segue may be accomplished as a fade or a cross fade, or the start of the Wind instance  may begin abruptly after the abrupt end of the prior media instance, Guitar Gallop instance , or accomplished via any other method of fading as is well known in the art. Ranked media will generally be played out for the entire duration, at which time the segue application  will either enable the presentation of the next ranked media, searching from highest to lowest rank, or present a default (e.g. same media stream) as described earlier. Continuing with the present example, the Wind instance  is played until its end time , at which time the segue application  causes a switch from media stream #  to media stream #  to present the Kissing Cousins instance . The Kissing Cousins instance , already in progress, is ranked higher than the new age genre, and thus the switch takes place. As described earlier, the segue may take place via any known method of fading, but is not necessary. Alternatively, a user may desire to have presented the higher ranked media from the beginning of the higher ranked media instance. Such an embodiment would require that higher-ranking media are always presented from the start of its presentation, and would often require that media in progress would not be played in its entirety. In the present example, assuming the Wind instance  is in progress, and noting that the start time  of the Kissing Cousins instance  occurs before the end time  of the Wind instance , the segue application  may cause a segue from the Wind instance  to media stream #  to present higher ranked Kissing Cousins at the Kissing Cousins instance  start time . The result would be that the end of the Wind instance  would not be presented. As an alternative embodiment, buffering may be employed in memory to enable the beginning of the higher ranked media instances to be played in situations of overlapping presentation times between selections, such as between times  and . Alternatively, buffering may be employed to cache the end of one song and the beginning of the next, or alternatively, play out the end of one song and cache in the next song. Of course, because of the delay caused by buffering, subsequent time adjustments would be made by the segue application  in presenting future media.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":["FIGS. 6-27","FIG. 4","FIG. 2"],"b":["283","282","244","450","244","282","259","241","244","252","248","241"]},"Once the user interface screen is presented to the user, the next step  in  is interacting with the user to define the media presentations at the user interface. Prompts (e.g. selections, instructional text messages, etc.) within the user interface screens will enable the user to decide (step ) if the user wants to present (and thus go to step ) or be presented with a user interface (step ) to continue to define or configure their custom media presentation step . The example user interface screen display  () in the preferred embodiment fills the entire television screen, but could also be a window composed on part of the television display over top of other windows. The example user interface screen display  includes a title header  common to all of the broadcast music application  interface screens. Below the title header  is a subtitle header  that is descriptive of elements below subtitle header . Channel list  includes a list, for non-limiting example, of all of the channel titles and their respective channel numbers available through the broadcast music application . Channel list  also includes open channel designations with channel number and pre-set default titles, for example \u201cMy Channel #1 115\u201d as shown in highlighted window , for custom media presentations, also referred to as \u201cmy channels\u201d. For non-limiting example, John Doe may have a my channel #1 comprising music for parties. John Doe may also have a my channel #2 comprising music for dinner. There may also be several users' my channels listed, such as Mary Doe's party mix music under my channel #8. The channel titles for my channels may be edited by the user, as described below. Each channel window  of channel list  contains the corresponding channel title and channel number, as described above. Channel list  also includes highlighted window , which may be scrolled up and down the media stream list  by up and down arrows  and , respectively. Alternatively, the highlighted window  may be fixed, and the up and down arrows  and , respectively, may cause the channel windows  with their corresponding channels and channel titles to advance through the highlighted window . Up arrow  and down arrow  suggest to the user a one-to-one functional correspondence to up and down arrows  and , respectively, on remote control device . Likewise, select button , located between up and down arrows  and , suggest a one-to-one functional correspondence with select button  on the remote control device . Select button  is used to select the desired channel in the highlighted window .","Current selections screen  displays the channel title and channel number corresponding to the channel in highlighted window , and the selections contained therein. Current selections screen  may also display textual instructions that guide the user on the use of the user interface screen , and are responsive to user selections. Current selections screen  alternatively may be an interactive display that the user may interact with to make additions or other changes to the selections located within the current selections screen. For non-limiting example, current selections screen  may accept user input directly, as opposed to simply displaying selections made with the user interface buttons or arrows. Bottom header  is located at the bottom of example first user interface screen display . Bottom header  includes service guide button  and configure my channel button . Service guide button  and configure my channel button  have counterpart buttons on remote control device .
