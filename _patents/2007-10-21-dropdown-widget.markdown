Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to a data processing system. More particularly, the present invention pertains to a graphical user interface component.","2. Description of the Related Art","A graphical user interface (GUI) has become one of the most widely used mechanisms in which the user interacts with a data or information processing and\/or communications system such as a personal computer (PC) or a personal digital assistant (PDA), or a cellular phone, etc. This is partly due to the recent progress in information technologies, both in software and hardware areas, and this is also partly due to the wide recognition of the benefits with which the (well-designed) graphical user interface provides the user in terms of the usability and accessibility, etc. In the graphical user interface paradigm, in the so-called windowing systems in particular, the user interacts with a computer (or other data processing\/communications devices) through one or more special areas in the display screen(s), typically of rectangular shapes, called windows. Windows can be opaque or semi-transparent. A special window that covers the whole display screen is generally known as a \u201cdesktop\u201d (e.g., in a window system of personal computers). Some windows are configured to display textual or graphical content within their boundaries, such as edit windows used in word processing applications. Other various types of special-purpose or \u201cstock\u201d graphical user interface components, or widgets or controls (or, common controls), are also included in most GUI toolkits or libraries or in most operating systems that natively support graphical user interfaces. (For example, Microsoft Windows, Apple Macintosh, various X-Window based window systems on Unix platforms, and other GUI systems on virtual machines such as Java Swing, Microsoft .Net framework, etc., and Palm, Symbian, and other operating systems for handheld devices or mobile handsets, etc.)","One of the most commonly used GUI controls is a so-called dropdown or dropdown list widget. A typical dropdown list consists of an edit box and a (pull-down) list. An item from the pull-down list may be selected and displayed on the edit box, which may or may not be editable by an end user. An item may also be added to the list either programmatically or by the user (e.g., by adding the item into the (editable) edit box). The list part may be made visible (\u201cpulled down\u201d) or hidden (\u201cclosed\u201d) by clicking on the (non-editable) edit box or on a button (typically drawn with a downward arrow) which is usually included in the dropdown list widget. In a typical graphical user interface (GUI) system, only one item may be selected (and displayed through the edit box area). Change of the selected item in the edit box (either in response to user input or initiated programmatically based on other conditions or events, etc.) typically triggers an event, which may be used, for example, to control the behavior of other widgets or to perform certain predefined operations (e.g., through callback functions). The dropdown list control, or simply dropdown control, is sometimes called a combo-box because it provides the combined functionalities of an edit control and a list control (or other type of component). It should be noted, however, that the combo-box control is a single widget in all common graphical user interface systems, libraries, or frameworks, for example, with a well-defined interface (e.g., an application programming interface, or API). In certain implementations, the list control part may always be displayed along with the edit control part (e.g., instead of being toggled between the hidden and pulled-down states). Other variations are also found.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B"],"b":["102","102","104","106","106","102","108","108","110","104","106"],"i":["a","a ","b"]},"A related graphical user interface component is a menu control, or a menu bar\/strip, which usually consists of one or more menu items. Menu items are typically organized in a hierarchical fashion, and they are designed to trigger certain associated actions when activated (e.g., in response to a user selection). Selecting a non-leaf menu item (e.g., similar to a folder) typically \u201cpulls down\u201d (or, hides) its child menu items (e.g., in the downward direction, or to the right, etc.), in a similar way that a list is displayed (or, hidden) when the combo box is toggled. Selecting a leaf menu item usually issues an associated command which is to perform a predefined function. Unlike the dropdown list component, however, the menu control is primarily used to trigger or issue an action rather than to select an item, and the menu control does not generally change the (parent menu's) label in response to selecting a (child) menu item.  shows a (horizontal) menu bar or menu strip control in the prior art. The (top-level) menu control shown in the figure is in a \u201cclosed\u201d state, and it comprises three menu items , \u201cFile\u201d, \u201cEdit\u201d, and \u201cView\u201d. Menu items can be \u201copened\u201d by clicking or hovering on the menu items (or, areas on or surrounding the associated labels) using a mouse pointer, or by activating certain predefined keyboard shortcuts.  illustrates the menu bar control in an open or dropped-down state. The \u201cEdit\u201d menu has been pulled down, and its child menu (or, submenu)  is displayed below the menu bar. The (vertically arranged) submenu bar  includes one or more menu items , each of which may open up another submenu or fire up an associated command or action, when activated. Labels of menu items are typically non-editable (e.g., by the user). A menu bar or a submenu bar may be closed either explicitly (e.g., by clicking on the menu, etc.) or implicitly (e.g., automatically when a user interacts with different widgets other than the menu, etc.). Certain aspects of the present invention may apply to a menu control as well as to a dropdown list control, even though our discussion may only refer to a dropdown list control in some cases.","A typical implementation of the dropdown list widget in the prior art is designed to pick an item from a single list of data associated with the widget, add an item to the list, or otherwise manipulate the data in the list. In some cases, the data may be organized into hierarchical lists, such as in the case of a menu component that includes submenus, but each menu (or, submenu) is still associated with a single list (e.g., its child menu items). In certain implementations, the list may be filtered, or otherwise dynamically manipulated, but they still deal with one list. There are cases, however, in which being able to organize items in more than one list (or, select an item from the multiple lists, for example, from different data sources, etc.) is desirable. For instance, listing hundreds or thousands of cities in the United States in one list may not be the most convenient way to organize and\/or present the data to the user. Instead, it may be more user-friendly if the cities are grouped, for example, into states and presented in multiple (shorter) lists.","Certain embodiments of the present invention provide methods and apparatuses for presenting a set of data on a graphical user interface (GUI). In particular, a dropdown widget with multiple lists is provided. According to an embodiment of the present invention, selection items are grouped into multiple lists, and the lists are presented in a certain preset order, for example, in response to a user input. In some embodiments, a list may be selected by using a toggle button on a widget, e.g., in a cyclic fashion. In some other embodiments, a particular list may be selected by choosing the corresponding button from multiple buttons, or by clicking on a particular area of the widget. Certain selected lists may also be presented based on the context or based on user preferences. Two or more lists may be displayed at the same time. Embodiments of the present invention can be used to enable the user to select items from two or more mutually exclusive or hierarchically organized lists.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, a multi-list combo-box control is provided. The graphical user interface component comprises an edit or text box area and one or more list boxes. A list may be selected and pulled down using a toggle button. In some embodiments, lists are displayed in a cyclic way, for example, when the dropdown button is pressed or a pointer is hovered over the button. In some embodiments, a list may be explicitly selected using a certain user interface such as a built-in spin control or multiple buttons. In certain cases, lists may be filtered and only a set of selected\/pre-filtered lists may be accessed by the user. Items in lists may also be filtered in certain implementations. In a certain embodiment, one or more lists may be simultaneously displayed, either overlapped or concatenated. Embodiments of the present invention may be used for displaying items from mutually exclusive lists (e.g., an item is either an email address or a telephone number, etc.) or from multiple folders or categories (e.g., bookmarks belonging to different folders, etc.). Embodiments of the present invention may also be used for displaying items from hierarchically organized lists. For example, the US cities may be grouped into 50 states (either beforehand when storing the data or on-the-fly when presenting them on the user interface, etc.) and they may be displayed through a GUI widget embodiment of the present invention. Certain embodiments may be used for displaying context-dependent lists (e.g., for selecting an item(s) from one or more lists, etc.). For example, context-sensitive help (or, help topics, help categories, etc.) may be presented to a user, which the user may cycle through to find the right help topic he or she is looking for. Embodiments of the present invention may also be used for displaying items classified in terms of their attributes (e.g., based on relevant dates, etc.) or items simply divided into multiple groups (e.g., alphabetically, etc.). In a certain embodiment, multiple items may be selected (e.g., one from each separate list, etc.). For example, three color components may be selected from three color palettes (e.g., for R, G, and B colors) included in a single multi-list combo-box widget.","Therefore, as summarized herein, the present invention provides, among other things, a graphical user interface control with multiple drop-down or pull-down lists. These and other embodiments, features, aspects, and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and from the detailed description and appended claims which follow.","The present invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which various exemplary embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Likewise, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in the following description in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be evident, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention. Parts of the description may be presented using terminology commonly employed by those skilled in the art to convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. Also, parts of the description may be presented in terms of operations performed through the execution of programming instructions. As well understood by those skilled in the art, these operations often take the form of electrical, magnetic, or optical signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, and otherwise manipulated through, for instance, electrical components.","The invention may utilize a distributed computing environment. In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be physically located in different local and remote memory storage devices. Execution of the program modules may occur locally in a stand-alone manner or remotely in a client\/server manner. Examples of such distributed computing environments include local area networks, enterprise-wide computer networks, and the global Internet. In addition, it should be understood that the programs, processes, methods, etc. described herein are not related to any particular computer or apparatus nor are they related or limited to any particular communication network architecture. Rather, various types of general-purpose machines may be used with program modules constructed in accordance with the teachings described herein. Similarly, it may prove advantageous to construct a specialized apparatus to perform the method operations described herein by way of dedicated computer systems in a specific network architecture with hard-wired logic or programs stored in nonvolatile memory such as ROM (read only memory).","Various methods will be described as multiple discrete operations in turn in a manner that is most helpful in understanding embodiments of the present invention. However, the order of the description should not be construed as to imply that these operations are necessarily to be performed in any particular order, in particular, in the order of the presentation. Some portions of the detailed descriptions which follow are presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here, and generally, conceived to be a self-consistent sequence of steps leading to a desired result. The steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, or the like. It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the following discussions, it is appreciated that throughout the present invention, discussions utilizing terms such as \u201cprocessing\u201d, \u201ccomputing\u201d, \u201ccalculating\u201d, \u201cdetermining\u201d, or \u201cdisplaying\u201d or the like, refer to the action and processes of a computer system, or similar electronic computing device, that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical (electronic) quantities within the computer system's registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage, transmission or display devices.","The present invention also relates to apparatus for performing the operations herein. This apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes, or it may comprise a general purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer. The algorithms and displays presented herein are not inherently related to any particular computer or other apparatus. Various general purpose machines may be used with programs in accordance with the teachings herein, or it may prove convenient to construct more specialized apparatus to perform the required method steps. The required structure for a variety of these machines will appear from the description below. In addition, the present invention is not described with reference to any particular programming language. It will be appreciated that a variety of programming languages may be used to implement the teachings of the invention as described herein.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, a method and apparatus for presenting a set of data on a graphical user interface (GUI) is provided. A GUI component, or control\/widget, in a certain embodiment comprises an edit or text box area and one or more list boxes. A list may be selected and pulled down using a toggle button or other activation mechanism. Data from certain data sources may be presented in one or more lists as selectable items. According to an embodiment of the present invention, selection items are grouped into multiple lists, and the lists are presented in a certain preset order, e.g., in response to a user input. In some embodiments, lists are displayed\/presented in a cyclic way, for example, when the dropdown button is pressed or a pointer is hovered over the button. In some other embodiments, a list may be explicitly selected using a certain user interface construct such as a built-in spin control or one or more buttons, or by clicking on a particular area of the widget. In some other embodiments, certain selected lists may also be presented based on the context or based on user preferences. In certain cases, lists may be filtered and only a set of selected\/pre-filtered lists may be accessed by the user. Items in lists may also be filtered in certain implementations. In a certain embodiment, one or more lists may be simultaneously displayed, either overlapped or concatenated. Embodiments of the present invention may be used, among other things, to enable the user to select items from two or more mutually exclusive or hierarchically organized lists without using multiple controls.","With reference now to figures,  illustrate various exemplary graphical user interface components according to certain embodiments of the present invention. The widgets shown in these figures are displayed in their \u201cclosed\u201d states (or, visual representations indicating the \u201cclosed\u201d states, etc.). The exemplary widget  of  according to an embodiment of the present invention comprises a text box or edit area  and a button or a \u201cmulti-arrow\u201d button  (e.g., to indicate that the button or the widget is associated with multiple lists, etc.). When the button  is pressed (or, a mouse pointer is hovered over an edit box area , etc.), a dropdown list is displayed. In a certain embodiment, a different list is displayed (e.g., in the same dropdown list box, etc.) when the button is pressed again. When all lists have been displayed at least once (e.g., in a certain predefined order), pressing the button one more time may close the drop-down list box. The list box may also be closed once an item is selected from one of the lists (or the hovering mouse pointer leaves the area of control, etc., depending on the implementation). The text area  is used to display a currently selected item. In a certain embodiment, the text box may be \u201ceditable\u201d. In such an embodiment, the selected item may be edited in the edit box , or a new item may be added. The newly added item may be inserted into one of the lists (e.g., stored in a data source such as a document in a file system or a table in a relational database, etc.), for example, into the \u201cfirst\u201d list in a certain preset order or into the \u201cactive\u201d list, which is associated with the currently or previously selected item, or into the currently open list, if any, etc. When the text box  is non-editable, it may be used as an extension of the button . That is, the multi-list box may be \u201ctoggled\u201d (e.g., cyclically) by clicking on the text box portion  of the widget , for example, using a mouse button.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 3C"],"b":["212","214","216","218","218","218","218","218","218","218","216","218","218","218","222","224","226"],"i":["a ","c ","b","a ","c ","b ","b","a ","c","a "]},"Turning now to , various exemplary graphical user interface components according to certain embodiments of the present invention are illustrated. The various widgets shown in these figures are displayed in their \u201copen\u201d or pulled-down\/dropped-down states.  shows a graphical user interface widget according to an embodiment of the present invention. The widget shown in the figure comprises, among other things, one or more lists of items (e.g., stored in a memory of a data processing system, etc.). One of the associated lists (or, a part of it) is currently shown in a pull-down or visible state . The list box portion  of the widget can be activated (e.g., opened\/pulled down, or closed\/hidden, etc.) using a button .  shows the graphical user interface widget of  with a different list  pulled down. The button has a different visual representation in this example. One of the items of the associated lists (e.g.,  or , etc.) may be selected and displayed in the edit box portion of the widget by the user, for example, using a pointing device or a keyboard. In the exemplary figure of , the selection has not been changed even though a different list has been opened. Typically, opening a list and selecting an item involve two (or more) separate events (e.g., user actions). In some embodiments, at least one list may always be visible (open). Lists may be sorted in some way. In certain implementations, the items in an open list may also be edited or deleted. A new item may be inserted (e.g., into a particular position, etc.). In a certain embodiment, the data may be presented in a table or grid format, or as a graph or figure, etc. According to an embodiment of the present invention, different lists are displayed in the same size list box. (For example, a short list may be \u201cpadded\u201d with blank lines, etc.) In some embodiments, each list may have a different (e.g., optimal, or user-configured, etc.) size. In a certain embodiment, a dropped-down list may be resized (e.g., its height, etc.), for example, using the \u201cresize grip\u201d .

The exemplary widget includes an (editable or non-editable) edit box  for displaying a selected item (text or image, etc.), a button  for toggling drop down lists, and one or more list boxes,  and  in the figure. As stated earlier, these components represent abstraction of functional entities (e.g., not necessarily separate controls by themselves). In a certain embodiment, the button part  may be optional. In a certain other embodiment, more than one button may be used. The items in the lists may be dynamically generated (or, filtered based on predefined lists, etc.) or they may come from separate (static) data sources. In some cases, a list may be dynamically \u201cpaginated\u201d into multiple lists (e.g., based on a pre-configured value, such as the maximum number of items in a single list\/page, etc.). In a certain embodiment of the present invention, a single dropdown list box component (e.g., a visual abstraction) is used\/reused for multiple data sources (or, lists). In a certain other embodiment, a list box component may be built in memory for each data source. In some cases, the lists (of the appropriate data) are simply drawn\/painted (e.g., in response to events such OnPaint, OnInvalidate, etc.). The lists (or, list boxes) may be resizable (e.g., new items may be added, exiting items may be deleted, etc.) or otherwise alterable in some implementations. New lists may also be added or existing lists may be removed from the widget in certain cases. According to an embodiment of the present invention, items (e.g., stored in one data source, etc.) may have attributes (or, tags, classes, categories, etc.) associated with them, and a set of lists may be created (e.g., either at the time of application startup or at the time of widget creation\/initialization\/configuration, etc.) based on the items' attributes. For example, one list  may contain items with the last modified date in the year 2004, and another list  may contain items with the last modified date in the year 2005, etc. According to an embodiment of the present invention, a graphical user interface widget is (visually) constructed from these elements or building blocks , , , and .","In a typical implementation, GUI widgets are part of an operating system (or a virtual machine) or an application framework, or they are provided as part of a (GUI) library (either statically or dynamically linked, etc.).

According to this exemplary diagram, the user  interacts with the system shown on the right-hand side of the figure. The exemplary system comprises an operating system  and an application framework . In this illustration, the GUI widget  is included in the application framework . The user typically interacts with an application (not shown in the figure), which may be built within (or, on top of) the application framework  and configured to run on a particular operating system  (or, a virtual machine, etc). The application may implement its own multi-list combo-box controls according to a certain embodiment of the present invention, or it may utilize pre-implemented widgets, for example, provided in the application framework . In this diagram, the relevant data (items in one or more lists, the selected item, other visual configuration, etc.) is stored in a persistent data source . The list data may be dynamically built in memory (e.g., based on a certain preset algorithm and\/or using other input data, etc.). In some cases, the data source (or, content of the widget) may be associated with a particular application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 9"]},"As shown in , the exemplary data processing system includes at least one bus  which is coupled to a microprocessor(s)  and a memory  such as a ROM (read only memory) or a volatile RAM (random access memory) and a non-volatile storage device(s) .

Typically, the I\/O devices  and  are coupled to the system through I\/O controllers . The volatile RAM  is typically implemented as dynamic RAM (DRAM) which requires power continually in order to refresh or maintain the data in the memory. The mass storage  is typically a magnetic hard drive or a magnetic optical drive or an optical drive or a DVD ROM or other types of memory systems which maintain data (e.g. large amounts of data) even after power is removed from the system. Typically, the mass storage  will also be a random access memory although this is not required. While  shows that the mass storage  is a local device coupled directly to the rest of the components in the data processing system, it will be appreciated that the present invention may utilize a non-volatile memory which is remote from the system, such as a network storage device which is coupled to the data processing system through a network interface  such as a modem or Ethernet interface. The bus  may include one or more buses connected to each other through various bridges, controllers and\/or adapters as is well known in the art. In one embodiment, the I\/O controller  includes a USB (universal serial bus) adapter for controlling USB peripherals and an IEEE 1394 (\u201cfirewire\u201d) controller for IEEE 1394 compliant peripherals.

According to an embodiment of the present invention, two or more lists may be combined (e.g., dynamically) and items from these lists may be presented at the same time. This is illustrated in , where an exemplary multi-list combo-box  is shown according to an embodiment of the present invention. The exemplary widget comprises a button  for displaying\/hiding the list portion and\/or for alternating among different lists. The widget is shown in an open state in the figure with multiple lists displayed at the same time. The illustration shows at least two lists,  and , virtually concatenated into one. In some implementations, concatenation may be toggled (e.g., between displaying one list and displaying more than one list at the same time). The widget  also includes a scroll bar  for scrolling items, or for displaying a portion of the lists. In a certain embodiment, items from one or more lists may be grouped into a \u201cpage\u201d (e.g., comprising multiple lists), and each page may be displayed in the list area when activated, for example, by the button . In some embodiments, all lists may be combined into one and displayed, e.g., in response to a user input (for example, as one of the multiple \u201cstates\u201d, etc.).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["802","804","806","806","810","808","802","812","814","814","814","804","804"],"i":["b","a"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 13","b":["852","852","852","854","856","858","860","860","864","862","862","862","860","854","856","858"],"i":["a","b ","a","b","b","a "]},"In some embodiments of the present invention, lists or items may be \u201cfiltered\u201d based on various criteria. One example is illustrated in , which shows an exemplary graphical user interface window  for setting user preferences according to an embodiment of the present invention. This particular setting may be used for configuring a multi-list combo-box widget in a certain context. For example, when a user is given a choice for selecting a certain movie, the lists may be limited to selected genres in this UI window. According to a certain embodiment, the preference setting UI (e.g., for filtering) may be presented along with a multi-list widget. For example, an additional button may be associated with the widget, which can activate a setup window similar to the one shown in . In some cases, each list may be configured to show\/not show from its list box area, for example, using a \u201cDo Not Show\u201d checkbox, etc.","With reference now to , another exemplary graphical user interface (GUI) component  according to an embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. In this particular example, two lists (e.g., cities from California and cities from Florida, and , respectively) are to be displayed through this GUI control. The exemplary control comprises two separate buttons  and  (e.g., one for California and one for Florida). Activating one button opens\/closes the corresponding list (or, replaces the currently open list, etc.). In , the widget currently displays the California city list , whereas in , the widget currently displays the Florida city list . The buttons have different visual representations depending on the selection. (For example, buttons and are activated in , respectively. The other buttons, e.g., in the top figure and in the bottom figure, are drawn in \u201cnormal\u201d states.) In a certain embodiment of the present invention, for example, as shown in this example, the selected item may be displayed with additional information (e.g., the prefix \u201cCA\u201d in this example) to indicate the list to which the item belongs. If an item Palm Beach is selected, the display on the edit box  may be changed to \u201cFL: Palm Beach\u201d in this particular example.","According to some embodiments of the present invention, hierarchically organized lists (or, hierarchically organized data) may be used with certain multi-list GUI widgets (e.g., categories, subcategories, leaf items, etc.). In the example shown in , a city in the United States may be selected by first selecting a state and then selecting one of the cities in that state.  shows the exemplary widget with the state list according to an embodiment of the present invention. The widget further includes a button  for opening\/closing\/alternating lists, etc. Once a selection is made at a top (or, upper) level (e.g., a category), another list (compatible with the top\/upper level selection, e.g., items in the selected category) is displayed, whose selection may prompt to display another lower level list, etc. In this illustration, California has been selected, and a list of cities in California is displayed in a different widget state as shown in . This state change may be triggered, for example, by the user selecting a different item in the list . Once a selection is completed (e.g., in multiple levels), the list part may be closed. Selecting an Internet host\/domain name is another example which can be implemented in a user-friendly way using a hierarchically organized multi-list combo box. For example, a user can select the top level domain first (e.g., .com, .net, etc.), which triggers displaying the second level (e.g., abc.com, cnn.com, Yahoo.com, etc. if.com has been selected), and so forth.","Accordingly, methods and apparatuses of operating a graphical user interface for a data processing system, in particular, a combo-box widget with multiple selection lists, have been provided.
