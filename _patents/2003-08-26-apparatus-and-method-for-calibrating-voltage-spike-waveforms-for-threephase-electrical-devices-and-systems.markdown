This problem is exacerbated when these electrical devices are integrated with devices configured in accordance with military specifications such as onboard electronics on a submarine or other naval vessels. Vendors typically do not perform tests or evaluations on the compatibility and survivability characteristics of COTS electrical devices. Typical current methodologies and schemes for testing electrical devices and voltage spike suppression are described in Peterson U.S. Pat. No. 4,307,342, Grace et al. U.S. Pat.
