No. 11\/283,406 filed Nov. 17, 2005, which is a continuation-in-part of PCT\/US05\/016340 filed May 9, 2005 and PCT\/US05\/016344 filed May 9, 2005; both of which claim priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/569,292 filed May 7, 2004, and to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/663,333 filed Mar. 18, 2005, the entire contents of all of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","An autoimmune disease results from an inappropriate immune response directed against a self antigen (an autoantigen), which is a deviation from the normal state of self-tolerance. Self-tolerance arises when the production of T cells and B cells capable of reacting against autoantigens has been prevented by events that occur in the early development of the immune system. The cell surface proteins that play a central role in regulation of immune responses through their ability to bind and present processed peptides to T cells are the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules (Rothbard, J. B., et al., 19919:527). Autoimmune diseases include rheumatoid arthritis (RA), multiple sclerosis (MS), human type I or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), autoimmune uveitis, primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and celiac disease.","One target for inhibition of an autoimmune response is the set of lymphocyte surface protein MHC molecules, particularly a protein encoded by an MHC class II gene, for example, HLA-DR, -DQ and -DP. Each of the MHC genes is found in a large number of alternative or allelic forms within a mammalian population. The genomes of subjects affected with certain autoimmune diseases, for example MS and RA, are more likely to carry one or more characteristic MHC class II alleles, to which that disease is linked.","A number of therapeutic agents have been developed to treat autoimmune diseases, including general anti-inflammatory drugs such as COX-2 inhibitors, i.e., agents that can prevent formation of low molecular weight inflammatory compounds by inhibiting a cyclooxygenase; agents that can function by inhibiting a protein mediator of inflammation, for example, by sequestering the inflammatory protein tumor necrosis factor (TNF) with an anti-TNF specific monoclonal antibody or antibody fragment, or with a soluble form of the TNF receptor; and agents that target a protein on the surface of a T cell and generally prevent interaction with an antigen presenting cell (APC) by inhibiting the CD4 receptor or the cell adhesion receptor ICAM-1. However, compositions having natural folded proteins as therapeutic agents can encounter problems in production, formulation, storage, and delivery. Several of these problems necessitate delivery to the patient in a hospital setting.","An agent that interacts and binds relatively nonspecifically to several MHC class II molecules is Copolymer 1 (Cop 1), a synthetic amino acid heteropolymer that was shown to be capable of suppressing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE; Sela, M. et al., 1990, Bull. Inst. Pasteur (Paris)), which can be induced in the mouse and is a model for MS. Copolymer 1, which is poly(Y,E,A,K) also known as glatiramer acetate or \u201cYEAK\u201d using the one letter amino acid code (see infra; Y represents tyrosine, E glutamic acid, A alanine, and K lysine), has been used to treat relapsing forms of MS but does not suppress the disease entirely (Bornstein, M. B., et al., 1987317:408; Johnson, K. P. et al., 199545:1268).","Although random copolymers may be effective for the treatment of autoimmune diseases (Simpson, D. et al., 200317(3):207-10), their repeated administration may cause undesired side effects. Accordingly, there is a need for improved methods for the treatment of autoimmune diseases with random copolymers which result in fewer side effects.","The invention provides methods and kits for the treatment or prevention of disease in a subject, preferably in a human. One aspect of the invention provides methods of treating or preventing a disease, the method comprising administering to said subject a dosing regimen of an effective amount of a random copolymer for the amelioration of a disease treatable with the random copolymer, said effective amount delivered to said subject at time intervals greater than 24 hours, 36 hours, or more preferably greater than 48 hours. A related aspect of the invention provides a method for the treatment of a subject in need thereof, comprising administering to said subject a dosing regimen of an effective amount of a random copolymer for the amelioration of a disease treatable with the random copolymer, said effective amount delivered to the subject using a sustained-release formulation which administers the random copolymer over a period of at least 2 days, at least 4 days, or at least 6 days, wherein the effective amount is an amount that is effective if delivered daily. In some embodiments, the disease of the methods of the present invention is mediated by T-cells, and in particular T1 cells or cells with T1 immune posture, or is a disease which is exacerbated by an excess of inflammatory cytokines.

Non-limiting examples of such proteolytic and\/or recombinant fragments include Fab, F(ab\u2032)2, Fab\u2032, Fv, and single chain antibodies (scFv) containing a V[L] and\/or V[H] domain joined by a peptide linker. The scFv's may be covalently or non-covalently linked to form antibodies having two or more binding sites. The term antibody also includes polyclonal, monoclonal, or other purified preparations of antibodies and recombinant antibodies.","The term \u201ccentral tolerance\u201d means tolerance for an antigen controlled by the events in the thymus, namely the clonal deletion of T cells reactive to the antigen in the thymus gland. Partially activated T cells with high affinity receptors for the antigen undergo negative selection and clonal deletion in the thymus by Fas-mediated apoptosis, triggered by coexpression and binding of FasL to Fas on the cell surface. In contrast, the term \u201cperipheral tolerance\u201d means deletion of T cells by activation-induced cell death (AICD) and functional silencing (clonal energy) of T cells without clonal deletion in the spleen. Also, when lacking the cooperation of helper T cells, B cells are presumably \u201chelpless\u201d to respond to T cell dependent antigens. The modulation of central and peripheral tolerance is regulated by phosphorylation of p56and ZAP-70. The status and the degree of phosphorylation of key residues of these proteins result in up or down regulation of signaling molecules that influence the peripheral and central tolerance. Inhibition of T cell receptor signaling also plays a role in inducing tolerance.","Other technical terms used herein have their ordinary meaning in the art that they are used, as exemplified by a variety of technical dictionaries.","The composition of a random copolymer of the instant invention comprises the characteristics of a compilation of a multiplicity of cross-reactive T cell epitopes.

There are at least three types of Class II MHC molecules: HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DP molecules. There are also numerous alleles encoding each type of these HLA molecules. The Class II MHC molecules are expressed predominantly on the surfaces of B lymphocytes and antigen presenting cells such as macrophages. Any available method can be used to ascertain whether the copolymer binds to one or more MHC class II proteins. For example, the polypeptide can be labeled with a reporter molecule (such as a radionuclide or biotin), mixed with a crude or pure preparation of MHC class II protein and binding is detected if the reporter molecule adheres to the MHC class II protein after removal of the unbound polypeptide.","In another embodiment, the copolymers used in the methods described herein are capable of binding to an MHC class II protein associated with multiple sclerosis. A polypeptide of this embodiment can have similar or greater affinity for the antigen binding groove of an MHC class II protein associated with multiple sclerosis than does Copolymer 1. Hence, the contemplated polypeptide can inhibit binding of or displace the binding of myelin autoantigens from the MHC class II protein. One MHC class II protein associated with multiple sclerosis is HLA-DR4 (DRB1*1501).","In another embodiment, the random copolymers used in the methods described herein are capable of binding to an MHC class II protein associated with an arthritic condition, for example, rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis. A random copolymer of this embodiment can have a greater affinity for the antigen binding groove of an MHC class II protein associated with the autoimmune disease than does a type II collagen 261-273 peptide. Hence, the contemplated Copolymer 1 or a random copolymer described herein such as YFAK can inhibit binding of or displace the type II collagen 261-273 peptide from the antigen binding groove of an MHC class II protein. The Class II MHC protein consists of approximately equal-sized alpha and beta subunits, both of which are transmembrane proteins. A peptide-binding cleft is formed by parts of the amino termini of both \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits. This peptide-binding cleft is the site of presentation of the antigen to T cells.","In other embodiments, the random copolymers used in the invention can bind to the peptide binding groove of the HLA-DR molecules. As binding motifs of Cop 1 to MS-associated HLA-DR molecules are known (Fridkis-Hareli et al, 1999162(8):4697-704), polypeptides of fixed sequence can readily be prepared and tested for binding to the peptide binding groove of the HLA-DR molecules as described in Fridkis-Hareli.

For example, the terpolymers can be made under condensation conditions using the desired molar ratio of amino acids in solution, or by solid phase synthetic procedures. Condensation conditions include the proper temperature, pH, and solvent conditions for condensing the carboxyl group of one amino acid with the amino group of another amino acid to form a peptide bond. Condensing agents, for example dicyclohexyl-carbodiimide, can be used to facilitate the formation of the peptide bond. Blocking groups can be used to protect functional groups, such as the side chain moieties and some of the amino or carboxyl groups against undesired side reactions.","For example, the process disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,849,550, can be used wherein the N-carboxyanhydrides of tyrosine, alanine, \u03b3-benzyl glutamate and N-\u03b5-trifluoroacetyl-lysine are polymerized at ambient temperatures in anhydrous dioxane with diethylamine as an initiator. The \u03b3-carboxyl group of the glutamic acid can be deblocked by hydrogen bromide in glacial acetic acid. The trifluoroacetyl groups are removed from lysine by 1 molar piperidine. One of skill in the art readily understands that the process can be adjusted to make peptides and polypeptides containing the desired amino acids, that is, three of the four amino acids in Copolymer 1, by selectively eliminating the reactions that relate to any one of glutamic acid, alanine, tyrosine, or lysine. For purposes of this application, the terms \u201cambient temperature\u201d and \u201croom temperature\u201d mean a temperature ranging from about 20 to about 26\u00b0 C.","A preferred synthesis method of the random copolymers of the present invention is by solid phase synthesis. The synthesis is done in multiple steps by the Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) approach using Fmoc protected amino acids. SPPS is based on sequential addition of protected amino acid derivatives, with side chain protection where appropriate, to a polymeric support (bead). The base-labile Fmoc group is used for N-protection. After removing the protecting group (via piperidine hydrolysis) the next amino acid mixture is added using a coupling reagent (TBTU). After the final amino acid is coupled, the N-terminus is acetylated.","The resulting peptide (attached to the polymeric support through its C-terminus) is cleaved with TFA to yield the crude peptide. During this cleavage step, all of the side chains protecting groups are also cleaved. After precipitation with diisopropyl ether, the solid is filtered and dried. The resulting peptide is analyzed and stored at 2-8\u00b0 C.","Example of Solid Phase Synthesis","The random copolymer YFAK consisting of L-alanine, L-lysine, L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine is prepared in its protected form on Wang resin.

To adjust the molecular weight during polypeptide synthesis, the synthetic conditions or the amounts of amino acids are adjusted so that synthesis stops when the polypeptide reaches the approximate length which is desired. After synthesis, polypeptides with the desired molecular weight can be obtained by any available size selection procedure, such as chromatography of the polypeptides on a molecular weight sizing column or gel, and collection of the molecular weight ranges desired. The present polypeptides can also be partially hydrolyzed to remove high molecular weight species, for example, by acid or enzymatic hydrolysis, and then purified to remove the acid or enzymes.","In one embodiment, the random copolymers with a desired molecular weight may be prepared by a process which includes reacting a protected polypeptide with hydrobromic acid to form a trifluoroacetyl-polypeptide having the desired molecular weight profile.

During the test reaction, the time and temperature are varied and the molecular weight range of a given batch of test polypeptides is determined.

In a specific preferred embodiment, the disease treated by the present method is relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.","Clinical symptoms of MS include sensory loss (paresthesias), motor (muscle cramping secondary to spasticity) and autonomic (bladder, bowel, sexual dysfunction) spinal cord symptoms; cerebellar symptoms (e.g., Charcot triad of dysarthna, ataxia, tremor); fatigue and dizziness; impairment in information processing on neuropsychological testing; eye symptoms, including diplopia on lateral gaze; trigeminal neuralgia; and optic neuritis.","The autoantigen in MS most likely is one of several myelin proteins (e.g, proteolipid protein (PLP); myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG); myelin basic protein (MBP); myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), myelin-associated oligodendrocytic basic protein (MBOP); citrulline-modified MBP (the C8 isoform of MBP in which 6 arginines have been de-aminated to citrulline), cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (CNPase), alpha-B crystalline, etc.) The integral membrane protein PLP is a dominant autoantigen of myelin. Microglial cells and macrophages perform jointly as antigen-presenting cells, resulting in activation of cytokines, complement, and other modulators of the inflammatory process, targeting specific oligodendroglia cells and their membrane myelin. A quantitative increase in myelin-autoreactive T1 cells with the capacity to secrete IFN-\u03b3 is associated with the pathogenesis of MS and EAE, suggesting that autoimmune inducer\/helper T lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of MS patients may initiate and\/or regulate the demyelination process in patients with MS. On the other hand, there is an extended literature on the protective role of T2 cells producing anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-10. The shift of balance from T1 to T2 type of cells is expected to be beneficial to the prevention and treatment of MS and EAE.","In another embodiment, the disease treated by the methods provided herein is Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus. Human type I or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is characterized by autoimmune destruction of the cells in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. The depletion of \u03b2-cells results in an inability to regulate levels of glucose in the blood. Overt diabetes occurs when the level of glucose in the blood rises above a specific level, usually about 250 mg\/dl. In humans a long pre-symptomatic period precedes the onset of diabetes. During this period there is a gradual loss of pancreatic beta cell function. The development of disease is implicated by the presence of autoantibodies against insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase, and the tyrosine phosphatase IA2 (IA2), each an example of a self-protein, -polypeptide or -peptide according to this invention. Human IDDM is currently treated by monitoring blood glucose levels to guide injection, or pump-based delivery, of recombinant insulin. Diet and exercise regimens contribute to achieving adequate blood glucose control.","Markers that may be evaluated during the pre-symptomatic stage are the presence of insulitis in the pancreas, the level and frequency of islet cell antibodies, islet cell surface antibodies, aberrant expression of Class II MHC molecules on pancreatic beta cells, glucose concentration in the blood, and the plasma concentration of insulin. An increase in the number of T lymphocytes in the pancreas, islet cell antibodies and blood glucose is indicative of the disease, as is a decrease in insulin concentration.","The presence of combinations of autoantibodies with various specificities in serum is highly sensitive and specific for human type I diabetes mellitus. For example, the presence of autoantibodies against GAD and\/or IA-2 is approximately 98% sensitive and 99% specific for identifying type I diabetes mellitus from control serum. In non-diabetic first degree relatives of type I diabetes patients, the presence of autoantibodies specific for two of the three autoantigens including GAD, insulin and IA-2 conveys a positive predictive value of >90% for development of type I DM within 5 years.","In another embodiment, the disease treated by the methods provided herein is autoimmune uveitis. Autoimmune uveitis is an autoimmune disease of the eye that is estimated to affect 400,000 people, with an incidence of 43,000 new cases per year in the U.S. Autoimmune uveitis is currently treated with steroids, immunosuppressive agents such as methotrexate and cyclosporin, intravenous immunoglobulin, and TNF\u03b1-antagonists.","In another embodiment, the disease treated by the methods provided herein is experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU). EAU is a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease that targets neural retina, uvea, and related tissues in the eye. EAU shares many clinical and immunological features with human autoimmune uveitis, and is induced by peripheral administration of uveitogenic peptide emulsified in Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA).","In another embodiment, the disease treated by the methods provided herein is primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). PBC is an organ-specific autoimmune disease that predominantly affects women between 40-60 years of age. The prevalence reported among this group approaches 1 per 1,000. PBC is characterized by progressive destruction of intrahepatic biliary epithelial cells (IBEC) lining the small intrahepatic bile ducts. This leads to obstruction and interference with bile secretion, causing eventual cirrhosis. Association with other autoimmune diseases characterized by epithelium lining\/secretory system damage has been reported, including Sjogren's Syndrome, CREST Syndrome, autoimmune thyroid disease and rheumatoid arthritis.","In another embodiment, the disease treated by the methods provided herein is celiac disease, also known as celiac sprue or gluten-sensitive enteropathy. Celiac disease is a disease that results from defective gastrointestinal absorption due to hypersensitivity to cereal grain storage proteins, including glutens or its product gliadin and glutenin, present in wheat, barley, and oats. The disease is caused by CD4 T cells that recognize gliadin as dietary antigen and these cells induce a Th1-mediated chronic inflammatory response. Symptoms include diarrhea, weight loss, and steatorrhea, villous atrophy and malabsorption are seen. It may also be associated with dermatitis herpetiforms, a vesicular skin eruption. Celiac disease is associated with alleles DQB1*0302 and DQB1*0201 combined with DQA1*0301 and DQA1*0501.95% of patients carry either DQB1*0201 or DQB1*0302. The strong HLA association is believed to be due to the capacity of DQ molecules encoded by DQB1*0201, DQA1*0501, DQB1*0302 and DQA1*0301 to efficiently present deaminated variants of glutamine-rich peptides derived from gliadin and glutenin.","In another embodiment, the method for treating an autoimmune disease in a subject further involves inhibiting the proliferation or function of T cells which are responsive to an autoantigen. The pathological process of autoimmune diseases and immune rejection is mediated by T cells. Upon binding to and recognition of an antigen, T cells proliferate, secrete cytokines and recruit additional inflammatory and cytotoxic cells to the site.","In yet another embodiment, the methods described herein for treating an autoimmune disease in a subject involve binding the random copolymer to a major histocompatibility complex class II protein which is associated with an autoimmune disease. The Class II MHC proteins are expressed predominantly on the surfaces of B lymphocytes and antigen presenting cells such as macrophages. These Class II MHC proteins have a peptide-binding cleft which is the site at which antigenic peptides are presented to T cells. When the present random copolymers bind to a major histocompatibility complex class II protein, those random copolymers can block or otherwise interfere with antigen presentation and\/or T cell activation.","In one embodiment, the disease treated by the methods of the present invention is host-versus-graft disease (HVGD) or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Transplantation systems such as organ transplantations and bone marrow reconstitution have become important and effective therapies for many life threatening diseases. However, immune rejection is still the major barrier for successful transplantation. This is manifested in functional deterioration and graft rejection in the case of organ transplantation (host-versus-graft disease, or HVGD. Another manifestation of pathological immune reactivity is GVHD that occurs in approximately 30% of bone marrow recipients. Up to half of those patients who develop GVHD may succumb to this process. This high morbidity and mortality has led to continuous interest in the possibility of controlling or preventing GVHD. Clinicopathologically, two forms of GVHD have been recognized Acute GVHD develops within the first 3 months after bone marrow transplantation and features disorders of skin, liver and gastrointestinal tract. Chronic GVHD is a multi-organ autoimmune-like disease emerging from 3 months up to 3 years post-transplantation and shares features common to naturally occurring autoimmune disorders, like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and scleroderma. The methods described herein may be used to treat both acute and chronic GVHD.","In a specific embodiment of the methods described herein, Copolymer 1 or YFAK random copolymer may be used for prevention and treatment of GVHD in all cases of organ transplantation that develop GVHD, but particularly in fetal thymus, and more particularly, in allogeneic bone marrow, transplantation. To a patient under suitable conditioning regimen, the GLAT copolymer may be administered in a treatment regimen from day-2 prior to the transplantation day, and then for another 60-100, at least 60 days, after the transplantation day. A regimen of such duration may comprise administrations of the random copolymer at intervals greater than 24, 30, 36, 42, or 48 hours. Other immunosuppressive drugs, such as cyclosporine, methotrexate and prednisone, may be administered with the Copolymer 1 copolymer.","The method of the invention may also be applied to the prevention and treatment of GVHD in the course of bone marrow transplantation in patients suffering from diseases curable by bone marrow transplantation, including leukemias, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL), acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) and chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML), severe combined immunodeficiency syndromes (SCID), osteopetrosis, aplastic anemia, Gaucher's disease, thalassemia and other congenital or genetically-determined hematopoietic or metabolic abnormalities.","In another embodiment, the methods of the present invention may be applied to promote nerve regeneration or to prevent or inhibit secondary degeneration which may otherwise follow primary nervous system injury, e.g., closed head injuries and blunt trauma, such as those caused by participation in dangerous sports, penetrating trauma, such as gunshot wounds, hemorrhagic stroke, ischemic stroke, glaucoma, cerebral ischemia, or damages caused by surgery such as tumor excision. In addition, such compositions may be used to ameliorate the effects of disease that result in a degenerative process, e.g., degeneration occurring in either gray or white matter (or both) as a result of various diseases or disorders, including, without limitation: diabetic neuropathy, senile dementias, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's Disease, facial nerve (Bell's) palsy, glaucoma, Huntington's chorea, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), status epilepticus, non-arteritic optic neuropathy, intervertebral disc herniation, vitamin deficiency, prion diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, carpal tunnel syndrome, peripheral neuropathies associated with various diseases, including but not limited to, uremia, porphyria, hypoglycemia, Sjogren Larsson syndrome, acute sensory neuropathy, chronic ataxic neuropathy, biliary cirrhosis, primary amyloidosis, obstructive lung diseases, acromegaly, malabsorption syndromes, polycythemia vera, IgA and IgG gammapathies, complications of various drugs (e.g., metronidazole) and toxins (e.g., alcohol or organophosphates), Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, ataxia telangectasia, Friedreich's ataxia, amyloid polyneuropathies, adrenomyeloneuropathy, Giant axonal neuropathy, Refsum's disease, Fabry's disease, lipoproteinemia, etc. In addition, other clinical conditions that may be treated through the administration of a random copolymer in accordance with the present invention include epilepsy, amnesia, anxiety, hyperalgesia, psychosis, seizures, abnormally elevated intraocular pressure, oxidative stress, and opiate tolerance and dependence.","In a specific embodiments, the disease treated by the methods described herein comprises multiple sclerosis, type-I diabetes, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), gastritis, autoimmune hepatitis, hemolytic anemia, autoimmune hemophilia, autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS), autoimmune uveoretinitis, glomerulonephritis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, psoriasis, myasthenia gravis, autoimmune encephalomyelitis, Goodpasture's syndrome, Grave's disease, paraneoplastic pemphigus, autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura, scleroderma with anti-collagen antibodies, mixed connective tissue disease, pernicious anemia, polymyositis, idiopathic Addison's disease, autoimmune-associated infertility, bullous pemphigoid, Sjogren's syndrome, idiopathic myxedema or colitis. In some embodiments, the subject is afflicted with more than one disease.","The random copolymers of the present invention may be administered to the subject as a composition which comprises a pharmaceutically effective amount of copolymer and an acceptable carrier and\/or excipients. A pharmaceutically acceptable carrier includes any solvents, dispersion media, or coatings that are physiologically compatible. Preferably, the carrier is suitable for intravenous, intramuscular, oral, intraperitoneal, intradermal, transdermal, topical, or subcutaneous administration. One exemplary pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is physiological saline. Other pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and their formulations are well-known and generally described in, for example, (18Ed., ed. Gennaro, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1990). Various pharmaceutically acceptable excipients are well-known in the art and can be found in, for example, (4ed., Ed. Rowe et al. Pharmaceutical Press, Washington, D.C.). The composition can be formulated as a solution, microemulsion, liposome, capsule, tablet, or other suitable forms. The active component which comprises the copolymer may be coated in a material to protect it from inactivation by the environment prior to reaching the target site of action. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are preferably sterile and non-pyrogenic at the time of delivery, and are preferably stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage.","In other embodiments of the present invention, the pharmaceutical compositions are regulated-release formulations. Copolymers of the present invention may be admixed with biologically compatible polymers or matrices which control the release rate of the copolymers into the immediate environment. Controlled or sustained release compositions include formulation in lipophilic depots (e.g., fatty acids, waxes, oils).","In some embodiments of the present invention, pharmaceutical compositions comprise random copolymers formulated with oil and emulsifier to form water-in-oil microparticles and\/or emulsions. The oil may be any non-toxic hydrophobic material liquid at ambient temperature to about body temperature, such as edible vegetable oils including safflower oil, soybean oil, corn oil, and canola oil; or mineral oil. Chemically defined oil substance such as lauryl glycol may also be used. The emulsifier useful for this embodiment includes Span 20 (sorbitan monolaurate) and phosphatidylcholine. In some embodiments, a random copolymer composition is prepared as an aqueous solution and is prepared into an water-in-oil emulsion dispersed in 95 to 65% oil such as mineral oil, and 5 to 35% emulsifier such as Span 20. In another embodiment of the invention, the emulsion is formed with alum rather than with oil and emulsifier. These emulsions and microparticles reduce the speed of uptake of random copolymer, and achieve controlled antigen delivery.","In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions also include additional therapeutically active agents. Such additional ingredient can be at least an additional random copolymer, such as a Copolymer 1 (YEAK, Copaxone\u2122) that binds to a different HLA molecule, an antibody which binds to an unwanted inflammatory molecule or cytokine such as interleukin-6, interleukin-8, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1; an enzyme inhibitor such as a protease inhibitor aprotinin or a cyclooxygenase inhibitor; an antibiotic such as amoxicillin, rifampicin, erythromycin; an antiviral agent such as acyclovir; a steroidal anti-inflammatory such as a glucocorticoid; a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or acetaminophen; or a non-inflammatory cytokine such as interleukin-4 or interleukin-10. Other cytokines and growth factors such as interferon-\u03b2, tumor necrosis factors, antiangiogenic factors, erythropoietins, thrombopoietins, interleukins, maturation factors, chemotactic protein, and their variants and derivatives that retain similar physiological activities may also be used as an additional ingredient.","In some embodiments, the additional active therapeutically active agent is selected from the group consisting of anti-psoriasis creams, eye drops, nose drops, Sulfasalazine, glucocorticoids, propylthiouracil, methimazole, I, insulin, IFN-\u03b21a, IFN-\u03b21b, glucocorticoids, ACTH, avonex, azathiopurine, cyclophosphamide, UV-B, PUVA, methotrexate, calcipitriol, cyclophosphamide, OKT3, FK-506, cyclosporin A, azathioprine, and mycophenolate mofetil.","Copolymers of the invention may also be used in combination with anti-obesity drugs. Anti-obesity drugs include P-3 agonists, CB-1 antagonists, appetite suppressants, such as, for example, sibutramine (Meridia), and lipase inhibitors, such as, for example, orlistat (Xenical). The subject copolymers may also be used in methods of the invention in combination with drugs commonly used to treat lipid disorders in diabetic patients. Such drugs include, but are not limited to, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, nicotinic acid, bile acid sequestrants, and fibric acid derivatives. Polypeptides of the invention may also be used in combination with anti-hypertensive drugs, such as, for example, \u03b2-blockers, cathepsin S inhibitors and ACE inhibitors. Examples of \u03b2-blockers are: acebutolol, bisoprolol, esmolol, propanolol, atenolol, labetalol, carvedilol, and metoprolol. Examples of ACE inhibitors are: captopril, enalapril, lisinopril, benazepril, fosinopril, ramipril, quinapril, perindopril, trandolapril, and moexipril.","The invention further provides a kit comprising (i) a composition comprising a random copolymer and (ii) instructions for administering the composition to a subject in need thereof at intervals greater than 24 hours, more preferably greater than 36 hours, for the treatment of a disease, such as an autoimmune disease. In one embodiment, the autoimmune disorder is multiple sclerosis. In a preferred embodiment, the random copolymer is Copolymer 1. In another preferred embodiment, the random copolymer is formulated in dosages for administration of greater than about 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, 72, 78, 84, 90, 96, 102, 108, 114, 120, 126, 132, 138, 144, 150, 156, 162, 168, 174, 180, 186, 192, 198, 204, 210, 216, 222, 228, 234, or 240 hours, or any intervening interval thereof. In another embodiment of the kits described herein, the instructions indicate that the random polymer is to be administered every about 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, 72, 78, 84, 90, 96, 102, 108, 114, 120, 126, 132, 138, 144, 150, 156, 162, 168, 174, 180, 186, 192, 198, 204, 210, 216, 222, 228, 234, or 240 hours, or any interval in between. Kits may comprise additional components, such as packaging and one or more apparatuses for the administration of the copolymer, such as a hypodermic syringe.","In a specific embodiment, the autoimmune disease is selected from the group consisting of multiple sclerosis, type-I diabetes, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), gastritis, autoimmune hepatitis, hemolytic anemia, autoimmune hemophilia, autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS), autoimmune uveoretinitis, glomerulonephritis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, psoriasis, myasthenia gravis, autoimmune encephalomyelitis, Goodpasture's syndrome, Grave's disease, paraneoplastic pemphigus, autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura, scleroderma with anti-collagen antibodies, mixed connective tissue disease, pernicious anemia, polymyositis, idiopathic Addison's disease, autoimmune-associated infertility, bullous pemphigoid, Sjogren's syndrome, idiopathic myxedema and colitis.","One aspect of the present invention provides novel methods to treat a subject afflicted with or suspected of being afflicted with a disease, such as an autoimmune disease, by administering one or more random copolymers to the subject in a therapeutically effective amount. In particular, subcutaneous administration of a pharmaceutical composition comprising a random copolymer composition is contemplated as a preferred embodiment of the invention. Subcutaneous injection induces more desired immune responses biased for T2 response, which is the basis for the tolerance for certain antigens.","In general, the methods of treatment of the present invention, which is immunomodulation of the subject in need of such treatment, can be differentiated from vaccination. Successful vaccination is dependent on the immunogenicity of the vaccine being administered, which increases the titer of antibodies directly reactive to the antigens in the vaccine. In contrast, the random copolymers of the present invention are effective in treating diseases without inducing a high titer of antibodies against the copolymers themselves. As demonstrated by the Examples below, the effectiveness of the methods of the present invention does not depend on the antibody production against the copolymers, and therefore is fundamentally different from vaccination. Unlike vaccination, random copolymers of the present invention, administered by the methods of the invention, induces tolerance toward the disease-related antigens, and more specifically, induces peripheral tolerance. Peripheral tolerance, in contract to central tolerance, has the advantage of being safer as a modulatory phenomenon. Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention is embodied in a method of administration of a composition comprising a random copolymer of the invention so as to induce peripheral tolerance toward the random copolymer and the disease related antigens.","In general, an embodiment of the invention is to administer a suitable dose of a therapeutic copolymer composition that will be the lowest effective dose to produce a therapeutic effect, for example, mitigating symptoms. The therapeutic copolymers are preferably administered at a dose per subject, which corresponds to a dose per day of at least about 2 mg, at least about 5 mg, at least about 10 mg, or at least about 20 mg as appropriate minimal starting dosages, or about x mg, wherein x is an integer between 1 and 20. In one embodiment of the methods described herein, a dose of about 0.01 to about 500 mg\/kg can be administered. In general, the effective dosage of the compound of the present invention is about 50 to about 400 micrograms of the compound per kilogram of the subject per day. In one specific embodiment, the equivalent dosage per day, regardless of the frequency with which the doses are administered, is from about 5 to 100, or more preferably, from about 10 to 40, or more preferably about 20 mg\/day. In another specific embodiment, each individual dosage in the treatment regimen is from about 5 to 100, or more preferably from about 10 to 40, or more preferably about 20 mg\/dose.","However, it is understood by one skilled in the art that the dose of the composition of the invention will vary depending on the subject and upon the particular route of administration used. It is routine in the art to adjust the dosage to suit the individual subjects. Additionally, the effective amount may be based upon, among other things, the size of the compound, the biodegradability of the compound, the bioactivity of the compound and the bioavailability of the compound. If the compound does not degrade quickly, is bioavailable and highly active, a smaller amount will be required to be effective. The actual dosage suitable for a subject can easily be determined as a routine practice by one skilled in the art, for example a physician or a veterinarian given a general starting point. For example, the physician or veterinarian could start doses of the compound of the invention employed in the pharmaceutical composition at a level lower than that required in order to achieve the desired therapeutic effect, and increase the dosage with time until the desired effect is achieved. A physician or veterinarian may also refer to the recommendations for the administration of Copaxone\u2122 as a general starting point.","In the context of the invention, the term \u201ctreatment regimen\u201d is meant to encompass therapeutic, palliative and prophylactic modalities of administration of one or more compositions comprising one or more random copolymers. A particular treatment regimen may last for a period of time which will vary depending upon the nature of the particular disease or disorder, its severity and the overall condition of the patient, and may extend from once daily, or more preferably once every 36 hours or 48 hours or longer, to once every month or several months. Following treatment, the patient is monitored for changes in his\/her condition and for alleviation of the symptoms of the disorder or disease state. The dosage of the oligonucleotide may either be increased in the event the patient does not respond significantly to current dosage levels, or the dose may be decreased if an alleviation of the symptoms of the disorder or disease state is observed, or if the disorder or disease state has been ablated, or if an unacceptable side effects are seen with the starting dosage.","In one embodiment, a therapeutically effective amount of the random copolymer is administered to the subject in a treatment regimen comprising intervals of at least 36 hours, or more preferably 48 hours, between dosages. In another embodiment, the random copolymer is administered at intervals of at least 54, 60, 66, 72, 78, 84, 90, 96, 102, 108, 114, 120, 126, 132, 138, 144, 150, 156, 162, 168, 174, 180, 186, 192, 198, 204, 210, 216, 222, 228, 234, or 240 hours, or the equivalent amount of days. In some embodiments, the agent is administered every other day, while in other embodiments it is administered weekly. If two copolymers are administered to the subject, such copolymers may be administered at the same time, such as simultaneously, or essentially at the same time, such as in succession. Alternatively, their administration may be staggered. For example, two copolymers which are each administered every 48 hours may both be administered on the same days, or one may be administered one day and the other on the next day and so on in an alternating fashion.","As shown by the Examples below, treatment regimens with longer dosing intervals, consequently often with lower total exposure of copolymers, induce lower titers of antibodies against copolymers themselves, while still inducing desired protective effects. Such reduction of neutralizing antibodies are desirable because it is considered likely to help random copolymer compositions to retain its effectiveness without being neutralized, and it is associated with reduced risk of anaphylactic shocks, providing safer treatments of diseases. Longer interval regimens are also desirable because they strengthen the bias for T2 responses, which is considered to be the mode of action for the random copolymer therapies.","In other embodiments, the random copolymer is administered in a treatment regimen which comprises at least one uneven time interval, wherein at least one of the time intervals is at least 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, 72, 78, 84, 90, 96, 102, 108, 114, 120, 126, 132, 138, 144, 150, 156, 162, 168, 174, 180, 186, 192, 198, 204, 210, 216, 222, 228, 234, or 240 hours, or the equivalent amount of days.","In one embodiment, the polymer is administered to be subject at least three times during a treatment regimen, such that there are at least two time intervals between administrations. These intervals may be denoted Iand I. If the polymer is administered four times, then there would be an additional interval between the third and fourth administrations, I, such that the number of intervals for a given number \u201cn\u201d of administrations is n\u22121. Accordingly, in one embodiment, at least one of the time intervals between administrations is greater than about 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, 72, 78, 84, 90, 96, 102, 108, 114, 120, 126, 132, 138, 144, 150, 156, 162, 168, 174, 180, 186, 192, 198, 204, 210, 216, 222, 228, 234, or 240 hours. In another embodiment, at least 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or 95% of the total number n\u22121 of time intervals are at least about 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, 72, 78, 84, 90, 96, 102, 108, 114, 120, 126, 132, 138, 144, 150, 156, 162, 168, 174, 180, 186, 192, 198, 204, 210, 216, 222, 228, 234, or 240 hours.","In yet another embodiment, the average time interval between administrations ((I+I+ . . . +I)\/n\u22121) is at least 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, 72, 78, 84, 90, 96, 102, 108, 114, 120, 126, 132, 138, 144, 150, 156, 162, 168, 174, 180, 186, 192, 198, 204, 210, 216, 222, 228, 234, or 240 hours, or at least two weeks.","In another embodiment, the dosage regimen consists of two or more different interval sets. For example, a first part of the dosage regimen is administered to a subject daily, every other day, or every third day, for example, at about 22 mg copolymer\/mbody surface area of the subject, wherein the subject is a human. In some embodiment of the invention, the dosing regimen starts with dosing the subject every other day, every third day, weekly, biweekly, or monthly. The dosage for administration every other day or every third day may be up to about 65 mg\/mand 110 mg\/mrespectively. For a dosing regimen comprising dosing of the random copolymer every week, the dose comprises up to about 500 mg\/m, and for a dosing regimen comprising dosing of the random copolymer every two weeks or every month, up to 1.5 g\/mmay be administered. The first part of the dosing regimen may be administered for up to 30 days, for example, 7, 14, 21, or 30 days. A subsequent second part of the dosing regimen with a different, longer interval administration with usually lower exposure (step-down dosage), administered weekly, every 14 days, or monthly may optionally follow, for example, at 500 mg\/mbody surface area weekly, up to maximum of about 1.5 g\/mbody surface area, continuing for 4 weeks up to two years, for example, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 26, 32, 40, 52, 63, 68, 78, or 104 weeks. Alternatively, if the disease goes into remission or generally improves, the dosage may be maintained or kept at lower than maximum amount, for example, at 140 mg\/mbody surface area weekly.

A subject at risk is identified by, for example, determining the genetic susceptibility to an autoimmune disease by testing for alleles of HLA that are associated with such autoimmune disease, and\/or based on familial history, or other genetic markers that correlate with such autoimmune disease. Such prophylactic treatment may additionally comprise a second copolymer that binds to a second HLA molecule associated with the autoimmune disease to be treated. The second HLA molecule may be a HLA-DQ or HLA-DR molecule. Preferably, the autoimmune disease to be prophylactically treated is IDDM or celiac disease.","In other embodiments of the methods described herein, additional therapeutically active agents are administered to the subject. In one embodiment, compositions comprising additional therapeutic agents(s) are administered to the subject as separate compositions from those comprising the random polymer. For example, a subject may be administered a composition comprising a random copolymer subcutaneously while a composition comprising another therapeutic agent may be administered orally. The additional therapeutically active agents may treat the same disease as the random copolymer, a related disease, or may be intended to treat an undesirable side effect of administration of the copolymer, such as to reduce swelling at a site of intradermal injection.","Additional therapeutically active agents which may be administered to the subject include copolymers which bind to a second HLA molecule associated with the disease, such as Copaxone\u2122; an antibody, an enzyme inhibitor, an antibacterial agent, an antiviral agent, a steroid, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent, an antimetabolite, a cytokine, or a soluble cytokine receptor. The second HLA molecule may be an HLA-DQ molecule or an HLA-DR molecule. The enzyme inhibitor may be a protease inhibitor or a cyclooxygenase inhibitor.","In a further embodiment, the copolymers of the present invention are administered to a patient with an autoimmune disease following an anti-lymphocyte therapy (e.g., anti-T cell or anti-B cell). In one embodiment, anti-T cell therapies may use antibodies, such as Campath-1H\u00ae (alemtuzumab; anti-CD52), OKT3 (anti-CD3), thymoglobulin (anti-thymocytic globulins), or anti-IL2R antibodies (e.g., daclizumab and basiliximab). Alternatively, anti-T cell therapies may use chemotherapy agents such as fludarabine, external-beam radiation therapy (XRT), and cyclophosphamide. In another embodiment, the copolymers of the present invention may be combined with an anti-B cell therapy for treating an autoimmune disease, such as agents that react with CD20 such as the antibody Rituxan (Rituximab). The dosage of the above treatments to be administered to a patient will vary with the precise nature of the condition being treated and the recipient of the treatment. The scaling of dosages for human administration can be performed according to art-accepted practices. For example, the dose for Campath-1H\u00ae will generally be in the range 1 to about 100 mg for an adult patient, usually administered daily for a period between 1 and 30 days. The preferred daily dose is 1 to 10 mg per day although in some instances larger doses of up to 40 mg per day may be used (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,120,766). Although not wishing to be bound by any particular mechanism or theory, it is believed that such combination therapy can enhance the therapeutic efficacy without any potential long-term toxicity. To illustrate, Campath-1H\u00ae is introduced in a patient for initial induction immunosuppression. Then, the patient is administered a copolymer of the present invention in the absence of Campath-1H\u00ae.","In other embodiments, a copolymer of the present invention can be administered with an anti-lymphocyte agent (e.g., anti-T cell or anti-B cell) either in the same formulation or in separate formulations, to enhance treatment. For example, a copolymer and an anti-lymphocyte agent can be administered at the same time (simultaneously) or at separate times (sequentially), provided that they are administered in such a manner and sufficiently close in time to have the desired effect.","The additional agent may be added as a part of the pharmaceutical composition, or may be administered concomitantly or within a time period when the physiological effect of the additional agent overlaps with the physiological effect of the copolymer of the present invention. More particularly, an additional agent may be administered concomitantly or one week, several days, 24 hours, 8 hours, or immediately before the administration of the copolymer. Alternatively, an additional agent may be administered one week, several days, 24 hours, 8 hours, or immediately after the administration of the copolymer.","An improvement in the symptoms of a subject afflicted with multiple sclerosis (MS) as a result of administration of the random copolymer may be noted by a decrease in frequency of recurrences of episodes of MS, by decrease in severity of symptoms, and by elimination of recurrent episodes for a period of time after the start of administration. A therapeutically effective dosage preferably reduces symptoms and frequency of recurrences by at least about 20%, for example, by at least about 40%, by at least about 60%, and by at least about 80%, or by about 100% elimination of one or more symptoms, or elimination of recurrences of the autoimmune disease, relative to untreated subjects. The period of time can be at least about one month, at least about six months, or at least about one year.","An improvement in the symptoms of a subject afflicted with arthritis or any other autoimmune disorder which results in inflammation of the joints may be noted by a reduction in edema of one or more joints, by a reduction in inflammation in one or more joints, or by an increase in mobility in one or more joints. A therapeutically effective dosage preferably reduces joint inflammation and edema and improves mobility by at least about 20%, more preferably by at least about 40%, even more preferably by at least about 60%, and even still more preferably by at least about 80%, relative to untreated subjects.","The contents of any patents, patent applications, patent publications, or scientific articles referenced anywhere in this application are herein incorporated in their entirety.","The practice of the present invention will employ, where appropriate and unless otherwise indicated, conventional techniques of cell biology, cell culture, molecular biology, transgenic biology, microbiology, virology, recombinant DNA, and immunology, which are within the skill of the art. Such techniques are described in the literature. See, for example, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd Ed., ed. by Sambrook and Russell (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press: 2001); the treatise, Methods In Enzymology (Academic Press, Inc., N.Y.); Using Antibodies, Second Edition by Harlow and Lane, Cold Spring Harbor Press, New York, 1999; Current Protocols in Cell Biology, ed. by Bonifacino, Dasso, Lippincott-Schwartz, Harford, and Yamada, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, 1999; and PCR Protocols, ed. by Bartlett et al., Humana Press, 2003.","PLP (139-151) peptide is the major immunogenic determinant recognized by CD4 T1 cells which in turn drive EAE development in SJL mice. When injected with pertussis toxin, PLP (139-151) peptide causes MS-like symptoms in the SJL mice. In the absence of the pertussis toxin, injected animals develop only mild and transient disease. The ability of random copolymer compositions to protect the animals from the effect of PLP injection was evaluated in the course of daily and weekly dosing of the animals after their exposure to PLP (139-151) peptide. Antibody isotypes were also examined. CD4 T cells can be divided into at least two different subsets depending on the pattern of their cytokine production. T1 cells preferentially produce IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3, activate macrophages, and stimulate production of the Ig subclasses IgG2a and IgG3 in mice and IgG1 and IgG3 in humans. In contrast, the signature cytokines of TH2 cells are IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, which provide potent B cell help and induce isotype switching to IgE and IgG1 in mice or to IgE, IgG2, and IgG4 in humans. Therefore, mouse IgG1 and IgG2b, generally associated with T2 response, and mouse IgG2a, markers of T1 immunity, were measured.","Mice (SJL, female) were immunized on day 1 with 100 \u03bcg of PLP (139-151) peptide in Complete Freund's adjuvant. The same day, the animals received an intravenous injection of 200 ng of pertussis toxin. On day 3, the same IV injection was repeated. Treatment with Copaxone\u2122 (YEAK) or Co-14 (YFAK), 7.5 mg\/kg, daily and weekly was started on day 6 and continued daily until day 36. On day 37, individual sera were collected and antibody response against PLP (139-151) peptide, Co-14 (YFAK), and Copaxone\u2122 were measured using standard ELISA with anti-mouse total Ig, IgG1, IgG2a or IgG2b as secondary antibody.","During the course of the experiment, disease severity was measured using a standard scoring system between 0 (no disease) and 5 (moribund), and body weight of a mouse was recorded as another measure of disease state. The mortality rate of the animals was recorded daily.","Although daily dosing of Copaxone\u2122 was effective in reducing the severity of the disease compared to mannitol dosing alone (), majority of the mice treated with daily dose of Copaxone\u2122 died suddenly after about 3 weeks of treatment (). As shown in , daily dosing of Copaxone\u2122 induced a large amount of antibodies in the surviving injected mice. In contrast, weekly dosing with Copaxone\u2122, and daily and weekly dosing with Co-14 (YFAK), resulted in much lower antibody titers. The immune response was predominantly IgG1+IgG2b (i.e., predominantly T2) responses, and a much lower IgG2a (i.e. T1) response was seen. The few surviving mice in Copaxone\u2122 daily group had large IgG1 and IgG2b response against compound (), raising the possibility that the cause of death in Copaxone\u2122 daily dosed mice is likely to be anaphylaxis. In contrast, weekly dosing with Copaxone\u2122, and daily and weekly dosing with Co-14 (YFAK), which showed a much lower antibody titers, prevented anaphylactic shock and increased efficacy. Another example of antibody titers is shown in , where Copaxone\u2122 and Co-14 (YFAK) were administered either once a week or 3 times a week. Copaxone\u2122, when administered 3 times a week, induces production of large amount of antibodies directed against it, whereas weekly dosing of Copaxone\u2122 and dosing of Co-14, either weekly or three times a week, do not induce appreciative amount of antibodies against the respective copolymers.","When antibody titers for PLP (139-151) peptide were measured, both Copaxone\u2122 and Co-14 (YFAK), regardless of dosing interval, induced similar, small increases in amounts of IgG1 formation against PLP (139-151) peptide () compared to dosing with vehicle alone. The titers of IgG2b against PLP (139-151) were also not significantly affected (). These results show that the protective effect of Copaxone\u2122 or Co-14 (YFAK) is not exerted through modulation of antibody amounts against PLP (139-151) peptide.","The T1 and T2 profiles of mice injected with 5 \u03bcg Copaxone\u2122 or Co-14 (YFAK) three times a week or on weekly bases, up to day 22 of the treatment. On day 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, 23, 29, spleens were collected and splenocytes were isolated. 400,000 cells per well of splenocytes were restimulated with various concentrations (0.8, 4, or 20 \u03bcg\/ml) of Co-14 (YFAK) for three days. On day 3 of the cell culture, the cells were transferred onto ELISPOT (enzyme-linked immunospot assay) plates, coated with either IFN-\u03b3 (interferon gamma) or IL-13 (interleukin 13). The T cell response is examined by measuring the IFN \u03b3 production (a T1 cytokine) and IL-13 production (a T2 cytokine). The degree of T cell stimulation is also examined by measuring the proliferation of the cells shown as tritiated thymidine intake.","A burst of response was seen in the first week of dosing, followed by a decreased but sustained response. As seen in , the response is T2 biased, with the IL-13 production induced more strongly than the IFN \u03b3 at all times in cells treated with either Copaxone\u2122 or Co-14 (YFAK). The T2 bias is further confirmed by the amount of 23 cytokines and chemokines, as seen in ."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIGS. 10A and 10B","FIG. 10A","FIG. 10B"]},"shows  show the ability of Co-14 to generate specific effects upon T and B cells.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIGS. 13A-C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 13A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 13B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 13C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIG. 16A","FIG. 16B"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
