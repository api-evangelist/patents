title: Multiple input/gain stage Gilbert cell mixers
abstract: Multiple input and/or gain stage Gilbert cell mixer designs are disclosed. The designs allow one input to be turned on at a time, and are suitable, for example, for use in receiver and transmitter applications. In addition, the designs allow for the inputs of the multi-input Gilbert cell mixer to be connected together, thereby allowing for switching of gain states within the Gilbert cell mixer. The mixer design may include, for example, a Gilbert cell mixer stage, and a plurality of input/gain stages. Each input/gain stage has its output connected to the input of the mixer stage, and is configured for receiving an input signal and applying a gain factor to that input signal to provide a signal for mixing with the LO. Each input/gain stage is configured with stage select circuitry for enabling or disabling that stage, so that only one input/gain stage is active at a time.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The invention was made with United States Government support under contract N00014-04-C-0589 awarded by the Army, and the United States Government has certain rights in this invention.","The invention relates to integrated circuitry, and more particularly, to Gilbert cell multiplier circuits.","A so-called Gilbert cell or four-quadrant multiplier is a cross-coupled differential amplifier having a gain that can be linearly controlled by modulating emitter bias current or by adjusting the ratio of emitter degeneration resistance to the load resistance. The amplitude of the differential input RF signal can be linearly controlled by a differential AC voltage. Typical Gilbert cell configurations can be found, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 3,689,752.","Gilbert cells are commonly used in a number of applications, including mixers, automatic gain control (AGC) amplifiers, amplitude and sideband modulators, amplitude modulation (AM) and sideband detectors, frequency doublers and dividers, squaring and square-root circuits. The typical implementation of a Gilbert cell mixer utilizes a simple differential pair as the input transconductance stage. This is cascode connected with the Gilbert switching quad, which is typically driven by a local oscillator signal. The resulting mixer can then be used to down-convert RF signals to some intermediate frequency (IF) in receiver applications, or to up-convert IF signals to the RF transmission band in transmitter applications.","Wideband receivers and transmitters often require multiple paths between the input and output because frequency-selective filters, often times in parallel, are used to cover different frequency bands and prevent signals at non-desirable frequencies from aliasing into the frequency band of interest at the output. Consequently, a M:1 switch is usually required in the system, either on the input of the mixer where M RF input signal paths are switched into a single mixer, or on the mixer output where the outputs from M mixers are switched to a signal IF output path. In addition, receivers and transmitters requiring multiple gain states require an additional variable gain amplifier or attenuator block to adjust the gain of the receiver, either at the input of the Gilbert cell mixer (in the RF band) or at the output of the Gilbert cell mixer (in the IF band).","However, cascading external switching and gain blocks (such as M:1 switches, amplifier, and attenuator blocks) in receivers and transmitters generally decreases system performance, including increased noise figure and decreased output intercept point (linearity). In addition, although some Gilbert cell multiplier circuits are themselves configured to receive multiple inputs, such conventional configurations necessitate multiplication of all the inputs at once, which is not suitable for all applications, such as those where only one of multiple inputs is desired for multiplication.","One embodiment of the present invention provides a mixer circuit device. The device includes a Gilbert cell mixer stage for multiplying a first signal received at an input by a second signal to provide an output signal. The device further includes a plurality of input\/gain stages, each input\/gain stage having its output connected to the input of the mixer stage and for receiving an input signal and applying a gain factor to that input signal to provide the first signal, wherein each input\/gain stage is configured with stage select circuitry for enabling or disabling that stage, so that only one input\/gain stage is active at a time. In one particular case, each of the input\/gain stages is configured with emitter degeneration. In another particular case, each of the input\/gain stages includes a differential pair that is biased using the stage select circuitry. In another particular case, the stage select circuitry includes a current source. In one such case, each of the current sources is implemented as a current minor with emitter degeneration. In another particular case, each input\/gain stage receives a corresponding one of multiple input signals, and only one of the input\/gain stages is enabled at a time. In another particular case, the input\/gain stages are tied together so that each input\/gain stage receives a common input signal, and only one of the input\/gain stages is enabled at a time. In one such case, each of the input\/gain stages has a different gain. In another particular case, the device is included in a system-on-chip configuration.","Another embodiment of the present invention provides an integrated circuit. The integrated circuit includes a Gilbert cell mixer stage for multiplying a first signal received at an input by a second signal to provide an output signal. The integrated circuit further includes a plurality of input\/gain stages, each input\/gain stage having its output connected to the input of the mixer stage and for receiving an input signal and applying a gain factor to that input signal to provide the first signal, wherein each input\/gain stage is configured with stage select circuitry for enabling or disabling that stage, so that only one input\/gain stage is active at a time. Each of the input\/gain stages further includes a differential pair that is biased using the stage select circuitry, and the stage select circuitry includes two current sources. In one particular case, each of the input\/gain stages is configured with emitter degeneration, and each of the current sources is implemented as a current mirror with emitter degeneration. In another particular case, at least one of the input\/gain stages includes a complementary metal oxide differential pair of field-effect transistors or a heterojunction bipolar transistor differential pair or a bipolar junction transistor differential pair. In another particular case, each input\/gain stage receives a corresponding one of multiple input signals, and only one of the input\/gain stages is enabled at a time. In another particular case, inputs of the input\/gain stages are tied together so that each input\/gain stage receives a common input signal, and only one of the input\/gain stages is enabled at a time. In one such case, each of the input\/gain stages has a different gain.","Another embodiment of the present invention provides a system that includes a circuit for at least one of transmitting and\/or receiving communication signals, the circuit including a mixer device. The mixer device includes a Gilbert cell mixer stage for multiplying a first signal received at an input by a second signal to provide an output signal, and a plurality of input\/gain stages, each input\/gain stage having its output connected to the input of the mixer stage and for receiving an input signal and applying a gain factor to that input signal to provide the first signal.

In one such case, each of the input\/gain stages has a different gain.","The features and advantages described herein are not all-inclusive and, in particular, many additional features and advantages will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the drawings, specification, and claims. Moreover, it should be noted that the language used in the specification has been principally selected for readability and instructional purposes, and not to limit the scope of the inventive subject matter.","Multiple input and\/or gain stage Gilbert cell mixer designs are disclosed. The designs allow one input to be turned on at a time, and are suitable, for example, for use in receiver and transmitter applications. In addition, the designs allow for the inputs of the multi-input Gilbert cell mixer to be connected together, thereby allowing for switching of gain states within the Gilbert cell mixer.","General Overview","As previously explained, conventional techiques for addressing multi-path receiver and transmitter configurations generally involves cascading an M:1 switch either at the input or output of the mixer. Likewise, conventional techniques for addressing multiple gain state transmitter configurations generally involves cascading a variable gain stage either at the input or output of the mixer. While the cascading of such discrete switching and gain stages is acceptable in many applications, the degradation to the linearity and noise figure of the system may create problems in others.","Thus, and in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a multi-input Gilbert cell mixer is provided for use in receivers and transmitters, thereby eliminating the need for a cascaded M:1 switch. The mixer design provides reasonable isolation between the unselected inputs and the outputs of the system, so that individual inputs of a multi-input set can be selected for mixing. The mixer gain associated with any one selected input can be varied as well, if so desired. In addition, the multi-input Gilbert cell mixer can be configured with its inputs connected together, thereby allowing for switching of gain states within the Gilbert cell mixer and eliminating the need for a cascaded variable gain amplifier in the system.","In one example configuration, a multi-input Gilbert cell mixer configured in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention has the functionality of a Gilbert cell mixer, and further includes the functionality of an M:1 switch (allowing for switching of individual inputs) but without any performance degradation in linearity and noise figure associated with conventional configurations. In one specific such embodiment, two or more differential transconductance pairs with emitter degeneration are integrally cascaded by a four-quadrant multiplier circuit. Each differential pair can be selectively biased, such that a single one of the differential pairs is biased on. In addition, the bias of that selected differential pair can be varied within an active region to effectively provide variable gain, if so desired.","In another example configuration, a switched-gain Gilbert cell mixer configured in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention has the functionality of a Gilbert cell mixer, and is further capable of adjusting gain states without an additional circuit block in the receiver\/transmitter cascade and without any performance degradation in linearity and noise figure. In one specific such embodiment, two or more differential transconductance pairs with emitter or source degenerations have their corresponding inputs tied together to form a single differential input. The outputs of the differential pairs are connected together and are cascaded by a single four-quadrant multiplier circuit. Each differential pair can be selectively biased, such that a single one of the differential pairs is biased on, and each of the differential pairs can be further configured with a different small-signal transconductance. Thus, the overall gain of the switched-gain Gilbert cell mixer can be determined by which differential pair is biased on.","Such Gilbert cell mixer configurations have a number of advantages, such as providing the flexibility to reduce layout parasitics for simultaneous high speed, wideband, and high dynamic range applications. As will be apparent in light of this disclosure, the mixer devices provided herein can be implemented in various configurations, such as with bipolar junction transistor (BJT), heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT), and\/or complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technologies, and are suitable for any number of applications, including integrated system-on-chip configurations as well as printed circuit boards configured with various discrete components including multi-input mixers (e.g., RF receivers and transmitters, especially those suitable for wideband applications). Numerous other applications will be apparent in light of this disclosure.","Gilbert Cell Mixer Architecture",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIGS. 1","FIG. 1"],"i":["a","b ","a"],"sub":["IN","OUT"]},"As can be seen with reference to , the mixer circuit includes a differential transconductance amplifier stage (differential transconductance pair) operatively coupled to a mixing stage implemented with a Gilbert cell. The power supplies of Vand Vare provided as typically done.","In such a typical Gilbert cell mixer, the RF input stage to the mixer has a differential transconductance pair of transistors, Qand Q. This transistor pair converts a differential input voltage at the bases to an output current at the collectors. The differential input voltage is designated as RFand RF, and the differential output current is designated as Iand I. The differential output current Iand Iis then mixed with the local oscillator signal (LOand LO) applied to the Gilbert switching quad, which is made up of Q-Q. The differential output signal of the mixing stage (IFand IF) is taken at the collectors of the Gilbert quad.","Linearity is generally dependent on the semiconductor process used and how much emitter degeneration is used, which is impedance element R. When impedance Ris a resistive element (as shown in ) for broadband applications, high linearity can be achieved. Note, however, that there is a trade with respect to lower mixer circuit gain and higher noise figure. Narrow band applications can partially mitigate this shortcoming by utilizing reactive components (i.e., inductors and\/or capacitors) for impedance R. The other impedances R-Rare generally used for shaping the circuitry frequency response and gain. Typical impedance values are as follows: R=R=100 ohms; R=R=70 ohms; and R=45 ohms.","While this typical mixer configuration can be cascaded with external switching and\/or gain stages as previously described, there is a resultant performance degradation with respect to linearity and noise figure. Thus, and in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a multi-input Gilbert cell mixer is provided that has the functionality of a Gilbert cell mixer and a M:1 switch and\/or variable gain stages integrated therein, but without any performance degradation in linearity and noise figure associated with such conventional configurations.","Multi-Input Gilbert Cell Mixer Architecture",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIGS. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"i":["a","b ","a","a "],"sub":["IN<0>","IN<1>","IN<N>","OUT"]},"As can be seen in , the mixer stage is implemented with a Gilbert cell in a similar fashion as shown in , and that previous description is equally applicable here. However, the single differential transconductance stage is replaced with N+1 RF input stages (generally designated as DTP #0, DTP #1, . . . , DTP #N), each configured with stage select circuitry thereby providing an integrated multi-input Gilbert cell mixer circuit capable of having a single one of its multiple inputs selected for mixing with a local oscillator signal. This input selection function is achieved without any performance degradation in linearity and noise figure.","In more detail, each of the RF input stages is configured with emitter degeneration and are cascaded by the Gilbert cell, which as previously explained is a four-quadrant multiplier circuit. In this example embodiment, each differential pair can be biased using two current sources (one for the p-differential signal and the other for the n-differential signal). The current sources can be implemented, for example, as current mirrors with emitter degeneration, although other suitable current source configurations can be used as well. As will be appreciated in light of this disclosure, these differential current source pairs effectively provide a selection mechanism, thereby allowing multiple inputs of the mixer circuit to be individually selected for mixing.","The RF input stage DTP #0 includes a differential transconductance pair of transistors, Q and Q, and is configured to receive a differential input voltage designated as RF and RF. This transistor pair Q and Q converts the differential input voltage at its bases to an output current at its collectors. In operation, the differential pair Q and Q is turned on by raising or otherwise adjusting VBB<0> up to a proper voltage. When VBB<0> is applied, the combination of transistor Q and resistor R as well as transistor Q and resistor R sources a current that biases Q and Q into the linear active region. As will be appreciated, VBB<0> can be adjusted to achieve a desired gain within that active region. If VBB<0> is too low, then the RF input stage DTP #0 will turn off; if VBB<0> is too high, then the RF input stage DTP #0 will saturate; thus, the active region is between these two extremes. The gain of RF input stage DTP #0 may also be adjusted, for example, by adjusting the degeneration impedance, R<0>.","The RF input stage DTP #1 includes a differential transconductance pair of transistors, Q and Q, and is configured to receive a differential input voltage designated as RF<1> and RF<1>. This transistor pair Q and Q converts the differential input voltage at its bases to an output current at its collectors. In operation, the differential pair Q and Q is turned on by raising or otherwise adjusting VBB<1> up to a proper voltage. When VBB<1> is applied, the combination of transistor Q and resistor R as well as transistor Q and resistor R sources a current that biases Q and Q into the active region. As will be appreciated, VBB<1> can be adjusted to achieve a desired gain within that active region. If VBB<1> is too low, then the RF input stage DTP #1 will turn off; if VBB<1> is too high, then the RF input stage DTP #1 will saturate; thus, the active region is between these two extremes. The gain of RF input stage DTP #1 may also be adjusted, for example, by adjusting the degeneration impedance, R<1>.","The RF input stage DTP #N includes a differential transconductance pair of transistors, Q and Q, and is configured to receive a differential input voltage designated as RF<N> and RF<N>. This transistor pair Q and Q converts the differential input voltage at its bases to an output current at its collectors. In operation, the differential pair Q and Q is turned on by raising or otherwise adjusting VBB<N> up to a proper voltage. When VBB<N> is applied, the combination of transistor Q and resistor R as well as transistor Q and resistor R sources a current that biases Q and Q into the active region. As will be appreciated, VBB<N> can be adjusted to achieve a desired gain within that active region.

The gain of RF input stage DTP #N may also be adjusted, for example, by adjusting the degeneration impedance, R<N>.","Thus, in such a multi-input mixer circuit operation, only one of the differential transconductance pair of transistors Q and Q is biased on (e.g., somewhere in the linear or otherwise active region of the differential pair) at a time by applying the appropriate voltage VBB<n> to the corresponding selection circuitry (to the base terminals of transistors Q and Q, in this example), VBB<n>. The gain of RF input stage DTP #n can be adjusted by adjusting VBB<n> within the linear or otherwise active region of the differential pair, and may also be adjusted, for example, by adjusting the degeneration impedance, R<n>. Note that n can be any integer from 0 to N, and represents one of N+1 RF input signals. In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, providing multi-input stage functionality incurs a 10% (or lower) increase in intermodulation product (linearity) or noise figure degradation, relative to conventional single input stage configurations.","Switched-Gain Gilbert Cell Mixer Architecture",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIGS. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"i":["a","b ","a","a "],"sub":["IN","OUT"]},"As can be seen in , the mixer stage is implemented with a Gilbert cell in a similar fashion as shown in , and that previous description is equally applicable here.
