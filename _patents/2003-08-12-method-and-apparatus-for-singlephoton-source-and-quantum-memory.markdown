title: Method and apparatus for single-photon source and quantum memory
abstract: An optical switch and optical storage loop are used as the basis of a single-photon source and a quantum memory for photonic qubits. To operate as a single-photon source, the techniques include a source of a pair of photons, such as a parametric down-conversion crystal, which is known to emit photons in pairs. The detection of one member of the pair activates the switch, which re-routes the other member into the storage loop. The stored photon is then known to be circulating in the loop, and can be switched out of the loop at a later time chosen by the user, providing a single photon for potential use in a variety of quantum information processing applications. To operate as a quantum memory for photonic qubits, a single-photon in an arbitrary initial polarization state is coherently stored in the loop, and coherently switched out of the loop when needed.

No. 10\/286,735, by T. Pittman et al., filed Nov. 1, 2002 (hereinafter referenced as Pittman I), the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.","This invention was made in part with Government support under Contract No. N0001-491-J1485 awarded by the Office of Naval Research. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to quantum information processing, and, in particular, to techniques for producing, storing, and retrieving quantum bits represented by single photons.","2. Description of the Related Art","The past approaches described in this section could be pursued, but are not necessarily approaches that have been previously conceived or pursued. Therefore, unless otherwise indicated herein, the approaches described in this section are not to be considered prior art to the claims in this application merely due to the presence of these approaches in this background section.","Information processing using classical computers relies on physical phenomena, such as magnetic fields, voltages, and optical intensity that can be produced and measured in each of two base states, one base state representing a zero and another base state representing a one. Each physical element that can achieve either of these two states represents one binary digit, called a bit. Quantum information processing uses physical elements that exhibit quantum properties that may include, not only one of the two or more base states, but also an arbitrary superposition state of the base states. A superposition state has some non-zero probability of being measured as one of the base states and some non-zero probability of being measured as another of the base states. A physical element that exhibits quantum properties for two base states represents one quantum bit, also called a qubit. Physical elements that are suitable for representing qubits include the spins of single electrons, electron states in atoms or molecules, nuclear spins in molecules and solids, magnetic flux, spatial propagation modes of single photons, and polarizations of single photons.","Logical operations performed on qubits apply not only to the base states of those qubits but also to the superposition states of those qubits, simultaneously. Quantum computers based on logical operations on systems of qubits offer the promise of massively simultaneous processing (also called massively parallel processing) that can address problems that are considered intractable with classical information processing. Such classically intractable problems that can be addressed with quantum computers include simulation of quantum interactions, combinatorial searches in unsorted data, finding prime factors of large integers, solving for cryptographic keys used in current secure communication algorithms, and truly secure communications (also called \u201cquantum cryptography\u201d).","Obstacles to achieving quantum computers include the difficulty in isolating qubits from uncontrolled interactions with the environment, and transmitting qubits. Many of the physical elements that represent qubits, such as molecules and solids, are not readily transmitted, and interact strongly with their environment.","Single photons, however, interact little in many environments, including glass fiber and air, and are easily transmitted in such media. Therefore several approaches have utilized quantum properties of single photons.","One approach implements logical operations on single photons using non-linear interactions between single photons. A problem with non-linear interactions between single photons is that such interactions are very weak and no devices satisfactorily implement this approach.","Another approach uses linear interactions between single photons but relies on interferometer techniques, e.g., interference on two spatial modes of propagation for a single photon. For example, logic gates using this approach have been proposed by E. Knill, R. Laflamme, and G. J. Milburn, \u201cA scheme for efficient quantum computation with linear optics,\u201d , vol. 409, p. 49, 4 Jan. 2001 (hereinafter Knill) and by M. Koashi, T. Yamamoto, and N. Imoto, \u201cProbabilistic manipulation of photons,\u201d A, vol. 63, 030301, 12 Feb. 2001 (hereinafter Koashi). These devices are called \u201cprobabilistic\u201d logical gates because they perform the desired logical operation in response to only a fraction of the input photons. However, it can be determined when an operation is performed successfully, so that, in a separate step often called a \u201cpost selection\u201d step or a \u201cpost-detection selection\u201d step, output photons are blocked unless the operation is successfully performed. It has been shown that the fraction can be increased close to a value of one with sufficient numbers of components and extra photons (called \u201cancilla\u201d) in particular states.","Probabilistic, linear devices proposed by Knill suffer from errors due to thermally induced phase shifts on the two spatial modes. Other probabilistic, linear devices proposed by Koashi reduce the phase shifts by including a large number of additional components and other resources, such as sources of a large number of qubits in particular states. Pittman I disclosed devices that perform logical operations on quantum states of single photons that operate on the polarization states of single photons and that do not suffer thermally induced phase shifts and that do not require a large number of additional components and resources. The Pittman I devices do employ some ancilla.","Many of these approaches for quantum computing benefit from a reliable source of single photons on demand in a particular state, with particular temporal and spectral properties, for example, to serve as a simple source for the ancilla described above, or to demonstrate the operation of the quantum logic operations. Furthermore, practical quantum computing is expected to utilize some mechanism for storing quantum bits with arbitrary values, for example to temporarily hold intermediate values during an extended computation.","Some approaches for providing single photons rely on a spontaneous emission of an isolated two-state quantum system, such as a single atom, ion, or quantum dot. However, these approaches for providing single photons suffer from at least two deficiencies: 1) uncertainty about whether a photon has been emitted; and 2) uncertainty about its direction. Although the probability of single-photon emission can be high in these approaches, there is no extant method for ensuring that a photon has actually been emitted. Furthermore, in some approaches, when a single photon is emitted, its direction may be any in a solid angle 4\u03c0 encompassing all directions.","Based on the foregoing there is a clear need for a source of single photons in a specified state that provides a certain emission of a photon and with a known direction.","Existing approaches for storing qubits exploit the persistent nature of some phenomena that represent qubits. For example, in an ion-trap approach to quantum computing, the qubits are stored in potentially long-lived atomic states. However, these approaches are not directly applicable to qubits represented by the states of single photons, and no method currently exists for effectively converting and storing the arbitrary states of single photons in the long-lived atomic states and then retrieving and converting back to the original states of single photons.","Challenges in providing a memory for photonic qubits in arbitrary states include that: 1) the single photon qubit to be stored travels at the speed of light in the storage medium; 2) the single photon qubit must be stored so as to maintain its arbitrary quantum state (the coherence of the stored photon); 3) the single photon must be retrieved on demand; and 4) the single photon qubit must be stored and retrieved without measuring the state of the photon. This fourth challenge arises because a measurement results in one of the base states and destroys the superposition state of the photon, e.g., eliminates the probability that the photon will be measured in a different base state.","Based on the foregoing description, there is a clear need for techniques for a quantum memory to store and retrieve qubits represented by arbitrary polarization states of single photons.","Techniques are provided for storing a single photon for retrieving on demand, such as for uses related to quantum computing. An optical switch and optical storage loop are used as the basis of both a single-photon source and a quantum memory for photonic qubits. To operate as a single-photon source, the techniques include a source of a pair of photons, such as a parametric down-conversion crystal, which is known to emit photons in pairs. The detection of one member of the pair activates the switch, which re-routes the other member into the storage loop. The stored photon is then known to be circulating in the loop, and can be switched out of the loop at a later time chosen by the user, providing a single photon for potential use in a variety of quantum information processing applications. To operate as a quantum memory for photonic qubits, a single-photon in an arbitrary initial polarization state is coherently stored in the loop, and coherently switched out of the loop when needed.","According to one aspect of the invention, a method includes receiving a single photon through an optical input connected to an optical loop that includes a storage loop and an optical switch. A selectable state of the optical switch is set. Based on the selected state of the optical switch, a single photon incident on the optical switch is directed into the storage loop or into an optical output also connected to the optical loop.","In another aspect of the invention, the techniques include a device for storage and retrieval of a single photon. The device includes an optical input, an optical output, and an optical loop connected to the optical input and optical output. The optical loop includes a storage loop and an optical switch. Based on a selectable state of the optical switch, a single photon incident onto the optical switch is directed into the storage loop or the optical output.","In another aspect of the invention, the techniques include a method of fabricating a device for storage and retrieval of single photons, as described above.","According to another aspect of the invention, a method for generating a single photon includes receiving at a single-photon detector a first photon of a pair of photons from a source that generates pairs of photons. The detector generates a detector electric signal when a photon is incident on the detector. A first state of an optical switch is set based at least in part on the detector electric signal. The first state causes the optical switch to direct a photon received on an optical input spatial mode to a first output of two output spatial modes. A second photon of the pair is received on the optical input spatial mode. The second photon is directed from the optical switch through the first output into a storage loop. The storage loop returns the second electron to the optical switch after the second photon passes through the storage loop.","In an embodiment of this aspect, it is determined whether there is a demand for the second photon. If there is not such a demand, then a loop state of the switch is set to direct the second photon back into the storage loop through the first output when the second photon returns to the switch. In another embodiment, if there is a demand for the second photon, then a release state of the switch is set to direct the second photon to a second output, different from the first output, to serve as the single photon generated by the method.","In another aspect of the invention, the techniques include a source device for a single photon. The source includes an optical switch with an optical input and two optical outputs. A photon is directed to one of the two outputs based on an selectable state of the optical switch. The source also includes a storage loop for directing a photon from a loop mode of the two outputs to the optical input of the optical switch. A source for a pair of photons and a single-photon detector are also included. The detector outputs a detector electric signal when a photon is incident on the detector. An optical coupler directs a first photon of the pair of photons to the detector and a second photon of the pair to the optical input of the optical switch. An electronic processor is connected to the detector and the optical switch. The electronic processor sets a first state of the optical switch based at least in part on the detector electric signal from the detector.","In an embodiment of this aspect, the first state causes the optical switch to direct a photon incident at the optical input into the storage loop through the loop mode.","In another aspect of the invention, a linear optics device for uses related to quantum computing includes a linear optics quantum logic gate connected to a plurality of sources of single photons, as described above.","In another aspect of the invention, the techniques include a method of fabricating a source of single photons, as described above.","In another aspect of the invention, the techniques include a method for storing a single photon of arbitrary polarization state for uses related to a memory for quantum computing. The method includes receiving a single photon of arbitrary polarization state through an optical memory input. The single photon is directed into an optical loop in which the single photon propagates from a particular position back to the particular position. An selectable state is set for an optical switch disposed in the optical loop. Based on the selectable state of the optical switch, the single photon propagating in the optical loop is directed either back through the optical loop or through a memory output to serve as the retrieved quantum bit contents of the memory.","In another aspect of the invention, a storage device for use as a memory in quantum computing includes a memory input, a memory output, an optical loop and an optical switch. The memory input includes a first optical spatial mode for receiving a single photon of arbitrary polarization state. The memory output includes a second optical spatial mode for sending the quantum bit retrieved from the device. The optical loop is optically connected to the memory input and the memory output, and the single photon received at the memory input propagates from a particular position back to the particular position in the optical loop. The optical switch is placed in the optical loop and directs the single photon in the optical loop either back into the optical loop and or out through the memory output, based on an selectable state of the optical switch.","In one embodiment of this aspect, the single photon directed to the memory output has the same polarization state as the single photon received at the memory input. In another embodiment of this aspect, the single photon directed to the memory output has the values of its base states swapped compared to values of the base states in the photon received at the memory input.","Methods and apparatuses for storing a polarization state of a single photon are described. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention.","For example, embodiments of the present invention are described in the context of providing one or more components for performing or demonstrating quantum computing, but the invention is not limited to that context. The invention may be applied in any context where single photons are desired in particular or arbitrary polarization states. As another example, embodiments are described herein using an electro-optical (EO) switch. In other embodiments other optical switches that cause a photon to take a selectable one of two or more spatial modes, known at the time when an embodiment is implemented, may be used, such as acousto-optical switches, mechanical switches, and optically activated optical switches.","1. Storage of a Single Photon for Retrieval on Quasi-Demand","Techniques are provided to store a single photon and to retrieve the photon at some later time, when, for example, a demand is made for the photon. These techniques provide a basis for a source of a single photon, which provides a single photon with near certain occurrence and with known spatial location and direction (e.g., known spatial mode). These techniques also provide a basis for a cyclical quantum memory for a qubit based on an arbitrary polarization state of a single photon. The techniques include an apparatus, a method of fabricating the apparatus, and a method of using the apparatus.","1.1 Structural Overview",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["110","110","120","120","120","110","112","114"]},"The optical switch  operates to direct a single photon into the storage loop of the optical loop  or into the optical output . In some embodiments, the optical switch  also operates to block photons other than a single photon desired to propagate in the optical loop . A photon incident on the switch  is blocked or directed into the storage loop or is directed to the optical output based on an selectable state of the switch .","In the illustrated embodiment, the selectable state of the switch  is determined by an electric controller . Any mechanism may be used to implement controller . For example, in some embodiments, controller  includes or is connected to a general purpose computer.

In the illustrated embodiment, step  includes the operation of controller  to send a signal along connection  to switch . This electrical state determines whether a single photon incident on the switch from the optical input  is to be captured in the loop, and is called hereinafter the \u201ccapture state\u201d of the EO switch. Three capture states are possible in the illustrated embodiment. In a first capture state, any photon incident on the switch  from the input  is blocked and is not transmitted through the switch. In a second capture state, a photon incident on the switch is directed to the storage loop of optical loop . In a third capture state, a photon incident on the switch is directed to the optical output . In some embodiments, more or fewer capture states are utilized; for example, the first and third capture states are the same in some embodiments, and they are different in other embodiments. In some embodiments, as described in more detail below, the controller  determines the capture state based on the detection of a trigger photon or photons with one or mores detectors (not shown in ). In some embodiments, the second capture state is set for only a short time window to ensure that only a single photon is directed into the storage loop.","In step , a photon is received on optical input . Any method may be used to direct a photon onto optical input . In some embodiments, step  is accomplished by use of an optical coupler to direct a photon from a photon source onto optical input . In some embodiments, step  is accomplished by use of an optical coupler to direct a photon from an output of an optical logic gate onto optical input .","In step , the photon is directed into the storage loop, or not, based on the capture electrical state. Step  includes directing the photon onto the switch. For example, in some embodiments, the optical input is connected to the switch  before the storage loop, and the photon is directed into the storage loop only if the second capture state had been set during step . In some embodiments, the optical input is directed into the storage loop before the switch , and the photon is blocked or directed into the optical output , unless the second capture state had been set during step , in which circumstance the photon is directed back onto the storage loop.","For purposes of illustration, it is assumed that the second capture state is set during step  and, therefore, that a single photon received at optical input  and subsequently incident on switch  is directed into the storage loop of optical loop .","In step  it is determined whether there is a demand for the photon propagating in optical loop . The demand can be determined in any manner known in the art at the time the device  is constructed. For example, the demand can be determined by a classical signal received on a classical input (not shown) to controller , such as an electric signal received on an electrical input. In some embodiments, the demand can be determined based on an output signal from a counter or timer operating in controller . In some embodiments, the demand can be determined based on measuring a photon or qubit in a detector (not shown) connected to controller .","If no demand for the photon is determined in step , then control passes to step . In step , the electrical state of the switch is set to return the photon to the storage loop before the time a photon propagating in the storage loop is returned to the switch . The electrical state of the switch  that causes the switch  to direct the photon from the storage loop back into the storage loop is called hereinafter the \u201cloop state.\u201d In some embodiments, the loop state is the same as one or more of the capture states. In some embodiments, the loop state is different from any of the capture states. Control then passes to step .","In step , the switch  directs the photon incident on the switch  from the storage loop back onto to the storage loop, based on the loop state.

In some embodiments, the release state is different from any of the capture states. Control then passes to step .","In step , the switch  directs the photon incident on the switch  from the storage loop into the optical output , based on the release state. In some embodiments, step  completes the process of retrieving a single photon stored in optical loop . In some embodiments, control passes back to step  to set a capture state for the switch  in optical loop .","A characteristic of the storage and retrieval techniques described above is the production of a single photon on optical output  at a time after receipt of the photon on optical input  that is a multiple of a particular time interval. The particular time interval, called hereinafter a \u201cloop interval,\u201d is the time for a photon to propagate through the optical loop . The loop time often does not present an obstacle to the use of the storage and retrieval techniques described herein. The loop time can be made very short (e.g., a loop time of about 13 nanoseconds is demonstrated below). A quantum computing cycle interval can be selected to match such loop times. In some embodiments the loop time is limited somewhat by the response time of optical switch . In some of these embodiments, the demand can be anticipated and the switch started ahead of the moment of demand so that a photon circulating with a loop time shorter than the response time can be switched out at a particular stage of the switch response.","In the following sections, more particular embodiments of switch  and storage loops are described for accomplishing types of functions useful in performing or demonstrating quantum computing, among other uses.","2. Certain Source of a Single Photon","As described in the background section, there is a need for obtaining a single photon on demand with near certainty and with a known spatial mode (location and direction of propagation). Such sources can provide ancilla photons for quantum logic gates or circuits, or can provide qubits for testing quantum logic gates or circuits, or both. A source of photons with near certainty in a known spatial mode is achieved at least according to the following embodiments.","2.1 Structural Overview",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIG. 2A","b":"200"},"The source  includes a source  that produces a photon pair with known polarization and spatial mode at an uncertain time. In an illustrated embodiment, the source  is a pulsed parametric down-conversion (PDC) source that produces one horizontally polarized photon, represented by state vector {1|H]+0|V]}, and one vertically polarized photon, represented by state vector {0|H]+1|V]}. As is well-known in the art, a PDC source is caused to emit a pair of photons in response to pumping of the PDC by a train of short pulses from a laser, such as a femtosecond mode-locked laser. The pair of photons is emitted at one of the well-defined times determined by the repetition rate of the pulsed laser. However, the specific pulse that actually produces the photon pair cannot be chosen in advance.","One photon of the pair is directed along optical path and the other is directed along optical path Any mechanism may be used to direct the photons onto optical paths , . In some embodiments, one or more optical couplers (not shown) are used. The photon on path is directed to an electrical controller described below, and the photon on path is directed to an optical loop, described below.","The optical loop includes EO switch and storage loop . The optical loop is used to store a single photon until demanded.","Photons impinge on EO switch  through switch input  made up of one or more spatial modes. Photons that impinge on EO switch are directed to switch output or switch output , or zero or more other switch outputs (not shown), collectively referenced hereinafter as switch output . The impinging photon is directed to one of the switch outputs  based on a selectable electrical state of the EO switch . A photon directed to switch output enters storage loop . A photon directed to switch output follows optical path to optical output ","Storage loop  returns a photon from switch output to switch input .","In the illustrated embodiment, a polarization rotator  is disposed in optical path to generate an output photon with a particular polarization state, as described in more detail below.","The electrical controller includes a single-photon detector , connection and processor . The detector  generates a classical signal when a single photon is incident on the detector . The processor  generates a signal to set the electrical state of the EO switch . The electrical controller is connected to EO switch by connection . Connections , include any mechanism for passing classical information.","2.2 Functional Overview","According to the illustrated embodiment, once a pair of photons is emitted by source , one of the pair is detected by detector  of the controller and used to time the setting of the second capture state for the EO switch . The EO switch in the illustrated embodiment is a high-speed EO switch that routes the photon on path into the storage loop  based on the second capture state imposed by the processor  of the controller. The stored photon is then known to be circulating in the optical loop and can be switched out on demand with a time precision on the order of the loop interval, or at an exact time corresponding to any number of round trips.","In the illustrated embodiment, the uncertain source  produces photons of known polarization states in known spatial modes, so the storage loop and switch can be designed to exploit that polarization state. For example, the EO switch and storage loop  can be designed to capture and release the vertically polarized photon of each pair generated by the source . Depending on the use of the single photon, such as to simulate a qubit input to a quantum gate or to provide ancilla in particular states, a single photon in a different polarization state may be desired. The polarization rotator  is a device that generates the desired polarization state from the single photon stored in the optical loop, such as from a vertically polarized photon. Any mechanism may be used. The polarization rotator  my be a fixed device, such as a combination of a half wave plate and a quarter wave plate. or a dynamic device that rotates the photon based on a classical signal generated or received at the device such as a Pockels cell, well known in the art.","2.3 Detailed Embodiment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2B"],"b":["201","200","250","201","290"]},"Embodiment  includes an EO switch , and includes delay component  and optical paths in optical path ","EO switch includes a polarizing beam splitter (PBS)  that reflects vertically polarized photons and transmits horizontally polarized photons incident along any of several spatial modes. One input mode of PBS  serves as one switch input of switch inputs .","EO switch also includes a Pockels cell (PC)  that is used to rotate the polarization of the photon circulating in the optical loop. The Pockels cell  is configured so that it does not affect a photon incident on the Pockels cell  unless the Pockels cell  is turned \u201con\u201d by a classical pulse from the processor  of the controller. When it is turned on, the Pockels cell  rotates the polarization of an incident photon by 90 degrees (\u03c0\/2 radians) so that the single photon emerging from the Pockels cell  has a flipped polarization state. For example, a vertically polarized photon, incident on the Pockels cell  in an on state, emerges from the Pockels cell  as a horizontally polarized photon. When the Pockels cell  is turned \u201coff,\u201d the incident photon's polarization is not changed. For example, a vertically polarized photon incident on the Pockels cell  in an off state emerges from a Pockels cell  as a vertically polarized photon. One input mode of PC  serves as another switch input of switch inputs , which directs a photon emerging from PC  onto a second input mode  of PBS .","In the illustrated embodiment, a vertically polarized photon arriving on the optical input along path enters switch input  a into the PBS . The PBS automatically directs this vertically polarized photon into storage loop  through switch output . Thus, in the illustrated embodiment, the photon circulates once in the storage loop before the electric state of the switch determines how it is directed.","The vertically polarized photon circulates in the storage loop  in the direction shown by the arrows on storage loop . The storage loop  directs a photon into the PC  through switch input If the PC  is in the off state, the photon emerges in the same vertically polarized state, enters PBS  at PBS input  and is reflected through switch output and onto optical path which leads to the source output. The photon is not captured. If the PC  is the on state, the photon emerges in the horizontally polarized state, enters PBS  at PBS input  and is transmitted through switch output back onto the storage loop . The photon is captured. Therefore, in this embodiment, the second capture state corresponds to the PC on state; and the first and third capture states correspond to the PC off state.","The delay component  disposed in optical path delays by a certain amount (called hereinafter the \u201cfixed initial delay\u201d) the arrival of a photon from source  at the optical loop. Since the two photons of the pair are created at the same time, the processor can determine that the vertically polarized photon of the pair (called hereinafter \u201cphoton b\u201d) arrives at the optical loop after the detection in detector  of the horizontally polarized photon (called hereinafter \u201cphoton a\u201d) by a time related to the fixed initial delay.","In order to store the photon b in the optical loop for more than one circuit, i.e., to capture photon b, the processor  sends a short classical pulse p to the Pockels cell  so that the Pockels cell  is turned on during the first pass of photon b through the optical loop.","To store photon b in the optical loop for subsequent circuits, as is desired if the photon is not demanded, the Pockels cell is set to the off state, so that photon b remains horizontally polarized and continues to be transmitted through PBS  and directed into the storage loop . Therefore the loop state of the switch that directs a captured photon back into the storage loop corresponds to the Pockels cell off state. Therefore the pulse p returns the Pockels cell state to the off state for the second and subsequent circuits through the storage loop.","When the stored photon is demanded, for example after a certain number of circuits, the Pockels cell state is changed back to \u201con\u201d to again rotate the polarization of photon b by \u03c0\/2. This changes the polarization of photon b from horizontal when it is incident on the Pockels cell  along input back to vertical as it emerges from Pockels cell  along optical path . The vertically polarized photon b is reflected by PBS  into switch output , thus releasing the captured photon on demand. Therefore the release state of the switch that directs a captured photon to the optical output is the Pockels cell on state.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0090","num":"0089"},"figref":["FIG. 2C","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2C"],"b":["230","284","1","234","284","234","284","284","234","234","284","234","284"],"i":["b ","a ","a ","a","a ","a ","a "],"sub":"S"},"After some number, n, of circuits through the optical loop, (represented in  by the time interval n \u03c4), a demand for the stored photon b is made by sending a pulse (p) to raise the electric state of the Pockels cell  to the on state.

The amount of this extension is a design consideration to balance the chances of capturing an unwanted photon with the advantages of a loop interval as short compared to the Pockels cell rise time as possible. In some embodiments, the trailing edge of p is extended because the photon is already released and can't be released twice. Again the amount of the extension is a design choice to balance the chances of inadvertently capturing a stray photon after releasing photon b.","When it is known that a photon will be demanded at some later time, the uncertain source  is pumped early enough before the expected demand so that a photon pair is almost certainly produced some time before the demand.

In the example setup embodiment, the single photon detector  is a PERKIN ELMER model SPCM-AQR-12 single-photon counting avalanche photodiode that generates a transistor-transistor logic (TTL) pulse, pD, along connection , when a single-photon is detected. Two independent CANBERRA model 410A electronic gate-and-delay (GD) generators are used. The GD generators , generate pulses p and p, respectively, based on receiving the pulse pD from the detector  along connection . Pulse p is used to time the second capture state of the Pockels cell , and pulse p is used to time a release state to simulate a demand for the captured photon, as shown in . These GD generators are configured to generate pulses with a minimum duration of about 100 ns, which is sufficient to test the operation of the source, even with a loop interval of 13 ns, as is described in more detail below. The OR gate  is used so that either pulse p or p may be used as input to driver  of the Pockels cell . The driver  converts the pulses as necessary to generate on and off states in the Pockels cell , such as by amplification, or by changing a bias voltage on the Pockels cell based on pulses p and p.","The optical path , for photon b, includes fiber couplers , , fiber delay line , fiber polarization controller , and mirrors , . These elements serve to direct photon b into an optical input of the source with a sufficient delay to account for the time of operation of controller  and Pockels cell . In the example embodiment, the avalanche photo-detector consumes 18 ns to produce the leading edge of pulse pD, the GD generators , were each configured with a dead time of 200 ns so that the production of the trailing edge of pulse p consumed 300 ns. The OR gate  imposed 18 ns of delay, and the amplifiers in driver  imposed about 38 ns of delay. Various coaxial cables used as electrical connections  imparted an additional 60 ns of delay. Therefore photon b is delayed about 434 ns or more in optical path ","Any suitable devices known in the art at the time a setup is implemented may be used in optical path to delay the arrival of photon b. In the example embodiment, the fiber couples , optically couple a photon into and out of the optical fiber delay line . The fiber couples , are made of suitable microscope objective lenses mounted on micro-translational stages, and the fiber optic delay line  is made up of a 3M brand FS-3224 single mode fiber long enough to provide over 500 ns of delay. A standard fiber polarization controller  is used to negate the effects of birefringence induced by the fiber. Mirrors , steer photon b, still vertically polarized, into polarizing beam splitter (PBS)  of the electro-optic switch.","The switch includes PBS  and Pockels cell . The PBS  reflects a vertically polarized photon b into the Pockels cell . In this setup, the Pockels cell is arranged with its fast and slow axes rotated 45 degrees from vertical polarization. The Pockels  cell is in the off state, so as not to rotate an incident photon, when it is biased with a direct current voltage to cause no rotation of an incident photon. The Pockels cell  is in an on state, to rotate polarization of an incident photon by 90 degrees, when a measured half wave voltage is applied. The measured half wave voltage is roughly 115 volts (V) at wavelengths of 702.2 nm for the switching times used in the example setup. An additional half-wave plate  is included for diagnostic tests described in a later section. When the switch is operated normally, the half-wave plate  is oriented so that it does not rotate the polarization of an incident photon.","The storage loop  includes a 4 meter long optical path in free space. Disposed in the storage loop  are a right angle prism , mirrors , , , , and lenses , . In order to minimize divergence of photons following this path, and maximize a total number of round trips a single photon can reliably propagate through the storage loop, the two lenses , are included, each with one meter focal length. Lens and prism  are mounted on longitudinal translation stages to form a Gaussian transmission line that can be optimized by the relative positions of the lens and prism . The degree of collimation produced by fiber coupler is adjusted to mode-match a beam into the storage loop to reduce the chances of losing a single photon passing through the fiber delay line . This matching is accomplished in a setup calibration phase, during which bright light at 694 nm from a laser diode is coupled into the fiber delay line .","To properly time the on and off states of the Pockels cell  with 100 ns pulse lengths in pulses p and p, in the example setup , the leading edges of pulses p and p are adjusted. The leading edge of pulse p is timed so that the Pockels cell transition from on to off, 100 ns later at the trailing edge of p, occurs immediately after the first pass of photon b through the Pockels cell. The leading edge of pulse p is timed so that the Pockels cell transition from off bark to on, based on the leading edge of pulse p, occurs just before the arrival of photon b during its final pass through the Pockels cell. The 100 ns extent of pulse p, which would rotate any following photons, is irrelevant because the only photon in the optical loop has already been released. The timing of p was set to a fixed value relative to detection at detector , and the timing of pulse p was set to several different values after detection at detector , to demonstrate the ability to release the captured photon on demand after a chosen number of round trips through the optical loop.","The output detector  and coincident counter  are used for determining the operation of the certain source. A second filter  limits detection at detector  to photons with the proper wavelength. In the example embodiment, the detector  is a second single-photon avalanche photodiode, and the filter  is a second bandpass filter centered at 700 nm with a pass band of 10 nm. When the stored photon is output on demand, it impinges on detector , which generates a second detector pulse pD. Another pulse from GD generator is sent to the coincident counter  to determine the time of the output photon relative to the detection of photon a, the trigger photon.","2.5 Example Results","The experimental setup  was first operated with the Pockels cell in the off state so that it did not rotate the polarization of an incident photon to capture, loop or release the photon. This was done to determine the rate of loss of photons in the optical loop including the storage loop and switch.","The half-wave plate  was oriented to rotate an incident photon by 45 degrees. This generates a photon in a superposition state in which there is a 50% chance the rotated photon will be measured as horizontally polarized and 50% chance it will be measured as vertically polarized. Therefore when the rotated photon impinges on the PBS  there is a 50% chance it will be transmitted back into the storage loop as horizontally polarized (and therefore \u201cmeasured\u201d as horizontally polarized). Similarly, there is a 50% chance it will be reflected to output path as vertically polarized and detected in detector  and therefore \u201cmeasured\u201d as vertically polarized.","If the experiment is repeated sequentially hundreds of times with hundreds of single photons, and the optical loop is perfectly efficient, it is expected that 50 percent of the photons will be reflected out after the first pass, 50% of the remainder out after the second pass, and so on. The number of photons detected at detector  after each 13 ns pass though the optical loop should fall by a factor of two. This is described by a curve of the form (\u00bd), where n is the number of passes through the loop (given by time after detection and delay divided by the loop time, e.g. 13 ns). If the optical loop is not perfectly efficient, as is expected, the number of photons detected at detector  will fall off faster than (\u00bd).","This experiment was repeated with about 5000 single photons over a 30 minute period. As expected, the number of photons detected after each round trip decreased by more than a factor of two. The data fit a curve of the form ( 1\/2.7)indicating a loss of about 26% per round trip. The majority of this loss is due to optical losses in the various components used to form the storage loop.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0113","num":"0112"},"figref":["FIGS. 5A","FIG. 4","FIGS. 5A"],"b":["5","5","5","2","433","5","5","5","502","420","410","504","492","1","484","420","1","434","434","434","434","440"],"i":["b","a "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0114","num":"0113"},"figref":"FIG. 5A","b":["510","2","484","420","2","434","434","492","494","450","512","510","400","2","513"],"i":"b"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0115","num":"0114"},"figref":["FIGS. 5B","FIG. 5A"],"b":["5","5","520","530","540","2","522","532","542","400","520","530","540","523","533","543"]},"However, the system is not perfect. Traces , , ,  indicate some counts throughout the recording interval from about 8 ns to about 70 ns, with small peaks corresponding to the time of each complete pass through the optical loop. The small peaks indicate that a photon is sometimes released from the optical loop before pulse p is received, and that a photon is sometimes not released on the pass when the pulse p is received but at some later pass. It is believed that the small peaks are due to switching errors caused by photons diverging in the storage loop and not passing through the Pockels cell within a proper range of angles. Outside the proper range of angles, the Pockels cell does not apply the correct half-wave voltage to an entire wave front associated with a propagating photon.","In the results obtained with setup , the effects of false triggering events and photon losses where greater than the effects of 26% loss per pass through the loop and the switching errors. False triggering events occur when the detector  generates an output signal even though a photon has not impinged on the detector\u2014a so-called \u201cdark count.\u201d As a consequence of dark counts, many fewer photons are stored in the optical loop than indicated by detector . Photon loss errors occur when a real photon a is detected at detector  but photon b is lost before entering the storage loop .","In practice, neither of these errors represents a major drawback for the single photon source. The effects of dark counts can be reduced to a low level by the use of femtosecond pulsed down-conversion as the source of the photon pair. Such sources allow gating of the detector  so that output from the detector is ignored except during the small fraction of the time after each pulse that an output pair is possible. For the photon loss problem, recent down-conversion experiments have shown that a near unity ratio of detection rates can be achieved (e.g., P. G. Kwait, A. M. Steinberg, R. Y. Chian, P. H. Eberhard, and M. D. Petroff, Appl. Opt. 33, 1844, 1994). In addition, new techniques for efficiently coupling down-conversion radiation into optical fibers have been demonstrated (e.g., C. Kurtsiefer, M. Oberparleiter, and H. Weinfurter, Phys. Rev. A 64, 023802, 2001).","The probability of two down-conversion pairs being emitted within the switching time is negligible, because, in general, the source of the photon pair is pumped in the conventional regime where the time between emissions is long compared to the switching time (on the order of 10 ns).","Problems associated with low quantum efficiency of the detector  are expected to be irrelevant, since an undetected trigger photon, photon a, will not cause a photon b to be captured, and the apparatus can be run long enough until a trigger photon is actually detected. To prevent un-triggered photons from entering the storage loop, the pulse pl can be made shorter. In addition, an additional switch, or switch electronic state, or switch component, could be used to prevent un-triggered photons from entering the storage loop.","3. Cyclical Quantum Memory","As described in the background section, there is a need for a memory for qubits represented by arbitrary polarization states of single photons.

After some time, the qubit is demanded from the CQM, and a photon with a polarization coherently related to the initial polarization is emitted along optical output ","The operation of the device  can be understood by first considering the case in which the EO device is not turned on. In this case, the vertical component of the incident qubit is reflected to path and travels clockwise through the Sagnac switch to mirror , path , EO device , path mirror , path and back into PBS , still vertically polarized. In PBS , the vertical component is reflected into the storage loop  onto mirror . After reflection, the photon retraces its path in reverse order, is reflected by PBS to propagate counterclockwise in the Sagnac switch and returned to PBS . Still vertically polarized, the vertical component is reflected to optical output . The vertical component represents those photons that would be measured as vertical.","The horizontal component is first transmitted through PBS to travel counterclockwise through Sagnac switch , up into storage loop  to mirror . After reflection, the photon retraces its path in reverse order, is transmitted by PBS to propagate clockwise in the Sagnac switch and returned to PBS . Still horizontally polarized, the horizontal component is transmitted to optical output . The horizontal component represents those photons that would be measured as horizontal.","Thus, whether the initial photon incident on optical input would be measured as horizontally or vertically polarized, it passes through the optical loop and is output along optical output The output does not depend on the state of the photon, therefore the probabilities being measured in either state have not changed and the superposition is preserved.","If there were no losses and no polarization-dependent phase shift, the output photon would emerge in the same superposition state as the initial photon, i.e., |\u03c8]=|\u03c8]. In any device there is some phase shifts due to birefringence and some propagation losses. Usually, thermally or vibrationally induced phase shifts are even greater than phase-shifts due to birefringence. For example, in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, thermal and vibrational phase shifts can easily ruin the coherence of the horizontal and vertical superposition states of a propagating photon.","In the CQM, the horizontal and vertical components follow the same path, but in opposite directions. Therefore the thermal and vibrational phase shifts are essentially the same for both components and any phase shifts apply equally to both components, thus preserving the coherence of the propagating photon.","In order for the CQM to store the qubit for more than one round trip (or pass) through the optical loop, the Pockels cell serving as the EO device  is turned on while the photon is propagating in the storage line for the first time. Thus, in the illustrated embodiment, the capture electric state for the Sagnac switch  is an on state properly timed while the photon is in the storage loop . Upon subsequent passes through the Sagnac switch , the photon's polarization is repeatedly flipped if the EO device  remains in the on electrical state. After each flip, each component of the photon polarization is returned by the PBS  to the storage loop  instead of exiting the device along the optical output . The photon remains trapped in the optical loop as long as the Pockel's cell is in the on electrical state. Thus the loop state is an on electrical state in the illustrated embodiment. When the Pockel's cell is turned to the off electrical state, the final values of the counter-propagating horizontal and vertical components are those required to release the photon from the device. Thus the release state is an off electrical state in the illustrated embodiment.","The loop and release states can be demonstrated for the initial vertical component. After reflection from the mirror and PBS , the vertical component reflects off mirror and transits the Pockels cell serving as the EO device . The photon is emitted as horizontally polarized, and thus becomes a horizontal component of the photon. After reflection at mirror , it is transmitted by PBS  back onto the storage loop . The horizontal component is reflected at mirror , transmitted through PBS , reflected from mirror and passed through Pockels cell as EO device . If the Pockels cell is still on, the photon emerges as vertically polarized along path , is reflected at mirror and PBS  back into the storage loop. It returns to PBS , is reflected to mirror and then to the Pockels cell serving as EO device . If the Pockels cell is still on, the photon emerges as a horizontal component and repeats the cycle just described. If the Pockels cell is off, the photon emerges still vertically polarized and, after reflection at mirror is reflected by PBS  to the optical output . The same reasoning applies to the initial horizontal component, at any moment propagating through the Sagnac switch in the opposite direction to the initial vertical component.","A characteristic of the embodiment  is that if the Pockels cell is turned off when the initial vertical component is propagating as a horizontal component (and therefore the initial horizontal component is propagating as a vertical component), the photon emitted along optical output is bit flipped with respect to the initial input photon. This occurs after the photon has made an even number of trips through the storage loop and is represented by the superposition state symbol |\u03c8]. After an odd number of trips through the storage loop, the photon emitted along optical output is the same as the initial input photon and is represented by the superposition state symbol |\u03c8]. This can be expressed by the relationships in Equation 2:\n\n|\u03c8]\u2003\u2003(2a)\n\n|\u03c8]=|\u03c8]\u2003\u2003(2b)\n\n|\u03c8]=\u03c3|\u03c8]\u2003\u2003(2c)\n\nwhere the symbol \u03c3represents a bit-flip operation.\n","The bit-flipping characteristic of the CQM embodiment  can be accommodated a number of ways in different embodiments that utilize this CQM. In one embodiment, the CQM round trip time (\u201cloop interval\u201d) is selected to be half a cycle time of a quantum computer using the CQM so that a qubit is always retrieved after an odd number of trips through the storage loop. In another approach, a feed-forward control can be used to re-flip photons representing qubits retrieved after an even number of trips through the storage loop. In some embodiments, the bit-flipped qubit returned from the CQM after an even number of passes is used in subsequent logic gates that allow for the bit-flipped value.","By repeatedly flipping polarization states for looping photons, certain types of errors automatically correct themselves. For example, unwanted polarization-dependent phase shifts imparted in the storage line affect each of the two initial components an equal number of times for qubits retrieved after an even number of trips through the storage loop. As a result, the accumulated phase shift over an even number n of multiple passes factors out of the final state. Similarly, the net relative phase shift for qubits retrieved after an odd number n of trips through the storage loop is only that due to the final trip, and not the accumulation of phase shifts due to the previous n- trips. The phase shift between components does not practically increase beyond the phase shift induced by one trip through the storage loop. Therefore, the phase shift between components does not increase with the number of passes through the storage loop or the optical loop.","The CQM device  involves timing the transition of the EO device  from an off electrical state to on electrical state after a photon has propagated once through the EO device  and before the photon returns from the storage loop . Thus an electric controller for controlling the electrical state of the EO device  should determine when a qubit for storage is incident on the device, e.g., at PBS . This can be done in any way known in the art, when the CQM is implemented. In some embodiments, the controller determines when a qubit is produced according to a particular quantum computing circuit by counting cycles of the quantum computer. In many embodiments of quantum logic devices, a qubit is produced probabilistically at a time that cannot be predicted. However, in many of these devices, the generation of a correct qubit is determined by detecting one or more ancillary photons and generating classical information based on such detections to allow the correct qubit to propagate to the next device. Therefore, in some embodiments, the classical information used to determine the production of a correct qubit is also used to time the change of state of the EO device  to store the qubit.","3.3 Example Setup",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0141","num":"0140"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 4"],"b":["700","700","750","710","710","790","480","490","492","494"],"i":["a","b"]},"The CQM includes a Sagnac switch  and a storage loop .

NPBS  couples qubits into the CQM optical input mode directed toward the right face of PBS . With the NPBS , the ratio of photons received over optical path to photons that are both input into the CQM and output from the CQM into detector  is expected to be 0.25.","The CQM outputs a qubit on the optical output, which is a spatial mode directed away from the right face of PBS . The polarization state of the output qubit is determined using the polarization analyzer , along with the filter , output detector  and coincident counter  described above. The polarization analyzer  is rotated to preferentially pass photons in a given polarization, as described in more detail below.","3.4 Example Results",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0149","num":"0148"},"figref":["FIGS. 8A","FIG. 7","FIGS. 8A","FIG. 7"],"b":["8","8","8","8","1","2","8","8","8","8","790","700","790"]},"In each of , B, C, D, E the abscissa axis  is time in ns after detection of photon a at detector , corrected for delay in path , passage through the Sagnac switch , and arrival at detector .

This loss per pass is associated with the optics of the optical loop, including the storage loop  and switch , as determined in experiments similar to experiments described above for setup . In these experiments, the Pockels cell is left \u201coff\u201d to flip polarizations on each pass and the half-wave plate  is oriented to rotate a photon's polarization by 45 degrees. Of this 19% loss per pass, it is estimated that 15% is due to reflection and transmission losses of the various optical components, and 4% is due to imperfect focusing in the 2F Gaussian transmission line. Small peaks at other times are due to switching errors, as described above for setup .","The capacity of the CQM to maintain qubit coherence is determined by testing the polarization state of the qubit emitted along the optical output. For these tests, the polarization analyzer  is included in the experimental setup and rotated to pass qubits in a particular polarization state. , B, C, D, E are graphs , , , ,  that illustrate experimental results for coherent polarization states of a stored qubit by operating the experimental setup of , according to several embodiments with different times for pulse p and p.

With an increase in the number of passes through the storage loop, as shown successively in  through , the maximum counting rate and the agreement with the cosine-squared curve decrease, somewhat, as would be expected in a setup that has not been optimized for performance. It is believed that the decreased agreement with the cosine-squared curves is due to small misalignments of the mirrors , , which produce spatial offsets that accumulate with each pass through the storage loop . These spatial offsets can reduce the spatial overlap of the horizontal and vertical components on the optical output, thereby reducing the interference conditions utilized to maintain the coherence of the qubit. Such errors are expected to be substantially reduced in different embodiments, which use fiber optic components rather than free-space components in the CQM.","The illustrated embodiments of the CQM demonstrate that qubits represented by polarization states of single photons can be stored in a simple free-space optical loop. Optical approaches to quantum computing are likely to involve the use of trains of intense laser pulses, such as those generated from mode-locked Ti-sapphire lasers, to generate input qubits for optical quantum logic gates. Such trains of pulses provide a natural clock cycle for a quantum computer. A CQM as illustrated here is ideally suited for storage of qubits generated by these gates for one or more such clock cycles.","In the foregoing specification, the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments thereof.
