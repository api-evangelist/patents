Moreover, it should be noted that the language used in the specification has been principally selected for readability and instructional purposes, and not to limit the scope of the inventive subject matter.","Techniques are disclosed for improving the dynamic performance of digital-to-analog converters (DAC), by compensating for the unique delay characteristics of each bit in the DAC summing junction to equalize the delays. Such parasitic wiring delay causes degradation of spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR), which is a metric of dynamic DAC performance. The DAC may be implemented, for example, either as part of a direct digital synthesis (DDS) system or as a stand-alone circuit having numerous applications. The techniques can be employed, for instance, in a system implemented in semiconductor materials (system-on-chip, or chip set) or with discrete components on a printed circuit board. This delay compensation effectively accounts for variations in propagation delays due to process variations.","General Overview","As previously explained, typical DAC circuits employed in DDS applications generally suffer from poor dynamic performance. One subtle but non-trivial problem is that high-speed DAC summing junctions have delay from bit to bit due to wiring parasitics on the summing junction. Although the delay from the parasitics does not impact traditional static DAC metrics such as integrated non-linearity and differential non-linearity, the delay can affect dynamic DAC performance metrics such as signal to noise ratio (SNR) and SFDR.","In more detail, for optimal dynamic performance, all of the DAC bit switches should ideally switch synchronously with the clock, and impact the DAC output node at the same time (or within a negligible tolerance of one another). However, parasitic wiring delays cause the effective delay time of each input bit node to be different with respect to the DAC output node. This problem is demonstrated in , which illustrates a schematic diagram of a typical DAC circuit.","This example DAC configuration includes a 4-bit input (Bit , Bit , Bit , and Bit ) and the corresponding current sources (I, I, I, and I) and switches (S, S, S, and S), with each switch S, S, S, and Sconnected to a summing junction as commonly done. In operation, each 4-bit digital signal at the DAC input is converted to an analog current at the summing junction and provided at the DAC output. Although a 4-bit resolution is shown, the resolution can be decreased\/increased as needed (by subtracting\/adding input bits and corresponding switched current sources). Such switched current source DAC configurations can drive a resistive load (R) directly, and are particularly suitable for high speed applications.","Also shown in the schematic are various parasitic wiring delays (\u03c4, \u03c4, and \u03c4) associated with the summing junction. Each wire delay is associated with one or more input bits. For example, if Bit  and Bit  were switched simultaneously (such that Sand Sare closed thereby activating current sources Iand I), the effect of Bit  on the DAC output would occur \u03c4+\u03c4after the effect of Bit  on the DAC output. Table 1 demonstrates the wire delays associated with each of the bits in one such example case.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Wiring delays associated with each bit"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"133pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Bit","Summing Junction Wiring Delays"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["0","\u03c4, \u03c4, \u03c4"]},{"entry":["1","\u03c4, \u03c4"]},{"entry":["2","\u03c4"]},{"entry":["3","none"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}},"br":{}},"As such, and in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the DAC performance can be improved, based on for example dynamic SNR and\/or SFDR metrics of the DAC, can be improved by compensating for the parasitic wiring delays (\u03c4, \u03c4, and \u03c4) up to the current switches (S, S, S, and S) of the DAC. This compensation can be provided, for example, using transmission lines on each bit\/switch control line or other suitable delay mechanisms that can be deployed to equalize the overall delay associated with each bit\/control line. In any case, the compensation allows switches S, S, S, and Sto impact the output node simultaneously (or otherwise within an acceptable tolerance of one another, such that all switching caused by the digital input impacts the output within a given time window).","Parasitic Wiring Delay Compensation",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 2","sub":["wiringdelay0","wiringdelay1","wiringdelay2"]},"As can be seen, the example DAC circuit with delay compensation can be implemented in a similar fashion as the DAC circuit shown in , except for the addition of the delay compensation elements (\u03c4, \u03c4, and \u03c4), which shall be discussed in turn. The previous discussion with respect to typical DAC circuit components such as the 4-bit input (Bit , Bit , Bit , and Bit ), current sources (I, I, I, and I), switches (S, S, S, and S), and parasitic wiring delays (\u03c4, \u03c4, and \u03c4), is equally applicable here.","As will be appreciated, any number of input bits (DAC resolution) can be used in conjunction with the bit delay compensation scheme provided herein. The DAC configuration may vary as well. For instance, in some embodiments, the DAC circuit with delay compensation may be implemented as a binary-weighted DAC (e.g., R-2R ladder DAC), or a thermometer-coded DAC, or a combination thereof. In general, any DAC circuit configuration that is susceptible to poor dynamic performance due to unequal delay times of each input bit node with respect to the DAC output node can benefit from an embodiment of the present invention.","In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, switching the input bits with compensating time delays (\u03c4, \u03c4, and \u03c4) in conjunction with the parasitic wiring delays (\u03c4, \u03c4, and \u03c4) on the summing junction equalizes the total delay of any one input bit with respect to any other input bit, and therefore results in all bit switches (S, S, S, and S) impacting the output node simultaneously (or within a negligible tolerance). For example, if \u03c4is set equal to 0 and \u03c4is set to equal to \u03c4+\u03c4+\u03c4, then bit  and bit  will switch simultaneously at the output node, thereby improving dynamic DAC performance, relative to an uncompensated DAC having non-equalized bit (current switch control line) inputs.

For instance, given a DAC clock speed in the range of 10 GHz to 30 GHz, the bit switches (S, S, S, and S) will be considered to be impacting the output node simultaneously if they do so within 100 femtoseconds (fs) or less of one another. The tolerance for slower clock speeds may be greater (e.g., <700 femtoseconds), and for faster clocks speeds may be lower (e.g., <50 femtoseconds). In this sense, all switching caused by the digital input (Bit , Bit , Bit , and Bit ) impacts the output within a predefined time window or less (whether it be a 50 fs, 100 fs, 200 fs, 400 fs, or other suitable window). In a more general sense, any suitable tolerance can be used, so long as the dynamic DAC performance (e.g., SNR and SFDR) is not degraded to unacceptable levels for a given application.","The compensation elements \u03c4, \u03c4, and \u03c4, can be implemented, for example, as transmission lines, such as microstrips, meanderlines, and\/or waveguides. Such transmission lines can be fabricated, for instance, during a back-end of a semiconductor process. During the front-end of the process, components such as the transistors, resistors, etc are created. The back-end is where metal interconnects and other metal layers or features (such as the transmission lines or other such delay compensation elements) can be created.","Any number of suitable semiconductor process technologies and material systems can be used in fabricating the DAC circuit with delay compensation. For example, for higher speed applications (e.g., in excess of 10 GHz), the DAC can be implemented, for instance, in heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) and\/or high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) technology. However, if such high speeds are not necessary (e.g., less than 2 GHz), then other technologies such as complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology can be utilized. Example materials from which the system can be implemented include III-V material systems such as gallium arsenide (GaAs) or indium phosphide (InP), or other suitable semiconductor material systems.","Compensation Delay Elements",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["0","1","2"]},"In more detail, parasitic  includes the RC time constant of RC, parasitic  includes the RC time constant of RC, and parasitic  includes the RC time constant of RC. As will further be appreciated, these RC time constants can vary from one DAC design to the next, or even within the same design due to variations in the devices and metallization from circuit to circuit within a single wafer as well as variation between lots of wafers.","In one specific embodiment, the transmission lines TX line , TX line , and TX line  are implemented as microstrips. A specific example transmission line configuration is an aluminum microstrip line that is 2 um to 6 um (e.g., 4 um) tall, 2 um to 8 um (e.g., 5 um) wide, and 1 um to 7 um (e.g., 4 um) above an aluminum ground plane. A dielectric can be deployed between the ground plane and the transmission line, such as polyimide or silicon dioxide or silicon nitride or benzocyclobutene or other suitable dielectric materials. Typical transmission line and ground plane materials include, for example, copper, gold, and aluminum.","In other embodiments, and as previously explained, the transmission lines TX line , TX line , and TX line  can be implemented with other suitable transmission line types, such as meanderlines or waveguides. Alternatively, the compensation delay provided by the transmission lines TX line , TX line , and TX line  in this example embodiment could be provided by one or more active devices such as unity gain buffer or other logic gate configuration. In general, any device that provides a desired amount or unit of propagation delay can be used as a delay compensation element, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","In an integrated circuit application, the transmission lines TX line , TX line , and TX line  (or other suitable compensation delay elements) can be implemented in the back-end process (e.g., during formation of the DAC interconnect structure). Alternatively, in an embodiment where the compensation delay element is a buffer or other active device, those compensation delay elements can be provided in the front-end of the process (e.g., along with the current switches etc). A serial path of such active devices can be provided, with each device providing a unit of delay contributing to the overall desired amount of compensation delay.","The length of each transmission line TX line , TX line , and TX line  can be varied to achieve the desired compensation delay. The desired length can be determined, for example, using a calibration procedure carried out empirically and\/or through simulation. In one such case, pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) bit streams can be driven into each of the DAC input bits individually on each current switch to measure the relative delays from the input of each current switch to the overall DAC output. The differences in the delay times can be used to determine the lengths of the transmission lines needed to equalize the delays associated with the current switches. When all of the transmission lines are physically laid-out in design, the layout can be extracted and re-simulated to determine if any additional adjustment\/refining is needed to ensure that the delays are equalized within a given tolerance (e.g., <200 femtoseconds).","As will be appreciated in light of this disclosure, the delay compensation element type, dimensions, and materials can vary from one embodiment to the next, and the claimed invention is not intended to be limited to any particular compensation delay element type\/configuration\/material system. For example, for integrated DAC circuit applications using transmission lines for the compensation delay elements (such as the example embodiment shown in ), the dimension of the compensation delay elements as well as the number of compensation delay elements will depend on factors such as the interconnect layout of the DAC circuit and the desired accuracy of the compensation delay to be provided. In some such applications, the DAC may be implemented, for example, either as part of an overall system-on-chip, where the compensation delay elements are configured to provide a complete on-board compensation scheme for compensating for both on-chip and off-chip delays.","In other embodiments, the compensation delay elements can be implemented using serial logic buffers that can be selectively coupled into the DAC bit switch path, such as the example embodiments shown in and . In short, an adjustable compensation delay element as shown in and can be used to replace each of the transmission line based delay elements shown in . Such programmable delay may be helpful, for instance, for DAC applications subjected to environmental changes (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc) or any other changes that may impact dynamic DAC performance after deployment of the DAC.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 4","i":"a ","b":["0","1","2","0","0","1","1","2","2"]},"This configuration allows for the selection of discrete delay increments, as provided by the buffers A-G. In general, each of the buffers A-G is associated with a fixed propagation delay, which can be exploited to delay the DAC current switch control input by a known amount. The buffers can be implemented with any suitable buffer technology, and in one example case are implemented with unity gain buffers (voltage followers). Other embodiments may utilize buffers having amplifying or attenuating capability, if so desired. The multiplexers Mux , Mux , and Mux  can be implemented, for example, with a conventional high-speed multiplexer circuit design (e.g., such as the SN54\/74LS157), and are used to select the desired amount of delay.","In operation, this example adjustable compensation delay element allows for selection of 0 to 6 buffer delays, not counting buffer A (the delay of which is constantly applied). Such an implementation can be used, for instance, to provide full parasitic delay compensation coverage for DAC circuits operating up to 30 GHz. Note, however, that higher operating frequencies can be used by scaling the number of buffers and multiplexers accordingly.

For instance, and with reference to the example of Table 5, if the DAC clock is set to 40 GHz and the operating temperature of the environment in which the DAC is operating is in the range of 35 to 45\u00b0 C., then a delay select control signal of 011 (assuming a 3-bit DSCS) is the one that provided optimal DAC dynamic performance (for the known set of stimulus) of all the available delay select control signals.","The processor can be implemented with any suitable processor technology, such as a programmable microprocessor or a microcontroller programmed or otherwise configured to carry out the methodologies described herein. For example, a microcontroller configured with a number of input\/output ports and a number of embedded routines for interrogating the current DAC operating parameter set and identifying a suitable DSCS. The input ports can each receive a signal indicative of a given operating parameter, and an output port can provide the desired DSCS. The LUT can be stored in a memory on-board or otherwise accessible by the microcontroller. The microcontroller may further include memory (e.g., ROM or flash) for storing the various routines as well as workspace (e.g., random access memory) for executing those routines.

For instance, in another embodiment, rather than using a look-up table populated with empirically developed data, the processor can be programmed to monitor for changes in the DAC operating parameter set, and when such a change is detected, the calibration mode can be entered where known stimulus (clock, temp, etc) are input to the DAC (in the given environment of interest). During calibration mode, the DAC output can be monitored in real-time for accuracy as the available delay select control signals are sequentially cycled through. After all available delay select control signals are tested, the one providing the DAC output closest in value to the desired DAC output value can be used for normal mode operation.","The foregoing description of the embodiments of the invention has been presented for the purposes of illustration and description.
