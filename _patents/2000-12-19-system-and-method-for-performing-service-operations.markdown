{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND ART","DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION","BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION","INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to service operations for machine and more particularly, to a system and method for sharing information regarding a machine between service tools.","Computer software tools are used in performing service type operations for certain types of machines. For example, field technicians utilize a number of tools to diagnose, retrieve information stored in external databases, retrieve information from sources on the machines, such as electronic control modules, and the like.","Typically, such tools are computer based and reside in a portable computer such as a notebook computer. Such tools were designed to communicate, i.e., share information using one of several different interprocess communication protocols, e.g., the Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP), Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE), or the Component Object Model (COM).","With the advent of these tools, it has been become desirable to link the various software tools to share and exchange information or control data. However, since the various software tools did not share a common communication protocol, the software tools would normally have to be revised to include integration modules which facilitated communication between one tool and one other tool.","Revising the tools to use a single protocol is time consuming and inefficient. Additionally, different protocols have different benefits which may be suitable for one tool and not for another.","The present invention is directed to overcoming one or more of the problems as set forth above.","In one aspect of the present invention a system for performing service operations on a machine is provided. The system includes first and second computer based service tools and a computer based workbench. The computer based workbench includes first and second application proxies and a binary network object with first and second interfaces. The application proxies are connected to one another through a stable integration protocol and binary network object. The first application proxy is coupled to the first computer based service tool and the second application proxy is coupled to the second computer based service tool. The first computer based service tool has access to service information in the second computer based service tool through the computer based workbench.","In another aspect of the present invention a method for sharing service information between first and second service tools is provided. The method includes the steps providing a binary network object having first and second interfaces. The method also includes the steps of providing a first application proxy coupled to the first interface and providing a second application proxy coupled to the second interface. The method further includes the step of sharing service information between the first and second computer based service tools through the first and second application proxies and the first and second interfaces.","With reference to the drawings and in operation, the present invention provides a system  and method for performing service operations on a machine . With specific reference to , the system includes first and second computer based service tools A,B.","The system  also includes a computer based workbench  which includes a binary network object . The binary network object  includes first and second interfaces A, B. As described below, the binary network object  allows the first and second service tools A, B to communicate, i.e., share information.","Preferably, the workbench  is a computer based tool implemented on a portable computer (not shown) with at least one of the first and second computer based service tools A, B.","The workbench  provides a common graphical user interface (see below) for a user to access and operate the first and second computer based service tools A, B.","The workbench  includes a first application proxy A and a second application proxy B coupled to the first and second service tools A, B respectively.","The first and second application proxies A, B each includes a constant portion A, B and an application programming interface A, B.","In the preferred embodiment, the binary network object  is implemented using the Component Object Model or COM. The binary network object  includes first and second interfaces A, B coupled to the constant portions A, B of the first and second application proxies A, B, respectively.","As described below, this arrangement allows one of the first and second computer based service tools A, B to have access to information on the other service tool A, B.","With reference to , a method  for sharing service information between the first and second service tools A, B is shown. In a first control block , the binary network object  having first and second interfaces A, B is provided. In a second control block , the first application proxy coupled to the first interface is provided. In a third control block , the second application proxy coupled to the second interface is provided. In a fourth control block , service information is shared between the first and second service tools A, B through the first and second application proxies A, B and the first and second interfaces A, B.","With reference to , a system  for providing service operations to a work machine  is illustrated. The work machine can be any sort of machine such as an earthmoving machine, construction machine, transportation machine, engine, computer, air conditioner, etc. . . This list is exemplary only and not intended to be exclusive. In the system  a plurality of service tools A-F are provided.","A Diagnostic Advisor A provides a computer based method and system and a computer program for providing case based diagnostics for the work machine .","A Service Information System (SIS) B includes service information related to the work machine . Preferably, the SIS B includes system functional tests, diagnostic code procedures, and other service information.","An Electronic Technician (ET) C is a computer software program for communication with electronic controls the work machine  and for retrieving information therefrom. The ET C is coupled to an onboard datalink and is able to read diagnostic and event codes, status parameters in real-time and to perform electronic control module calibrations and configurations.","A Data View Module D for viewing data related to the work machine . For example, the Data View Module D is able to read (remotely) and display sensor data.","An Engine Performance Estimator (EPE) E and a Reports and Feedback Module F are also provided. The EPE E is a service tool designed specifically for truck engines to help a field technician resolve customer performance complaints, e.g., low power and\/or poor fuel economy.","The prior enumeration of service tools is exemplary only and not intended to be exclusive.","The service tools A-F are able to share information through a workbench . For example, the Diagnostic Advisor A may contain links to information contained in the SIS B to support its recommendations. The Diagnostic Advisor A, SIS B, Electronic Technician C, Data View Module D, EPE and Reports and Feedback Module F are discussed further in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/742,879 filed on Dec. 20, 2000 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/745,228 filed on Dec. 20, 2000, which are hereby incorporated by reference.","The workbench  includes a binary network object  having first through sixth interfaces A-object  having first through sixth interfaces A-F. First through sixth application proxies A-F couple the service tools A-F to the workbench  and each other A-F via the respective interface A-F.","In the preferred embodiment, the system  and method  of the present invention is embodied in a computer program product, i.e., software. The computer program product comprises a computer useable storage medium having computer readable program code means embodied in the medium.","With reference to , the present invention provides a graphical user interface  for use by the user  to interface with the system . The graphical user interface  includes Menu Bar , a Tool Bar , an application container , and a Launch Pad . The Launch Pad  includes a plurality of buttons for providing access to the service tools A-B, A-F.

Actuation of a button A-F launches a respective service tools A-F in the application container .","Each of the service tools A-B, A-F were designed to communicate externally, i.e., to the other service tools A-B, A-F through the workbench , , using a communication protocol suitable to the service tool and its operation. For example, the Electronic Technician C communicates using the Dynamic Data Exchange protocol (DDE), the Diagnostic Advisor A communicates using the Component Object Model (COM), the SIS B communicates using the Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP), and the Data View Module D uses operating system messages to implement focus switching functionality.","As described above, each of the service tools A, B, A-F is accessible through the graphical user interface  of the workbench , . The workbench ,  consolidates access to all of the service tools A, B, A-F through a single sign-on and provides a common look and feel.","The application proxy A, B, A-F for each service tool A, B, A-F includes a constant portion A, B, A-F and an application programming interface A, B, A-F. The constant portion A, B, A-F allows a service tool A, B, A-F to communicate with the other service tools A, B, A-F. The constant portion A, B, A-F typically does not change. The application programming interface A, B, A-F couples the constant portions A, B, A-F with the respective service tool A, B, A-F. The application programming interface A, B, A-F is custom written for each service tool A, B, A-F A-F in a variety of interprocess communication protocols (DDE, COM, TCP\/IP, etc.). This allows the service tools A, B, A-F to be updated with the latest technology (code, platform, etc.) without affecting the communications between the service tools A, B, A-F and without modification of the constant portion A, B, A-F. This allows for a seamless flow of information and control data between the service tools A, B, A-F thereby saving programming time and effort.","Other aspects, objects, and features of the present invention can be obtained from a study of the drawings, the disclosure, and the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00010","num":"00010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00011","num":"00011"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00012","num":"00012"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00013","num":"00013"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
