{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND ART","PRIOR ART DOCUMENTS","DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION","Problem to be Solved by the Invention","Means for Solving Problem","Effects of the Invention","DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION","EXAMPLES"],"p":["The present invention relates to a modified fluorescent protein.","A fluorescent protein, for example, a green fluorescent protein having an amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 6 of a sequence listing is generally used as a material for fluorescently labeling a protein in basic research and application research. Fluorescent labeling with a fluorescent protein enables the observation of localization and movement of a protein under an optical microscope. Further, a fluorescent protein that responds to environment, such as cytoplasmic pH and calcium concentration, has also been created by genetic engineering modification (Patent Documents 1 and 2). The fluorescent protein capable of responding to a cytoplasmic environment change is a very potential tool for checking life phenomenon.","On the other hand, conventionally, it has been suggested that there is a strong correlation between the pressure in a living body and the life phenomenon, as is found in the fact that the shape of a tissue which is being generated is determined by a pressure in a cytoplasm.","Patent Document 1: JP 2002-253261 A","Patent Document 2: JP 2002-369690 A","However, there is no technology capable of measuring a pressure in a living body, and hence, the above-mentioned hypothesis is still to be verified. It is considered that a technology capable of visualizing a pressure in a living body will greatly develop biological study. In particular, if a pressure in a living body can be visualized with a fluorescent protein, the pressure can be measured non-invasively, that is, without damaging a living sample such as a cell or a living body.","The present invention provides a modified fluorescent protein allowing a pressure in a liquid to be measured.","The present invention relates to a modified fluorescent protein comprising a peptide linker inserted into a position homologous to a position between 144th and 145th amino acids in an amino acid sequence of a wild type fluorescent protein isolated from jellyfish or a fluorescent protein derived from the wild type fluorescent protein, wherein fluorescence properties of the modified fluorescent protein change depending on a change in pressure applied to a liquid in which the modified fluorescent protein exists.","The fluorescence properties of the modified fluorescent protein of the present invention change depending on a change in pressure applied to a liquid in which the modified fluorescent protein of the present invention exists, and preferably, the change in pressure and the fluorescent intensity exhibit a positive correlation. Therefore, the modified fluorescent protein of the present invention is capable of visualizing a change in pressure in a living body and enables the pressure to be measured with time based on a change in fluorescence non-invasively, that is, without damaging a living sample such as a cell or a living body. Further, a change in pressure applied to a liquid in which the modified fluorescent protein of the present invention exists can be detected easily.","A fluorescent protein is a protein having a cylindrical structure called a \u201c\u03b2-can structure\u201d. There is a chromophore composed of three amino acid residues in the \u03b2-can structure, and the chromophore sensitively responds to a proton configuration caused by the surrounding \u03b2-can structure. The present invention is based on the finding that, by inserting a peptide linker into a part of a fluorescent protein, more specifically, a loop closest to the chromophore, a modified fluorescent protein can be obtained in which the fluorescence properties change depending on a change in pressure applied to a liquid in which the fluorescent protein exists, and preferably, a pressure applied to the liquid in which the fluorescent protein exists and fluorescent intensity exhibit a positive correlation.","That is, in one aspect, the present invention relates to a modified fluorescent protein (hereinafter, sometimes, referred to as \u201cmodified fluorescent protein of the present invention\u201d) in which a peptide linker is inserted into a position homologous to the position between the 144th and 145th amino acids in the amino acid sequence of a wild type fluorescent protein isolated from jellyfish or a fluorescent protein derived from the wild type fluorescent protein, characterized in that the fluorescence properties of the modified fluorescent protein change depending on a change in pressure applied to a liquid in which the modified fluorescent protein exists.","Although a mechanism in which the fluorescence properties of the modified fluorescent protein of the present invention change depending on a change in pressure applied to a liquid in which the modified fluorescent protein of the present invention exists is not clear, the following interpretation can be considered. That is, when a peptide linker is inserted into a part of a fluorescent protein, more specifically, a loop closest to a chromophore, a \u03b2-can structure located close to the chromophore in the fluorescent protein is distorted, which allows water in a solvent to enter the chromophore. The chromophore interacts with water to change fluorescence properties. That is, the following is considered: a pressure applied to a liquid in which the modified fluorescent protein of the present invention exists increases to change the behavior of water in the chromophore, with the result that a fluorescent wavelength of light emitted from the chromophore changes, and\/or fluorescent intensity increases. It should be noted that the present invention may not be construed only based on the above-mentioned mechanism.","No fluorescent protein allowing a pressure in a solvent to be measured has been reported. Further, in regenerative medicine, it is becoming clear gradually that a pressure is important for determining the shape of a tissue. However, there is no technology capable of measuring a pressure in a cell, and hence, further finding has not been obtained. The modified fluorescent protein of the present invention can be expressed in a cell by a simple method such as gene transfer. Therefore, the modified fluorescent protein of the present invention may become a tool that is useful and applicable, for a number of biological researchers. For example, in study of deep-sea creatures, it is necessary to check a relationship between the pressure and the life phenomenon, and hence, the modified fluorescent protein of the present invention may become a tool that is also very important for the study of deep-sea creatures.","[Fluorescent Protein]","The term \u201cfluorescent protein\u201d as used herein refers to a protein emitting light when irradiated with excitation light. Although the fluorescent protein is not particularly limited, there may be given sp., sp. and the like isolated from coral; sp. L and the like isolated from sea anemone; and and the like isolated from jellyfish, as a material for the modified fluorescent protein. Preferably, there may be given those which are obtained by using, as a material, a wild type fluorescent protein isolated from jellyfish or a fluorescent protein derived from the wild type fluorescent protein. In the present invention, the term \u201cwild type fluorescent protein isolated from jellyfish\u201d refers to a fluorescent protein isolated from jellyfish of 238 (full-length) amino acid residues, and preferably refers to a green fluorescent protein (GFP; 238 (full-length) amino acid residues, GenBank Accession No. AAA27722, SEQ ID NO: 6 of a sequence listing) isolated from jellyfish (). Further, the term \u201cfluorescent protein derived from the wild type fluorescent protein\u201d as used herein includes a mutant fluorescent protein derived from the GFP, and preferably includes fluorescent proteins such as YFP, CFP, EGFP, EYFP, and ECFP. Hereinafter, in the present invention, the \u201cwild type fluorescent protein isolated from jellyfish or fluorescent protein derived from the wild type fluorescent protein\u201d is sometimes referred to simply as \u201cfluorescent protein\u201d. As a sequence of the YFP, there may be given an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 of 238 amino acid residues, and as a sequence of the CFP, there may be given an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 7 of 238 amino acid residues. However, in the present invention, the YFP and the CFP are not limited to the above-mentioned sequences. For example, the sequences of the YFP and the CFP may include those which include substitutions, additions, deletions, or insertions of one or a plurality of amino acid residues in the vicinity of an N-terminal or a C-terminal for the purpose of cloning or TAG labeling in a range not influencing the function as a fluorescent protein, and those which do not have an amino acid sequence length of 238 amino acid residues because of the substitutions, additions, deletions, or insertions. It is appropriate that the insertion site of a linker in this case (that is, a loop closest to a chromophore) is set to a position homologous to the position between the 144th and 145th amino acids in the amino acid sequence of the wild type fluorescent protein. The fluorescent protein in the present invention can be easily obtained as, for example, a commercially available product in a form of not only a protein but also a polynucleotide encoding the fluorescent protein or a vector capable of expressing the fluorescent protein. As the fluorescent protein in the present invention, the YFP and the EYFP (in particular, represented by an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1) are preferred, which are fluorescent proteins with tyrosine substituted for threonine at amino acid residue 203 of the green fluorescent protein. The reason for this is as follows. In the YFP and the EYFP, a chromophore (65-67 residues) and a phenol ring of tyrosine at amino acid residue 203 interact with each other electronically, and hence, the emission characteristics of the YFP and the EYFP are expected to change sensitively, compared with the GFP.","[Peptide Linker]","The term \u201cpeptide linker\u201d as used herein refers to an amino acid sequence to be inserted into a fluorescent protein. The number of amino acids of the peptide linker is preferably 1 or more from the viewpoint of maintaining sensitivity to a pressure and fluorescent intensity. Further, from the same viewpoint, the number of amino acids of the peptide linker is preferably 4 or less, more preferably 3 or less. Thus, the number of amino acids of the peptide linker is preferably 1 to 4, more preferably 1 to 3. Further, it is preferred that amino acid residues of the peptide linker include glycine, and it is more preferred that all the amino acid residues are glycine, from the viewpoint of maintaining sensitivity to a pressure and fluorescent intensity.","The insertion position of the peptide linker is a loop closest to a chromophore of the fluorescent protein, preferably the position between 144th and 145th positions of an amino acid sequence of a fluorescent protein, more preferably a site homologous to the position between the 144th and 145th amino acids in the wild type fluorescent protein, that is, the green fluorescent protein (GFP; GenBank Accession No. AAA27722, SEQ ID NO: 6) of 238 (full-length) amino acid residues. Even in the case where the peptide linker is to be inserted into a fluorescent protein that does not have an amino acid sequence length of 238 amino acid residues, those skilled in the art would be able to specify an insertion site easily by general alignment, visual comparison of sequences, or the like.","[Fluorescence Properties that Change Depending on Change in Pressure]","The term \u201cfluorescence properties\u201d as used herein includes an excitation wavelength, a fluorescent wavelength, spectra thereof, and fluorescent intensity. In the modified fluorescent protein of the present invention with a peptide linker inserted thereto, at least one of the fluorescence properties changes depending on a change in pressure applied to a liquid in which the modified fluorescent protein of the present invention exists, and preferably, at least fluorescent intensity changes in a positive correlation depending on a change in pressure applied to a liquid in which the modified fluorescent protein of the present invention exists. The expression \u201cfluorescent intensity changes in a positive correlation depending on a change in pressure applied to a liquid in which the modified fluorescent protein of the present invention changes\u201d means the following. When a pressure applied to a liquid in which the modified fluorescent protein of the present invention exists increases, fluorescent intensity increases, and when a pressure applied to a liquid in which the modified fluorescent protein of the present invention exists decreases, fluorescent intensity decreases. A pressure applied to a liquid in which the modified fluorescent protein of the present invention exists preferably more than 0 MPa and 1,000 MPa or less, more preferably more than 0 MPa and 500 MPa or less, still more preferably more than 0 MPa and 300 MPa or less from the viewpoint of maintaining sensitivity of a pressure and fluorescent intensity.","[Method for Producing a Modified Fluorescent Protein of the Present Invention]","The modified fluorescent protein of the present invention can be produced easily by a known method, for example, by cloning a modified DNA in which a DNA of a basic sequence encoding a peptide linker is inserted into a site homologous to the position between the 144th and 145th amino acids in an amino acid sequence of a wild type fluorescent protein isolated from jellyfish or a fluorescent protein derived from the wild type fluorescent protein in a DNA encoding the wild type fluorescent protein isolated from jellyfish or the fluorescent protein derived from the wild type fluorescent protein, and expressing the cloned modified DNA appropriately. Handling including a method for purifying the modified fluorescent protein of the present invention can be the same as that of the fluorescent protein subjected to modification. Further, in the case where the modified fluorescent protein of the present invention is expressed in a living body, there is a method for cloning a DNA encoding the modified fluorescent protein of the present invention to an appropriate expression vector, and transferring the vector to an intended cell or living body. It should be noted that the modified fluorescent protein of the present invention is not limited to its production method, cloning method, expression method, and gene-transfer method.","Thus, in another aspect, the present invention relates to a vector (hereinafter, sometimes referred to as \u201cvector of the present invention\u201d) encoding the modified fluorescent protein of the present invention. The vector of the present invention may be an expression vector for expressing the modified fluorescent protein of the present invention. In the expression vector, an expression system is not particularly limited, and whether the expression system is a prokaryote or a eukaryote does not matter. Thus, in still another aspect, the present invention relates to living organisms excluding cells or human beings gene-transferred with the modified fluorescent protein of the present invention. Further, the present invention also relates to a kit including the vector of the present invention, containing a reagent required for gene transfer, cells, an instruction manual, etc., as needed.","[Fusion form with an Internal Standard Fluorescent Protein]","A pressure applied to a liquid in which the modified fluorescent protein of the present invention exists can also be measured by combining the modified fluorescent protein of the present invention with a conventional fluorescent protein, using the conventional fluorescent protein as an internal standard whose fluorescence properties do not change with respect to a pressure, and comparing the fluorescence properties of both the proteins. In the case of using a fluorescent protein as an internal standard, it is preferred that the modified fluorescent protein of the present invention be different from the internal standard protein in fluorescence properties, and it is preferred that the modified fluorescent protein of the present invention be different from the internal standard protein in excitation wavelength and spectrum thereof. Further, from the viewpoint of regulating expression amounts of both the proteins to enhance sensitivity, a fusion protein form in which the modified fluorescent protein of the present invention is fused with the internal standard protein is preferred. Thus, in still another aspect, the present invention relates to a fusion fluorescent protein (hereinafter, sometimes referred to as \u201cfusion fluorescent protein of the present invention\u201d) in which the modified fluorescent protein of the present invention is fused with a fluorescent protein having an excitation spectrum different from that of the modified fluorescent protein.","In the fusion fluorescent protein of the present invention, the modified fluorescent protein of the present invention and the internal standard fluorescent protein may be fused with each other through a linker. Those skilled in the art would be able to produce the fusion fluorescent protein of the present invention easily, for example, by cloning a DNA fragment encoding the modified fluorescent protein of the present invention to a vector of a known fluorescent protein. Thus, in still another aspect, the present invention relates to a vector encoding the fusion fluorescent protein of the present invention. The vector may be an expression vector for expressing the fusion fluorescent protein of the present invention. In the expression vector, an expression system is not particularly limited, and whether the expression system is a prokaryote or a eukaryote does not matter. Thus, in still another aspect, the present invention relates to living organisms excluding cells or human beings gene-transferred with the fusion fluorescent protein of the present invention. Still further, the present invention can relate to a kit including the vector, containing a reagent required for gene transfer, cells, an instruction manual, etc., as needed.","[Pressure Measurement Method]","In still another aspect, the present invention relates to a method for detecting a change in pressure or a pressure applied to a liquid in which the modified fluorescent protein\/fusion fluorescent protein of the present invention exists, in which fluorescent intensity or a fluorescent wavelength of the fluorescent protein is detected.","The fluorescence properties of the modified fluorescent protein\/fusion fluorescent protein of the present invention change depending on a pressure applied to a liquid in which the modified fluorescent protein\/fusion fluorescent protein of the present invention exists. Therefore, for example, by allowing the modified fluorescent protein\/fusion fluorescent protein to exist in a cell, a blood vessel, an embryo, or an aqueous solution, a change in pressure applied to any one of them can be detected. Further, by using an internal standard together or the fusion fluorescent protein of the present invention, a pressure can also be known in real time. The detection sensitivity of a pressure using the modified fluorescent protein\/fusion fluorescent protein of the present invention can be set to, for example, 1.0 MPa to 0.1 MPa, preferably 0.8 MPa to 0.4 MPa, more preferably 0.7 MPa to 0.5 MPa. Further, a pressure that can be detected is, for example, more than 0 MPa and 1,000 MPa or less. From the viewpoint of the detection sensitivity, a lower limit of the pressure is preferably 0.001 MPa or more, more preferably 0.01 MPa or more, still more preferably 0.05 MPa or more, still more preferably an atmospheric pressure or more. Further, from the same viewpoint, an upper limit of the pressure is preferably 500 MPa or less, more preferably 100 MPa or less, still more preferably 10 MPa or less, still more preferably 1 MPa or less.","The modified fluorescent protein of the present invention can be applied, more specifically, to measurement of a change in osmotic pressure in a cell, measurement of a change in blood pressure, and measurement of a body internal pressure of deep-sea creatures, etc.","Hereinafter, the present invention will be described by way of examples with reference to the drawings.","[Insertion Mutant of YFP]","Insertion mutants were produced respectively by inserting a peptide linker between aspartic acid at amino acid residue 144 and tyrosine at amino acid residue 145 of a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) of 238 (full-length) amino acid residues represented by SEQ ID NO: 1 of a sequence listing (). The inserted peptide linkers were G (mutant name: YFP-1G), GGG (mutant name: YFP-3G: SEQ ID NO: 2), GGTGGS (SEQ ID NO: 3) (mutant name: YFP-6G), GGTGGSGGTGGS (SEQ ID NO: 4) (mutant name: YFP-12G).","The YFP and the YFP mutants were expressed and purified by a conventional method. That is, a DNA plasmid encoding the YFP and the YFP mutants was transformed into , and the YFP and the YFP mutants were expressed in The YFP and the YFP mutants were separated and purified from collected lysates (cytoplasm) by adding a FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK: SEQ ID NO: 5) to an N-terminal of the YFP and the YFP mutants.","[Comparison of Wavelength Characteristics]","An absorption wavelength spectrum and an emission wavelength spectrum of each of the insertion mutants produced as described above were checked. As a result, the absorption wavelength and the emission wavelength of the YFP shifted to a short wavelength owing to the insertion of glycine in accordance with the number of the inserted amino acid residues (). It is considered that the shift of the fluorescent wavelength revealed that the \u03b2-can structure changed owing to the insertion of glycine to change the environment on the periphery of a chromophore of the YFP. The fluorescent intensity of the YFP-6G and the YFP-12G decreases compared with the YFP, and hence, it is considered that the YFP-1G and the YFP-3G are more preferred as a fluorescent protein for detecting a pressure.","[Pressure Dependence of Wavelength Characteristics]","The pressure dependence of the YFP, the YFP-1G, and the YFP-3G were checked. Specifically, the pressure dependence was measured under the following conditions. ) shows the results of the YFP, ) shows the results of the YFP-1G, and ) shows the results of the YFP-3G.","[Measurement Condition of Pressure Dependence]","YFP and YFP mutants were prepared so as to be in a concentration of 0.1 to 0.3 mg\/ml in a solution of 20 mM of Hepes-NaOH (pH 8.0). The absorbance was measured in a range of an absorption wavelength of 250 to 600 nm by an absorption spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-Vis Spectrophotometer UV-1650PC). The fluorescent intensity was measured in a fluorescent wavelength of 500 to 650 nm with an excitation wavelength being fixed to 488 nm by a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-Vis Spectrophotometer UV-1650PC).","The fluorescence properties under a pressure were measured through use of a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-Vis Spectrophotometer UV-1650PC), a high-pressure absorbance cell unit (PCI500, Syn Corporation), and a pressure pump (HP-500, Syn Corporation). The pressure was changed at a speed of about 5 MPa per second so as to avoid a change in temperature involved in a rapid change in pressure. One minute after the intended pressure was achieved, the excitation wavelength was fixed to 480 nm, and fluorescence properties were measured in a fluorescent wavelength of 500 to 650 nm. An experiment was performed all at room temperature (25\u00b0 C.).","As shown in ), as a pressure was applied to the YFP, the peak wavelength shifted to a long wavelength side and fluorescent intensity decreased. As shown in ), as a pressure was applied to the YFP-1G, the peak wavelength shifted to a long wavelength side and fluorescent intensity increased until the pressure reached 200 MPa and then decreased. As shown in ), as a pressure was applied to the YFP-3G, the peak wavelength shifted to a long wavelength side and fluorescent intensity increased.  is graphs each summarizing the foregoing results.","As shown in ), regarding the pressure dependence of a shift of the peak wavelength, no substantial difference was found among the YFP, the YFP-1G, and the YFP-3G. Further, as shown in ), regarding the pressure dependence of a change in fluorescent intensity at a peak wavelength, a change ratio of the fluorescent intensity of the YFP under a pressure of 300 MPa was 0.75, whereas a change ratio of the fluorescent intensity of the YFP-3G under a pressure of 300 MPa was 2.4. Thus, it was revealed that the YFP-3G was greatly influenced by a pressure, compared with the YFP.","[Measurement of Change in Pressure from Change in Fluorescent Intensity]","A detailed correlation graph between the fluorescent intensity (515 to 535 nm) of the YFP-3G and the pressure (0 to 50 MPa) applied to a liquid in which the YFP-3G exists was created (). The graph of  was obtained by plotting a change ratio of fluorescent intensity when a pressure applied to an aqueous solution of the YFP-3G from 0 MPa to a predetermined pressure. As shown in , a change in pressure and a change in fluorescent intensity correlate with each other, and hence, a change in pressure applied to a liquid in which the YFP-3G exists can be estimated from the fluorescent intensity of the YFP-3G through use of  as a calibration table.  shows an example thereof.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5","FIG. 6"]},"Accordingly, the fluorescence properties of the modified fluorescent protein of the present invention change depending on a change in pressure applied to a liquid in which the YFP-3G exists, and hence, according to the present invention, it was shown that it is possible to measure a pressure applied to a liquid in which the modified fluorescent protein of the present invention exists.","[Production of GFP Mutants and CFP Mutants]","Insertion mutants were produced respectively by inserting a peptide linker between aspartic acid at amino acid residue 144 and tyrosine at amino acid residue 145 of each of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) and a cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) represented by amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO: 6 and SEQ ID NO: 7 of a sequence listing.
