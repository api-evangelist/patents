{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This disclosure generally relates to active inductors","An inductor, in general, is a passive electrical component that can store energy in a magnetic field created by the electric current passing through it. An inductor's ability to store magnetic energy is measured by its inductance (symbol \u201cL\u201d), in units of \u201chenries\u201d (symbol \u201cH\u201d, named after American scientist Joseph Henry). Inductance results from the magnetic field forming around a current-carrying conductor, which tends to resist changes in the current. Electric current through the conductor creates a magnetic flux proportional to the current. A change in this current creates a corresponding change in magnetic flux which, in turn, by Faraday's Law generates an electromotive force (EMF) that opposes this change in current. Inductance is a measure of the amount of electromotive force generated per unit change in current. By definition, if the rate of change of current in a circuit is one ampere per second and the resulting electromotive force is one volt, then the inductance of the circuit is one henry.","Inductors are one of the basic components used in electronics where current and voltage change with time due to the ability of inductors to delay and reshape alternating currents. The effect of an inductor in an electric circuit is to oppose changes in current through the circuit by developing a voltage across the circuit proportional to the rate of change of the current. The relationship between the time-varying voltage v(t) across an inductor with inductance L and the time-varying current i(t) passing through it is described by the differential equation:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"v","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}},{"mi":"L","mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2146","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}}},{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"t"}]},"mo":"."}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}}},"There are many design variations for constructing inductors. For example, an inductor may be constructed as a coil of conducting material (e.g., copper wire) wrapped around a core either of air or of ferromagnetic or ferromagnetic material. As another example, when incorporated as a component of an integrated circuit (IC) where it is desirable that the size of the inductor is relatively small, a gyrator-based circuit, which uses a capacitor and other active components to transpose the capacitive impedance to an inductive one, behaves similarly as an inductor. Such circuits are called \u201cactive inductors\u201d as they use active elements to create inductive impedance in a wide frequency range.","A gyrator is a passive, linear, lossless, two-port, and non-reciprocal electrical network element. An important property of a gyrator is that it inverts the current-voltage characteristics of an electrical component or network. In the case of linear elements, the impedance is also inverted. In other words, a gyrator can make a capacitive circuit behave inductively.  illustrates several example circuits that implement active inductors. More specifically, ) illustrates an example gyrator-based circuit. ) illustrates a single-ended, single-sided variation of the gyrator-based circuit illustrated in ). ) and () illustrate two additional variations of the gyrator-based circuit. The principle of operation of this class of circuits is to integrate the input voltage by means of a trans-impedance amplifier that dumps the current on a capacitor (e.g., an explicit capacitor or a transistor gate capacitor), and transfer the obtained voltage through another trans-impedance amplifier back to the input, thus achieving the input current that is an integral of the input voltage (i.e., inductive behavior).","In each of the variation circuits illustrated in , Zdenotes the input impedance into the circuit in the direction indicated by the arrow, and Vdenotes the power supply. For example, for the circuits illustrated in ) and (), the input impedance may be determined as:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["Z","in"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"s"}},{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"r","mrow":{"mi":"ds","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"2"}},{"mi":"g","mrow":{"mi":"m","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"1"}},{"mi":"g","mrow":{"mi":"m","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"2"}}],"mo":["\u00d7","\u00d7"]},"mo":"+","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mi":"s","mo":"\u00d7","msub":{"mi":"C","mrow":{"mi":"gs","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"1"}}},{"msub":[{"mi":"g","mrow":{"mi":"m","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"1"}},{"mi":"g","mrow":{"mi":"m","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"2"}}],"mo":"\u00d7"}]}}},{"mo":["\uf605","\uf606"],"mfrac":{"mn":"1","msub":{"mi":"g","mrow":{"mi":"m","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"2"}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"s","mo":"\u00d7","msub":{"mi":"C","mrow":{"mi":"gs","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"2"}}}},"mo":"."}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"]}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]}}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 2(","FIG. 2(","FIG. 2(","FIG. 2("],"i":["a","b","a","a"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["Z","in"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"s"}},{"mi":"R","mo":"\u00d7","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mi":"s","mo":"+","mfrac":{"mn":"1","mrow":{"mi":"R","mo":"\u00d7","msub":{"mi":["C","gs"]}}}},{"mi":"s","mo":"+","mfrac":{"msub":[{"mi":["g","m"]},{"mi":["C","gs"]}]}}]},"mo":"."}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"3"}}]}}}}},"In EQUATION (3), R is the resistance of the resistor; Cis the gate-to-source capacitance of the nMOS transistor; and gis the transconductance of the nMOS transistor.","The circuit illustrated in ) is simpler than the gyrator-based topology illustrated in .

In either case, the practical usability of the circuit is greatly reduced. To further explain this problem with an example, consider the circuit illustrated in ), if the voltage at location  is V and the voltage at location  is V, then in order for there to be sufficient current in the circuit so that the circuit behaves similarly as an inductor, V-V needs to be greater than V.","To overcome this problem,  illustrates several example circuits that have the characteristic of an inductor. Each of the illustrated circuits simulates the behavior of an inductor, as defined by EQUATION (1). The input impedance Zmay be determined using EQUATION (2).
