{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/157,272 filed on Oct. 1, 1999 and entitled Data Structures and Algorithms For Simulated Interaction With Graphical Objects, which application is hereby incorporated by reference.","This invention pertains generally to computer graphics and to two-dimensional and three-dimensional simulation and interaction with objects represented by such graphics, and more particularly to system, method, data structures, and computer programs for simulated interaction with such graphical and virtual objects.","Heretofore the ability to integrate real-time three-dimensional hand interaction into software applications has been somewhat limited and has required a relatively high level of skill among practitioners. Complex three-dimensional worlds have not been easy to simulate and frequently such simulations were performed in a rudimentary manner as the required results would not support the massive efforts needed to understand the simulated to environment, objects in that environment, or the input\/output devices with interaction with the environment and objects would be made. It also has it not been practical to develop complex scene graphs and mapping between the several scene graphs that might typically be present. System interaction and the visual and tactile\/force feedback were also in need of improvement, particularly where it was desired that visual feedback cues be synchronized with tactile and force cues, especially for hand grasping interactions of virtual objects.","These and other limitations have been addressed by the inventive system, method, data structures, computer program, and computer program product of the invention.","The invention provides a structure, method, computer program and computer program product for novel object simulation and interaction of and between computer generated or graphical objects in virtual space. These include novel Neutral Scene Graph data structures and procedures for using such graphs, Object-Manipulation Procedures, and impedance mode procedures and techniques for simulating physical interaction with computer generated graphical objects in virtual space.","Aspects and embodiments of the invention are now described relative to the figures. Three aspects of the invention are first described all pertaining to different aspects of simulation and interaction between computer generated or graphical objects in virtual space. These aspects involve: (i) Neutral Scene Graphs, (ii) Object-Manipulation Algorithms and Procedures, and (iii) Impedance mode procedures and techniques. In general each of the aspects involves a certain methodological or procedural steps that are conveniently implemented on either a general computer system of the type having a processor and memory coupled to the processor, input\/output devices, and other elements that are known in the art of personal computers. The invention may also be practiced with special purpose computers or in hardware. Data structures are also created and used relative to at least some of the inventive procedures.","After these three aspects have been described in some detail, the implementation of one particular embodiment of the invention as computer software is described in considerable detail so that the interaction between the above described three aspects and other elements of a simulation and interaction system and method may more clearly be understood. This implementation is referred to as the Virtual hand Toolkit (VHT), which is a component of a Virtual Hand Suite 2000.","Neutral Scene Graph","In a first aspect, the invention provides a system, apparatus, method and computer program and computer program product for relating two or more scene-graph data structures. As used in this description as well as in the applicable arts, a scene graph may be thought of broadly as a data structure that structures or organizes a collection of nodes into a hierarchy through the use of directed edges. In addition, a scene graph typically has no cycles, which means that it is not typically possible to follow a sequence of edges and arrive at the starting node. The technical term for this type of graph structure is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Directed acyclic graphs are known in the art and not described in further detail here. In practice, non-terminal nodes (that is, those nodes with directed edges leaving the node) of a scene graph are called or referred to as group nodes. Group nodes may also contain one or more homogeneous transformation matrices. A path in a scene graph is a set of nodes and edges that ends at a terminal node. The product of any transformation matrices encountered in a path provides the frame (position, orientation) of the terminal node with respect to the node at the start of the path.","A Neutral Scene Graph (NSG) is a structure as well as a mechanism or procedure for relating two or more scene graphs. An NSG may for example, provide a topological mapping between multiple scene graphs. An NSG is typically a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where each node may contain pointers to one or more nodes in the scene graphs the NSG is to relate.","One use for such an NSG is to synchronize two or more \u201casynchronous\u201d scene graphs in time. A set of \u201csynchronizing\u201d NSGs may, for example, be used to synchronize a set of \u201casynchronous\u201d scene graphs. In addition to synchronizing asynchronous scene graphs, NSGs may also provide additional information, functions, one or a set of indicators, flags, transformations, instructions for data manipulation, other information, and the like. An NSG may but does not need to preserve the connectivity of the graphs it relates.","A transformation introduced by an NSG may provide a mapping between a node in a first graph to a node in a second graph or between a node in the second graph to a node in the first graph. Where more than two graphs are involved, the NSG may introduce multiple transformations for mapping nodes in and between each of the two or more graphs. The direction of the mapping may be provided by a flag or other indicator or information item. Other flags, indicators, or information items may be used to hold information about the state of synchronization of various graphs.","Graph traversals of an NSG may provide a mechanism for asynchronously synchronizing the nodes in one or more graphs. The one or more graphs may be updated independently and\/or in separate threads or processes.","A set of NSGs may also be used to map between two or more sets of graphs. A separate NSG may be used to synchronize each graph pair.","In one exemplary embodiment, illustrated in , one NSG synchronizes two scene graphs, scene graph A (SG-A) and scene graph B (SG-B), and each node in the NSG (nodes shown as square boxes) contains two pointers, one to a node in graph A (nodes shown as round circles) and one to a node in graph B (nodes shown as triangles). NSG pointers are also illustrated as are scene graph edges using different arrowheads as indicated in the key shown in .","In another exemplary embodiment, an NSG provides the mapping between: (1) a graphical scene graph (GSG), such as OpenInventor, OpenGL Optimizer, Performer, and the like, or any other graphical scene graph application program interface (API); and (2) a haptic scene graph (HSG) or an interaction scene graph (ISG). In this second embodiment, the HSG is typically a scene graph of the type used for fast collision detection between virtual objects in a simulated two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) environment. In this embodiment, the NSG is constructed to map the haptic scene graph (HSG) and the graphical scene graph (GSG). There is a transformation in each NSG node that is a function that converts a homogeneous transformation matrix in HSG form into a transformation matrix in the desired GSG form. This transformation is invertible, and the direction of the update is controlled by a flag, indicator, or other control device. In some instances, the transformation may be a unity or identity transformation.","The Neutral Scene Graph (NSG) described here is particularly useful since typically computer graphics associated with a 2D or 3D simulation only need to be updated from between about 10 times per second to about 60 times per second since these rates are typically sufficient to support visual observation. In contrast, a haptic (i.e., force feedback) display and the associated interactive mathematical model of the simulation typically requires (or at least greatly benefits from) much faster update, such as more than 100 times per second and typically from about 1000 times per second to 2000 times per second or more. Thus, the graphical update (e.g. 10\u201360 times\/second update frequency) can advantageously be run or executed in a separate computer program software thread, and at a much different update rate, from the corresponding haptic or interaction thread (e.g. 1000\u20132000 times\/second update frequency). These data update frequencies are provided for the purpose of illustration and the invention itself is not limited to any particular update rate or frequency. The inventive NSG provides an efficient mechanism to ensure that the updated graphical data remains synchronized with the corresponding updated haptic or interaction data, even if and when they are updated at different times and intervals.","Embodiment of Object-Manipulation Structure and Procedure","In a second aspect, the invention also provides an object-manipulation data structure, procedure, algorithm, computer program and computer program product which uses a static-friction approximation with parameters to allow user control over the ease of manipulation or control of virtual objects. Each collision event detected between a portion of a grasping (or contacting) virtual object (such as a graphical hand) and a virtual object to be grasped (or contacted) yields a contact normal data (or signal), which is input to a state machine and more particularly to a manipulation finite-state machine (MFSM).","Each virtual object to be grasped (or otherwise contacted) has an associated MFSM that in turn has an associated grasping virtual object \u201cparent,\u201d referred to as the GParent. (For simplicity of explanation, a grasping type contact will be assumed for purposes of description here, but the invention is not limited only to grasping type contact.) A GParent is a virtual object that is capable of grasping another virtual object. A GParent may be any virtual object independent of a virtual object to be grasped, and each GParent virtual object may have any number of other virtual objects using it as a GParent. Collision information between a virtual object to be grasped and its GParent is used in the inventive algorithm, method, and computer program. The state of the manipulation finite-state machine (MFSM) determines how a virtual object behaves with respect to its GParent.","An exemplary embodiment of a MFSM is illustrated in , and includes the following states: NONE, ONE, G3, and RELEASE. In the \u201cNONE\u201d state, the virtual object to be grasped is not in a graspable state. In the \u201cONE\u201d state, there are insufficient contacts and contact normals to fully constrain the virtual object with respect to the GParent. The object may only be manipulated around by the contact point. In the \u201cG3\u201d state, there are at least three \u201cgrasping\u201d contact points whose contact normals each have at least some specified minimum angular separation. The virtual object to be grasped is considered fully constrained by its GParent. In the \u201cRELEASE\u201d state, the object was previously constrained to the GParent but is now in the process of being released.","Transition of and between the states in the exemplary embodiment of the MFSM of  is governed by various parameters including but not limited to the following parameters: minimum normal angle (MinNormalAngle), minimum drop angle (MinDropAngle), number of drop fingers (NumDropFingers), and grasp one cone slope (GraspOneConeSlope).","The minimum normal angle (MinNormaLAngle) parameter includes an angular quantity giving the minimum angular separation of all contact normals required to enter a G3 state.","The minimum drop angle (MinDropAngle) parameter is an angular quantity specifying the angle limit for a GParent Manipulator relative to a reference datum necessary for the manipulator to not be classified as a Drop Finger. A Manipulator is defined as the vector from a reference point on the GParent to a contact point on the parent so that the MinDropAngle specifies the angle limit for a GParent Manipulator relative to a reference datum necessary for the manipulator to not be classified as a Drop Finger. When the GParent is a graphical hand, this manipulator is the vector from the metacarpaophalangeal joint of the hand to the contract point on the finger. The MinDropAngle may be defined as the angle of a manipulator relative to the palm of the hand (i.e., the metacarpus), beyond which, the manipulator is classified as a Drop Finger. The minimum drop angle (MinDropAngle) may also be defined as a maximum allowable change in angle of a manipulator relative to an angle of the manipulator while the finger is in contact with the virtual object to be grasped (such as the angle of the manipulator just before contact ceases).","The number of drop fingers (NumDropFingers) parameter includes the number of manipulators whose angles do not exceed the MinDropAngle requirement, beyond which number the grasped virtual object enters the Release state.","The grasp one cone slope (GraspOneConeSlope) parameter includes the angular tolerance of the contact normal for maintaining a ONE state.","The MFSM may optionally depend on either the position or velocity of the contact points, but generally need not depend on either the position or velocity of the contact points. The contact condition may be characterized merely by a normal, so the virtual object to be grasped does not have to be in actual contact with a GParent to undergo a state transition. A separate invisible (e.g., non-rendered) representation of the virtual object may be used by the MFSM, and may be increased in size, scaled, or otherwise augmented or padded with a manipulation layer to make it easier to manipulate or to otherwise alter or augment its manipulation characteristics. This also permits virtual objects to be manipulated remotely.","With further reference to the state diagram of , the diagram illustrates possible state transitions between the states of the MFSM that can occur during the state recalculation. These transitions include a transition from NONE to ONE in response to a \u201cnew contact\u201d condition, and a transition between ONE and NONE in response to a \u201c0 contact\u201d (zero contact) condition. New contact is the condition when a point on the GParent, which in the previous iteration was not in contact with the virtual object to be grasped, comes into contact with the virtual object. Zero Contact (or no contact) is the condition when in the previous algorithm iteration there was at least one point on the GParent in contact with the virtual object to be grasped, but there are no longer any such contact points. The manipulation state also transitions from RELEASE to NONE in response to the \u201c0 contact\u201d condition. The manipulation state transitions from the ONE state to the G3 state when there are a good set of normals and three contacts. Normals are considered to be good when there is at least one pair of contract normals which have an angle between them exceeding the MinNormalAngle parameter. The manipulation state in the MSFM transitions from G3 to RELEASE when the number of \u201cmanipulators\u201d which have an angle less than the minimum drop angle is not greater than or equal to NumDropFingers. An example value for NumDropFingers is 2. Once the state machine is in the ONE state, it will remain in that state when any new contact condition occurs, unless conditions are met to transition to the G3 state.","One embodiment of the inventive grasping method, algorithm, procedure, and computer program includes the following steps. While the grasping or manipulation simulation is running (typically by executing the simulation program in processor and memory of a general purpose digital computer), the neutral scene graph (described above) synchronization procedure is executed to synchronize the graphical scene graph and the interaction (or haptic or collision) scene graph. In this embodiment, the graphical scene graph comprises an OpenGL representation of the GParent and virtual object to be grasped. Also in this embodiment, the interaction scene graph comprises features of the GParent and virtual object that may be different from their respective OpenGL representations. For instance, the virtual object may be scaled larger to make it easier to grasp, have sharp edges smoothed so a haptic display does not go unstable, be represented by one or a set of simpler geometric shapes to make interaction calculations more efficient, and the like (Step ). Next, the virtual objects that are in the ONE or G3 state are either in contact with the GParent or are being grasped by it, and are thus constrained to move based on their relationship with their associated GParent, (Step ). More than one MFSM will be provided when there is more than one virtual object to be grasped, a single MFSM process being allocated to each virtual object to be grasped.","Collision checks are then performed between the manipulator and the virtual environment (Step ). Here the manipulator is defined to include the portion of the GParent in contact with a virtual object. In a useful embodiment, collision checking is done using the VClip algorithm known in the art. In one embodiment of the invention, collision detection may utilized the techniques described in co-pending U.S. Utility application Ser. No. 09\/432,362 to filed Nov. 3, 1999 and entitled \u201cSystem And Method For Constraining A Graphical Hand From Penetrating Simulated Graphical Objects,\u201d which is hereby incorporated by reference.","For each collision that is detected, the collision information, including (1) the contact point between the manipulator (i.e., the object pointed to by GParent, which is sometimes referred to as the Virtual End Effector or VEE) and the virtual object, (2) the normal to the contact point, and the like, are sent to the MFSM corresponding to the object that is colliding with the manipulator (Step ). Finally, the grasping state for all MFSMs are recalculated at the interaction update rate, which is typically as fast as the interaction software thread can run.

A CDROM containing executable code is provided in Appendix II, and a Programmer's Guide is provided in Appendix III.","Impedance Mode Structure and Procedure","In yet another aspect, a haptic-control technique for low-bandwidth updates of a force-feedback controller and method of control incorporating or utilizing these low-bandwidth haptic-control updates. This technique is particularly applicable to situations where a simulation is executing asynchronously (either on the same computer in a different thread or on a separate computer) from an associated force-control process.","For the purpose of this description, we refer to a Physical End Effector (PEE) as a physical device (typically a mechanical or electromechanical device) which can apply force to a physical user, and we refer to a virtual end effector (VEE) as the virtual object or objects that represent this PEE device in a computer simulation.","The computer simulation software thread communicates to the force-control software thread a Local Surface Approximation (LSA) of a virtual object (or objects) in a region local to a VEE. The force-control software thread then computes the actual force to be generated by the PEE. The control process executes a real-time (or substantially real-time or near real-time) control loop that uses the LSA information to generate a realistic force approximation to the LSA for display on the PEE.","A Local Surface Approximation (LSA) includes an approximation of at least one, and advantageously each, of the factors in a region near the VEE that are likely to influence the VEE. The LSA description may, for example, include information about the geometry, velocity, acceleration, compliance, texture, temperature, color, smell, taste, and the like, or any other physical, static, dynamic or any other property associated with one or more nearby virtual objects. A geometric approximation may, for example, include: (1) a single polygon (such as a virtual object tangent plane), (2) an approximating polyhedron, (3) a parametric surface (such as NURBS or subdivision surfaces), and the like.","Each LSA may also optionally contain information about the surface texture of a portion of a nearby virtual object. Such surface texture may include any haptic-related contact properties, such as contact model parameters like stiffness and damping. Such parameters may be encoded as multiple textures on the geometric surface. Associated with an LSA may be one or a set of flags or other indicia to give information about the contact state, or separation distance, and grasp state of the neighboring virtual objects.","Each VEE in the simulation may have multiple possible LSAs associated with it due to the multiple virtual objects in a simulation. Two embodiments of procedures for associating LSAs with VEEs are now described. First the LSAs are sorted by contact state with assignment to a VEE having the LSA closest to it. Second, a new composite LSA that encompasses all LSAs within a fixed distance of the VEE is constructed.","One embodiment of the host-computer-side procedure and algorithm is now described. While the simulation is running or executing on a general purpose computer, collision detection checks are performed between the VEE and the virtual environment (Step ). In one embodiment of the invention, collision detection may utilize the techniques described in co-pending U.S. Utility application Ser. No. 09\/432,362 filed Nov. 3, 1999 and entitled \u201cSystem And Method For Constraining A Graphical Hand From Penetrating Simulated Graphical Objects,\u201d which is hereby incorporated by reference above.","The paragraph above describes the collision-check step. Subsequently, a set of LSAs is constructed for each potential collision between the VEEs and all the virtual objects. Each LSA in the set corresponds to the object portion that is in contact or potential contact with the VEEs (See ). The set of LSAs are stored in a memory buffer.","For each VEE, the subset of LSAs in the memory buffer that correspond to that particular VEE is found and one of the following two steps is performed: (i) combine the subset of LSAs into a single set, and (ii) select the most significant LSA out of the subset. In either case, one LSA is constructed or selected for each VEE. The final step is to send this LSA to the PEE controller.","An exemplary embodiment of the host side procedure is summarized in pseudo-code immediately below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"while( simulation running )"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"182pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"perform collision check between VEE and virtual environment"]},{"entry":[{},"for( each collision pair )"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"161pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"construct LSA to the object portion of the contact pair"]},{"entry":[{},"send LSA to command buffer"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"182pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"for( each LSA in command buffer )"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"161pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"for( each VEE )"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"construct single LSA corresponding to all"]},{"entry":[{},"LSAs for this VEE, OR find closest LSA"]},{"entry":[{},"to VEE"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"send LSA to PEE controller"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"On the force-control side this procedure and algorithm uses two asynchronous threads of execution, the slow-thread and the fast-thread. The slow-thread uses the LSA information and the Physical End Effector (PEE) model to calculate the corresponding interaction force-field (spatial distribution of interaction forces due to LSA\/PEE configuration). The fast-thread uses the latest available force-field (calculated by the slow-thread) and the feedback from the sensors (high bandwidth information) to control the actuator device. Hence, the fast-thread is the dedicated servo controller for the force actuators. De-coupling the slow-thread enables the fast-thread to run at kilohertz rates increasing haptic feedback fidelity.","The fast-thread may employ a variety of control algorithms including control algorithms known in the art and proprietary control algorithms. Such control algorithms, may for example include position control and force control algorithms. For example, for position control, the force applied by the PEE is determined based on the discrepancy between desired position and\/or velocity of the VEE with respect to the haptic surface texture. For force control, the force applied by the PEE is determined based on the discrepancy between applied and computed forces.","The slow-thread loop and fast-thread loop procedures for each Physical End Effector (PEE) are now described. For the slow code thread loop the procedure for each PEE is as follows: First, the LSA is projected into the actuator domain. Next, the PEE model is projected into the actuator domain. Finally, collision detection is performed in the actuator domain to calculate or otherwise determine a corresponding force field.","The fast code thread loop runs at a higher frequency such as for example between 1 kHz and 2 kHz. For each PEE, the fast sensors are read and mapped. Fast sensors may for example include feedback or other signals or data from encoders, tachometers force sensors, or the like. Next, discrepancies between current (measured) and desired force field are calculated.

Programmers also sometimes cannot waste time on other complex issues such as collision-detection, haptic scene graphs, event models and global system response.","In a conventional application development environment, with an integrated graphical user interface, programmers are provided with implicit operation of the mouse, windows, document containers and various widgets. The Virtual Hand Toolkit (VHT) takes a similar approach, offering automatic management of virtual hands, a simulated world with graphical representation and an expandible model for handling interactions between world entities.","The VHT is transparent to the programmer's work, as its core is based on a multi-threaded architecture with event-based synchronization. This is similar to GUI-based applications where the programmer need not manage the mouse or service graphical user interface (GUI) events. The application development process should focus on application-specific functionality, not low-level details. To develop an application that makes use of whole-hand input devices, according to an embodiment of the invention, the software designer is provided with an application model that consists of three major components:","A human hand;","An manipulation and interaction; and","A capability.","The Virtual Hand Toolkit (VHT) is divided into a number of functional components corresponding to a division of libraries. According to one or more embodiments, the toolkit is implemented by using two libraries and a set of support libraries.","Purchased hardware can come with basic software that includes Device Configuration Utility, Device Manager and the Device layer components of the Virtual Hand Toolkit. This can include hardware support, for example, in the form of device proxy classes as well as a set of classes for doing 3D math as well as a set of exception classes. The basic device layer is described in detail below.","The main functionality of the VHT is contained in the Core layer and includes both the haptic and neutral scene graphs, simulation support, collision interface, model import, human hand support (including grasping and ghosting).","Third-party support packages and interfaces can be located, in separate specific libraries. For example, support for a Cosmo\/Optimizer display engine can be imported into the VHT and stored in a separate library. Also, local geometry level collision detection is externalized and the VHS includes two modules that may be used. The relationships between these levels can be seen in .","The next sections describe all the components of the VHT and the typical usage of each of the classes that make them up.","A complete working example is also presented in detail below.","A working understanding of C++ programming language and proficiency with a development environment on their platform (such as Windows NT or SGI IRIX) is assumed. Some basic knowledge of 3D graphics is also assumed. Additional background information to provide or supplement this knowledge is provided in standard textbooks such as: , J. Foley, A. van Dam, S. Feiner, J. Hughes. 2nd Edition, Addison-Wesley, 1996; and , Bjame Stroustrup, 3rd Edition, Addison-Wesley, 1997; each of which is hereby incorporated by reference.","According to an embodiment of the invention, an overview of the Virtual Hand Toolkit (VHT) is presented using simple examples to illustrate the usage of the main classes in the VHT. Furthermore, the development environment settings (for NT\/2000 and IRIX) are explained. Additional detail regarding the classes is provided below.","Virtual Human Hand","In an application, the Virtual Human Hand class (vhtHumanHand) is the high-level front-end for whole-hand input devices. It lets the developer easily specify what kind of devices are to be operated, and where they are serviced. Then it takes care of all further operations automatically. The aim is to make these advanced I\/O devices as transparent as possible, much like the computer mouse in traditional applications.","Object Manipulation and Interaction","Developing an interactive 3D application is a complex process because of the necessity of defining simulated objects and controlling their state at run-time. The VHT has a significant section dedicated to these particular tasks. The Haptic Hierarchy and associated import filters provide a simple way to specify the geometrical and physical details of digital objects. The Collision Detection Engine keeps track of any contact between objects as they move or change shape and provides the simulation environment with this information in a multi-threaded fashion.","Rendering","Some applications need to present the mathematical and geometrical information discussed above in a more visual form, namely as 3D digital objects. Although that particular task does not involve the VHT, close cooperation is required to achieve realistic rendering. For this the VHT provides a Data-Neutral Scene Graph that binds user-specific data with haptic objects for synchronization, or notification of haptic events. It also offers the functionality to render digital hands that closely mimic the behaviour of a human hand being measured by an instrumented glove such as the CyberGlove.","Creating an Application","There are three simple steps to follow when using the VHT as the main haptic simulation loop of your application. One approach is: connecting to a CyberGlove and a six degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) position tracker (Polhemus or Ascension), associating the devices to the application's virtual hand (vhtHumanHand instance), and creating the support environment with the vhtEngine and vhtSimulation classes.","Setting-Up a Virtual Hand","The Virtual Hand Toolkit uses a client\/server architecture in which the user's application acts as the client. The physical devices reside on the server side, also known as the Device Manager. The Device Manager can be running on the same machine as a user's application, or on any other machine on a network (or even the Internet). In either case, it is necessary to specify which of the devices are going to be used by the application.","The address of a CyberGlove is given through a helper class named vhtIOConn. The straightforward use of vhtIOConn is through a resource registry, which is specified in an external file. If the REGISTRY_FILE environment variable specifies a registry file, then to attach to the default glove you only have to set the variable as shown below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"vhtCyberGlove *glove="]},{"entry":[{},"new vhtCyberGlove(vhtIOConn::getDefault(vhtIOConn::glove));"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"One can also provide all the details in software code.

For this purpose, a haptic scene graph framework is provided, along with an external data import mechanism.","The haptic scene graph can be constructed by specifying the geometry of simple objects from within the application. Given the complexity of the average digital object, applications can import object descriptions from data files generated by third-party 3D modellers.","Specifying Objects","Two kind of geometries are supported as nodes of the haptic scene graph: polyhedrons, and elementary common shapes like spheres and cubes.","Polyhedrons are useful for approximating most surfaces found on objects. It is common for 3D modellers to generate triangle-based faces of complex geometries, as they are simple to manage and they have good properties for visual rendering.

According to one or more embodiments of the invention, the VHT can provide an expansion path to facilitate drawing or creating virtual objects.","Refreshing from the Data Neutral Graph","During the execution of an application, the VHT will detect collisions and work in concert with the simulation logic to react to them, normally by at least displacing objects. For example, you can picture the haptic action of pushing a cube using the hand. This section describes how the information is transferred from the haptic scene graph into the visual scene graph, so that visual geometries move appropriately.","Yet another graph, the data neutral graph (e.g., the Neutral Scene Graph or NSG), will provide the glue between the two scene graphs. Typically, the data neutral graph is created as objects are imported and transferred into the haptic scene graph, as mentioned under the heading Using a NodeParser below. The data neutral scene graph mechanism is explained in greater detail below.","The VHT holds any independent collidable object as a vhtComponent node of the haptic scene graph. In the simple case, the visual update is a simple matter of transferring the transformation matrices from the vhtComponent nodes into the equivalent nodes of the visual scene graph. This is valid if the visual objects don't have non-collidable mobile sub-elements (for example, a car which doesn't have spinning wheels).","The VHT facilitates that operation by keeping an optimized list of data neutral nodes which link the matching vhtComponent and visual instances. That list is accessed with the vhtEngine::getComponentUpdaters. The list is made of instances of vhtNodeHolder, which are simply convenient place holders for data neutral nodes. The method vhtNodeHolder::getData returns the actual data neutral node.","In the following code segment, the first element of the list of data neutral nodes associated with vhtComponents is queried. Then, a loop iterates through the elements of the list. At each iteration, it extracts the CosmoCode node and its vhtComponent equivalent (if any), and copies the transformation of the vhtComponent into the CosmoCode node's matrix; using the correct ordering of matrix elements. Note that this example is based on a utilization of the vhtCosmoParser class, which can create a map between vhtComponent and csTransform instances. For this reason, no class checking is implemented in the loop, but in general such a blind operation would be error-prone.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0132","num":"0131"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00020","num":"00020"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"273pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"csMatrix4f fastXform;"},{"entry":"vhtNodeHolder *updateCursor;"},{"entry":"vhtCosmoNode *mapNode;"},{"entry":"vhtComponent xformGroup;"},{"entry":"updateCursor= globalEngine->getComponentUpdaters(\u2009);"},{"entry":"while (updateCursor != NULL) {"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"259pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"mapNode= (vhtCosmoNode *)updateCursor->getData(\u2009);"]},{"entry":[{},"if ((xformGroup= (vhtComponent *)mapNode->getHaptic(\u2009)) != NULL) {"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"238pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"csTransform *transformNode;"]},{"entry":[{},"vhtTransform3D *xform;"]},{"entry":[{},"double scaling, matrix[4][4];"]},{"entry":[{},"unsigned int i;"]},{"entry":[{},"if ((transformNode= (csTransform *)mapNode->getCosmo(\u2009)) != NULL) {"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"xform= xformGroup->getLM(\u2009);"]},{"entry":[{},"xform.getTransform(matrix);"]},{"entry":[{},"fastXform.setCol(0, matrix[0][0], matrix[0][1], matrix[0][2], matrix[0][3]);"]},{"entry":[{},"fastXform.setCol(1, matrix[1][0], matrix[1][1], matrix[1][2], matrix[1][3]);"]},{"entry":[{},"fastXform.setCol(2, matrix[2][0], matrix[2][1], matrix[2][2], matrix[2][3]);"]},{"entry":[{},"fastXform.setCol(3, matrix[3][0], matrix[3][1], matrix[3][2], matrix[3][3]);"]},{"entry":[{},"transformNode->setMatrix(fastXform);"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"238pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"}"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"259pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"}"]},{"entry":[{},"updateCursor= updateCursor->getNext(\u2009);"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"273pt","align":"left"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"}"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}},"br":{}},"The VHT device layer is included with some hardware products, according to one or more embodiments of the invention.

Scene graphs are widely used in computer graphics applications for representing geometric relationships between all the components in a scene. Popular examples of scene-graph-based API's include OpenInventor, Performer, OpenGL Optimizer and VRML97. Readers unfamiliar with scene graphs are encouraged to read texts covering some of the API's mentioned above.","According to one of more embodiments of the invention, the VHT scene graphs are primarily oriented toward haptic and dynamic operations, rather than graphic rendering.","The information necessary to build a good representation of a virtual environment is quite complex, and requires a special flexibility in terms of geometrical and visual data management. Because of that, the VHT does not rely on a single scene graph to manage the virtual environment. Instead, it relies on a mapping mechanism to link haptic and visual information while giving a maximum flexibility for developers to use the most appropriate scene description within their applications. This section discuss the Haptic Scene Graph and the Data Neutral Scene Graph of the VHT. The VHT scene graphs are also designed to release developers from constraining their own data structures in order to accommodate the VHT.","Haptic Scene Graph","The haptic scene graph is an organizational data structure used to store virtual environment information such as geometry, coordinate transformations and grouping properties, for the purpose of collision detection, haptic feedback and simulation. Each object in a scene, often referred to as a node, can be viewed as the composition of a number of geometric entities positioned in space according to a coordinate frame local to the object. In turn, each object has a coordinate transformation from the global frame that defines the basis of its local coordinate frame. The haptic scene graph includes facilities to transform positions expressed in a local coordinate frame to a global one, and for the exhaustive parsing of all elements in a formal order.","According to one or more embodiments of the invention, the VHT haptic scene graph is a directed tree without cycles, rather than a general graph. According other embodiments of the invention, however this limitation might be removed.","Fundamental Haptic Scene Graph Classes","As discussed above, a scene graph can contain at least two types of nodes, namely transformation grouping nodes and geometric nodes. By organizing these two types of nodes into a tree-like data structure, we obtain a hierarchy of geometric transformations that can be applied to geometric shapes. In the VHT, the vhtTransformGroup and vhtShape3D classes provide the basic set of scene graph nodes. The haptic scene graph can be constructed by inserting nodes one by one from method calls, or by using a model parser like the vhtCosmoParser.","A vhtTransformGroup instance is constructed either with a default transformation, or by passing a homogeneous transformation matrix into the constructor. In the VHT, homogeneous transformations are stored in vhtTransform3D instances. A vhtTransform3D object represents a three-dimensional coordinate transformation, including both arbitrary rotation and translation components.","Transformation instances contain two variables that each hold a type of homogeneous transformations. First, the variable vhtTransformGroup::LM (local matrix) contains a transformation from the local coordinate frame to the global frame (world). The global frame is defined as the frame at the root of the scene graph. Secondly, the variable vhtTransformGroup::transform contains a transformation from the local frame to the frame of the parent node. LM transformations are obtained by just pre-multiplying (i.e. right multiplication) all transforms found along a direct path from the root node to the transform group. The instance variables are accessed through the methods setLM\/getLM and setTransform\/getTransform respectively.","To create hierarchies of nodes, the relationships between the nodes can be defined. This is accomplished with the help of the addChild(vhtNode *nPtr) method of the vhtTransformGroup class. To build a simple hierarchy with two levels, one of which is translated  units along the x-axis, the following can be used:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0148","num":"0147"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00023","num":"00023"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"vhtTransformGroup *root= new vhtTransformGroup(\u2009);"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"182pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"\/\/Define that node as the root node of the haptic graph."]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"root->setRoot(\u2009);"]},{"entry":[{},"vhtTransform3D xform(10.0, 0.0, 0.0);"]},{"entry":[{},"vhtTransformGroup *newFrame= new vhtTransformGroup(xform);"]},{"entry":[{},"root->addChild(newFrame);"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"A haptic scene graph is permitted to have only one node defined as the root node. The root node is defined by calling the setRoot method on the chosen to instance. Note that the root property is a singleton setting in the sense that each user application may have only one root node.","The haptic scene graph becomes interesting when it is populated with actual geometric objects. This is accomplished by adding nodes of the vhtShape3D class. A vhtShape3D instance is actually a geometry container, which is used to store different types of geometry. To better accommodate geometries expressed as NURBS, polygons, implicit definitions and so on, the vhtShape3D contains an instance variable that points to the actual geometric information. This allows users to define new geometries specific to their needs by class inheritance while still retaining all the benefits of the haptic scene graph.","As an example, consider making a cube with unit dimensions. The VHT provides a geometric convenience class called vhtVertexBox for making box-like objects. This class is one of a few elementary primitive shapes of the VHT available to the developer.

In the above discussion, it was shown how to construct a simple scene graph, how to render one and finally how to manipulate one in real time. From the point of view of the VHT, a haptic scene graph is primarily a collision data structure that describes the current state (position, orientation, geometry) of the shapes that constitute a scene.","In a typical user application, the haptic scene graph will be generated by some import mechanism (see Chapter 10), or some other algorithmic technique. Once this is done, a collision engine object will run over the scene graph and generate collision geometry for each vhtShape3D. Once this is done, the vhtSimulation component of the application will execute an update loop on the haptic scene, and the collision engine in tandem.","Seen from this point of view, the render method demonstrated above is primarily for debugging complex scenes in which the collision geometry needs to be rendered. We defer a detailed discussion of this framework to Chapter 8.","Haptic Scene Graphs\u2014More details","This section discusses some of the more advanced features of the haptic scene graph classes: generic grouping nodes, vhtComponent nodes and the human hand scene graph.","The vhtTransformGroup previously introduced is one type of grouping node offered by the VHT. The parent class of vhtTransformGroup is vhtGroup, which is also the superclass of all other grouping nodes. It provides generic child management methods such as numChildren, setChild and detachChild.","The method numChildren returns the number of immediate children that are in the group on which it was called (children of children are not taken in account). In the above sample code, the root node has one child. When a specific haptic scene graph layout is required and its position in the children list is known, the setChild method can be used to specify the child index for a new addition. This can be used instead of the addChild method. Note that the VHT does not impose any limitation on the way user applications can order children in a grouping node. In particular, it is possible to have a single child with an index of . This would mean that the first 9 children of the group would be empty slots (NULL pointers). In this case, a child that is added afterward with the addChild method will get the index value of 11.","Finally vhtGroup::detachChild is used to remove a child from the scene graph. It takes either a child index or a child object pointer as its argument, and cause the specified child to be removed from the scene graph. The nodes are not deleted, but the connection to the haptic scene graph is broken. This can be used to move subgraphs from one location to another in the scene graph.","The vhtSwitch node is a grouping node that has an \u201cactive child\u201d property. During a haptic scene graph traversal, only the active child (if any) is used. This is useful for scene operations like varying level-of-detail, where a group node will have several versions of the same subgraph in varying resolutions. Depending on the user viewpoint, the best subgraph is chosen. This behaviour is accessible through the methods currentChild and setWhichChild. The first method returns a vhtNode instance, which is the head of the active subgraph. The second takes a single integer argument that is the index of the desired active vhtNode.","The vhtComponent is yet another type of grouping node. It is intended as a convenient reference node for rigid objects composed of several vhtShape3D nodes. Most geometric modelling software builds geometries using some primitives that can be added together. The VHT supports this type of construction through the vhtComponent node. All children of a vhtComponent instance have fast pointers to the component. The pointers are accessed by using the getComponent method of the vhtNode class. The convenience of this type of object is in aggregate processing such as collision detection and hand-grasping algorithms.","The vhtComponent importance is shown in the light of collision detection. For now, note that by default, only vhtShape3D nodes that have different vhtComponent parents can be collided. For the moment, consider a simple example of constructing a geometry that resembles a barbell. It can be thought of as composed of three cylinders, a long thin one representing the bar and two short thick ones for the weights. By using the center of the bar as the local coordinate system, all three shapes can be vhtShape3D nodes (and their associated geometry). Now in an application the barbell might be spinning and flying (as barbells often do). By making the entire barbell nodes a subgraph of a vhtComponent instance, we need only update the transform of the component and refresh. The haptic scene graph will automatically treat all the children of the component as a rigid body and optimize the refresh action.","Data Neutral Scene Graph","The VHT's haptic scene graph is oriented toward other tasks than graphic rendering. Examples of the previous section have demonstrated the haptic scene graph features by eventually drawing its content; yet this was mostly done for the sake of pedagogy. In a user application, the rendering is most likely to use a different approach, oriented toward visual quality and the use of some drawing package. This is why the VHT provides an additional type of scene graph, called the Data Neutral Scene Graph.","The Data Neutral Scene Graph acts as a mapping mechanism between the Haptic Scene Graph and other information, typically a visual description of the scene on which the application works. Thus an application using the VHT is expected to contain in general three scene graphs: the visual graph, the haptic graph, and the data neutral graph that will map associated nodes from first two graphs.","The primary class used in the Data Neutral Scene Graph is vhtDataNode. It provides the basic graph management methods, and it can point to an associated node that belongs to the Haptic Scene Graph. Conversely, a node in the Haptic Scene Graph that has been associated by a vhtDataNode will point back to that instance, thus providing a mapping to some external information. The Data Neutral Scene Graph is a stencil for developing customized versions according to an application requirements.","The support for the CosmoCode rendering library is implemented in this very fashion. The VHT derives the vhtDataNode into a vhtCosmoNode class by supplying a placeholder for csNode instances. As the CosmoCode import filter provided by the class vhtCosmoParser traverses a CosmoCode scene graph, it creates instances of vhtCosmoNode, and links them with the corresponding dual instances of csNode and vhtNode. The vhtCosmoParser shows the simplicity of expanding the VHT to communicate with an external scene graph.","The VHT also provides a CosmoCode tree parser (vhtCosmoParser class), which traverses CosmoCode scene graph, created from VRML files. This parser descends the CosmoCode tree, creates a haptic node for each appropriate csNode, and finally creates instances of vhtCosmoNode that act as a bidirectional maps between the visual and haptic nodes. So for an application that imports and draws VRML files using CosmoCode, three scene graphs would be used: the CosmoCode scene graph for rendering, the haptic scene graph, for collision detection and force feedback, and finally the data neutral nodes to exchange modifications such as movements to either the visual or the haptic scenes.","The main features of the vhtDataNode are the getParent and getChildren methods, which return both a vhtDataNode instance. The children of a vhtDataNode are organized as a linked list, rather then an ordered list as in the haptic scene graph grouping nodes. This linked-list is browsed by using the getNext\/getPrevious methods. Finally, the haptic node (a vhtNode object) associated with a data neutral node is defined and accessed with the setHaptic\/getHaptic methods. All other functionality is subclass dependant.","In an application that makes use of the multi-threaded abilities of the VHT and links with an external scene graph or some other data structure, synchronous data integrity must be maintained explicitly. The VHT provides a locking mechanism that works in conjunction with the vhtSimulation class discussed below. This is accomplished by calling vhtNode::sceneGraphLock and then calling vhtNode::sceneGraphUnlock to unlock the graph. These calls are fairly expensive in terms of performance and data latency so locking should be centralized in user application code and used as sparingly as possible.","As an example of a situation where locking is required, consider a CosmoCode scene graph that is connected via a data neutral scene graph to a haptic scene graph. The haptic scene graph is updated by some vhtSimulation method that the user code has inherited. Once per graphic rendering frame, the LM matrices corresponding to all vhtComponent classes in the haptic scene graph need to update their corresponding nodes in the CosmoCode scene graph so that the visual matches the haptic. During this process, the vhtSimulation instance must be paused or blocked from updating the component nodes while they are being read or else the visual scene graph might display two superimposed haptic frames.

This scene graph can be manipulated just like any other haptic scene graph (see Chapter 5). Access to the root node of this scene graph is provided by the getHapticRoot method.

These calls are performed automatically when then vhtHumanHand is registered with the vhtEngine. In order for this to take place, each hand must be registered with the active engine object using the vhtEngine::registerHand method. Hand registration also takes care of adding the hand scene graph to the current haptic scene graph root node, as a child.","The hand haptic scene graph is organized into six subgraphs, one for each finger starting with the thumb and one for the palm.

This can be very useful in collision detection, when only the vhtShape3D is returned from the collision engine. Chapter 8: Collision Detection, gives an example that uses this access technique.","Visual Hand Geometry","The vhtHumanHand class is equipped with a visual geometry that can draw itself in an OpenGL context. The visual geometry is accessible through getVisualGeometry and setVisualGeometry access methods, which return and set a vhtHandGeometry instance.","Once the user has an active OpenGL context and an active vhtHumanHand class it is very simple to draw the current hand configuration. The first step is to allocate a vhtOgIDrawer object. This object knows how to traverse and draw the vhtHandGeometry class.

This mode runs a control law on the Force Control Unit (FCU) at 1000 Hz to control the force feedback. In this mode, the VHT uses objects of type vhtContactPatch to supply the dedicated hardware unit with predictive information about the physical environment simulated by the application.","A vhtContactPatch instance represents a tangent plane approximation to the surface of the virtual object which is touched by a particular finger. Contact patches can be constructed in a variety of ways, depending on the user application.","When the vhtHumanHand::update method is invoked, a query is done for each finger in the haptic graph to determine if a contact patch has been set. If there are any fresh patches, they are sent over to the controller. Although each finger has 3 phalanges, and each phalanx allows a separate contact patch, the CyberGrasp device has only one degree of freedom per finger. For this reason, the to \u2018best\u2019 patch is chosen for each finger as the closest patch to the distal joint. For example, if two patches are set on the index finger, one for the metacarpal and one for the distal, only the distal patch will be sent to the controller.","After each call to vhtHumanHand::update, the patches on all phalanx are reset. In order to continue to \u2018feel\u2019 an object, a new set of patches will have to be set before the next call to the update method.","Grasping Virtual Objects","Once an application has constructed a vhtHumanHand object, a scene graph and a collision mechanism, the VHT provides a mechanism for allowing vhtComponent objects to attach themselves to the virtual hand. This procedure is more commonly known as \u2018grasping\u2019.","Each vhtComponent has a method getGraspManager that returns an object of type vhtGraspStateManager. The grasp state manager encapsulates an algorithm for allowing scene components to be automatically \u2018picked up\u2019 by a virtual hand. The basic idea is that when a virtual hand collides with a vhtComponent graph, each hand part (phalanx, palm) generates some collision information, including the surface normal at the collision point. If these contact normals provide sufficient friction, the component will be attached to the hand.","Although the algorithm is somewhat complex, in practice, using this feature is very simple.

The second and third lines of code in this method call the vhtGraspStateManager::constrain( ) and vhtGraspStateManager::reset( ) methods respectively. The constrain method tells the state manager to enforce the current grasping state. This means that if the normal conditions are sufficient, the component will be fixed relative to the virtual hand. The second method resets the cached collision information in the state manager. The purpose of this is to allow components to be released from a grasped state. If there are no collision reports after a reset call, the next constrain call will result in the component being released.","After this, there is some code to extract the collision events for the current frame. It is important to see that we isolate all collisions between a hand and any other scene component. Once this is done, the last code segment sets the phalanx and normal for the current collision event with the vhtGraspStateManager::addPhalanxNormal( ) method. Calls to this method cache the normal and phalanx information to allow a call to constrain to determine if the component should be grasped.","An additional trick has been added is to make object grasping particularly easy, contact normals are set for all MTD's less that 0.2. This means that even if the fingers are not touching the object (they could be 2 mm away), the grasping algorithm is invoked. For more exact grasping, this threshold should be less than or equal to zero.","One-Fingered Grasping","In some situations, it is useful to allow components to be constrained to a single phalanx. The vhtGraspStateManager facilitates this with the setUseGraspOneState method. When this is enabled, any single point contact (from addPhalanxNormal) will result in the component being constrained to that hand part. It is the responsibility of the user application to release the component (via a reset call).","Ghost Hand Support","In a virtual environment, one of the most psychologically disturbing events is watching as a virtual hand passes right through a virtual object in the scene. The human brain rejects this type of event strongly enough that it reduces the suspension of disbelief most applications of this type are trying to achieve. For this reason, the VHT includes support for a ghost hand algorithm that attempts to prevent such interpenetrations.","The ghost hand algorithm works by trying to find a vector that can be added to the current tracker position that will place the hand outside of all objects in the scene. This algorithm also has a coherence property, in that the hand should move the minimum amount from the previous frame to achieve this non-penetration. Thus moving the virtual hand down through a virtual cube will result in the graphical hand remaining on top of the cube.","In the situation where the graphical hand has been constrained by the ghosting algorithm, a non-zero offset vector exists that is added to the tracker. Once the physical hand moves in a direction away from contact, the graphical hand will try to converge this offset vector to zero by a small increment each frame (this is controlled by the get\/setConvergenceRate method).","In practice, the ghost hand algorithm performs well; however it may be noted that the algorithm may generally degrade with decreasing haptic frame rate.","This functionality is encapsulated in a subclass of the vhtHumanHand called vhtGhostHumanHand. Objects of this class can be constructed exactly as a regular vhtHumanHand, and in fact behave in exactly the same way most of the time. However, there is one additional method, vhtGhostHunanHand::setContactPair( ). In practice, the user application simply needs to tell the ghost hand about all the collision pairs caused by hand-scene collisions. The update method will take care to of the graphical constraint calculations.","Haptic Simulations","Applications that use the VHT for hand-based interaction or haptic scene graph simulation are most likely to have a similar program structure. In most cases, at the beginning of each frame, the most recent data is obtained from all external hardware devices, then the haptic scene graph is updated, and then user processing is performed based on the fresh data. The VHT source code segments presented in previous example have such structure. In each case, the user action is to render the scene or the hand. The VHT contains a formalized set of classes that encapsulate such a haptic simulation.","The front-end class for haptic simulation is vhtEngine. In an application, a single instance is used to register and to manage all hands in a scene, the scene graph, and allow for importing arbitrary scene graphs. The vhtEngine class also uses multi-threading to update all of its members without the intervention from the user application. User applications simply have to set any vhtHumanHand using the registerHand method (there is currently a limit of 4 hands that can be registered simultaneously). The scene graph to manage is set with the method setHapticSceneGraph. Once these two parameters have been defined, the engine can be started.

While a haptic simulation is running, any of the nodes in the scene graph can be queried or changed as well as any aspect of the registered hands. As mentioned in the previous section, due to the multi-threading nature of haptic simulations, all scene graph nodes should be locked during data reads and\/or writes.","The above framework enables user applications to easily query data from a running haptic simulation. This can be useful for graphical rendering or for telerobotic applications. However it may be necessary to have a smaller grain synchronization between the application and each update loop of the simulation. For this the VHT provides the vhtSimulation class. A vhtEngine instance invokes the doSimulation method of an associated vhtSimulation object once per frame. By extending vhtSimulation class, user applications can insert arbitrary processing into the haptic simulation. The method vhtEngine::useSimulation is used to set the user-defined vhtSimulation object.","By default, the vhtSimulation::doSimulation method performs the scene graph refresh and hand updates. Before the scene graph is locked by the vhtSimulation, the method preLockProcess is called. After all external data is updated, but while the scene graph is locked, the method handleConstraints is called. After the scene graph is unlocked, postLockProcess is called. It is only necessary to inherit those methods that the user application actually needs to call. For many applications this will either be none or just handleConstraints. The three methods, preLockProcess, handleConstraints and postLockProcess do no action in the library provided vhtSimulation. Users are encouraged to subclass and use these entry points.","We conclude this section with an example that reworks the previous spinning cube demo into the vhtSimulation framework. In addition, we add a human hand and demonstrate the use of locking to draw the current state of the haptic scene graph using OpenGL.","Collision Detection","The determination of contact between two virtual graphical objects constitutes the field of collision detection. Contact information can take many forms, some applications only require boolean knowledge of collisions whereas others need detailed contact parameters such as surface normals and penetration depths. The VHT collision mechanism supports all of these requirements by providing a modular interface structure. In this framework, users may customize the collision detection to any desired degree.","Collision detection algorithms are almost always the primary source of to performance degradation in applications that check for collisions. For this reason, the VHT system consists of several layers of optimized techniques to ensure the highest possible performance. The collision detection process can be divided into two steps: wide mode followed by local mode.","In wide mode, an algorithm tries to reduce the large number of possible collision pairs to the smallest possible set. The VHT collision system uses a number of techniques to globally cull all possible collision pairs to a smaller set of probable collision pairs. The algorithm does this in a conservative manner so that collisions are never missed.","In local mode, also known as pair-wise collision detection, two shapes are compared at the actual geometry level to determine detailed contact information. Information such as contact normals, closest points, etc. is calculated. VHT includes support for two implementations of an algorithm known as GJK (for Gilbert-Johnson-Keethri) for performing these computations.","The collision framework also provides for user customization of the entire local mode process. This modularity allows for the creation of high performance collision modules specialized for each user application. An overview of the collision engine structure is presented in .","The management of collision geometries, wide mode and other collision processing is handled internally in the vhtCollisionEngine class. An object of type vhtCollisionEngine is constructed by specifying a haptic scene graph and a collision factory to use. This chapter contains an overview of the factory and engine construction and use.","The Collision Factory","In the VHT, a collision framework is a pair of objects, a vhtCollisionEngine and an associated vhtCollisionFactory. The collision engine operates on data that are produced by its collision factory. However the vhtCollisionFactory class is an interface class (pure virtual) that sub-classes must implement.","The two virtual methods in the vhtCollisionFactory are:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0241","num":"0240"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00036","num":"00036"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["vhtCollisionPair","*generateCollisionPair( vhtShape3D &obj1, vhtShape3D &obj2 );"]},{"entry":["vhtGeometry","\u2002*generateCollisionGeometry( vhtShape3D &obj);"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"The first method determines if two vhtShape3D nodes can collide, and if so, generates an appropriate vhtCollisionPair object.

The basic purpose of this code is to parse the collision list and for each distal joint collision event encountered, send an appropriate message to the connected CyberGrasp force feedback device.","The first thing this code does is retrieve the current collision list and check to see if there are any collisions reported.","For each collision event the code extracts the vhtCollisionPair object which corresponds to two objects in collision proximity. See the Programmer's Reference Manual for a full description of this class' functionality.","The next step is to determine which two objects are colliding. This code example uses the fact that all hand-related shape nodes have external attributes. By checking each object in the pair for this property, we can determine which one is a hand node and which one is an object. From this, we use the fact that all hand shape nodes are children of a phalanx (including the palm) to retrieve the hand object.","This portion of the code completes the collision detection phase. Once the colliding objects have been identified, the code moves into the collision response to phase. In this example the response will be just to construct and send a contact patch to the CyberGrasp controller unit corresponding to the surface of the object being touched.","Contact patches are tangent plane representations of the surface of objects. These tangent planes are specified in world coordinates. Using rotate instead of transform preserves the unit length character of normal vectors. By updating the contact patches sent to the grasp controller on every haptic frame, it is possible to feel the surface of complex geometric objects.Somewhat by way of summary, the collision framework provided by the VHS consists of two primary components, a collision factory and a collision engine. Once these two pieces have been constructed and associated with a haptic scene graph, a single engine method provides a list of collision pairs. User applications are then free to use any or all of the provided information to construct their own response. In conjunction with the VHS hand class, it is straightforward to implement grasping and ghost hand behaviour.","Model Import","The VHS programming framework is structured so that it is very simple to integrate into 3rd party rendering or visualization environments. In this chapter, the mechanism by which scene graphs can be imported from an arbitrary data structure (or file) is discussed. Once a scene graph has been imported into the VHS, there is a mechanism for synchronizing the position and orientation of all shapes in the scene very rapidly. This mechanism is also discussed.","The VHS ships with an associated library VHTCosmo that provides an interface to the Cosmo\/Optimizer SDK. This will be the basis of the description in this section.","The fundamental structure behind scene graph import and synchronization is a structure known as the neutral scene graph (NSG). The NSG provides a (non-bijective) mapping between any external scene graphs nodes and the VHT scene graph nodes. The NSG is non-bijective in the sense that there does not need to be an exact 1\u20141 correspondence between every node (although in practice this will usually be the case).","The external interface consists of the following steps:","Subclass a new neutral node type.","Implement a node parser.","Import a scene graph.","Use the vhtEngine::getComponentUpdaters mechanism to synchronize.","Neutral Scene Graph","The NSG is a graph of nodes of type vhtDataNode. The base class has all the functionality necessary to manipulate and construct a simple graph. For the purpose of model import, a subclass of the vhtDataNode must be constructed so that a pointer to the 3rd party graph (3PG) is available.
