No. 10\/856,560 filed May 28, 2004 issued as U.S. Pat. No. 7,167,705; co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/357,653 filed Feb. 16, 2006; co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/926,738 filed Oct. 29, 2007; and co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/019,335 filed Jan. 24, 2008. All the above references are by the same inventor as the present application and are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties for all purposes.","The present disclosure relates generally to the management of telecommunication services in telecommunications networks, and in particular to common user authentication and subscription management on disparate telecommunication networks for various telecommunication services.","A telecommunications network can be of several types, including mobile telecommunications networks and fixed telecommunications networks. Mobile telecommunication networks can include telecommunications networks hosted on networks of cellular stations and mobile telephones, pagers, radio-devices, and other infrastructure and portable devices which allow a user to communicate wirelessly. Mobile telecommunications networks also include those networks hosted on satellites and portable ground stations, vehicle-mounted communications gear, and handheld devices. Other mobile telecommunications networks are also available. Fixed telecommunications networks can include telecommunications networks hosted on public switched telephone networks (PSTN), land lines, and wired infrastructure within businesses and homes. Fixed telecommunications networks can also include those hosted over the Internet or local internets connecting computers, network appliances, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephones, and other devices. Telecommunication networks can also include a hybrid of fixed and mobile networks, such as wired networks which reconfigure so that a user can move between wired nodes and connect and reconnect by wire or wirelessly to the network as if the user were on one network. Telecommunications networks are typically provided by network providers.","Telecommunications services, sometimes referred to as simply \u201cservices,\u201d can include services such as voice mail, call conferencing, presence detection, and call hunting. Presence detection and call hunting services include the process of determining a phone number (or IP address) which a target user is using or has recently used in order to forward calls to that number. Services are typically provided by service providers.","An Operations Support System (OSS) is a computer system which supports processing in a telecommunications network, such as maintaining network inventory, provisioning services, configuring network components, and managing faults. A Business Support System (BSS) is a computer system which may interface with customers, take orders, process bills, and collect payments. An OSS and a BSS can run on the same computer or computers and may be integrated with each other. An OSS and BSS can have separate or shared database repositories.","A BSS repository can store customer information from a service provider point of view, such as customer address information, customer billing information, products purchased by the customer, and campaigns to which a customer has responded. A BSS repository also can include subscription information for a customer, such as information for any voice, wireless, or roaming plan, as well as number of minutes purchased per month, etc. Such information is treated as product information from a BSS point of view, and the BSS repository also will include information as to whether a particular customer is subscribing to that product. If, for example, a customer subscribing to a new subscription is entitled to a new phone, that information typically will be maintained in the BSS repository. A BSS repository also typically is used to maintain trouble tickets, such as information regarding problems with service or failure to receive a form, as well as maintaining security credentials.","An OSS repository, on the other hand, is used for monitoring and administration of the system or other OSS operations such as charging\/rating and activation provisioning. An OSS repository can also contain subscriber information such as information for the current and active bill for a customer, an inventory of assets associated with a customer, types of products or services provided to a customer, etc. A repository at the network level might include current network information for a customer, such as whether the customer is logged onto the network, a location of the customer on the network, whether a customer device is active, etc.","A service resource such as a Service Delivery Platform (SDP) repository stores subscription information for a customer that is useful in running software services that are exposed to the customer, such as whether a particular customer has requested to receive news updates, and if so, also stores preference information such as which types of news the customer wishes to receive, e.g., international news or news related to a specific topic, as well as a channel in which to receive the news (e.g., Short Message Service (SMS) or Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS)) and format information for the news (e.g., background color and font size). The SDP repository also can include information such as an identity for each customer, credentials, customer availability, etc.","In the lexicon of telecommunications, \u201cconvergence\u201d typically means that a service provider offers different networks (e.g., fixed, mobile, wireless, broadband) and offers the same services on the different networks. Also, the different networks may be provided by partnering network providers.","It is often understood that convergence uses IP (Internet Protocol) Multimedia System (IMS). IMS offers a common set of network, transport, and session layers independent of the bearer of services.","IMS is sometimes considered the architecture for Next Generation Networks (NGN). IMS is built on IP standards such as Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and Diameter. In the network layer, a core SIP network handles routing and location lookup. In the application layer, SIP application servers provide services.","IMS generally standardizes the network layer infrastructure and application layer on vanilla Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)-standardized SIP. The standardization of the network layer infrastructure and application layer uses the SIP\/IP core and SIP session layer, respectively.","The telecommunications industry is specifying and promoting new networks (such as NGNs or Next Generation Networks) that aim to provide support for the latest technologies (e.g., VoIP, multimedia streaming and messaging, and web 2.0) and an Internet-like user experience with viable business models for the operators. These networks can be used to provide new, attractive, and revenue generating multimedia ad real time services, for example. IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) is the most widely known example of such a new network technology. With its layered architecture, IMS provides the ability to deploy new exciting services (e.g., VoIP, Multimedia streaming and messaging and web 2.0), as well as convergence (e.g. Voice Call Continuity (VCC)), making these services available through multiple access networks, such as FMC (Fix Mobile Convergence) where the services are available through mobile and wired networks. Of course, the Internet is the other mainstream of NGN that enables web 2.0 services in general.","An example of a new and exciting service is triple play (voice+data+video) and quadruple play (e.g., adding IPTV, PSTN or mobile) combined with shared business support systems from a single operator or a service provider to a consumer. Demand for such converged services, combined with the convergence between wireless and fixed networks (e.g., broadband), further emphasizes the need to move away from silo-based architectures and instead rely on a horizontal, standards-based platform that enables convergence.","In telecommunications, service providers not only deal with the networks assets, platforms, and services, but must also support business processes to provide services to their customers and interact with their partners and suppliers, as well as operational processes to monitor and administer these assets. Tools, infrastructure, data repositories, and applications for performing these tasks are referred to as service provider business support systems (BSS) and operational support systems (OSS). BSS typically includes resources that support the business aspects (e.g. CRM, PRM, ERP, Analytics, financial, revenue management) while OSS supports the execution of the business with aspects like monitoring, management, and administration; resolution of trouble; billing and\/or charging; provisioning; activation; fulfillment; etc.) In any service provider, services and runtime interact with OSS and BBS. Today, OSS and BSS are often complex archaic systems designed for legacy networks where services, hardware, and network resources consist mainly of static components.","IMS has been of interest to service providers because IMS promises interoperability out of the box with a prescribed deployment architecture and a \u2018wall garden\u2019 that allows SP viable business models. However, IMS is just one Next Generation Network option of many, including vanilla IETF SIP (Internet\/intranet) to pre-IMS. IMS has been referred to as rigid, complex, and costly, and it has not yet been widely deployed. IMS will probably evolve, and less stringent evolutionary systems will probably be available that support IMS-like services, such as push-to-talk over cellular without full IMS deployment. However, there is a need for systems and processes that can attain convergence but which do not require re-hosting, re-architecting, or recapitalizing as IMS is perceived to require.","Systems and methods in accordance with various embodiments can overcome deficiencies in IMS by providing abstracted services and identity and subscription information beyond their access networks and handling user authentication and subscription information for the services in an abstract identity manager.","In one embodiment, a system of telecommunication networks and services comprises a plurality of telecommunications access networks having managed identities as well as a service abstracted from the access networks. The service is adapted to run on the access networks, and an operational support system (OSS) coupled to a business support system (BSS). The OSS and BSS are shared across the access networks, and the access networks have the same identity manager.","Another embodiment relates to a method of managing services on a plurality of different telecommunication networks. The method comprises providing an identity manager to a first telecommunications network and a second telecommunications network, and providing a telecommunications service to the first and second telecommunications networks. The method further comprises authenticating a user using the identity manager through the first telecommunications network, verifying that the user is subscribed to the service using the identity manager through the first telecommunications network, verifying that the user is allowing the user to access the service on the first telecommunications network, authenticating the user using the identity manager through the second telecommunications network, verifying that the user is subscribed to the service using the identity manager through the second telecommunications network, and allowing the user to access the service on the second telecommunications network.","A further understanding of the nature and advantages of the inventions disclosed herein may be realized by references of the remaining portions of the specification and the attached drawings.","Systems and methods in accordance with various embodiments can overcome aforementioned and other deficiencies in existing systems such as IMS by using an abstraction layer for services, user authorization for those services, and subscription confirmation for those services.","As described, it is possible to implement a system where telecommunications services can be deployed on legacy, current, future, and variations of telecommunications networks and have the services co-exist.","For true convergence, a Service Delivery Platform (SDP) in accordance with U.S. Pat. No. 7,167,705 (incorporated by reference above) can be used that abstracts network technologies and is extensible as needed in the service layer with or without IMS. The capability to recognize, authenticate, and manage (e.g. federate) the identity of users across different channels can be addressed with identity management across network and service layers (middleware\/DSP and applications). The capability to share the management of user information and assets (e.g. subscriptions, bills, assets) can be achieved by ensuring that an Operations Support System (OSS)\/Business Support System (BSS) is shared across channels and relies upon the same identity manager. This can be achieved by integrating OSS\/BSS with a service layer following U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/019,335 filed Jan. 24, 2008 (incorporated by reference above).","With SDP and context in a horizontal service layer, service continuity is achievable when network\/radio continuity is supported. For example, Voice Call Continuity (VCC) in the service layer can be achieved with approximately five function calls with many customizable features (e.g. criteria for switches or ways to implement the switch, involved clients). An example use case is to switch phone calls or a media session on a device when on a switch radio network or from device to device across a radio network. A service level Smart Common Input Method (SCIM) for IMS provides the same composition on Internet IMS as well as legacy networks.","In , SDP architecture  implements an example of the desired functionality on top of an underlying J2EE core provided by the application server. It is valuable to have a common identity managed across all the elements and the network, as well as a common view of all the data about a principal. A basic approach to providing a service delivery platform starts with a standards-based IT platform (e.g. J2EE) and makes the platform carrier grade, and extends beyond HTTP to protocols such as SIP, Diameter, and Parlay. To support the key protocols relevant to Telecommunications, for example, the SDP can provide support for SIP\/ISC, Diameter and Parlay CORBA as well as adapters to messaging gateways. A standard approach can be used to build adapters to any other resource or protocol using JCA 1.5, for example. Enablers are provided as reusable components that abstract the network resources and standard northbound interfaces. IT\/SOA then can be used to provide services such as revenue generating services, utilizing SOA-based policies and business rules (e.g. from third parties). The platform then can provide for SOA-based integration of OSS, BSS, and SDP. Exposure to third party content and service provider can be achieved by SOA to expose, integrate and enforce policies. SOA also can be used to also support and rationalize policy management and evaluation throughout the service provider environment.","In one embodiment, the service delivery platform (SDP) is a standards-based horizontal platform that abstracts the underlying network resources and follows a service-oriented architecture (SOA). The platform can be an SOA platform based on J2EE which includes a J2EE converged container and exposes various communication enablers. Enablers can include, for example, call control enablers and media server control enablers as discussed elsewhere herein. Further, interfaces can be exposed to applications and other enablers and resources for usage of various functionality. Some or all of the interfaces can be standard or standardizable, as is its behavior, such as may include Open Mobile Alliance (OMA), Parlay, Parlay X, and WS components. For the purpose of the SDP, these enablers can provide various MVC (Mobile\/Voice\/Communications) functionality. The applications can be built using one or more enablers, and can add notions like a user interface (UI), user management, and charging, either in the code or via delegation and orchestration.","In certain embodiments, the SDP (or the runtime for the network) and the OSS\/BSS components utilize, are developed for using, or are compatible to use the same managed identity so that, independent of the particular network, it can be ensured that the user is the same, and the user identity can be managed appropriately across different networks. Often current systems perform identity management at the network layer, or maybe at the service level when the identity is exposed to a third party. Unfortunately, those two identities are rarely linked and managed, and further there is no existing link with the OSS\/BSS components as the components exist in a separate layer or environment. Systems and methods in accordance with the various embodiments can combine these components using a service-oriented architecture (SOA), and build the components on the same stack so that they can share managed identities.","By integrating components such as SDP, OSS, and BSS components, an end-to-end integration can be provided that enables consistent OSS\/BSS\/SDP coexistence across multiple network technologies, enabling evolutionary deployments of NGNs, as well as enabling consistent OSS\/BSS\/SDP and service sharing across multiple network technologies or providers, enabling true convergence. Such an approach also provides for business-driven management with almost zero touch of all the service provider systems.","With reference to , Service Delivery Platform (SDP)  in SDP architecture  in accordance with an embodiment is a horizontal platform for the service layer that abstracts underlying network resources. The SDP follows a service-oriented architecture and realizes the blueprint (see ) which factors out business rules, provides mobile voice and communication features, and is positioned with respect to IMS and Legacy\/Parlay as an SDP in U.S. Pat. No. 7,167,705 (see above). The SDP has converged SIP AS and OSA AS within the IT platforms and telephony AS, and supports end to end integration with the OSS\/BSS. It is preferable that the SDP is standard based and is implemented in Java EE (formerly Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE)) and has a service-oriented architecture.","A service delivery platform such as is illustrated in  can build upon a standards based IT platform, such as an underlying J2EE core, and can make the platform carrier grade. The SDP can extend support beyond IP HTTP to support key protocols for telecommunications, for example, such as SIP\/ISC, Diameter, and Parlay CORBA, for example, as well as adapters to messaging gateways. A standard or generic approach can be used to build adapters to any other resource or protocol using JCA 1.5. An SDP also can provide enablers as reusable components that abstract network resources and northbound interfaces. Services such as revenue services can be provided via IT and\/or SOA functionality. The SDP also can provide support for SOA-based policies and business rules, as well as SOA-based integration of domains such as OSS domains with the SDP domain.","In certain embodiments, the SDP (or the runtime for the network) and the OSS\/BSS components utilize, are developed for using, or are compatible to use the same managed identity so that, independent of the particular network, it can be ensured that the user is the same, and the user identity can be managed appropriately across different networks. Systems and methods in accordance with the various embodiments can combine components such as OSS\/BSS components using a service oriented architecture (SOA) and an event driven architecture (EDA), and build the components on the same stack, or at least on a same identity framework, so that they can share managed identities.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"],"b":["204","204","204"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["506","508","510"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["612","614","616","618","620","622"]},"With reference to , OSA-AS  includes OSA\/Parlay X APIs overlaid on OSA\/Parlay Java Realization APIs with interfaces to SIP Servlets, OSA JCA 1.5, and other JCA 1.5 (J2EE Connector Architecture) components.","With reference to , SDP  has a suite of service-oriented architecture services, including Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) service  and Virtual Private Branch Exchange Service (Virtual PBX) . SDP  also has charging service , messaging service , voice access service , call control service , presence service , and media server control .","SDP  communicates with lower lying control plane  via a Diameter session. Diameter can call a Serving-Call Session Control Function (S-CSCF), Interrogating-Call Session Control Function (I-CSCF), or Proxy-Call Session Control Function (P-CSCF), which in turn communicate with a Home Subscriber System (HSS) (S-CSCF and I-CSCF) or Breakout Gateway Control Function\/Media Gateway Control Function (BGCF\/MGCF) (P-CSCF). Provisions for a Security Gateway (SEG) may also be included.","S-CSCF communicates through a Multimedia Resource Function (MRF) with IP transport plane . P-CSCF can communicate to transport plane  directly or through BGCF\/MGCF. Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) accepts commands and routes messages through the Internet or IP networks. SGSN can also forward and format commands and messages to a Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) for a PSTN\/PLMN (Public Land Mobile Network) or media gateway for wireless telecommunication networks.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["1050","1056","1054","1052","1058","1056"]},"A UUP can include a service resource such as an enabler that provides an identity managed virtual view of all the data about principals encountered in the SDP, including information such as credentials, subscriptions, service-specific data, network data (e.g., HSS), dynamic data (e.g., presence and location information), and profile information. The UUP provides for customizable schema mapping and caching or pre-fetching of data. The UUP also allows northbound interfaces to be wrapped and\/or transformed as needed. These northbound interfaces can include, for example, interfaces such as Java (e.g., JNDI, JAX RPC, JAX WS), SOAP\/HTTP (e.g., Rg Interface), LDAP, Diameter (e.g., Sh\/Dh, Cx\/Dx), OMA GSSM, and XCAP (e.g., OMA XDM profile enabler) interfaces. The UUP also can support \u201csouthbound\u201d protocols including LDAP, XCAP, JDBC, Custom\/Web service, and Diameter (e.g., Sh\/Dh, Cx\/Dx, HSS, SLS) protocols. The UUP can support various IMS profiles, customer data models, subscriber management features including integration with OSS\/BSS, and various administration features.","The whole platform can be used with identity management services. In one example, a UUP (unified user profile) built on a Virtual Directory offers an identity managed single view of the information about the subscribers (or other principles) from OSS (e.g. assets in inventory), BSS (e.g. bill and subscriptions), network (e.g. HSS via Sh), Dynamic information (e.g. presence or location) and any other service level specific information (e.g. credentials, and application or enabler data).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["1102","1104","1106","1108","1110"]},"According to one embodiment, operations , , and  are similar to operations , , and , respectively, but performed on the second telecommunications network.
