title: System and method for the automated brokerage of financial instruments
abstract: Disclosed herein in a preferred embodiment is an automated financial instrument brokerage system wherein a front end layer interacts with customers to generate activity requests for an intermediate layer. The intermediate layer preferably processes the activity requests and places financial instrument orders on a financial market if appropriate. A backend layer preferably provides data to the intermediate layer for processing activity requests. Multiple heterogeneous front end customer applications may be supported by the same intermediate layer. Further, multiple backend layer applications may interact with the intermediate layer in a manner transparent to the front end layer. Further, scalability can be achieved be partitioning various tasks of the intermediate layer onto separate servers, and more preferably on separate redundant servers. Load balancers may then be used in the intermediate layer to provide distributed access to these servers. Also disclosed herein is a caching technique whereby turnaround time for processing activity requests can be reduced by reducing the number of times that the intermediate layer needs to interact with the backend layer.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE AND PRIORITY CLAIM TO RELATED APPLICATION","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application is a divisional of pending U.S. application Ser. No. 10\/692,067, filed Oct. 22, 2003, published as U.S. Patent Application Publication 2004\/0167840, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention relates to an automated electronic system for processing orders from investors for transactions of financial instruments and supplying financial account information to investors.","In the present day, investors are discovering that computers and, in particular, computer networks such as the Internet, are a particularly useful tool for managing and tracking their financial investment portfolio. Whether it is an individual investor seeking to occasionally buy or sell stocks, bonds, or other financial instruments; a day trader conducting numerous such transactions each day; or a professional investor such as a licensed broker who manages the financial portfolios of numerous clients; access via a computer network to financial markets to conduct these transactions is now and increasingly more so in the future an important channel for execution of this business.","Thus, a need in the art has developed for an infrastructure that both supports access to the financial markets and provides fast and efficient management of those transactions. In previous systems known to the inventors herein, such infrastructure as adopted and used in the prior art took on a client-server model such as that shown in .","As shown in , a trading company maintains a system  that includes a back office mainframe computer  on which customer account data is stored. This customer account data generally includes personal information about each customer (e.g., name, address, etc.), the investment positions of each customer (e.g., what stocks that customer owns), the value of those positions, and any other pertinent account information. To provide access to this account information, one or more web servers  are provided to allow a customer  to access the account information in the mainframe  via a computer network . Business logic that is resident on either or both of the web servers  and the mainframe  operates to process activity requests from a customer such as (1) buying\/selling financial instruments on a trading market  through a gateway  that formats the order requests in accordance with the market specifications and (2) getting current quote data for financial instruments from a quote vendor . For a system  that experiences high customer traffic, redundant web servers are placed behind a load balancer  in order to alleviate any potential delays due to bottlenecks. Incoming activity requests from the customer  are distributed by the load balancer  to an available web server .","However, as electronic trading of financial instruments has grown more popular, the demands placed on the system of  have also increased. In handling this increased demand, the inventors herein have found that such a system is not easily scalable to accommodate high traffic volume. The approach of merely adding new web servers is only a partial solution to the problem for many reasons not the least of which is the cost required to provide each new \u201cintelligent\u201d web server and the problems inherent in the distributed logic working well between the increasing number of elements in the network. Recognizing the drawbacks of the prior art system structure and its inherent limitations, the inventors herein have developed a radical new approach for the design of the infrastructure for an automated financial instrument brokerage system.","According to one aspect of the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the inventors herein have abstracted the system's activity request processing business logic onto an intermediate layer that interfaces front end web servers with backend accounting databases, quote vendors, and trading market interfaces. This design effectively \u201cgathers\u201d the logic together into a single intermediate layer and removes it from the front end and back end layers. Such abstraction greatly improves the system's flexibility to accommodate modifications in the backend of the system (e.g., a new accounting database, a new quote vendor, or a new trading market interface) or modifications in the front end of the system (e.g., modifications to the customer interfaces or the addition of new types of customer interfaces such as an interface to wireless devices such as cell phones or personal digital assistants (PDAs)). Accordingly, the intermediate \u201clayer\u201d or tier of business logic can remain unchanged or largely unchanged when such modifications occur.","According to another aspect of the preferred embodiment of the invention, within the intermediate layer, various tasks of the business logic can be segmented to separate dedicated servers to provide further scalability and flexibility. For example, logic for processing order activity requests can be placed on one or more dedicated order servers. Logic for obtaining customer account data from a backend accounting database can be placed on one or more dedicated customer account servers. Logic for obtaining quote data can be placed on one or more dedicated quote servers. This separation of processing tasks onto separate dedicated servers on the basis of processing type, task or function improves the scalability of the system because if any particular server (e.g., the order server, the customer account server, and\/or the quote server) becomes bogged down with traffic, an additional redundant server of that particular type can be added to the system for increased processing capabilities. Further, modifications to logic can be more easily implemented due to such segmentation as the logic is isolated on the corresponding dedicated server.","According to another aspect of the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the intermediate layer servers preferably communicate with each other and with the front end layer via TCP\/IP communication protocol, which accommodates the front end layer and intermediate layer being physically remote from each other and the various intermediate layer servers being physically remote from each other.","According to another aspect of the preferred embodiment of the present invention, a plurality of redundant servers are preferably implemented in the intermediate layer and a load balancer is preferably used to interface the redundant servers with the front end. The load balancer can also be used to interface the redundant servers with the other server types in the intermediate layer. For example, a load balancer can interface a plurality of redundant order servers with the front end. Preferably, a load balancer is used with a bank of redundant servers for each intermediate layer server type to distribute incoming activity requests among the redundant servers in a balanced manner, thereby greatly decreasing the processing delay for activity requests by eliminating processing bottlenecks. With such a configuration, when additional processing capability is needed for a particular type of processing (e.g., if there is congestion in the bank of redundant order servers), one only needs to add a new redundant server of that type to the system and register that new redundant server with the load balancer for that server group.","According to yet another aspect of the preferred embodiment of the present invention, data caching is preferably utilized in the intermediate layer servers to reduce the need for data transfers between the intermediate layer and the backend layer. For example, resident memory, preferably application-in-memory cache, on a customer account server can be used to store customer account data that has been recently retrieved from the backend accounting database. When an activity request is received by that customer account server that would utilize customer account data that is stored in the cache, the customer account server, in accordance with predetermined usage rules, can process that activity request in accordance with the cached data, thereby alleviating the need for a data transfer from the backend database. Such data caching provides a substantial increase in the speed of processing an activity request. Further, such data caching can also preferably be used in connection with the quote data that the quote server receives from a quote vendor.","According to yet another aspect of the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the intermediate layer can process activity requests generated by the front end layer independently of the customer interface from which the activity request originated (e.g., for activity requests originating from a web site, from a wireless device, or from a touchtone telephone) through the use of a common interface that formats activity requests from any of the customer interfaces in the same manner.","According to yet another aspect of the preferred embodiment of the present invention, quote data can preferably be obtained from multiple quote vendors in a manner transparent to various services in the system, despite potential formatting differences in the quote data from the multiple vendors, because the quote server is preferably configured to convert all quote data into a common data format for internal system wide use, regardless of its source.","According to yet another aspect of the preferred embodiment of the present invention, migration from an old backoffice accounting database system to a new backoffice accounting database system is facilitated by a \u201cthree day system\u201d wherein interaction with the old and new backoffice databases proceeds according to a specialized protocol for the first three days of the migration.","These and other features and advantages of the present invention will be in part apparent and in part pointed out in the following description and referenced figures.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["150","150","152","154","156"]},"The front end layer  acts an interface between users such as customers or brokers (preferably via a computer network such as the Internet) and the intermediate layer . A web server  can provide such an interface. Through the web server , a user can access a web site associated with the system  to initiate activity requests for the system . Activity requests can be any action requested by a user that pertains to a capability of the system. Examples of activity requests include, but are not limited to, an order request to buy or sell a financial instrument, a modification request to modify an order to buy\/sell a financial instrument, a request to view the portfolio for a given customer account, and a request to view recent trade history for a given customer account. These and other activity requests supported by the preferred embodiment will be discussed further below. Also, it is worth noting that the term \u201cfinancial instrument\u201d is used in accordance with its ordinary meaning in the art to mean instruments that can be traded on a financial market or through an electronic order matching facility such as ECN, and includes, but is not limited to, items such as stocks, options, mutual funds, futures, securities futures, and the like. The term \u201cfinancial instrument\u201d does not include checks or money orders.","The front end layer preferably communicates with the intermediate layer through a component object model (COM) interface  that is preferably resident on each of the front end servers. The COM interface  preferably comprises an OrderRules,dll , an OrderClient.dll , a WBOClient.dll , a WBOCalculations.dll , a QuoteClient.dll , and an ODBC . Additional details about these COM interfaces will be described below.","The OrderRules COM object  obtains trading restriction data from the trading administration database described below and validates order activity requests against these restrictions. The OrderClient COM object  provides information needed by an order server  to process order activity requests. The WBOClient object  provides information for obtaining appropriate customer account data from the customer account server . The WBOCalculations COM object  performs various calculations on the customer account data obtained through the WBOClient object . However, it should be noted that the functionality of the WBOCalculations object can be incorporated into the WBOClient object if desired. The QuoteClient object  provides information for obtaining appropriate quote data from the quote server . The ODBC object  provides information for interacting with the SQL database schema .","The intermediate layer  preferably comprises an order server , a customer account server , a quote server , and an SQL database schema .","The order server  receives data from the OrderClient object  and uses this data to process an order related to a financial instrument. In carrying out this processing, the order server preferably interacts with the other intermediate layer servers as set forth below. When an order is ready to be sent to the trading market, the order server prepares an order message for transmission to the order management system  from which it can be acted on by various stock exchanges\/market centers .","The customer account server  receives data from the WBOClient object  and uses this data to obtain the appropriate customer account information either from its own cache memory or from a back office accounting database system . In the preferred embodiment wherein at least one web server  is present in the front end layer  to provide access for customers to the system  through a web site, the customer account server can be characterized as a web-to-back office (WBO) server because it acts as a gateway between the customer using the website and the back office account information. In further discussions herein, the customer account server  will be referred to as a WBO server. However, it should be noted that the customer account server is not limited to being connected at the front end to web applications. Front end access to the customer account server can occur through any known technique of remote data access, including but not limited to LANs, VPNs, dedicated T1 lines, and the like.","The quote server  receives data from the QuoteClient object  and uses this data to obtain appropriate quote information from quote vendors . This quote information is information relating to the pricing of financial instruments, examples of which are set forth below. For example, the quote server can act on a received QuoteClient activity request to obtain the current price for shares of IBM stock.","The SQL database schema  receives activity requests from ODBC . The schema  supports various databases used by other intermediate layer servers when processing activity requests, as will be explained further herein. Preferably, the databases supported by database schema  include separate databases for orders (orders database ), trading administration (trading admin database ), and customers (customers database ).","The back end layer  preferably comprises an order management system  that takes orders from the order server and places those orders on the trading market , a back office accounting database system  that stores customer account information, and an interface  for receiving quote data from a quote vendor. Clearing services  provide post trade functionality such as providing the settlement of trades and the movement of money between parties in the market.","The scalability and flexibility of the preferred embodiment of the present invention is illustrated with . In connection with the front end layer , the use of a common COM interface  supports the use of multiple heterogeneous customer interfaces. For example, the preferred embodiment preferably supports a customer interface through a web site, wherein the web site is supported by a plurality of web servers . Also, a customer interface through touchtone telephones, including but not limited to voice recognition applications, can be supported through IVR touchtone servers . Further, customers can access the system  through a wireless device such as a cell phone, pager, personal digital assistant (PDA), and the like through wireless (WAP) servers . Lastly, through applications installed and running on a customer's computer, a customer can interact with the system through Windows trading application server  and Java trading application servers . The Windows trading application servers  support ScottradeElite software, which is commercially available from the assignee of the present invention. The Java trading application servers  support Scottrader software, which is also commercially available from the assignee of the present invention.","Because each of these heterogeneous customer interfaces interacts with the intermediate layer  through a common COM interface , the intermediate layer is not affected by modifications to the customer interfaces.  illustrates the use of such a common COM interface  for a customer interface through a web site and a customer interface through a wireless device. From the perspective of the intermediate layer, there is no difference between activity requests emanating from the web site or the wireless device. Further, scalability to the front end can be easily provided without altering the intermediate layer through the use of parallel servers in the front end. Thus, if traffic through the web servers  is particularly heavy, a new redundant web server can be added to alleviate congestion.","Although not shown in , it should be understood that the front end layer servers preferably interact with the users through various networks (not shown), security firewalls (not shown), and load balancers (not shown) that arbitrate balanced access to the redundant servers. Such implementations at the front end are standard and known in the art, and do not form part of the present invention.","In the intermediate layer  of , scalability is provided through the use of redundant order servers  in an order server bank , redundant WBO servers  in a WBO server bank , redundant quote servers  in a quote server bank , and clustered SQL databases for schema .","To distribute incoming activity requests in a balanced manner to the various servers, it is preferred that load balancer  connect the front end servers with the WBO server bank . The load balancer  is configured to distribute access to the WBO servers  according to a predetermined algorithm (e.g., round robin or any other known technique) in order to prevent server overload and maintain low activity request processing latency. In a preferred embodiment, the load balancers distribute activity requests to awaiting servers according to a \u201cbest response time\u201d criteria. Load balancers  and  preferably provide the same functionality in connection with order server bank  and quote server bank , respectively. Although in the preferred embodiment, separate load balancers are used for each server type in the intermediate layer, it should be understood that the same load balancer can be used to arbitrate access to both the WBO servers and the quote servers, or any other combination of the different intermediate layer server types. However, because the use of a single load balancer for servers of multiple processing types would introduce a single point of failure to the system , the use of multiple load balancers, wherein each load balancer is assigned to a different server type is strongly preferred over the use of a single load balancer. Further, to more greatly ensure high availability of the intermediate layer server, redundant load balancers can be used with each server bank to take over for a load balancer in the event of a load balancer failure. A preferred load balancer for use with the system  is a CISCO CSS 11154. However, as should be understood, other load balancers can be used in the practice of the invention.","It is preferred that the load balancers maintain persistent load balanced connections with their redundant servers at the TCP\/IP level. Through port monitoring wherein the load balancer checks the \u201cheartbeat\u201d of its connection to each redundant server, the load balancer will be able to detect whenever a server is unavailable. When the load balancer tests its TCP\/IP port connection with each server to which it is connected, if no response is heard from the server to a \u201cping\u201d after a predetermined amount of time has passed (preferably around 3 seconds), the load balancer will remove that server's address from its list of available servers. Thus, the load balancer can prevent incoming activity requests from being distributed to an unavailable server.","The processing flow for handling various activity requests will now be described.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"]},"In , at step , the user initiates a request for some type of customer account data (e.g., one or more of the customer's positions, balance, recent trades, etc.). At step , a WBOClient object  is communicated to the intermediate layer  where it is load balanced (step ) and passed to an available WBO server .","The WBO server  then checks its cache for \u201cfresh\u201d customer account data pertinent to the activity request (step ), which will be explained in greater detail below. If pertinent cached data is found at step , then at step , the WBO server determines whether that cached data is to be used. This determination is made according to one or more usage rules, as will be explained in greater detail below. If either step  or step  results in a negative determination, the WBO server will query the backoffice accounting database system  for the pertinent customer account data. It is preferred that the WBO server also query the orders database  and customers database  for any pertinent customer account information that would not be found in the backoffice accounting database system . At step , the WBO server gets the pertinent customer account data from either its cache or the backoffice and customers\/orders databases as may be appropriate.","Thereafter, at step , WBO server calls performs any calculations that need to be performed on the customer account data to satisfy the customer account activity request, such as a calculation of unsettled balances or the number of day trades for that day. These calculations preferably provide the functionality of the WBOCalculations object.","Upon the completion of step , customer account data that is responsive to the customer account activity request is passed back to the WBOClient  through the load balancing step for subsequent display to the user at step . The load balancer preferably keeps an internal flow table to keep track of data that needs to be routed to a specific server rather than an available server.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"]},"In , at step , the user initiates a request for a quote (e.g., a request to see the price at which IBM stock is trading). At step , a QuoteClient object  is communicated to the intermediate layer  where it is load balanced (step ) and passed to an available quote server .","The quote server  then operates, at step , to obtain the requested quote data either from its cache or from a quote vendor , as will be explained in greater detail below. Once the quote server  obtains the requested quote data, this quote data is passed back to the QuoteClient object  through the load balancing step for subsequent display to the customer (step ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":"1100"},"Thereafter, at the front end, the OrderRules object is called to validate the order activity request against restrictions stored in the trading administration database , as will be explained below (step ). Then, if the order is valid (step ), an OrderClient object is communicated to the intermediate layer (step ). If the order is not valid, the remote front end user is notified and the process will await a new order activity request.","The OrderClient object arriving at the intermediate layer is load balanced at step . After load balancing, it arrives at an available order server, which in turn calls QuoteClient (step ) and calls WBOClient (step ). QuoteClient is called to obtain appropriate pricing information from an available quote server about the financial instrument involved in the order activity request. The QuoteClient request issued by the order server will pass through load balancing at step  to arrive at an available quote server at step  where the pertinent quote data will be obtained and returned to the order server (once again through a load balancing step). WBOClient is called to obtain customer account data from an available WBO server that is pertinent to the order activity request. The WBOClient activity request issued by the order server will pass through load balancing at step  to arrive at an available WBO server at step  where the appropriate customer account data will be obtained from either, all, or some combination of the backoffice accounting database system, the customers database, the orders database, and the WBO server's own cached data. Thereafter, the customer account data is passed back to the order server (after a return trip through a load balancing step).","At step , the order server implements business logic to determine whether the received order activity request should be accepted. Acceptance is generally conditional on the quote data and customer account data revealing whether sufficient buying power exists in the customer's account for the order. This standard business logic is known in the art and will not be elaborated on herein.","It is preferred that the order server at this step also include unique business logic wherein some order activity requests will be passed to an approval desk for human intervention by a broker through an approval desk interface that will be described below. If approved from the approval desk interface, the order activity request will proceed like other orders from step . Preferred conditions for invoking the approval desk include forwarding an order activity request to the approval desk: (1) if the SecurityMaster for the symbol is not set up correctly or is missing routing codes, (2) if a market order is being cancelled, (3) if an options order includes over 200 contracts, (4) if an equity order includes over 50,000 shares, with the share price being at least $1, (5) if an equity order includes over 200,000 shares, with the share price being under $1, (6) if selling an option call to open, (7) if selling short while the market is closed, and (8) if it is near the market's closing time and the order might not reach the exchange floor in sufficient time prior to closing. As should be understood, these conditions may be altered by a practitioner of the invention to meet one's specific business needs.","If step  finds the order to be unacceptable, then, at step , the ODBC object is preferably called to write the order attempt into the orders database, thereby creating audit trail information.","If step  finds the order to be acceptable, then at step , the ODBC object is preferably called as at step . Thereafter, at step , FixOrderServer is called by the order server to format the order activity request as a FIX packet to be sent to the order management system. At step , the order management system forwards the FIX packet created from the order activity request to the appropriate financial market, such as the Nasdaq or NYSE. After acknowledgement of the order transmission is received, the order server calls the NotificationSwitchClient object to create and send multicast packets to inform interested applications of the order transmission. Preferably, this multicast is sent to the WBO servers so that that its cache can be updated and to any front end applications that support real time updates on trades such as the Java trading application and the Windows trading application.","When the market informs the order management system of the order's execution, the NotificationSwitchClient object is preferably called once again by the order server to multicast notice of the execution to interested applications. Preferably, this multicast is sent to the WBO servers so that that its cache can be updated and to any front end applications that support real time updates on trades such as the Java trading application and the Windows trading application.","It is also worth noting that the automated brokerage system of the preferred embodiment supports entry of orders through the backoffice, wherein a broker directly enters an order in the backoffice accounting database system. Such orders are preferably communicated directly from the backoffice accounting database  to the order management system at step , as shown in .","I. Front End Layer:","With reference to , the system's front end layer  preferably supports a plurality of heterogeneous applications that generate activity requests in response to user input. These heterogeneous front end applications can be thought of as delivery channels from which activity requests are delivered to the intermediate layer . From the perspective of the intermediate layer , the heterogeneous nature of the various customer interfaces is immaterial due to the commonality of the COM interface .","Examples of heterogeneous customer applications supported by the preferred system  include website applications provided by web servers , touchtone telephone applications provided through IVR touchtone servers , wireless device applications from cell phones, pagers, PDAs, and the like through wireless (WAP) servers , desktop computer application access through Windows trading application servers  and Java trading application servers . A Dell 1550, dual 1133 MHz server with 1 GB of RAM and mirrored 18 GB drives is the preferred hardware for the front end servers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":["FIGS. 8(","FIG. 8(","FIG. 8(","FIG. 8(","FIG. 8(","FIG. 8(","FIG. 8(","FIG. 8("],"i":["a","g","a","b","c","d","e","f","g"],"b":["8","158"]},"A customer interface application for the IVR touchtone servers  would occur through a touchtone telephone from which a customer can initiate activity requests and interact with the server system via automated systems known in the art.

Intermediate Layer:","A. Order Service","The order service preferably accepts, transmits and validates activity requests that are orders to buy\/sell financial instruments. The order servers  receive orders from the various front end delivery channels (e.g., through the web servers ), request information from the WBO service to use in validating the order(s) (to obtain data such as the customer's money balances, any restrictions on the customer's account, etc.), request information from the quotes service (to use in pricing and validating orders), and from the SQL database server  (to determine if the particular financial instrument that is the subject of the order activity request is eligible to trade), if the delivery channel is enabled for trading, and so on.  illustrates this process. Preferred hardware for the order server is a Dell 1550, dual 1133 MHz server with 1 GB of RAM and mirrored 18 GB drives operating with Windows 2000 server.","If an order is rejected, the orders service operates to store that order in the orders database  along with the reason for the rejection, audit trail information, and so on. If the order is accepted, the orders service also stores the order and audit trail information in the Orders database . Further, the orders service then passes the order on to the Order Management System (OMS)  for further processing (see below). As noted above, multiple order servers  preferably exist behind a TCP\/IP load balancer  to allow for the delivery channel application to fail over seamlessly if any particular order server should fail.","(i) OrderClient","OrderServer, which is a dedicated application, preferably a Windows C++ application, and OrderClient use a size-delimitated protocol where each X bytes contain a specific piece of data. This format is required by OrderServer.","As noted above, OrderClient  is a COM object that is preferably created in the language C++, but can be created under any language that supports COM. The use of a COM object allows for use of the same object on many different trading platforms while using a common code set for handling orders.","OrderClient  takes generic order information (account number, buy\/sell stock, shares, limit price, qualifiers, etc) and creates a packet. OrderClient then sends this packet over a TCP\/IP socket to an order server . The OrderServer program resident on the order server  then formats the packet using a protocol as explained below. It is preferred that OrderClient and OrderServer communicate with each other over a TCP\/IP socket. OrderServer preferably listens on port 5665 of the order server  for connections.","OrderServer preferably (1) accepts socket connections from OrderClient, (2) parses the received packets into data structures that represent generic orders, (3) processes the order, (4) sends a response back over the same socket to the OrderClient that sent the packets, and (5) then disconnects from the socket.","OrderServer preferably processes the order by validating the order against the business rules specific to the client's account. To do this, OrderServer needs customer account data, and to obtain such data, WBOClient  is also resident on OrderServer. Using WBOClient  (which will be explained below), OrderServer is able to obtain the customer account data needed to validate the order activity request in accordance with business rules. OrderServer also preferably stores the order in the orders database . Further still, OrderServer sends the order to the order switch  over a socket, using FixOrderServer.\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0100"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"182pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["#define

WBO Service","The Web to Back Office (WBO) service supplies all of the accounting information for a customer's account(s) to interested applications in the system . This customer account data preferably includes monies held in the account, what stocks are owned in the account, trade executions in the account, open orders (buy, sell, etc) for the account, and ancillary information such as name, address, and so on.

For example, if a brokerage firm is converting from one back office system to another, and must account for trade data information on one system and settlement data information on the other (typically three days later), the WBO service can allow for aggregation of data from the two different backend database systems. As will be explained in greater detail below, as part of this aggregation, a \u201cThree Day System\u201d was developed to facilitate such changes in backoffice database accounting systems, thereby allowing the other services of the system to continue seamlessly during a backoffice accounting database transition.","WBO service primarily acquires customer account data from the backoffice accounting database system , which is preferably an AS\/400 CRI brokerage accounting system, but can also acquire data from the SQL database schema  (such as the customers database  or orders database ), or other data stores. The WBO service of the preferred embodiment of the present invention eliminates the need for the front end applications to have to know where customer account data resides or in which format it is stored. With WBO Service, multiple WBO servers  preferably exist behind a TCP\/IP load balancer  to allow for the front end applications to fail over seamlessly if any particular WBO server  should fail. Preferred hardware for the WBO server is a Dell 1550, dual 1133 MHz server with 1 GB of RAM and mirrored 18 GB drives operating with Microsoft Windows 2000 server.","The WBOClient.dll is a COM object that communicates with the WBOServer application to get account data from the backoffice accounting database system  using a TCP\/IP socket. WBOClient preferably resides on both the order servers  and the front end applications. The WBOClient.dll object is preferably created in the C++ language, but can be created under any language that supports COM.","The packets produced and processed by the WBO service are preferably formatted in accordance with the protocol described below. However, it should be noted that any protocol suitable for formatting messages transmitted between applications is suitable for use with the present invention. This protocol is preferably a size-delimitated protocol where each X bytes contain a specific piece of data.","In operation, the WBO server listens to a port for connections from a WBOClient object. When initiated, WBOClient retrieves customer account data from the WBOServer application for such things that include, but are not limited to account balances, executions, open orders, positions and account settings.","The WBOServer program receives the customer account activity request from WBOClient as a packet, and creates a generic request structure out of the data contained therein.","Preferably when processing a customer account activity request, WBOServer searches its resident memory, preferably its application-in-memory cache, for any cached data. As will be described in greater detail below, customer account data found in cached memory that is pertinent to a customer account activity request will be used by WBOServer to process the customer account activity request if that cache data complies with predetermined usage rules. Preferably, these usage rules are reconfigurable. In either event, if cached data is found and the data is valid according to the cache usage rules, then WBOServer sends that cached data back to WBOClient.","If no cached data can be found or if the cache data does not comply with the cache usage rules, WBOServer queries the backoffice accounting database system  for the data. Upon retrieving the appropriate data from the backoffice accounting database system , the WBOServer preferably merges this data with data found in the SQL databases, e.g. account settings, open orders, specific calculations, etc.","WBOServer thereafter preferably performs other calculations based on this data to determine more specific account values, and then updates its cache record. Lastly, WBOServer preferably returns the retrieved customer account data to the client application via the same socket.","During the above operation, WBOServer is also listening for multicasts from the order servers  to know when a client places a trade or receives an execution, etc. When an account event occurs in a customer account, WBOServer preferably marks any cached data pertaining to that customer account as invalid, thereby forcing any activity request for information on that account to perform a query of fresh data from the backoffice accounting database system . Preferred instances of account events will be described below.","WBOCalculations is a COM object resident on the front end COM interface that takes account data as parameters and performs calculations to determine specific values for an account such as buying power, total account value, and market value for account positions. Parameters received are data structures representing account data such as money balances, open orders, current positions and current day executions. The logic for these calculations are known in the art. As a COM object, WBOCalculations can be used by any trading platform that supports COM, thereby facilitating the scalability, which allows the system to maintain prompt response times despite growing traffic volumes. The WBOCalculations methods preferably come in two versions, one that takes the \u201cStream\u201d data in byte stream format (e.g. UnsettledReleases) and then another variation that takes the array format returned by WBOClient (e.g. UnsettledReleasesArr) where each BSTR input parameter can be replaced with a VARIANT*.

By maintaining customer account data in its application-in-memory cache, the WBO server will reduce the number of times it will need to issue data requests to the backoffice accounting database system, thereby reducing traffic at a potential bottleneck and also increasing response time for handling customer account activity requests.","In order to be considered \u201cfresh\u201d, the cached account data preferably complies with a plurality of cache usage rules. These rules, which are preferably directed toward ensuring that the customer account data returned by the WBO server is an accurate current time reflection of the customer's account, can be programmed into the logic of the WBO server. Examples of preferred rules that define the conditions under which cached data can or cannot be used include: (1) for cached data to be used, data for the requested customer account must exist in the cache, (2) for cached data to be used, the cached data must not have been requested more than a predetermined number of times (preferably 30 times), (3) for cached data to be used, the cached data must not have been stored in the cache for longer than a predetermined duration of time (preferably 5 minutes), and (4) for cached data to be used, account events must not have occurred in the pertinent customer account since the time that the customer account data was cached.","Preferably, the WBO servers  listen for account events which can be communicated thereto via multicasts from other servers. The WBO servers can perform this listening task by joining subscription lists on a specific multicast IP address and port on the server. An account event is any event that alters a customer's account. Examples of preferred account events include: (1) the placing of an order for the pertinent customer account, (2) the placing of a modify order for a pertinent customer account, (3) the placing of a cancel order for a pertinent customer account, (4) the execution of an order for a pertinent customer account, (5) approval of an order from the approval desk for a pertinent customer account, (6) rejection of an order from the approval desk for a pertinent customer account, (7) an exchange  updating an order for a pertinent customer account (preferably coming in through a FixOrderServer multicast), (8) an exchange  canceling an order for a pertinent customer account, and (9) the deletion of a pending order for the pertinent customer account.","Applications preferably create these account events using the NotificationSwitchClient COM object described above. Each application which may create an account event preferably provides methods such as PostOrder, PostExecution, PostModify, and PostCancel that takes customer account data as parameters and sends a multicast packet to the IP port on which the WBO servers are listening.","In the event that cached data is not found or cannot be used because of the cache usage rules, the WBO server queries the backoffice accounting database system for the customer account data. Thereafter, the WBO server queries the orders database  and customers database  for data such as pending orders and specific calculations for the account, which are not available from the backoffice accounting database system.","Once it has obtained the requisite customer account data from the backoffice and the orders database, the WBO server merges the data into one common dataset and updates its cache with the new data. At this time, the \u201cfresh\u201d data timer and \u201cfresh\u201d data request counter are reset.","C. Database Schema","The database schema  for the preferred embodiment of the present invention preferably is a SQL database schema that uses a Microsoft SQL Server 2000 to store a variety of information not included in the order, WBO, or quote services but still needed to support the various front end applications and the other three services.","As part of the service, the \u201ccustomers\u201d database  contains customer account specific information that is not stored on the backoffice accounting database system , such as email address, trading password, web site preferences, access information such as web-site authentication credential, buying power for day-traders, exchange agreement signatures, popup messages to be display during authentication, address change history, notes, etc. )-() illustrate a preferred table arrangement for the customers database .","Internet customers are preferably added to the customers database  when a branch manager opens a new account for such customers. Non-internet customers are added to the customers database  through a nightly process in which the data is extracted from the back office system  and loaded into the customers database . An Internet customer is a customer who conducts some specified percentage of transactions on his account through the Internet. A preferred threshold for Internet customers is one who conducts 90% of his account transactions through the Internet.","The \u201corders\u201d database  contains orders entered via the various front end applications, including orders that may have been rejected by the system  for various reasons. The orders database  also contains audit trail information on each order such as the front end application from which it was entered and the computer address from which the order originated. Further, the orders are preferably logged by account, symbol, when the order was placed, where the order was placed from (internet, IVR, streaming product, international trading site, etc), limit\/market, time in force for limit orders, and quantity. When orders are executed by the system, a corresponding entry is added to an execution table, with details of the execution such as account number, total shares for this execution, total shares remaining for this transaction, price of execution. )-() illustrate a preferred table arrangement for the orders database .","Every time an order is modified internally or by the customer, an audit record is maintained.","Due to the large amount of data kept for orders, a copy of all data in the orders database is preferably placed on a report server nightly. This allows internal users to query the database without affecting the customer experience.","The \u201ctrading admin\u201d database  stores non-customer specific information required to run the various services, including information on the availability for trading of various financial instruments, which of the front end applications are available and the status of each service, and other administration and control data. The trading admin database  is also preferably used to generate a web tracking number for orders received over the Internet. As previously noted, )-() illustrate various administrator interfaces for controlling the trading admin database . )-() illustrate a preferred table arrangement for the trading admin database .","It is preferred that these SQL databases exist in the system in a clustered node configuration, as shown in , to allow for redundancy and fail over.","Whereas most databases are designed as one large database, thereby requiring additional hardware be added to the same physical box in an effort to keep up with growth requirements, the preferred embodiment of the present invention segments the logically grouped elements of customers, orders, and trading administration into distinct databases. Interaction with each of these databases is preferred in order to complete a transaction. This partitioning of data into separate databases prevents overtaxing of the system, which would be a distinct risk under normal database design convention in which all of these divisions would have been designed to operate as a single database. Because the data is already in separate databases the system  is always ready for scaling.","Further, by segregating each of the individual components to isolated databases, a system administrator is able to place these unique databases on a separate physical database servers  if conditions are such that utilization is high. If conditions are such that database utilization is low, the system administrator can instead use a single database server  to host multiple databases.","D. Quote Service","The quote service preferably utilizes QuoteDB, which is a dynamically linked library, to handle communication between client applications and QuoteServer, which is an application running on the quote server. QuoteDB creates packets to retrieve stock data from QuoteServer, parses the response from QuoteServer, and creates data structures for easy access to the quote data. QuoteClient is preferably a COM wrapper for QuoteDB, thereby rendering the quote data accessible through any language that supports COM.","The quote service preferably supplies real-time and static pricing and descriptive information on financial instruments. The descriptive information preferably includes: last sale, bid, ask, volume, and CUSIP, for these instruments. Quote data is typically delivered for display to a customer, but is also used to value the positions that the customer owns (stocks, bond, options), and as part of the order acceptance process.\n\n","The raw quote data is primarily acquired from market data vendors as is known in the art, but can also be acquired from SQL databases or other data stores. The QuoteClient\/QuoteServer combination eliminates the need for the front end applications to know where quote data resides or know the format in which the data is stored.","Also, through the use of the quote data aggregation technique of the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the quote service can also fail over between raw quote data sources should a real-time vendor cease to update, consistently providing the requested data. According to this aspect of the preferred embodiment, QuoteServer merges various quote feeds as one generic quote source. QuoteServer achieves this by creating connections to quote vendors and abstracting their data into a common data format used internally by the system . Thus, when the quote service switches to a new quote vendor , the quote server will be able to appropriately process the raw quote data despite the fact the raw quote data from the new vendor may not match the raw quote data from the old vendor. For example. Different vendors may use different data formatting to describe the same financial instrument. For example, Berkshire Hathaway Class A stock on the NYSE uses the symbol \u201cBRK A\u201d. On one vendor, this symbol may be formatted as \u201cBRK.A\u201d while on another vendor, that same symbol may be formatted as \u201cBRK-A\u201d. With this aspect of the preferred embodiment, the quote server abstracts this symbol data to a common data format, thereby rendering a switch from one quote vendor  to another seamless and transparent to other services in the system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0296","num":"0892"},"figref":["FIGS. 19(","FIG. 19("],"i":["a","f","a"],"b":"150"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0297","num":"0893"},"figref":["FIG. 19(","FIG. 19(","FIG. 19(","FIG. 19(","FIG. 19("],"i":["b","c","d","e","f"]},"Also, it is preferable that the quote service cache the quote data that it receives from vendors to reduce its need to interact with the quote vendors. Reduced quote vendor interaction preferably translates to prompter response times to quote activity requests. Accordingly, the quote server preferably maintains quote data obtained from a quote vendor in its resident memory, preferably its application-in-memory cache. For quote data maintained in cache to be used when processing a quote activity request, it is preferred that such usage proceed in accordance with usage rules in a similar manner described in connection with caching for the WBO service. However, with quote data, it is preferred that a different set of usage rules be used. With quote data, the most important usage rule is preferably time. After a predetermined duration of time, preferably sixty minutes if the quote service is configured to receive uninterrupted and continuous updates on cached quote data from the quote vendor, the cached quote data is deemed outdated and fresh quote data from the quote vendor will be sought. As should be understood, different lengths of time can be used for this time length. If no updates are being received by the quote server for the cached quote data or if there is an interruption in those updates, it can be expected that this freshness time duration will be considerably shorter.","Further, it is worth noting that the QuoteClient object may also be configured to retain quote data it receives for a predetermined duration of time, preferably around 1 second.","When receiving a response from the quote vendor, the quote server  preferably updates its own cache record for future requests. QuoteServer also receives quote\/trade updates from the quote vendor to update it's own cache based on the latest quote\/trade. It is preferred that QuoteServer be capable of merging general quote data (last price, bid, ask, volume, etc), date stored in other data stores such as SQL, company fundamental data, stock price history, available options, top market movers, real-time streaming time and sales and level 2 quote data into one generic quote source.","The QuoteClient COM object preferably functions take a symbol as the only parameter and return a VARIANT cast as a BSTR. Decimal values are returned to three decimal places unless otherwise noted. Values are returned as strings and, unless otherwise noted, functions return \u201cN\/A\u201d when data is not available.","The preferred functions for QuoteClient are as follows:","AnnualHigh","Returns a 52 week high price in fractional format, unless quoted in decimals by exchange.","AnnualLow","Returns a 52 week low price in fractional format, unless quoted in decimals by exchange.","Ask","Returns the \u2018ask\u2019 as decimal.","AskF","Returns the ask price in fractional format, unless quoted in decimals by exchange.","AskSize","Returns the ask size as an integer.","Bid","Returns the bid as a decimal.","BidF","Returns the bid price in fractional format, unless quoted in decimal by exchange.","Bid Size","Returns the bid size as an integer.","BidTick","Returns \u201c+\u201d for upticks and \u201c\u2212\u201d for downticks.","Change","Returns net change for the day in decimal format (three decimal place precision).

This routing depends on a number of parameters such as: NASDAQ or NYSE stock, size of the order, destination of the original order if this order is a change or cancellation of an earlier order, status of the execution point, etc. As noted above, the OMS  performs these tasks using known techniques.","The OMS  sends this order to the appropriate market  using a financial industry standard protocol known as \u201cFIX\u201d, which is an order message format enclosed in TCP\/IP communications protocol for transmission via data lines to the market centers.","If the financial markets are not open, the order is queued by the OMS  in a local data store where it awaits transmission to the financial markets once those markets are open to accept orders.","The OMS  also receives notifications of order execution, cancellation and reject messages from the market centers in response to orders sent thereto. These messages are passed to both the backoffice accounting database  and the Orders service. The backoffice accounting database  uses this information to update the customer's accounts. The Orders service provides this information to interested applications (such as the front end client application that initiated the order) via the NotificationSwitch multicast.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0461","num":"1058"},"figref":"FIG. 17","b":["150","156","168","168","154","172","172","150","170"],"i":["a ","b ","a ","b "]},"In the past, changes in a backoffice accounting database system , while keeping the trading system online, have created major difficulties because of the traditional 3 day delay between an order's trade data and settlement date, and because of option trades. That is, during the first three days of a migration from an old database system to a new database system , the new database system would not have an accurate picture of the customer's account due to the settlement dates still pending. In previous efforts known to the inventors herein, efforts to migrate from one backoffice system to another have entailed data entry personnel manually keying orders during the first three days of transition into both the old and new system.","However, with the intermediate layer  of system , efficient migration can be achieved using a \u201cthree day system\u201d as described herein. When implementing the \u201cthree day\u201d system, the timeline for operations is based on the settlement period of equity trades. At the current time, the standard settlement period for equity trades is three days. The standard settlement period for option trades is one day. It should be noted that these settlement periods may change in the future. However, the principles of the \u201cthree day\u201d system are equally applicable for database migrations when the settlement periods are longer or shorter so long as corresponding changes are made in the pertinent time intervals which will be discussed below.","Prior to the database migration, the new backoffice system is preferably minimally populated with only customer name and address information. The old backoffice system, as would be expected, is populated with full customer account information.","During a first time interval that commences when the new backoffice system goes live and concludes two days thereafter, data relating to option trades that are transacted by the automated brokerage system during this time interval are stored in the old backoffice system. Further, during this time interval, data relating to equity trades that are transacted by the automated brokerage system during this time interval are stored in the new backoffice system. For activity requests received during this time interval that require customer account data, the WBO servers preferably retrieve customer account data from both the old and new backoffice systems and aggregate this retrieved data to obtain a full and accurate picture of a customer's account. Option trades that arise during this interval are stored in the old backoffice system because their settlements will occur within the three day window. However, because the settlement of new equity trades will fall after the three day window, that data is stored in the new backoffice system that will remain live at the conclusion of the three days.","Upon the conclusion of the first time interval, the second time interval begins. The duration of the second time interval is preferably one day given the three day settlement period for equity trades. During this second time interval, data relating to both option trades and equity trades that have been transacted by the automated brokerage system during the second time interval are stored in the new backoffice system. Further, for activity requests received during this second time interval that require customer account data, the WBO servers preferably continue to retrieve customer account data from both the old and new backoffice systems aggregate this retrieved data to obtain a full and accurate picture of a customer's account.","At the conclusion of the second time interval (which, as noted, is preferably three days after the new backoffice system has gone live), the old backoffice system will no longer have active settlement dates pending for either equities or options. The content of the old backoffice system can then be copied into the new backoffice system.","It is preferred that the three day system commence on a Wednesday such that it will conclude at close of business on a Friday, thereby allowing the copying of the old backoffice system into the new backoffice system to occur during a time period where the markets are not open. Even more preferably, the three day window of the \u201cthree day\u201d system will expire at the close of business Friday prior to a three day weekend or holiday weekend. However, other days of the week may also be chosen as would be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art.","While the present invention has been described above in relation to its preferred embodiment, various modifications may be made thereto that still fall within the invention's scope, as would be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art. Such modifications to the invention will be recognizable upon review of the teachings herein. For example, it should be readily understood that the various services can be geographically remote from each other. Further, the system  can be duplicated at multiple geographic locations, such as shown in ) and () wherein routers and are used to provide a connection to the backoffice from a site remote from the backoffice. As such, the full scope of the present invention is to be defined solely by the appended claims and their legal equivalents."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIGS. 8(","i":["a","g"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIGS. 9(","i":["a","n"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIGS. 12(","i":["a","c"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIGS. 13 and 13(","i":["a","m"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIGS. 14 and 14(","i":["a","e"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIGS. 15 and 15(","i":["a","f"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIGS. 16(","i":["a","c"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIGS. 18(","i":["a","b"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIGS. 19(","i":["a","f"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
