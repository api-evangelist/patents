{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, and licensed by or for the United States Government.","1. Technical Field","The disclosure generally relates to radar systems.","2. Description of the Related Art","Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a system for producing high-quality radar images with wide applications in remote sensing and mapping. SAR is used for such diverse functions as military imagery, oil and mineral surveys, and mapping the surfaces of planets. Modern SAR systems use the Doppler shift generated by the motion of a platform upon which the radar system is mounted, such as an airplane or a satellite, which sweeps the radar antenna over the terrain to be imaged to resolve objects in azimuth.","Ground-based SAR systems use image reconstruction algorithms based on position. These systems typically require that the antenna be displaced in relation to the object that is being imaged in order to produce enough sampling locations to reconstruct an image. Such ground-based SAR systems tend to exhibit various disadvantages, such as only being able to operate by moving the antenna in a wide sweep over a relatively immobile target.","Systems and methods for producing radar images are provided. In this regard, an exemplary embodiment of a system comprises: a transmitter operative to transmit a pulsed signal; a receiver operative to sample the pulsed signal after reflection; a Doppler-shifting mechanism operative to create a Doppler shift in the pulsed signal; and a platform upon which the transmitter and the Doppler-shifting mechanism are mounted, the Doppler shift being associated with relative motion between the Doppler-shifting mechanism and the platform.","An exemplary embodiment of a method comprises: transmitting a Doppler-shifted pulse; receiving the Doppler-shifted pulse as a reflection from a target; analyzing the pulse received to generate a plurality of samples; and correlating frequency responses of the plurality of samples with points on the target.","Another exemplary embodiment of a method comprises: transmitting a Doppler-shifted pulse; receiving the Doppler-shifted pulse as a terrain reflection; analyzing the pulse received to generate a plurality of samples; correlating the samples with range bins based on times received; determining the frequency spectrum of for samples within the range bins; and correlating the frequency spectra and the range bins with points on the terrain to produce an image of the terrain.","Other systems, methods, features and\/or advantages of this disclosure will be or may become apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following drawings and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems, methods, features and\/or advantages be included within this description and be within the scope of the present disclosure. For functionality, the mechanism for inducing the Doppler shift can be located on either the transmitting antenna, the receiving antenna, or both as would be the case if the antenna was used for transmission and reception.","Systems and methods for producing radar images are provided, several exemplary embodiments of which will be described in detail. In this regard, such systems and methods involve the use of Doppler-shifting mechanisms. In some embodiments, a high degree of resolution may be achieved as relative motion to produce a Doppler shift does not rely on motion of the transmitter and\/or receiver in a macro sense with respect to the target. That is, in such an embodiment, relative motion to produce a Doppler shift for enabling imaging can be isolated to the transmitter and\/or receiver.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","101","102","103","104","105"]},"In operation, such as for the purpose of imaging a target , a pulsed signal is transmitted from the transmitter with a Doppler shift being imparted to the pulsed signal by the Doppler-shifting mechanism. In this embodiment, the Doppler shift is created by relative motion between the Doppler-shifting mechanism and the platform. Thus, the pulsed signal contains velocity information in the form of the Doppler shift. Notably, in some embodiments, the platform may also exhibit relative motion with respect to the target, such as those instances in which the platform is carried by a vehicle.","The pulsed signal reflects back from the target and is sampled at the receiver. Notably, multiple samples corresponding to the reflected pulsed signal can be acquired, with multiple ones of the samples containing different range information pertaining to the target. This is particularly the case when the antenna beam is broad and the pulse is capable of illuminating the entire target that is being imaged. These samples are then passed to the imaging unit for further processing as will be described later.","It should be noted that the embodiment of  uses a separate transmitter and a separate receiver, in contrast to a transceiver, which can be used in other embodiments. The use of a separate transmitter and a separate receiver may be considered advantageous in some implementations.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A-2D","FIG. 2A"],"b":["210","218","216","214","214"]},"In , embodiments that incorporate rotating reflectors are depicted. Notably, rotating reflectors reflect signals in the inertial reference frame of the portion of the reflecting surface that is illuminated by the transmitter. In this regard, a rotating reflector  of  rotates about an axis . A transmitter\/receiver horn antenna  transmits a beam towards a concave reflecting surface , thereby illuminating a location . The concave reflecting surface  shapes the beam in the direction perpendicular to the tangential radial velocity of rotating reflector  upon reflection.","In contrast, the partially illuminated dish antenna  of  rotates about an axis  to produce a Doppler shift. Specifically, a transceiver horn antenna  transmits a beam onto a concave reflecting surface , thereby illuminating a location . Location  reflects and shapes the beam in a direction perpendicular to the tangential radial velocity of dish antenna .","The transmitter motion that is perpendicular to the direction of propagation determines the amount of Doppler shift and, by extension, the resolution of the radar. For the foregoing embodiments, illustrated in , B, and C, that include a rotating structure, the motion that is normal to the direction of propagation is the tangential motion of the rotating structure and is a product of the angular velocity and the radius of the structure.","In , an embodiment of a mechanism  incorporating a vibrating structure  is depicted. Transmitter antenna  is mounted on the vibrating structure. The emitted pulses may be timed to coincide with peaks in the vibration of the structure. The receiver may be mounted on a separated, non-vibrating structure in order to continually sample the returns. This embodiment could potentially greatly reduce the size of the system, as a velocity component that is dependent on the size of the structure is not utilized.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","300","301","301","302","303","304","309","303","309","310","304","304","310"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"]},"As shown in , samples corresponding to a reflected pulsed signal are associated with range bins, which are sorted based on the time received, in block . Each range bin corresponds to a different respective distance from the receiver. The frequency spectrum of responses in each range bin is determined in block . By arranging these frequency responses in a radial map in block , an image of the target is produced. The range bin gives the radial coordinate of the sample, and the frequency response gives the azimuthal coordinate. This radial map can then be converted into a grid map by interpolation if this is desired by the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["506","500","506","502","506","504","510","502","502"],"i":["b ","a "]},"There are various computational algorithms that can determine the frequency response of reflected pulsed signals. By way of example, a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) can be used. In this regard, an analog signal frequency spectrum and the corresponding DFT are shown in  and , respectively. The frequency of the transmitted pulse along the zero line is the frequency of the transmitted pulse, and the Doppler shifting mechanism applies no change in frequency along the zero line. Of note is the fact that the resolution is a function of the dwell time, which could be arbitrary in some embodiments. Other algorithms may also be used.","Operation and resolution are explained in greater detail below, with reference to various mathematical equations and examples corresponding to a representative system. System operation begins when a pulse that has been Doppler shifted by some mechanism, for example one of the rotating mechanisms illustrated in  or a vibrating mechanism similar to the mechanism illustrated in , is transmitted from an antenna. The pulse now has a velocity component in the inertial reference frame of the surface of the Doppler shifting mechanism, perpendicular to the direction of radar propagation. The pulse propagates to the target. The pulse reflects from the terrain being imaged. The pulse propagates to the receiver. The pulse is sampled at the receiver and passed into range bins based on the time received. Range bins with the same range are correlated between pulses to determine the frequency response of the range bin. There is a change in frequency of the reflected signal due to a Doppler shift, which is given in equation (1).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":["\u0394","f"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mi":["v","\u03bb"]}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}},"br":[{},{},{}],"figref":"FIG. 7","i":"b.

The radar may be mounted on a platform that is either portable or stationary, allowing for great flexibility of use. In contrast to scanning radar with high directivity, which use complex phase shifters and multi-emitting elements, some embodiments may use a broad beam with a single transmitter and receiver, making it simpler and less expensive. Since accuracy for Doppler systems is a function of frequency resolution, and frequency resolution is a function of sampling time, some embodiments could in theory provide arbitrarily fine azimuth resolution; this will probably end up being only limited by noise. Multi-axis image generation may be possible because the Doppler shift is being created as opposed to being a by-product of the platform's motion. Certain embodiments may function without light, or to see through smoke, fog, light vegetation, or some walls. Suggested applications may include, but are not limited to, machine vision, target acquisition, targeting, persistent surveillance, mine detection, reconnaissance, and support for urban operations. Other suggested applications may include, but are not limited to, support to fire fighters, machine vision, security systems, as well as locating survivors in collapsed structures.
