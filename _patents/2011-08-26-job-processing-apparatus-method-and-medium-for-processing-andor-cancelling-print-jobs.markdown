Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a job processing apparatus and a computer-readable storage medium.","2. Description of the Related Art","In the related art, a job processing apparatus stores jobs entered by users in a memory thereof and sequentially executes the stored jobs. When canceling a job entered in such a job processing apparatus, the users perform an operation, such as one described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 11-003004, with an operation unit of the job processing apparatus. In this way, the users cancel the job.","More specifically, the following procedure is performed. The users cause the job processing apparatus to display a list of the jobs held therein on a display unit. The users then select a desired job from the displayed job list and instruct the job processing apparatus to cancel the selected job.","However, in the method according to the related art, a job, the cancellation of which has been instructed, is canceled with a simple operation without reference to a type of the job.","Accordingly, even a type of job that may cause inconveniences if it were mistakenly canceled is unfortunately canceled with a simple operation. For example, regarding a facsimile (fax) reception job, users who have instructed cancellation do not have an original document. When the users mistakenly cancel the fax reception job, the users who have instructed the cancellation have to request a sender having the original document to retransmit the image data. This labor becomes a burden on the users who have instructed the cancellation.","For the reasons given above it may be undesirable to cancel all types of jobs with a simple operation.","In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, a job processing apparatus is provided that includes a holding unit configured to hold a job subjected to execution; a receiving unit configured to receive a cancellation instruction for canceling execution of the job held in the holding unit; and a control unit configured to perform control in response to reception of the cancellation instruction by the receiving unit so that when the job held in the holding unit is of a specific type, the job is not canceled and when the job held in the holding unit is of a type other than the specific type, the job is canceled.","Further features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of exemplary embodiments with reference to the attached drawings.","Exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings.","First Embodiment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"The job processing system according to the first exemplary embodiment of the present invention includes a personal computer (PC)  and an image forming apparatus  serving as an example of a job processing apparatus. The PC  and the image forming apparatus  are connected to each other via a local area network (LAN) .","The image forming apparatus , such as a color multifunctional peripheral (MFP), includes a control unit , a reader unit , a printer unit , and an operation unit .","The reader unit  includes a scanner unit  and a document feeder (DF) unit .","The scanner unit  optically scans an image on an original document and converts the scanned image into image data. The DF unit  conveys a set original document to a position where the original document can be scanned by the scanner unit .","The scanner unit  scans an image on the original document conveyed by the DF unit  and converts the scanned image into image data. The scanner unit  also includes an original plate, not illustrated, and can also scan an original document set at the original plate.","The printer unit  includes a paper feeder unit , a marking unit , and a paper discharger unit .","The paper feeder unit  stores sheets for use in printing and conveys each sheet to the marking unit . The marking unit  performs printing on the basis of image data. More specifically, the marking unit  performs printing by transferring and then fixing toners onto the sheets. Meanwhile, the printing method is not limited to this one and a printing method using ink may be used. The paper discharger unit  executes post-processing, such as sorting and stapling, on the printed sheets as needed and then discharges the printed sheets.","The operation unit  includes a display unit, such as a liquid crystal display (LCD) , and hardware keys. The operation unit  displays setting screens and a status of the image forming apparatus  on the display unit. The operation unit  also receives various instructions from users with the hardware keys and sends the received instructions to the control unit . Additionally, the operation unit  may include a touch panel that is integrated into the LCD . When the operation unit  includes the touch panel, the operation unit  sends instructions received through the touch panel to the control unit .","The control unit  is connected to the reader unit , the printer unit , and the operation unit  and controls the reader unit , the printer unit , and the operation unit  in an integrated manner. The control unit  is also connected to the PC  via the LAN  and exchanges data with the PC . In accordance with instructions received from users through the operation unit  or the PC , the control unit  executes various jobs.","For example, the control unit  executes a copy job. More specifically, upon receiving a copy setting and a copy execution start instruction from a user through the operation unit , the control unit  causes the reader unit  to scan an original document. The control unit  then receives and stores image data of the original document scanned by the reader unit  and performs given image processing in accordance with the copy setting. The control unit  then transfers the image data to the printer unit  and causes the printer unit  to print an image of the image data. When execution of post-processing, such as stapling, is set in the copy setting, the control unit  causes the printer unit  to execute the post-processing.","In addition to the copy job, the control unit  executes a print job. More specifically, the control unit  receives image data and a print setting from the PC  and causes the printer unit  to print an image of the received image data in accordance with the received print setting.","Further, the control unit  executes a facsimile (fax) reception job. More specifically, the control unit  causes the printer unit  to print an image in accordance with image data received through a fax transmission\/reception unit , which will be described later.","Additionally, the control unit  executes a box print job. More specifically, the control unit  stores image data in a storage unit, such as a memory unit  to be described later, and causes the printer unit  to execute printing in accordance with image data selected by users from the pieces of stored image data.","Further, the control unit  executes a data transmission job. More specifically, the control unit  stores image data of an original document scanned by the reader unit  in the storage unit and then transmits the stored image data to the PC .","The control unit  also executes an automatic report job. The control unit  manages an execution history of jobs executed in the image forming apparatus  in the storage unit, such as the memory unit  to be described later. The control unit  causes the printer unit  to print the execution history stored in the memory unit  whenever a given number of sheets are printed by the printer unit  or whenever given time is measured by a timer, not illustrated.","Although the description is given in the first exemplary embodiment for the case where the image forming apparatus  is an MFP, the image forming apparatus  may be a single functional peripheral (SFP) having a single function. Additionally, the description is given in the first exemplary embodiment for the case where the image forming apparatus  is a color device, the image forming apparatus  may be a monochrome device.","A configuration of such a control unit  will now be described with reference to .","A central processing unit (CPU)  reads out and executes programs from a read-only memory (ROM)  to perform various control operations.","The ROM  stores programs read out by the CPU .","A random access memory (RAM)  functions as a work area of the CPU .","An operation-unit interface (I\/F) unit  controls transmission and reception of data to and from the operation unit , respectively. For example, the operation-unit I\/F unit  transfers display data sent from the CPU  to the operation unit . The operation-unit I\/F unit  also delivers an instruction received from a user through the operation unit  to the CPU .","A network I\/F unit  controls transmission and reception of data when the CPU  communicates with an external apparatus (e.g., the PC ) via the LAN .","A memory control unit  is connected to a first bus , a second bus , and a third bus . The memory control unit  controls data transfer for writing data in or reading data from the memory unit .","The memory unit  stores image data. The memory unit  also stores, as a job, image data and setting values used in processing the image data. The memory unit  can store a plurality of jobs. The jobs stored in the memory unit  are sequentially executed by the CPU . Accordingly, the memory unit  functions as a holding unit that holds jobs subjected to execution until the jobs are executed.","A scanner I\/F unit  is connected to the reader unit  and controls transmission and reception of data to and from the reader unit , respectively. For example, the scanner I\/F unit  transfers a command from the CPU  to the reader unit  and transfers image data of an original document scanned by the reader unit  to the memory control unit .","A scanner image processing unit  executes image processing on image data, that is received by the scanner I\/F unit  and written in the memory unit , in accordance with a user setting. For example, when monochrome copy is set by a user, the scanner image processing unit  converts color image data scanned by the reader unit  into monochrome image data.","A printer image processing unit  performs image processing to convert image data into data that can be printed by the printer unit .","A printer I\/F unit  is connected to the printer unit  and controls transmission and reception of data to and from the printer unit , respectively. For example, the printer I\/F unit  outputs image data to be printed to the printer unit .","A direct memory access controller (DMAC)  controls data transfer between the memory control unit  and the scanner I\/F unit , the scanner image processing unit , the printer image processing unit , and the printer I\/F unit .","A configuration of the operation unit  will be described with reference to .","The operation unit  includes the LCD , a selection key set , a numeral keypad , a reset key , a stop key (or a cancel key) , and a start key . The keys  to  in the first exemplary embodiment are provided as hardware keys.","The LCD  displays various screens on the basis of instructions from the control unit .","The selection key set  includes an up key, a down key, a left key, a right key, and a set key. Users use the up, down, left, and right keys to move a cursor in a menu screen displayed on the LCD  and press the set key to determine an item selected with the cursor.","The numeral keypad  is for receiving input of numerical values, such as the number of copies to be printed, from users.","The reset key  is for clearing currently set setting values to return the setting back to an initial state.","The start key  is for receiving requests for executing various jobs, such as a copy job, a print job, and a data transmission job, from users by the image forming apparatus .","The stop key  is for receiving an instruction for canceling a job, execution of which has been requested, (a cancellation instruction) from users.","An example of a screen displayed on the LCD  will now be described with reference to .","An initial screen illustrated in  is displayed when the image forming apparatus  is turned on or when the reset key  is pressed.","Users operate the selection key set  to perform copy setting while watching the screen illustrated in . In the example screen illustrated in , the users can set an \u201cenlargement\/reduction ratio\u201d, a \u201cpaper size\u201d, a \u201cdensity\u201d, a \u201cdocument type\u201d, and \u201cboth-side printing\u201d.","The enlargement\/reduction ratio is an item that the users can specify a value between 0% and 200%. The control unit  changes size of image data of an original document scanned by the reader unit  in accordance with the specified enlargement\/reduction ratio before an image is printed on a sheet.","The paper size is an item that the users can specify from A4, A3, B4, B5, and so forth. The control unit  feeds a sheet of the specified paper size from the paper feeder unit  before printing.","Additionally, the users operate various items to set the density, the document type, and the both-side printing.","The control unit  stores these setting values in the memory unit . Upon receiving an instruction for changing the setting values through the operation unit , the control unit  changes the content displayed on the LCD  and the setting values stored in the memory unit  in accordance with the instruction.","When the start key  is pressed with the setting values being changed, the control unit  causes the reader unit  to scan an image on an original document and stores the scanned image data in the memory unit . The control unit  then generates a job by associating the stored image data with the setting values and stores the generated job in the memory unit .","The control unit  also registers information on the job held in the memory unit  in a job management table (see ) that is managed in the memory unit . Thereafter, the control unit  manages a job execution status and execution order in accordance with the job information registered in the job management table.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIGS. 5A and 5B"},"Information contained in this job management table is updated by the control unit  once the control unit  receives a job, once execution of a job completes, and once a job is cancelled.","When a job is stored in the memory unit  in response to pressing of the start key , the control unit  first registers job information in the job management table, such as one illustrated in .","Parameters, such as execution order, a job ID, a job name, a job type, a print setting, and a status, are managed for each job in the job management table.","Jobs registered in the job management table are executed by the control unit  in accordance with the execution order. More specifically, jobs are executed in ascending order of the execution order. After execution of a job completes, the completed job is deleted from the job management table and the execution order of the other jobs is decremented (decreased).","The job ID is a code that is assigned to a job by the control unit  upon generation of the job in order to uniquely identify the job.","The job name is assigned to a job. For copy jobs, names \u201ccopy \u201d, \u201ccopy \u201d, \u201ccopy \u201d, . . . are automatically assigned to the copy jobs by the control unit . For jobs received from the PC , a file name generated by application software of the PC  is registered as the job name in the job management table.","The job type is information indicating a type of a job. Upon receiving a job, the control unit  identifies a type of the job and registers information indicating the identified job type in the job management table. The job types include a copy job, a fax transmission job, a fax reception job, an image data transmission job, a print job, and automatic report job. So preferably the image forming apparatus can perform two or more of the aforementioned job types.","The print setting is received from users through the operation unit  or a printer driver of the PC .","The status is a value indicating an execution status of each job. More specifically, types of the status include \u201cbeing executed\u201d, \u201cexecution wait\u201d, \u201cstopped\u201d, and \u201cbeing canceled\u201d. The status is managed by the control unit .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":"FIG. 5A"},"A single job is illustrated in  and the job \u201c0015\u201d is being executed by the control unit . The status of the job is \u201cbeing executed\u201d. This status indicates that the control unit  is currently executing processing in which the control unit  causes the reader unit  to scan image data of an original document, performs image processing, and then causes the printer unit  to execute single-side printing on a A4-size sheet.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":["FIG. 5B","FIG. 5A"],"b":["102","207"]},"Four jobs are illustrated in . The job \u201c0015\u201d is being executed by the control unit  and the status thereof is \u201cbeing executed\u201d. The status of the other jobs is \u201cexecution wait\u201d, which indicates that each job is held in the memory unit  but is not yet executed by the control unit .","Transition of screens displayed in the operation unit  of the image forming apparatus  will now be described with reference to . This screen transition is controlled by the CPU  in accordance with a program in the ROM .","A status screen  illustrated in  shows an execution status of a job that is being executed.","The status screen  is displayed once the start key  is pressed with the screen illustrated in  being displayed. When a user wants to return this screen back to the screen illustrated in , the user may select <CLOSE> with the selection key set  or press the reset key .","The status screen  displays selection items, such as <CLOSE> and <CANCEL>. The status screen  also displays setting values regarding the currently executed job.","When the user wants to cancel the currently executed job, the user can cancel the job by operating the cursor with the selection key set  to move the cursor to <CANCEL> and then pressing the set key. When the user presses the stop key  with the status screen  being displayed, the control unit  performs an operation that is similar to the one performed when the cursor is moved to <CANCEL> and then the set key is pressed. In this way, the user can rapidly inform the control unit  of their intention to cancel the job without selecting the item with the cursor.","When <CANCEL> is selected in this status screen  or when the stop key  is pressed, the control unit  temporarily suspends all jobs subjected to execution held in the memory unit . The control unit  then determines the number of jobs held in the memory unit . Upon determining that a single job is held, the control unit  causes the LCD  to display a cancel confirmation screen . Upon determining that a plurality of jobs are held, the control unit  causes the LCD  to display a selection screen .","The cancel confirmation screen  displays selection items, such as <NO> and <YES>. When the user wants to cancel the currently executed job, the user operates the selection key set  to select <YES> and then presses the set key. On the other hand, when the user does not want to cancel the currently executed job, the user selects <NO> and then presses the set key.","When the set key is pressed with <YES> is being selected, the control unit  cancels the job held in the memory unit . While canceling the job, the control unit  causes the LCD  to display a cancel execution screen . On the other hand, when the set key is pressed with <NO> being selected, the control unit  causes the LCD  to display the status screen  without canceling the job held in the memory unit . When <NO> is selected, the control unit  restarts executing the job while causing the LCD  to display the status screen .","The user can also cancel the job by pressing the stop key  with the cancel confirmation screen  being displayed. In contrast to the case where the set key is pressed with <YES> in the cancel confirmation screen  being selected, to cancel the currently executed job by pressing the stop key  with the cancel confirmation screen  being displayed is referred to as simple job cancellation.","Here, when a single job subjected to execution is held in the memory unit , the user can easily cancel the job by pressing the stop key  twice with the status screen  being displayed. However, the user may mistakenly press the stop key  twice. In such a case, it is not desirable to cancel certain types of jobs, such as a fax reception job for receiving and printing a fax and an automatic report job for printing, as a report, an execution history of jobs executed in the image forming apparatus , because of the following reasons. In a case of the fax reception job, when the job is mistakenly canceled, the user has to contact a sender to ask retransmission of the original document. Accordingly, the user has to perform a troublesome work. In addition, the automatic report job is a function for reporting the execution history every time a given number of copies are printed or every time given time elapses. When the automatic report job is mistakenly canceled, the automatic report job is not executed until the next execution timing. Accordingly, a manager who checks the execution history of the image forming apparatus  with the report may miss timing for checking the execution history.","To avoid this situation, in the first exemplary embodiment, the control unit  (functioning as a determining unit) determines whether simple job cancellation is permitted for the currently executed job when the stop key  is pressed with the cancel confirmation screen  being displayed. More specifically, this determination is performed in step S of , which will be described later. When the type of the job to be cancelled is the fax reception job or the automatic report job, the control unit  determines that the simple job cancellation is \u201cnot permitted\u201d. On the other hand, when the job to be canceled is of types other than the fax reception job and the automatic report job, the control unit  determines that the simple job cancellation is \u201cpermitted\u201d.","Meanwhile, determination of whether the simple job cancellation is permitted on the basis of the job types, such as the fax reception job and the automatic report job, is merely an example.","Whether the simple job cancellation is permitted may be determined on the basis of other conditions.","For example, when a box print job is executed, whether or not to delete data stored in a box (i.e., a specific area in the memory unit ) after execution of the box print job can be previously set. When the currently executed job is the box print job and the setting is made so that the data stored in the box is deleted after execution of the box print job, the control unit  determines that the simple job cancellation is \u201cnot permitted\u201d for the job. On the other hand, when the currently executed job is the box print job and the setting is made so that the data stored in the box is not deleted after execution of the box print job, the control unit  determines that the simple job cancellation is \u201cpermitted\u201d. By controlling the operation in this manner, the control unit  can restrict the simple job cancellation when the original image data of the box print job is deleted once the box print job is mistakenly canceled. Accordingly, the control unit  may restrict simple job cancellation of a job not only on the basis of the type of the job to be canceled but also when data needed in re-execution of the job is lost as a result of cancellation of the job.","For example, information on a user ID and a department is managed in association with a job in the job management table illustrated in . The control unit  may restrict cancellation of the job when the job is associated with a specific user ID or a specific department. More specifically, the control unit  receives, from the external PC , information indicating a user ID or a department with a job and manages the information indicating the user ID or the department in association with the job. Upon receiving a simple job cancellation instruction from a user, the control unit  may restrict cancellation of the job when the job to be cancelled is managed in association with the information indicating the specific user ID or the specific department. On the other hand, upon receiving a simple job cancellation instruction from a user, the control unit  may cancel a job when the job to be cancelled is managed in association with information indicating a user ID other than the specific user ID or a department other than the specific department.","In addition, information indicating the job type, the specific user ID, and the specific department, based on which cancellation is restricted, may be set in advance by users through the operation unit  and the external PC .","When the control unit  determines that the simple job cancellation is not permitted using the above-described methods, the control unit  does not cancel the job but maintains the display state of the cancel confirmation screen . When the control unit  determines that the simple job cancellation is permitted, the control unit  cancels the job held in the memory unit . While canceling the job, the control unit  causes the LCD  to display the cancel execution screen .","With such control, users can rapidly inform the control unit  of their intention to cancel a job by operating the stop key  without selecting an item with a cursor when simple job cancellation is permitted for the job. Additionally, the control unit  can prevent a job for which the simple job cancellation is not permitted from being accidentally cancelled when the users mistakenly press the stop key  twice. Further, even when the simple job cancellation is not permitted for a job, the users can cancel the job by selecting <YES> with the cursor in the cancel confirmation screen . In this way, the users can inform the control unit  of their intention to cancel the job.","After cancellation of the job completes, the initial screen illustrated in  is displayed.","On the other hand, if a plurality of jobs are held when <CANCEL> is selected in the status screen  or when the stop key  is pressed, the selection screen  is displayed. When the selection screen  is displayed, the control unit  receives selection of a job to be canceled from a user.","The selection screen  displays a selection item <RESTART>. A list of the jobs held in the memory unit  is also displayed by the control unit  on the basis of the job management table.","When the user wants to restart execution of the temporarily suspended job, the user operates the selection key set  to select <RESTART> and then presses the set key. When the set key is pressed with <RESTART> being selected, the control unit  restarts executing the temporarily suspended job and returns the selection screen  back to the status screen .","On the other hand, when the user wants to cancel one of the plurality of jobs held in the memory unit , the user operates the selection key set  to select one of the jobs and then presses the set key, thereby instructing the control unit  to cancel the job. When cancellation of the job is instructed, the control unit  causes the LCD  to display a cancel confirmation screen . Meanwhile, the control unit  performs control so that the job is not canceled when the stop key  is pressed with the selection screen  being displayed. This is because, when a plurality of jobs are held in the memory unit , it is difficult for the control unit  to identify a job that the user wants to cancel from the plurality of jobs.","As in the cancel confirmation screen , the cancel confirmation screen  displays selection items, such as <NO> and <YES>. When the user wants to cancel the job selected in the selection screen , the user operates the selection key set  to select <YES> and then presses the set key. On the other hand, when the user does not want to cancel the job selected in the selection screen , the user selects <NO> and then presses the set key.","When the set key is pressed with <YES> is being selected, the control unit  cancels the job selected in the selection screen  and causes the LCD  to display the cancel execution screen . On the other hand, when the set key is pressed with <NO> being selected, the control unit  causes the LCD  to display the status screen .","After cancellation of the job completes, the control unit  executes a following job and displays a status of the executed job on the status screen .","By performing control in this way, the control unit  can execute cancellation processing suitable for the number of jobs held in the memory unit .","For example, when a single job is held in the memory unit , the user can rapidly cancel the job by pressing the stop key  twice with the status screen  being displayed.","On the other hand, when the user presses the stop key  twice and a plurality of jobs are held in the memory unit , the control unit  can prevent a job that is not intended by the user out of the plurality of jobs held in the memory unit  from being canceled.","The description has been given in the first exemplary embodiment for the case where the control unit  cancels a job held in the memory unit  in response to pressing of the stop key  twice with the status screen  being displayed. However, the present invention is not limited by this case and the control unit  may cancel the job held in the memory unit  in response to pressing of the stop key  twice with the screen illustrated in  being displayed.","A procedure of processing executed by the control unit  in response to pressing of the stop key  will now be described with reference to a flowchart of . Meanwhile, the CPU  of the control unit  reads out and executes a program stored in the ROM , whereby the processing illustrated in the flowchart of  is performed.","First, in step S, the control unit  detects pressing of the stop key . Upon detecting pressing of the stop key  in step S, the control unit  temporarily suspends jobs held in the memory unit . The process proceeds to step S.","In step S, the controller unit  determines whether a single job or a plurality jobs are held in the memory unit  on the basis of the job management table. When the control unit  determines that a single job is held, the process proceeds to step S. When the control unit  determines that a plurality of jobs are held, the process proceeds to step S.","In step S, the control unit  causes the LCD  to display the cancel confirmation screen  and stands by for an instruction from a user.
