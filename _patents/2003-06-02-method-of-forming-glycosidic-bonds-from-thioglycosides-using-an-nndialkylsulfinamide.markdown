{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 60\/387,806, filed Jun. 11, 2002.","This research was supported by Grant No. 1R01 GM57335 from the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. The government has certain rights to this invention.","The present invention relates to a method of forming glycosidic bonds. More particularly, the present invention relates to methods of forming glycosidic bonds, either in solution or on a polymer support, from a thioglycoside utilizing an N,N-dialkylsulfinamide and trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride (TfO). The present method permits the facile formation of several different types of glycosidic bonds, and can be utilized in an automated syntheses of oligosaccharides and polysaccharides.","Carbohydrates play a central role in a wide variety of normal and abnormal biological recognition processes. For example, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides, as components of glycoproteins and glycolipids, are ubiquitous on cell surfaces and function as cell-surface markers for recognition by protein receptors. Although such carbohydrate-mediated interactions are important in biological events, an understanding of the structure-activity relationships (SAR) of carbohydrates has developed very slowly because of the difficulty of synthesizing well-defined oligosaccharides and polysaccharides for study.","For example, carbohydrates on cell surfaces have been implicated in chronic inflammation, in viral and bacterial infection, and in tumorigenesis and metastasis. Inhibiting interactions between cell surface carbohydrates and their protein receptors could provide an effective means of preventing or treating various diseases. Consequently, a great potential exists for, and a great amount of research is directed to, the use of synthetic oligosaccharides and polysaccharides as therapeutic agents.","One application of synthetic oligosaccharides is inhibition of cell adhesion. Thus, there is interest in synthetic carbohydrates that interfere with selectin and\/or integrin binding, and, therefore, of use in the treatment of asthma, ARDS, reperfusion injury, multiple sclerosis, and various other chronic inflammatory diseases.","Synthetic carbohydrates also can be useful to inhibit bacterial adhesion to human tissue. Certain oligosaccharides and polysaccharides also can be useful to induce immune responses, for antibody production, e.g., as vaccines, or to induce disease states in research animals.","Despite such uses of synthetic oligosaccharides and polysaccharides in research and therapeutic applications, no universally applicable method exists for the synthesis of these complex molecules presently. Enzymatic methods have been developed that are effective in the regiospecific and stereospecific formation of glycosidic linkages, but the enzymes are relatively specific for particular substrates, and are not widely applicable to the variety of oligosaccharides and polysaccharides that must be synthesized. See, O. Karthaus et al. ., 1, 1851-1857 (1994), and M. Schuster et al., ., 116, 1135 (1994).","Oligosaccharide synthesis is not limited to an enzymatic method, and, therefore, carbohydrate synthesis has become a very active field of research. Other glycosylation reactions and strategies for carbohydrate synthesis have been developed. As a result, some relatively complex oligosaccharides have been synthesized, but to date no generally applicable \u201cuniversal\u201d synthetic method that can reliably generate glycosidic linkages with control of regiochemistry and stereochemistry exists.","Persons skilled in the art are aware that subtle changes in the structures of glycosyl donors and acceptors change the regiochemical and stereochemical outcomes, and the yields, of existing glycosylation reactions. Consequently, every oligosaccharide synthesis is a unique undertaking. The state of the art, therefore, does not permit the synthesis of large libraries of oligosaccharides for screening purposes","Combinatorial synthesis has been used to identify drug leads and elucidate structure-activity relationships in specific areas of drug discovery. Combinatorial methods of synthesizing peptides and nucleic acids on solid supports to provide combinatorial libraries of peptides and nucleic acids have been available for many years. But, combinatorial methods to synthesize carbohydrates on the solid phase only now are being developed. See Liang et al., , 274, pp. 1520-1522 (1996). The reliable preparation of a combinatorial oligosaccharide library requires reliable and consistently If high-yielding reactions, which give well-defined products from a variety of substrates under standardized reaction conditions.","Carbohydrates are notoriously difficult to synthesize, but research groups have made advances in simplifying and accelerating the synthetic process. For example, an automated solid-phase oligosaccharide synthesizer that facilitates preparation of carbohydrates has been developed (, 291, 1523 (2001)). The automated oligosaccharide synthesis allows production of oligosaccharides in about 1% of the time required using previous methods.","A comprehensive carbohydrate-based combinatorial capability requires an ability to link, attach, and modify sugars. However, the execution of such a comprehensive strategy is difficult because of the complexity of carbohydrate-based systems and the synthetic difficulties related to their construction and modification.","In addition, a simple monosaccharide contains multiple reactive sites and an anomeric center with difficult-to-control stereochemistry. Traditionally, a site selective reaction is controlled by complicated protecting group schemes. Further, the construction of multiple consecutive glycosidic linkages or glycosidic linkages to differing substrates typically relied upon different glycosylating reagents because of the lack of a single general glycosidic bond-forming reaction reliably applicable to a wide variety of substrates. Therefore, the success of a carbohydrate-based combinatorial program depends on effectively solving the unique chemical problems posed by carbohydrates.","The linking of monosaccharide units through a glycosidic bond is fundamental to the synthesis of oligosaccharides and various glycoconjugates. Therefore, the development of carbohydrate-based technology requires the construction of glycosidic bonds in the solid or liquid phase. The formation of glycosidic bonds is central to the field of glycobiology and to the preparation of a carbohydrate-based therapeutic or diagnostic agent.","Thioglycosides are among the most widely used glycosyl donors because of their ease of preparation and shelf stability. Thioglycosides also are compatible with numerous protection and deprotection synthetic steps, as well as being orthogonal to several other glycosidic bond-forming reactions, such as the trichloroacetimidate and glycosyl fluoride methods. See, P. J. Garegg, ., 52, pp. 179-266 (1997).","A thioglycoside requires activation to form a glycosidic bond. However, the stability that renders thioglycosides attractive as a donor, sufficiently reduces their reactivity in coupling reactions such that reaction times often are very long (e.g., up to ten days). Current methods of activating thioglycosides also suffer from one or more other disadvantages, such as unstable or unavailable activating agents, the need to oxidize the thioglycoside to the sulfoxide, poor stereoselectivity, and lack of generality. In addition, expensive reagents, which typically suffer from stability problems, are required for activation. Frequently, reagents used to activate thioglycosides are based on heavy (e.g., mercury) or precious (e.g., silver) metals, and pose problems of expense, environmental and toxicological concerns, and\/or disposal.","Nonmetallic thiophiles of varying stability and activity currently in common use include dimethyl(methylthio)sulfonium triflate (DMTST), methylsulfenyl triflate (MeSOTf), benzeneselenyl triflate (PhSeOTf), iodonium dicollidine perchlorate (IDCP), and N-iodosuccinimide-trifluoromethane sulfonic acid (NIS\/TfOH). Kahne's sulfoxide glycosylation method (D. Kahne et al., ., 111, 6881-6882 (1989)) and related methods using glycosyl sulfimides (S. Cassel et al., , 39, 5175-5178 (1998)) are distinct from the mainstream methods because these methods require prior oxidation of the thioglycoside but, in doing so, permit the formation of highly reactive glycosylating species at low temperature.","Investigators, therefore, are searching for improved methods of activating thioglycosides, and forming of glycosidic bonds in general. One research group has developed a polymer-supported synthesis of oligosaccharides (O. J. Plante et al., , 291. pp. 1523-1527 (2001)). However, this technology does not permit the preparation of \u03b2-mannosides, and also utilizes a very unstable glycosyl phosphate and\/or trichloroacetimidate.","The present invention provides a method of forming glycosidic bonds utilizing thioglycosides and an activating system that overcomes problems associated with prior methods of forming glycosidic bonds, and permits the automated synthesis of oligosaccharides and polysaccharides.","The present invention is directed to an improved method of forming glycosidic bonds, which in turn facilitates the synthesis, including the automated synthesis, of oligosaccharides and polysaccharides, in solution and in the solid phase. More particularly, the present invention is directed to utilizing a thioglycoside to form a glycosidic bond, wherein the thioglycoside is activated using an N,N-dialkylsulfinamide and trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride (TfO).","Therefore, one aspect of the present invention is to provide an activating system for thioglycosides that can be used in the formation of glycosidic bonds and in the synthesis of oligosaccharides and polysaccharides. The thioglycoside-activating system of the present invention:","(i) is useful in the formation of a very wide range of glycosidic bonds, including, but not limited to, \u03b2-mannosides, 2-deoxy-2-aminoglucosides, and galactosides;","(ii) is compatible with both armed (ether protected) and disarmed (ester protected) thioglycosides;","(iii) enables coupling to primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols, and primary and secondary amines, as glycosyl acceptors;","(iv) functions in minutes, e.g., about 2 to about 10 minutes, at low temperatures, e.g., about \u221250\u00b0 C. to about \u221278\u00b0 C.;","(v) uses a combination of commercially available trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride and a readily prepared N,N-dialkylsulfinamide as the thioglycoside activating system; and","(vi) functions in an extremely efficient manner for the low temperature activation of insoluble polymer supported thioglycosides.","Another aspect of the present invention is to provide a method of synthesizing \u03b2-mannosides on a polymer support.","Still another aspect of the present invention is to provide a method of activating a thioglycoside comprising adding TfO and an N,N-dialkylsulfinamide having a general structural formula (I): \n\n","wherein Ris selected from the group consisting of aryl, heteroaryl, and Calkyl; and Rand R, independently, are Calkyl, or Rand Rare taken together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached to form a 4- to 8-membered aliphatic ring, optionally containing an additional nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur atom, to the thioglycoside.","Another aspect of the present invention is to provide an activating system for a selenoglycoside comprising TfO and an N,N-dialkylsulfinamide.","Another aspect of the present invention is to provide an activating system for a thioglycoside comprising TfO and either a solid N,N-dialkylsulfinamide having a structure \n\n\nor a liquid N,N-dialkylsulfinamide having a structure \n\n","Yet another aspect of the present invention is to provide a method of converting an \u2014SR moiety (wherein R is alkyl or aryl) of a thioglycoside to an \u2014OR\u2032\u2033, \u2014NH(R\u2032\u2033), or \u2014N(R\u2032\u2033)moiety, wherein R\u2032\u2033, independently, is a moiety of a simple or complex alcohol or amine of structure R\u2032\u2033OH, NH(R\u2032\u2033), or NH(R\u2032\u2033), respectively.","Still another aspect of the present invention is to provide a combination of 1-benzenesulfinyl piperidine (BSP) and trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride (TfO) as a powerful, metal-free thiophile that can readily activate both armed and disarmed thioglycosides, via glycosyl triflates in about 2 to about 10 minutes at about \u221250\u00b0 C. to about \u221278\u00b0 C., e.g., at \u221260\u00b0 C., in a suitable solvent, e.g., dichloromethane, and, optionally, in the presence of a suitable base, e.g., 2,4,6-tri-tert-butylpyrimidine (TTBP). The glycosyl triflates are rapidly and efficiently converted to glycosides, upon treatment with acceptor alcohols and amines, in good yield and stereochemical selectivity.","These and other novel aspects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from following detailed description of the preferred embodiments.","A primary goal of research in the carbohydrate area has been the development of more practical activators capable of converting thioglycosides to glycosyl triflates at low temperature. The present invention is directed to the use of an activating system comprising an N,N-dialkylsulfinamide and TfO, which activates thioglycosides (or selenoglycosides) in about 2 to about 10 minutes at about \u221250\u00b0 C. to about \u221278\u00b0 C., and thereby facilitates the formation of glycosidic linkages.","The use of S-aryl arylthiosulfinates, in conjunction with TfO, as activating agents for armed thioglycosides has been disclosed in D. Crich et al., ., pp. 4067-4069 (2000). However, the disclosed activating system did not permit activation of disarmed thioglycosides. (i.e., thioglycosides protected with ester groups), and required several equivalents of reagents for complete activation of armed thioglycosides (i.e., thioglycosides protected with ether groups).","The present thioglycoside activating system comprises an N,N-dialkylsulfinamide as a shelf-stable reagent that is substantially more powerful than the previously described activating systems, requires only a minimal excess, if any, of TfO over a stoichiometric amount, and activates both armed and disarmed thioglycosides. The present activating system converts thioglycosides to glycosyl triflates, and eventually to glycosidic bonds, cleanly and in high yield.","It should be understood that a present activating system also activates selenoglycosides. Accordingly, the term \u201cthioglycoside\u201d as used herein refers collectively to thioglycosides and selenoglycosides.","The N,N-dialkylsulfinamides used in the present activating system are known compounds. See, T. J. Maricich et al., ., 49, pp. 1931-1934 (1985), and K. K. Andersen, , D. H. R. Barton and W. D. Ollis, eds., Pergamon, Oxford, Vol. 3, pp. 317-329 (1979). However, N,N-alkylsulfinamides have not been utilized as an activator component for thioglycosides, or in the reactions disclosed herein. Also, the reaction between N,N-dialkylsulfinamides and TfO has not been reported previously. Boronic acid functionalized polymers for use in solid phase oligosaccharide synthesis has been disclosed, but not employed previously in the synthesis of \u03b2-mannosides. See, G. Belogi et al., ., 41, pp. 6965-6968 (2000).","The present invention utilizes a thioglycoside as the donor, and overcomes the disadvantages associated with other glycosylation methods using a thioglycoside or other donor. The present invention allows activation of thioglycosides within minutes at about \u221250\u00b0 C. to about \u221278\u00b0 C., and typically at about \u221260\u00b0 C. to about \u221278\u00b0 C., using a combination of two, metal-free, shelf-stable reagents, one of which (TfO) is commercially available and the other (an N,N-dialkylsulfinamide) is easily prepared synthetically on a large scale. Moreover, all types of thioglycosides, i.e., armed and disarmed, are activated in accordance with the present invention under a standard set of conditions, and a wide range of different glycosidic bonds can be formed.","The present method can be used to activate polymer-supported or solubilized thioglycosides with several advantages, including ease of operation, purification, and automation. The present method also can be used to form the widest possible range of glycosidic bonds in a highly efficient manner. It is envisioned that the method can be extended to encompass the formation of other types of glycosidic bonds, such as more elaborate thioglycosides, N-glycosides (nucleosides), and C-glycosides.","L. Yan et al., ., 118, pp. 9239-9248 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,040,433 disclose a method that requires prior oxidation of a thioglycoside to the sulfoxide, but has not been widely applied. The most widely applied glycosylation method, i.e., the trichloroacetimidate method disclosed in R. R. Schmidt et al., ., 50, pp. 21-123 (1994), requires the preparation and use of unstable glycosyl trichloroacetimidates, and, therefore, is significantly less convenient than a method based on the use of thioglycosides.","The glycosyl fluoride method can be compared to the present thioglycoside method because glycosyl fluorides are readily prepared and shelf stable, but this method is of no economic interest because the activating elements are metal based, typically using hafnium, which severely limits commercial application. See, K. C. Nicolaou et al., \u201cOligosaccharide Synthesis from Glycosyl Fluorides and Sulfides,\u201d in , S. Hanessian, ed., Dekker, N.Y., pp. 313-338 (1997).","For the purposes of this disclosure, the following terms are defined as follows.","The term \u201cmonosaccharide\u201d refers to a pentose, hexose, heptose, or octose sugar, analog, or derivative thereof, including, but not limited to, deoxy sugars, dideoxy sugars, amino sugars, and sugar acids.

Many other protecting groups are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.","The term \u201cglycosyl donor\u201d refers to a sugar with a leaving group (or potential leaving group) on at least one anomeric carbon which, under appropriate conditions, is capable of participating in a glycosylation reaction wherein the anomeric carbon becomes covalently attached to a second moiety, typically a glycosyl acceptor, as defined below, or a nucleophile.","The term \u201cglycosyl acceptor\u201d refers to any moiety, including a sugar, having the capacity to participate as the second moiety in the glycosylation reaction by virtue of a nucleophilic (or potentially nucleophilic) group present among the groups or substituents of such moiety, such that a covalent bond is formed between an anomeric carbon of a glycosyl donor and the nucleophilic (or potentially nucleophilic) group.","The terms \u201ccarbohydrate, disaccharide, oligosaccharide, or polysaccharide\u201d all refer to a molecule or a portion thereof, which is comprised of two or more monosaccharides that are joined by a glycosidic linkage. A \u201csugar\u201d is any carbohydrate, disaccharide, oligosaccharide, polysaccharide, or monosaccharide.","The terms \u201cCalkyl,\u201d and \u201cCalkyl\u201d are defined as an alkyl group, straight chain, branched, or bicyclic, containing one to six or one to two, carbon atoms, respectively. The alkyl group optionally can be substituted with one or more, and typically one to three, nonreactive substituents, such as, for example, halo (i.e., Cl, Br, F, I), alkoxy (e.g., OCH, OCH), OCF, CF, aryloxy (e.g., OCH), or aryl (e.g., CH). The term \u201cCalkenyl\u201d is defined similarly, except the carbon chain contains a carbon-carbon double bond.","The term \u201cacyl\u201d is defined as RC(\u2550O)\u2014, wherein R is Calkyl or aryl.","The term \u201caryl,\u201d alone or in combination, is defined as a monocyclic or polycyclic aromatic group, preferably a monocyclic or bicyclic aromatic group, e.g., phenyl or naphthyl. Unless otherwise indicated, an \u201caryl\u201d group can be unsubstituted or substituted, for example, with one or more, and in particular, one to four, halo, Calkyl, Calkenyl, OCF, NO, CN, CF, alkoxy, and aryloxy. Exemplary aryl groups include phenyl, naphthyl, tetrahydronaphthyl, chlorophenyl, methylphenyl, methoxyphenyl, trifluoromethylphenyl, nitrophenyl, 2,4-methoxychlorophenyl, and the like.","The term \u201cheteroaryl\u201d is defined herein as a monocyclic or bicyclic ring system containing one or two aromatic rings and containing at least one nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur atom in an aromatic ring, and that can be unsubstituted or substituted, for example, with one or more, and in particular one to four, substituents, for example, Calkyl, Calkenyl, alkoxy, aryl, aryloxy, OCF, CF, and halo. Examples of heteroaryl groups include, but are not limited to, thienyl, furyl, pyridyl, oxazolyl, quinolyl, isoquinolyl, indolyl, triazolyl, isothiazolyl, isoxazolyl, imidazolyl, benzbthiazolyl, pyrazinyl, pyrimidinyl, thiazolyl, and thiadiazolyl.","The following abbreviations are used herein: Bn is benzyl, Bz is benzoyl, Ac is acetyl, Ph is phenyl, Me is methyl, and Phth is phthalimide.","A thioglycoside is activated using an N,N-dialkylsulfinamide and TfO. The N,N-dialkylsulfinamide has a general structural formula (I): \n\n","wherein Ris selected from the group consisting of aryl, heteroaryl, and Calkyl; and Rand R, independently, are Calkyl, or Rand Rare taken together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached to form a 4- to 8-membered aliphatic ring, optionally containing an additional nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur atom.","In preferred embodiments, Ris aryl, and Rand R, independently, are Calkyl, or Rand Rare taken together with the nitrogen to which they are attached to form a 5- or 6-membered aliphatic ring.","In most preferred embodiments, Ris aryl, preferably phenyl, Rand Rboth are methyl or both are ethyl, or Rand Rare taken together with the nitrogen to which they are attached to form a pyrrolidinyl or, preferably, a piperidinyl moiety.","A preferred N,N-dialkylsulfinamide used in the present invention is 1-benzenesulfinyl piperidine, termed BSP, and having a structural formula \n\n\nAnother preferred N,N-dialkylsulfinamide has the structure: \n\n","BSP is used in conjunction with TfO, and is a potent reagent for the activation of both armed and disarmed thioglycosides. The reaction between BSP and TfO is illustrated below: \n\n","BSP is readily prepared in relatively large scale, is white, crystalline, and readily dried, and is shelf-stable under ambient storage conditions. Moreover, as demonstrated by standard low-temperature NMR experiments, BSP reacts completely with TfO and converts a standard thioglycoside (1) to a glycosyl triflate (2) within minutes at \u221260\u00b0 C., essentially stoichiometrically. \n\n","Optimal glycosidic bond formation is achieved simply by cooling a 1:1 mixture of the thioglycoside and an N,N-dialkylsulfinamide of the present invention, e.g., BSP, to \u221260\u00b0 C. in dichloromethane (CHCl) in the presence of the hindered base, e.g., 2,4,6-tri-tert-butylpyrimidine (TTBP), treatment with 1.1 equiv. of TfO, and, after five minutes, addition of an acceptor alcohol or amine, warming to room temperature, and isolating the product using standard work-up procedures.","The N,N-dialkylsulfinamides are readily prepared in a large scale, for example, by conversion of thiophenol to benzensulfinyl chloride (PhSOCl) using sulfuryl chloride and acetic anhydride, followed by treatment with a desired secondary amine, e.g., piperidine. Many N,N-dialkylsulfinamides are isolated by crystallization to provide a white stable solid. Others are isolated by vacuum distillation to provide clear liquids. The following illustrates the preparation of an N,N-dialkylsulfinamide, specifically BSP.","A solution of PhSOCl (58.9 g, 0.365 mol) in diethyl ether (EtO) (200 mL) was added slowly to a cooled solution (5\u00b0 C.) of piperidine (72 mL, 0.73 mol) in EtO (200 mL). The reaction mixture then was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The solid residue was triturated with hexanes to yield BSP as a white crystalline solid (53.4 g, 70%): mp 84-85\u00b0 C. (lit. mp 83-84\u00b0 C.); H NMR \u03b4: 1.41-1.53 (6H, m), 2.83-2.87 and 2.89-3.04 (each 2H, m), 7.37-7.42 (3H, m), 7.56-7.59 (2H, m); C NMR \u03b4: 23.8, 26.1, 46.9 126.1, 128.7, 130.6, and 143.3; MS (EI) m\/z 210 (MH).","The trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride used in the activating system is commercially available, and is used in conjunction with the N,N-dialkylsulfinamide to provide an extremely potent activating system for the formation of glycosidic bonds from thioglycosides.","The N,N-dialkylsulfanilamide is used in an amount of about one mole per one mole of thioglycoside. The TfO is used in an amount of about 1 to about 1.2 mole per mole of thioglycoside. The reaction is performed in the presence of an optional base, typically a weak, sterically hindered base, such as 2,6-di-t-butylpyridine, 2,4,6-tri-t-butylpyrimidine, or a similar base known to persons skilled in the art. The reaction also is performed in a solvent, preferably a chlorinated solvent, like dichloromethane, at a temperature of about \u221250\u00b0 C. to \u221278\u00b0 C., preferably about \u221255\u00b0 C. to about \u221265\u00b0 C. The identity of the solvent is not limiting, and any solvent that solubilizes the reactants, as desired, and is a liquid at the reaction temperature can be used in the method of the present invention.","The 2,4,6-tri-t-butylpyrimidine (TTBP) is a preferred, sterically hindered, non-nucleophilic base used in the present invention. 2,6-Di-tert-butylated pyridine also is useful as a base in the present method. TTBP is a preferred base because it is a white, non-hygroscopic, crystalline solid that is not readily sublimed under vacuum. However, the crystalline nature of TTBP renders it relatively insoluble in dichloromethane at \u221278\u00b0 C., and, therefore, the reaction is performed at about \u221260\u00b0 C. 2,6-Di-tert-butylated pyridine preferably is used as the base when a temperature lower than about \u221260\u00b0 C. is desired or required.","A thioglycoside activated by the present activating system can be, for example, a pentose or hexose sugar, or a sialic acid; with a broad range of stereochemistry, including, but not limited to, xylose, rhamnose, glucose, galactose, mannose, glucosamine, and N-acetyl neuraminic acid.","The following illustrates a general reaction scheme of the present invention for solution glycosylation using a thioglycoside: \n\n","wherein P is a protecting group, typically a benzyl group (armed) or an acetyl or benzoyl group (disarmed);","R is alkyl or aryl, typically an ethyl or phenyl group;","Ris an aryl, heteroaryl, or Calkyl group, typically a phenyl group;","Rand Rare as defined above, with N(R)Rtypically being piperidinyl, N(CH), or N(CH);","R\u2032\u2033 OH is a primary, secondary, or tertiary alcohol; and","base is a mild, sterically hindered base, such as, but not limited to, 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine or 2,4,6-tri-tert-butylpyrimidine. In another embodiment, (R\u2032\u2033)NH or (R\u2032\u2033)NHcan be substituted for R\u2032\u2033 OH.","Examples of forming glycosidic bonds using a thioglycoside activated by an N,N-dialkylsulfinamide and TfO are set forth in the following Table 1. Table 1 illustrates the diversity and range of thioglycoside donors and acceptor alcohols (R\u2032\u2033OH) useful in the method of the present invention. Especially noteworthy is coupling of mannose, in the form of a \u03b2-mannoside, to a tertiary alcohol, as illustrated in Table 1, entry 2.

present activating system using phenyl thioglycosides as donors. However, ethyl thioglycosides are activated equally well as phenyl glycosides. It also has been found that a selenoglycoside can be activated by the N,N-dialkylsulfinamide\/TfO\/optional base method of the present invention, as illustrated below: \n\n\nThe selenoglycoside reaction was extremely \u03b1-selective (\u03b1:\u03b2>9:1). The differential reactivity of thioglycosides and selenoglycosides to the BSP\/TfO activating system is envisioned as providing a one-pot oligosaccharide synthesis.\n","An important feature of the present method is the double glycosylation of carbohydrate diols. One example illustrated below is coupling of a 4,6-glucopyranosyl diol (3) to the phthalimide protected glycosamine donor (4), which resulted in the isolation of the trisaccharide (5) in 85% yield. \n\n","A second example is coupling of a mannopyranosyl diol (6) to a highly \u03b1-selective mannosyl donor (7) resulting in the formation of the mannotriose (8), as illustrated below. This particular example illustrates a synthesis of a protected version of the trisaccharide substrate of the mannose binding protein concanavalin A. \n\n","From the above examples, it has been shown that the present N,N-dialkylsulfinamide and TfO activating system is considerably more potent than the MPBT\/TfO method. The N,N-dialkylsulfinamide and TfO method activates a full range of armed and disarmed glycosyl donors, under a standard set of conditions. Accordingly, the present method differs from other methods of thioglycoside activation, particularly most other glycosylations methods that with few exceptions, require alternative conditions for arming and disarming protecting groups. The generalized reaction conditions provided by the present method facilitates use of the method by nonspecialists, and is of a benefit in the development of fully automated oligosaccharide synthesizers. It is also important that products of the present BSP\/TfO glycosylations are easier to purify than the prior MPBT glycosylations. The present invention generates fewer by-products and, because fewer reagents are required, separation of by-products is considerably easier.","General Method for the Preparation of Glycosides.","To a stirred solution containing a thioglycoside (0.185 mmol), 1-benzenesulfinyl piperidine (BSP, 0.185 mmol), TTBP (0.370 mmol), and activated 3 \u212b powdered sieves in CHCl(5 mL), at \u221260\u00b0 C. under an argon atmosphere, was added TfO (0.203 mmol).

J. Plante, , 291, 1523-1527 (2001). Nevertheless, the development of a truly versatile system for the automated, supported synthesis of oligosaccharides requires that methods for the highly diastereoselective synthesis of all classes of glycosidic bond be transposed to the solid phase. At the present time, the art still has not achieved that goal, with several classes of glycosidic bonds still presenting a considerable challenge even in solution. The present invention illustrates the first successful polymer-supported synthesis of the difficult \u03b2-mannopyranoside-type glycosidic bond.","In particular, the linkage of S-phenyl 2,3-di-O-benzyl-\u03b2-D-thiomannopyranoside to a crosslinked polystyrene support, in the form of its 4,6-O-polystyrylborinate ester, is disclosed. Activation of the polymer-supported mannosyl donor is achieved by at \u221260\u00b0 C. in CHClin the presence of 2,4,6-tri-tert-butylpyrimidine by a combination of BSP and TfO. Addition of the donor alcohol at \u221260\u00b0 C., followed by warming to room temperature, and subsequent cleavage from the resin by gentle heating in aqueous acetone yields anomerically pure 2,3-di-O-benzyl-\u03b2-D-mannopyranosides in excellent yield. Successful, diastereoselective coupling has been demonstrated with a range of primary secondary and tertiary glycosyl acceptors including typical carbohydrates and threonine derivatives.","The \u03b2-mannosides have long been recognized as one of the more important and challenging classes of glycosidic bonds. Accordingly, substantial effort has been spent on developing methods for their synthesis culminating in several successful strategies. These methods largely are indirect and consequently less than ideal for solid supported synthesis because of the extra steps that are required. The only method transferred to the solid phase to date is an adaptation of the intramolecular aglycon method which, by its very nature, results in cleavage from the resin concomitant with formation of the \u03b2-mannoside linkage (Y. Ito et al., ., 119, 5562-5566 (1997)).","In contrast to both the use of polystyrylboronic acid as a protecting group for carbohydrate diols (J. M. Fr\u00e9chet et al., ., 101, 432-436 (1979)) and an extension thereof to the immobilization of thioglucoside 4,6-diols and the use of bound donors in coupling reactions (G. Belogi et al., ., 41, 6965-6968 (2000); G. Belogi et al., ., 41, 6969-6972 (2000)), phenylboronic acid derivatives were investigated. In order to determine whether the 4,6-O-phenylboronate ester exhibited the same torsionally disarming properties as the benzylidene group, diol (28) was condensed with phenylboronic acid to give compound (29). Compounds (29) were activated in dichloromethane at \u221260\u00b0 C. in the presence of TTBP with BSP, and then coupled to 1-adamantanol to give the crude \u03b2-mannoside (30). Subjecting the residue to silica gel chromatography removed the phenylboronate ester to provide diol (31) in 72% yield The anomeric stereochemistry of diol (31) was confirmed by the Jcoupling constant (K. Bock et al., . 2, 293-297 (1974)) of 152 Hz as well as by conversion of diol (31) into its known 4,6-O-benzylidine derivative (D. Crich et al., , 54, 8321-8348 (1998)), with which it was identical. \n\n","The viability of the 4,6-O-phenylboronates as torsionally disarming protecting groups was thus established, and with the polymer-supported variant was tested. Accordingly, diol (28) was heated in pyridine with polystyrylboronic acid (32) (J. M. J. Fr\u00e9chet et al., ., 101, 432-346 (1979); J. M. J. Fr\u00e9chet et al., ., 41, 3877-3882 (1976)) to give the bound donor (33) with a loading of about 1 mmol\/g as determined by the amount of diol (28) liberated on cleavage.","Activation of the bound thioglycoside (33) was achieved by stirring in CHClwith BSP at \u221260\u00b0 C. in the presence of TTBP and TfO for 20 minutes, followed by addition of the acceptor alcohol, warming to room temperature and quenching. After removal of the excess reagents, alcohol, and by-products, the coupled \u03b2-mannosides (33) were released from the resin by heating in aqueous acetone for 1 hour to give the 4,6-diols (35).","The various \u03b2-mannosides prepared by this procedure are summarized in Table 3.

\u03b2-mannosides. The method utilizes BSP and TfO for the activaiton of thioglycosides. Very short activation times are required at a low temperature, and the isolated yields of \u03b2-mannosides from this polymer-supported protocol are directly comparable with those obtained using the analogous solution phase methodology. The method is both different and complimentary to that disclosed in Y Ito et al., . 33, 1765-1767 (1994) and M. Lergenmuller et al., ., 1367-1376 (1999). The present method differs fundamentally because cleavage from the resin is not an integral part of the coupling reaction, but rather the disaccharide is retained on the support The present method is complimentary to prior methods because, after cleavage, the method provides \u03b2-mannosides bearing free hydroxyl groups at the 4- and 6-positions, whereas the Ito et al. method provides the \u03b2-mannoside selectively deprotected at the 2-position.","Obviously, many modifications and variations of the invention as hereinbefore set forth can be made without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, and, therefore, only such limitations should be imposed as are indicated by the appended claims."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
