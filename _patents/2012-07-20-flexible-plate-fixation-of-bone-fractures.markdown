title: Flexible plate fixation of bone fractures
abstract: Embodiments provide methods, apparatuses, and systems for fixation of a fractured bone. In various embodiments, the systems and plates may provide elastic suspension of the receiving holes relative to the osteosynthesis plate. This elastic suspension may promote load distribution between the screws that connect a bone segment to the plate, thereby reducing stress risers and load shielding effect. In addition, stress at the screw holes, and within the construct as a whole, is reduced by incorporation of these elastic elements in the plate. Additionally, in some embodiments, for instance if fracture healing by callus formation is desired, elastic suspension of the receiving holes relative to the osteosynthesis plate may enable small, controlled amounts of relative motion between bone fragments connected by the plate, which may promote fracture healing by callus formation.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","GOVERNMENT INTEREST","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF DISCLOSED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application is a Divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/166,539, filed on Jun. 22, 2011, which claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e) from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Nos. 61\/357,855 filed on Jun. 23, 2010, which claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e) from U.S. Provisional Patent application Nos. 61\/428,745 filed on Dec. 30, 2010 the subject matter of which is herein incorporated reference.","This invention was made with government support under AR061201 award by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.","Embodiments herein relate generally to devices for fixation of a fractured bone.","Osteosynthesis plates for stabilization of bone fractures typically are applied with bone screws. Traditionally, bone screws compress a plate onto the bone surface to provide stable fixation. More recently, locking plates have been introduced, which typically have threaded receiving holes for positive, angle-stable engagement with the threaded head portion of a locking screw. These locking plates may provide more stable fixation in the ends of weak, osteoporotic bone compared to traditional, non-locking plates.","Clinically, plate osteosynthesis constructs face two principal challenges. First, an osteosynthesis construct may alter the load distribution in bone, which may either cause bone resorption in cases exhibiting load shielding, or bone fracture due to implant-induced stress risers. Second, the high stiffness of a plate osteosynthesis construct may suppress relative displacement between bone fragments, whereby this interfragmentary motion is important to promote the natural cascade of fracture healing by callus formation. Therefore, overly stiff locking plate constructs may delay or prevent fracture healing by callus formation.","In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which are shown by way of illustration embodiments that may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural or logical changes may be made without departing from the scope. Therefore, the following detailed description is not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of embodiments is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.","Various operations may be described as multiple discrete operations in turn, in a manner that may be helpful in understanding embodiments; however, the order of description should not be construed to imply that these operations are order dependent.","The description may use perspective-based descriptions such as up\/down, back\/front, and top\/bottom. Such descriptions are merely used to facilitate the discussion and are not intended to restrict the application of disclosed embodiments.","The terms \u201ccoupled\u201d and \u201cconnected,\u201d along with their derivatives, may be used. It should be understood that these terms are not intended as synonyms for each other. Rather, in particular embodiments, \u201cconnected\u201d may be used to indicate that two or more elements are in direct physical contact with each other. \u201cCoupled\u201d may mean that two or more elements are in direct physical or electrical contact. However, \u201ccoupled\u201d may also mean that two or more elements are not in direct contact with each other, but yet still cooperate or interact with each other.","For the purposes of the description, a phrase in the form \u201cA\/B\u201d or in the form \u201cA and\/or B\u201d means (A), (B), or (A and B). For the purposes of the description, a phrase in the form \u201cat least one of A, B, and C\u201d means (A), (B), (C), (A and B), (A and C), (B and C), or (A, B and C). For the purposes of the description, a phrase in the form \u201c(A)B\u201d means (B) or (AB) that is, A is an optional element.","The description may use the terms \u201cembodiment\u201d or \u201cembodiments,\u201d which may each refer to one or more of the same or different embodiments. Furthermore, the terms \u201ccomprising,\u201d \u201cincluding,\u201d \u201chaving,\u201d and the like, as used with respect to embodiments, are synonymous.","In various embodiments, methods, apparatuses, and systems for fixation of a fractured bone are provided. In various embodiments, the systems and plates may provide elastic suspension of receiving holes relative to an osteosynthesis plate. In various embodiments, this elastic suspension may promote load distribution between screws that connect a bone segment to the plate, thereby reducing stress risers and the load shielding effect. In addition, in various embodiments, stress at the screw holes, and within the construct as a whole, may be reduced by incorporation of these elastic elements in the plate. Additionally, in some embodiments, for instance if fracture healing by callus formation is desired, elastic suspension of the receiving holes relative to the osteosynthesis plate may enable small, controlled amounts of relative motion between bone fragments connected by the plate, which may promote fracture healing by callus formation. In some embodiments, relative motion between bone fragments enabled by the elastic elements may be substantially parallel to an upper or lower surface of the bone plate, or substantially parallel to a bone surface.","Unlike other devices, bone plates in accordance with certain embodiments disclosed herein may be configured to be suspended above the surface of the bone, so that a gap is present between the lower surface of the plate and the upper surface of the bone. In various embodiments, this may be accomplished by using locking screws that are designed to engage with a threaded hole in the bone plate. In various embodiments, the coupling of a locking screw with a corresponding portion of a bone plate may ensure that the locking screw is only inserted to a certain extent, for instance the point where the screw locks into the hole of the bone plate. In another embodiment, the receiving hole elements may extend through the lower surface of the bone plate, for instance so that the plate remains suspended over the bone surface even if a bone fastener is used to compress the receiving hole element to the one bone.","In other embodiments, for instance if direct fracture healing is desired, elastic suspension of the receiving holes relative to the osteosynthesis plate may promote elastic compression across a fracture site, whereby the plate may be affixed to the bone with non-locking screws inserted in an eccentric manner in order to induce compression across the fracture. Thus, in various embodiments, it may be beneficial and desirable to stabilize a bone fracture with a plate as disclosed herein to enhance load distribution between screws, to promote fracture site motion when fracture healing by callus formation is desired, and\/or to induce prolonged compression across a fracture when direct fracture healing is desired.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A","FIGS. 2A and 2B","FIGS. 1A"],"b":["1","2","2","101","160","108","136","108","106","105","105","105","136","160","148","168","103","136","105","160","105","160","105","136","148","107","108","160","108","101"],"i":["a ","a ","a.

In various embodiments, the load acting on bone segments  and onto locking screws  may induce elastic translation of receiving holes  relative to bone plate , which in turn may cause generally parallel motion between bone segments  at bone fracture . In this configuration, axial loading of bone segments  may cause elastic deformation of elastic beam elements , wherein slot segments  located at the aspect of receiving hole  facing fracture  become narrower, while slot segments  located at the receiving hole aspect facing away from fracture  become wider.","In various other embodiments,  illustrates a cross-sectional side view of a bone plate for elastic compression of a bone fracture, shown in functional association with non-locking bone screws for spanning a bone facture in a cylindrical bone, wherein bone screws are inserted in an eccentric manner, and  illustrates a cross-sectional side view of a bone plate for elastic compression of a bone fracture, wherein tightening of eccentrically inserted bone screws induces elastic compression across a bone fracture by deformation of elastic beam elements that connect the plate holes to the plate member, both in accordance with various embodiments.","Thus, in order to illustrate a method for inducing elastic compression across a bone fracture,  depict cross-sectional views of an embodiment of a bone plate  applied to bridge and to elastically compress a fracture  in a substantially cylindrical bone.  depicts bone screws  being partially inserted through receiving holes  into bone segments . In various embodiments, screws  may be inserted eccentrically in receiving holes , at a small distance from the center-line  of receiving hole  in an opposite direction from fracture .  depicts the embodiment in a cross-sectional view after complete insertion of screws . Since screws  were inserted eccentrically relative to receiving hole , once screw heads  are contacting bone plate  during insertion, screws  may be forced to translate toward the center of receiving holes . This in turn causes bone segment  attached to screws  to translate relative to bone plate  toward fracture , thereby inducing compression across fracture . Once fracture  is fully compressed, any further translation may be accommodated by deformation of elastic beam elements  connecting receiving holes  to bone plate . In embodiments, this elastic deformation may induce additional compressive forces at fracture .","As illustrated in , the introduction of elastic elements in a bone plate as described elsewhere herein (referred to in  as an S-plate) may reduce axial stiffness of the plate as compared to a standard plate without the elastic elements. Notably, there is little to no impact on the bending stiffness of the plate due to the introduction of the elastic elements.","Thus, in some embodiments, having an opening with a major dimension in a transverse direction may effectively reduce the bending strength of bone plates, which may fail in bending. Thus in various embodiments, the flexible elements described herein may not have a major dimension extending in transverse direction. This orientation may cause the bone plate to retain a substantial amount of bending strength. As described elsewhere herein, it is desirable to maintain the bending strength of the construct while reducing the axial stiffness of plate, and additionally reducing stress at the screw hole(s) and in the construct as a whole. In various embodiments, stress at the screw hole(s) may cause undesirable or detrimental deformation of the hole(s).","In other embodiments, if the cantilever beam were located transversely \u2018in-line\u2019 with the screw hole, the transverse opening may extend over a substantial portion of the plate in order to derive flexibility, which in turn may reduce the bending strength of the plate. Thus, various embodiments disclosed herein employ a combination of two or more cantilever beams located above and below the screw hole (e.g., in the longitudinal plate direction), which may preserve bending strength of the plate.","In still other embodiments described herein, one or more pairs of cantilever beams may be employed, wherein the beams of each cantilever pair are located on opposite sides of the screw hole in longitudinal direction, rather than one cantilever beam element that extends in a principally transverse direction to either one or both sides of the screw hole (lug), depending if the screw hole is located offset from or located on the longitudinal plate midline, respectively.","Other embodiments disclosed herein use pairs of slots that extend through the plate edge, rather than a slot that defines the transverse opening and that surrounds the beam and lug element, wherein the slot remains within the plate surface and does not extend through the plate edge.","Still other embodiments include a set of slots per screw hole, wherein the set combines a central slot that partially surrounds the screw hole without extending through the plate edge with peripheral slots that penetrate through the longitudinal plate edge, rather than one continuous slot per screw hole, whereby the slot defines the transverse opening and surrounds the beam and lug element.","Various other embodiments disclosed herein employ a set of slots to form a principally S-shaped spring element having an upper and a lower cantilever element that is diagonally connected by a central segment that contains the screw hole, rather than a generally I-shaped cantilever beam, for instance. Still other embodiments described herein employ cantilever elements of a width that is substantially smaller than the plate thickness, rather than a cantilever element of a width that is larger than the plate thickness. This may ensure a desired bending direction of the cantilever beam within the plane of the plate rather than out of the plane of the plate.","It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes could be made to the embodiments described above without departing from the broad inventive concept thereof. Specifically, the disclosed invention may be practiced for fixation of a bone plate to one side of a fracture only, whereby the corresponding side of a fractured bone may be applied to the one plate by alternative means for flexible or rigid fixation.
