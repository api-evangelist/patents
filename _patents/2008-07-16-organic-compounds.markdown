A Serine\/Threonine (Ser\/Thr, or S\/T) protein kinase, termed Akt, is identified as a downstream target of PI3-kinase. This protein kinase is recruited to the cell membrane by interaction of its pleckstrin homology domain with PI3K products, phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIPS), and phosphatidylinositol-3,4-diphosphate (PIP), where it is activated by phosphorylation of its catalytic domain by 3-Phosphoinositide-dependent Kinase-1 (PDK-1). Akt is further activated by phosphorylation of a serine in its C-terminal hydrophobic motif by another kinase (PDK-2). The activation of Akt acts downstream to regulate additional kinases many of which are implicated in cellular processes that control survival, proliferation, metabolism and growth translation. PI3K can also drive cellular processes that impact transformation, cellular proliferation, cytoskeletal rearrangement and survival through a parallel pathway that does not involve Akt (Hennessy et al., 4:988-1004 (2005)). Two of these pathways are activation of the small GTP-binding proteins Cdc42 and Rac1 and activation of the serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase (SGK). Cdc42 and Rac1, which regulate cytoskeletal movement and cell motility and can function as oncogenes when over-expressed, are also linked to the RAS pathway. Thus, PI3K activity generates 3\u2032-phosphatidylinositol lipids that act as a nodal point to stimulate a diversity of downstream signaling pathways.","That these pathways impact cellular properties proliferation, survival, motility and morphology that are often disrupted in cancer, proliferative diseases, thrombotic diseases and inflammation, among others, dictates that compounds inhibiting PI3K (and isoforms thereof) have utility, either as a single agent or in combination, in the treatment of these diseases. In cancer, deregulation of the PI3K\/Akt pathway is extensively documented, including overexpression of the PIK3 CA gene, activating mutations of the PIK3 CA gene, overexpression of Akt, mutations of PDK-1, and deletions\/inactivation of PTEN (Parsons et al., 436:792 (2005); Hennessy et al., 4:988 (2005); Stephens et al., 5:1 (2005); Bonneau and Longy, 16:109 (2000) and Ali et al., 91:1922 (1999)). Recent findings indicate that PIK3CA is frequently mutated (>30%) in various solid tumors in humans (Samuels and Ericson, 18:77 (2005)) and the most frequent of these mutations promote cell growth and invasion (Samuels et al., 7:561 (2005), and are transforming (Kang et al., 102:802 (2005), Zhao et al., 102:18443 (2005)). Thus, inhibitors of PI3K, particularly of the p110a isoform encoded by PIK3CA and its mutations, will be useful in the treatment of cancers driven by these mutations and deregulations.","In its compounds aspects, the embodiments provide novel compounds that act as inhibitors of serine\/threonine kinases, lipid kinases, and, more particularly, as inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) function.

It may further be evidenced by reduced requirement for other, symptomatic therapy, i.e. therapy for or intended to restrict or abort symptomatic attack when it occurs, for example anti-inflammatory (e.g. corticosteroid) or bronchodilatory. Prophylactic benefit in asthma may in particular be apparent in subjects prone to \u201cmorning dipping\u201d. \u201cMorning dipping\u201d is a recognised asthmatic syndrome, common to a substantial percentage of asthmatics and characterised by asthma attack, e.g. between the hours of about 4 to 6 am, i.e. at a time normally substantially distant form any previously administered symptomatic asthma therapy.","Other inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases and conditions to which the present invention is applicable include acute lung injury (ALI), adult\/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), chronic obstructive pulmonary, airways or lung disease (COPD, COAD or COLD), including chronic bronchitis or dyspnea associated therewith, emphysema, as well as exacerbation of airways hyperreactivity consequent to other drug therapy, in particular other inhaled drug therapy.

Although trastuzumab has demonstrated durable responses in some patients expressing Her2\/neu-ErbB2, only a subset of these patients respond. Recent work has indicated that this limited response rate can be substantially improved by the combination of trastuzumab with inhibitors of PI3K or the PI3K\/AKT pathway (Chan et al., 91:187 (2005), Woods Ignatoski et al., 82:666 (2000), Nagata et al., 6:117 (2004)).","A variety of human malignancies express activitating mutations or increased levels of Her1\/EGFR and a number of antibody and small molecule inhibitors have been developed against this receptor tyrosine kinase including tarceva, gefitinib and erbitux. However, while EGFR inhibitors demonstrate anti-tumor activity in certain human tumors (e.g., NSCLC), they fail to increase overall patient survival in all patients with EGFR-expressing tumors. This may be rationalized by the fact that many downstream targets of Her1\/EGFR are mutated or deregulated at high frequencies in a variety of malignancies, including the PI3K\/Akt pathway. For example, gefitinib inhibits the growth of an adenocarcinoma cell line in in vitro assays. Nonetheless, sub-clones of these cell lines can be selected that are resistant to gefitinib that demonstrate increased activation of the PI3\/Akt pathway. Down-regulation or inhibition of this pathway renders the resistant sub-clones sensitive to gefitinib (Kokubo et al., Brit. J. Cancer 92:1711 (2005)). Furthermore, in an in vitro model of breast cancer with a cell line that harbors a PTEN mutation and over-expresses EGFR inhibition of both the PI3K\/Akt pathway and EGFR produced a synergistic effect (She et al., Cancer Cell 8:287-297 (2005)). These results indicate that the combination of gefitinib and PI3K\/Akt pathway inhibitors would be an attractive therapeutic strategy in cancer.","The combination of AEE778 (an inhibitor of Her-2\/neu\/ErbB2, VEGFR and EGFR) and RAD001 (an inhibitor of mTOR, a downstream target of Akt) produced greater combined efficacy that either agent alone in a glioblastoma xenograft model (Goudar et al., 4:101-112 (2005)).","Anti-estrogens, such as tamoxifen, inhibit breast cancer growth through induction of cell cycle arrest that requires the action of the cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip. Recently, it has been shown that activation of the Ras-Raf-MAP Kinase pathway alters the phosphorylation status of p27Kip such that its inhibitory activity in arresting the cell cycle is attenuated, thereby contributing to anti-estrogen resistance (Donovan, et al, 276:40888, (2001)). As reported by Donovan et al., inhibition of MAPK signaling through treatment with MEK inhibitor reversed the aberrant phosphorylation status of p27 in hormone refractory breast cancer cell lines and in so doing restored hormone sensitivity. Similarly, phosphorylation of p27Kip by Akt also abrogates its role to arrest the cell cycle (Viglietto et al., 8:1145 (2002)). Accordingly, in one aspect, the compounds as defined herein may be used in the treatment of hormone dependent cancers, such as breast and prostate cancers, to reverse hormone resistance commonly seen in these cancers with conventional anticancer agents.","In hematological cancers, such as chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), chromosomal translocation is responsible for the constitutively activated BCR-Abl tyrosine kinase. The afflicted patients are responsive to imatinib, a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, as a result of inhibition of Abl kinase activity. However, many patients with advanced stage disease respond to imatinib initially, but then relapse later due to resistance-conferring mutations in the Abl kinase domain. In vitro studies have demonstrated that BCR-Ab1 employs the Ras-Raf kinase pathway to elicit its effects. In addition, inhibiting more than one kinase in the same pathway provides additional protection against resistance-conferring mutations. Accordingly, in another aspect of the embodiments, the compounds as defined herein are used in combination with at least one additional agent, such as Gleevec\u00ae, in the treatment of hematological cancers, such as chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), to reverse or prevent resistance to at least one additional agent.","Because activation of the PI3K\/Akt pathway drives cell survival, inhibition of the pathway in combination with therapies that drive apoptosis in cancer cells, including radiotherapy and chemotherapy, will result in improved responses (Ghobrial et al., CA 55:178-194 (2005)). As an example, combination of PI3 kinase inhibitor with carboplatin demonstrated synergistic effects in both in vitro proliferation and apoptosis assays as well as in in vivo tumor efficacy in a xenograft model of ovarian cancer (Westfall and Skinner, 4:1764-1771 (2005)).","In addition to cancer and proliferative diseases, there is accumulating evidence that inhibitors of Class 1A and 1B PI3 kinases would be therapeutically useful in others disease areas. The inhibition of p110\u03b2, the PI3K isoform product of the PIK3CB gene, has been shown to be involved in shear-induced platelet activation (Jackson et al., 11:507-514 (2005)). Thus, a PI3K inhibitor that inhibits p110\u03b2 would be useful as a single agent or in combination in anti-thrombotic therapy. The isoform p110\u03b2, the product of the PIK3CD gene, is important in B cell function and differentiation (Clayton et al., 196:753-763 (2002)), T-cell dependent and independent antigen responses (Jou et al., 22:8580-8590 (2002)) and mast cell differentiation (Ali et al., 431:1007-1011 (2004)). Thus, it is expected that p110\u03b2-inhibitors would be useful in the treatment of B-cell driven autoimmune diseases and asthma. Finally, the inhibition of p110\u03b2, the isoform product of the PI3KCG gene, results in reduced T, but not B cell, response (Reif et al., 173:2236-2240 (2004)) and its inhibition demonstrates efficacy in animal models of autoimmune diseases (Camps et al., 11:936-943 (2005), Barber et al., 11:933-935 (2005)).","The preferred embodiments provide pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one compound as defined herein together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier suitable for administration to a human or animal subject, either alone or together with other anticancer agents.","Another embodiment provides methods of treating human or animal subjects suffering from a cellular proliferative disease, such as cancer.

Representative kits include a PI3K inhibitor compound of the preferred embodiments (e.g., a compound as defined herein) and a package insert or other labeling including directions for treating a cellular proliferative disease by administering a PI3K inhibitory amount of the compound.","Administration and Pharmaceutical Composition","In general, the compounds of preferred embodiments will be administered in a therapeutically effective amount by any of the accepted modes of administration for agents that serve similar utilities. The actual amount of the compound of preferred embodiments, i.e., the active ingredient, will depend upon numerous factors such as the severity of the disease to be treated, the age and relative health of the subject, the potency of the compound used, the route and form of administration, and other factors. The drug can be administered more than once a day, preferably once or twice a day. All of these factors are within the skill of the attending clinician.","Therapeutically effective amounts of compounds as defined herein may range from about 0.05 to about 50 mg per kilogram body weight of the recipient per day; preferably about 0.1-25 mg\/kg\/day, more preferably from about 0.5 to 10 mg\/kg\/day. Thus, for administration to a 70 kg person, the dosage range would most preferably be about 35-70 mg per day.","In general, compounds of the preferred embodiments will be administered as pharmaceutical compositions by any one of the following routes: oral, systemic (e.g., transdermal, intranasal or by suppository), or parenteral (e.g., intramuscular, intravenous or subcutaneous) administration. The preferred manner of administration is oral using a convenient daily dosage regimen that can be adjusted according to the degree of affliction. Compositions can take the form of tablets, pills, capsules, semisolids, powders, sustained release formulations, solutions, suspensions, elixirs, aerosols, or any other appropriate compositions. Another preferred manner for administering compounds of the preferred embodiments is inhalation. This is an effective method for delivering a therapeutic agent directly to the respiratory tract (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,607,915).","The choice of formulation depends on various factors such as the mode of drug administration and bioavailability of the drug substance. For delivery via inhalation the compound can be formulated as liquid solution, suspensions, aerosol propellants or dry powder and loaded into a suitable dispenser for administration. There are several types of pharmaceutical inhalation devices-nebulizer inhalers, metered dose inhalers (MDI) and dry powder inhalers (DPI). Nebulizer devices produce a stream of high velocity air that causes the therapeutic agents (which are formulated in a liquid form) to spray as a mist that is carried into the patient's respiratory tract. MDI's typically are formulation packaged with a compressed gas. Upon actuation, the device discharges a measured amount of therapeutic agent by compressed gas, thus affording a reliable method of administering a set amount of agent. DPI dispenses therapeutic agents in the form of a free flowing powder that can be dispersed in the patient's inspiratory air-stream during breathing by the device. In order to achieve a free flowing powder, the therapeutic agent is formulated with an excipient such as lactose. A measured amount of the therapeutic agent is stored in a capsule form and is dispensed with each actuation.","Recently, pharmaceutical formulations have been developed especially for drugs that show poor bioavailability based upon the principle that bioavailability can be increased by increasing the surface area i.e., decreasing particle size. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,107,288 describes a pharmaceutical formulation having particles in the size range from 10 to 1,000 nm in which the active material is supported on a crosslinked matrix of macromolecules. U.S. Pat. No. 5,145,684 describes the production of a pharmaceutical formulation in which the drug substance is pulverized to nanoparticles (average particle size of 400 nm) in the presence of a surface modifier and then dispersed in a liquid medium to give a pharmaceutical formulation that exhibits remarkably high bioavailability.","The compositions are comprised of in general, a compound as defined herein in combination with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. Acceptable excipients are non-toxic, aid administration, and do not adversely affect the therapeutic benefit of the compound as defined herein. Such excipient may be any solid, liquid, semi-solid or, in the case of an aerosol composition, gaseous excipient that is generally available to one of skill in the art.","Solid pharmaceutical excipients include starch, cellulose, talc, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, magnesium stearate, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, sodium chloride, dried skim milk and the like. Liquid and semisolid excipients may be selected from glycerol, propylene glycol, water, ethanol and various oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, e.g., peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil, etc. Preferred liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions, include water, saline, aqueous dextrose, and glycols.","Compressed gases may be used to disperse a compound of the preferred embodiments in aerosol form. Inert gases suitable for this purpose are nitrogen, carbon dioxide, etc. Other suitable pharmaceutical excipients and their formulations are described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, edited by E. W. Martin (Mack Publishing Company, 18th ed., 1990).","The amount of the compound in a formulation can vary within the full range employed by those skilled in the art. Typically, the formulation will contain, on a weight percent (wt %) basis, from about 0.01-99.99 wt % of a compound as defined herein based on the total formulation, with the balance being one or more suitable pharmaceutical excipients. Preferably, the compound is present at a level of about 1-80 wt %.","General Synthetic Methods","The compounds of preferred embodiments can be prepared from readily available starting materials using the following general methods and procedures. It will be appreciated that where typical or preferred process conditions (i.e., reaction temperatures, times, mole ratios of reactants, solvents, pressures, etc.) are given, other process conditions can also be used unless otherwise stated. Optimum reaction conditions may vary with the particular reactants or solvent used, but such conditions can be determined by one skilled in the art by routine optimization procedures.","Additionally, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art, conventional protecting groups may be necessary to prevent certain functional groups from undergoing undesired reactions. Suitable protecting groups for various functional groups as well as suitable conditions for protecting and deprotecting particular functional groups are well known in the art. For example, numerous protecting groups are described in T. W. Greene and G. M. Wuts, , Third Edition, Wiley, New York, 1999, and references cited therein.","Furthermore, the compounds of preferred embodiments contain one or more chiral centers. Accordingly, if desired, such compounds can be prepared or isolated as pure stereoisomers, i.e., as individual enantiomers or diastereomers, or as stereoisomer-enriched mixtures. All such stereoisomers (and enriched mixtures) are included within the scope of the preferred embodiments, unless otherwise indicated. Pure stereoisomers (or enriched mixtures) may be prepared using, for example, optically active starting materials or stereoselective reagents well-known in the art. Alternatively, racemic mixtures of such compounds can be separated using, for example, chiral column chromatography, chiral resolving agents and the like.","The starting materials for the following reactions are generally known compounds or can be prepared by known procedures or obvious modifications thereof. For example, many of the starting materials are available from commercial suppliers such as Aldrich Chemical Co. (Milwaukee, Wis., USA), Bachem (Torrance, Calif., USA), Emka-Chem or Sigma (St. Louis, Mo., USA). Others may be prepared by procedures, or obvious modifications thereof, described in standard reference texts such as Fieser and Fieser's , Volumes 1-15 (John Wiley and Sons, 1991), Rodd's , Volumes 1-5 and Supplementals (Elsevier Science Publishers, 1989), , Volumes 1-40 (John Wiley and Sons, 1991), March's , (John Wiley and Sons, 4th Edition), and Larock's (VCH Publishers Inc., 1989).","The various starting materials, intermediates, and compounds of the preferred embodiments may be isolated and purified where appropriate using conventional techniques such as precipitation, filtration, crystallization, evaporation, distillation, and chromatography. Characterization of these compounds may be performed using conventional methods such as by melting point, mass spectrum, nuclear magnetic resonance, and various other spectroscopic analyses.","Compounds of preferred embodiments can be made by employing palladium mediated coupling reactions, such as Suzuki coupling. Said couplings can be employed to functionalize a heterocycle or aryl ring system at each position of the ring system providing said ring is suitably activated or functionalized.","Suzuki coupling (Suzuki et al., . (1979) 866) can be used to form the final product and can be effected under known conditions such as by treatment with functionalized boronic esters as in the following schemes:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0323","num":"0322"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00115","num":"00115"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00115","he":"100.50mm","wi":"75.78mm","file":"US08053574-20111108-C00115.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0324","num":"0323"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00116","num":"00116"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00116","he":"94.83mm","wi":"75.78mm","file":"US08053574-20111108-C00116.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"The pyridinyl or pyrimidinyl cores can be obtained commercially and functionalized.
