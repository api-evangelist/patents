{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention relates generally to creating content for business objects, and more specifically, to creating and modifying notes for business objects.","Enterprise Information Systems (EIS) provide a technology platform for the modelling and management of business processes and activities. An EIS typically models activities related to the operation of an enterprise, such as human resources, accounting, finance, plant management, sales and distribution, marketing, fleet management, warehouse management, and others. An EIS may model business processes via business objects that could represent tasks or activities of an enterprise, for example.","Extending an EIS is a time-consuming and resource-consuming process and runtime extensions are generally not available on an EIS. Because of the complexity associated with an EIS, extending an EIS involves modelling additional components for the system in a design time environment, testing such additional components, and deploying such additional components in the runtime of the EIS.","Some EIS offer static extension mechanisms that require the generation of extensions in a design time environment. Such extensions require development effort and additional resources such as time, human effort, and funds. Thus, such extensions cannot be provided on-demand.","Further, information pertaining to a business object in an EIS may be tightly coupled to the business object itself; and all changes to the business object may require to be performed in the same transaction with the business object, thus affecting the business object and all instances of the business object.","In hosted on-demand systems, it may be relevant to keep data in each instance of a business object separate from other instances of the business object because each business object instance may be relevant for different organizations sharing the use of the hosted system.","These and other benefits and features of embodiments of the invention will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description of preferred embodiments thereof, presented in connection with the following drawings.","In various embodiments, a system is presented. The system of the embodiments saves notes relevant for a business object instance. The system further manages positioning and visibility settings of notes. The system includes a buffer module to handle buffering and synchronization and a persistence module to save the notes.","In various embodiments, a method is presented. The method includes creating a note in a user interface, attaching the note to a position on a user interface screen and saving the content and position of the node to a database using a dedicated database connection inside a dedicated transaction.","Embodiments of techniques for generating and binding notes to business objects are described herein. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of the invention.","Reference throughout this specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d, \u201cthis embodiment\u201d and similar phrases, means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, the appearances of these phrases in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.","In various embodiments, an Enterprise Information System (EIS) is presented. An EIS enables organizations to manage their business processes and tasks on an Information Technology (IT) platform. Typically, an EIS includes modules for business activities, such as, but not limited to accounting, finance and controlling, human resources, sales, distribution, procurement, warehouse management, and other modules.","A business object in an EIS represents a physical or logical object pertaining to the business activities of an organization. Business objects may encapsulate business logic for a business process or business task. Examples of business objects may be a sales order, an invoice, an account, and others.","A business object instance in an EIS may represent a particular selection of data from a data source pertaining to the business object. For example, a \u201csales order\u201d is a business object; and \u201csales order 001\u201d is a particular instance of the business object \u201csales order.\u201d In another example, \u201caccount Smith\u201d is a particular instance of the business object \u201caccount.\u201d","An EIS may handle work in transactions. Transactions are units of work that are performed by a database system, EIS, or other systems.","In various embodiments, a system may be implemented to provide extensibility for business object instances. Such extensibility may be in the form of notes added to business object instances. The system may provide user interface (UI) elements to receive content for notes in a UI. Such notes and corresponding database connection are persisted in a transaction separate from the general EIS transaction. The system of the embodiments may also display notes which correspond to a visibility setting, thus allowing for public, private, or group visible notes on business object instances. For example, a note may be added to the business object instance \u201csales order 001\u201d with a visibility setting of \u201cpublic.\u201d Thus, all users of the system with access to the business object instance \u201csales order 001\u201d will be able to read the note. In another example, a second note may be added to the business object instance \u201csales order 001\u201d with a visibility setting of \u201cprivate.\u201d In this case, only the user who added the note will be able to read it, while all other public notes would still be available to all users of the business object instance \u201csales order 001.\u201d In a further example, a third note may be added to the \u201csales order 001\u201d with a visibility setting \u201cgroup,\u201d in which a group of users for whom the note will be visible may be defined.","Using notes, business objects and instances thereof may be enriched with additional information. For example, in a business object \u201ccustomer,\u201d a business object instance would be a particular customer of the organization, such as \u201ccustomer A.\u201d A salesperson handling \u201ccustomer A\u201d may wish to add additional information on \u201ccustomer A\u201d as a hint via a note, such as a telephone extension of a contact person at \u201ccustomer A\u201d. In another example, a note may be added to note that a particular customer has particular preferences. Thus, other users working with the customer would have such preferences in mind. However, information provided in a note is relevant for the business object instance and will not be visible in other business object instances. Thus, users of different business object instances will be able to see only the information relevant for the business object instances they have access to.","In various embodiments, a system of the embodiments may receive notes from a user interface and handle such notes in dedicated transactions. Thus, saving information in a note does not trigger a change in the underlying business object of a business object instance. In various embodiments, note content of notes attached to read-only business object instances can be changed.","In various embodiments, a system of the embodiments may save a position of a note relevant for a user of a business object instance. Thus, the same note may be displayed in different UI positions depending on the user.","In various embodiments, there may be many user interfaces or views on top of a business object. The content of a note may be available to all UIs and views of the business object; however, each UI and view may have a different position for the note.","In various embodiments, a \u201cnote associated with a business object instance\u201d is a note created for a particular business object instance. The note may only be available in the business object instance it is created in. Other business object instances of the same business objects will not display the note.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["102","102","104","104","118","120","104","106","106","108","110","104","106","104","106","104","108","108","108","110","120","120","100"]},"In various embodiments, notes received from the UI client  may be saved to the persistence module  after a check has determined that the notes for business object instance are relevant and persistent. Such checks may be relevant for concurrency purposes. For example, if a business object instance is newly created, the notes should not persist before the business object instance because in such a case the notes in the database may result in having irrelevant or incorrect data.","In various embodiments, the buffering module  may receive data relevant for the note from the controller  via data received from the registry. To determine if a business object is relevant for a business object instance, the buffering module  may receive data from the extensibility registry . The controller may use the EIS transaction  to find the business object relevant for the business object instance.","In various embodiments, the controller may implement UI logic relevant for the business object instances and UI screens thereof. Such logic may determine positions of UI elements, interactions between UI elements, and activities of UI elements.","In various embodiments, after a note has been persisted to the persistence module , the note may be replicated to a secondary persistence via the replicator . Replicating the note to the secondary persistence enables searching operations for notes.","In various embodiments, the EIS transaction may include components pertaining to one or more functions of the EIS related to the business object instance.","In various embodiments, EIS functions may be exposed to the UI backed via enterprise services.","In various embodiments, the components of system  may be implemented on one or more servers.","Some benefits of the presented system of  include an integration and propagation of notes to types of UIs based on the same business object and the ability to edit notes attached to read-only UIs. Updates to notes may be saved independently from original business object on editable UIs. The system implements optimistic locking to minimize conflicts. Further, asynchronous updates minimize lock conflicts and improve user experience; changes from parallel sessions are directly available (including newly created notes).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["108","202","108","108","202","204","204","204"]},"In various embodiments, the plugin  and listener  handle synchronization for the buffering module with other entities such as EIS transactions (e.g., EIS transaction  of ). For example, the plugin  performs a check to determine if a business object instance is persistent or not. To determine if a business object instance is persistent, the plugin  may access components in the EIS transaction  to obtain information about the business object instance. The plugin  enables the buffer manager  to obtain information from the buffer manager. The translator  receives information from a registry (e.g., extensibility registry  of ), and translates this information in a suitable form for the buffer manager  format. The buffer manager  may use this information to communicate with the runtime buffer .","The listener  \u2018listens\u2019 for events occurring in the EIS transaction . For example, the listener triggers a delete operation for one or more notes relevant for a business object instance if the business object instance is deleted. The listener  also may trigger a flush operation if a business object is persisted in the EIS transaction . If a business object is persisted, notes content and position on business object instances will also be synchronized to keep the most current notes content in the database. In various embodiments, if a note is created for a first time on a business object instance which is also created for the first time, the business object instance will be saved first. Following the saving of the business object instance, the note will be saved as well.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["112","112","302","302","304","302","306","302","118","308"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["402","404"]},"At process block , a check is performed to determine if a business object instance relevant for the note and the business object is persistent. If the business object instance is not persistent, at process block , the received note is updated in a buffer. At process block , a check is performed to determine if the business object is persistent. If the business object is persistent, at process block , the note is persisted to a storage medium such as a database.","In various embodiments, the note may also be replicated to enable search functionality for notes.","In various embodiments, if the business object instance is persisted, the buffer is synchronized at process block . At process block , a check is performed to determine if the note has been changed by another user. If the note has been changed, at process block , the user is notified via an information message. In various embodiments, this check may be referred to as \u2018optimistic locking.\u2019 Optimistic locking is a concept that may refer to throwing an error if the item has been changed by another entity. With this concept, an entity (e.g., application, object, etc.) that wishes to change and item may not need to obtain an explicit lock on the item before performing the change. If the note has not been changed, the note is updated in the buffer at process block .","In various embodiments, the process as described in  may be performed by components as described in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["502","504","506","510","508"]},"In various embodiments, the process as described in  is performed by components as described in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["602","606","608","610","612","614"]},"In various embodiments, the process as described in  is performed by components as described in .","The architecture described in  and the processes described in  allow for the implementation and configuration of an EIS that enables end users with no technical knowledge to extend the system. Thus, time, funds, and resources may be saved. Further, such an EIS may deliver rich user-specific and instance-specific content to facilitate collaboration and information exchange.","Some embodiments of the invention may include the above-described methods being written as one or more software components. These components, and the functionality associated with each, may be used by client, server, distributed, or peer computer systems. These components may be written in a computer language corresponding to one or more programming languages such as, functional, declarative, procedural, object-oriented, lower level languages and the like. They may be linked to other components via various application programming interfaces and then compiled into one complete application for a server or a client. Alternatively, the components maybe implemented in server and client applications. Further, these components may be linked together via various distributed programming protocols. Some example embodiments of the invention may include remote procedure calls being used to implement one or more of these components across a distributed programming environment. For example, a logic level may reside on a first computer system that is remotely located from a second computer system containing an interface level (e.g., a graphical user interface). These first and second computer systems can be configured in a server-client, peer-to-peer, or some other configuration. The clients can vary in complexity from mobile and handheld devices, to thin clients and on to thick clients or even other servers.","The above-illustrated software components are tangibly stored on a computer readable medium as instructions.
