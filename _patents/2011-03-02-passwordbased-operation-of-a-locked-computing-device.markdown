{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Technical Field","The present application relates generally to the operation of a computing device in a locked or restricted mode.","2. Description of the Related Art","Computing or communication devices, such as computers, laptops, PCs, tablets, MP3 players and smartphones, are typically controlled through user input interfaces including touchscreens, buttons, keyboards, trackpads, trackballs, microphones and the like. To enhance security or conserve power, these devices may enter a \u201clocked\u201d state if no input has been received for a period of time, or if expressly instructed to enter the locked state. In the locked state, some or all of the device's input interfaces may be inoperable or non-responsive, thus reducing the likelihood of accidental operation of the device due to inadvertent actuation of an input interface, potentially reducing the power consumed by some or all of the input interfaces. In the locked state, access to functions or data on the device can be restricted; to access some or all of the device's functions or data, a security code such as a password or PIN may be required.","The embodiments described herein provide a computing or communication device and a method for operating the device while it is in a locked state. These embodiments will be described and illustrated primarily in relation to a mobile wireless communication device. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, however, that this description is not intended to limit the scope of the described embodiments to mobile wireless communication devices. The methods and systems described herein may be applied to any appropriate computing device, communication device or data processing device. The device may be adapted to communicate with another communication or data processing device over a fixed or wireless connection, whether portable or wirelessly enabled or not, whether provided with voice communication capabilities or not. However, the device need not be adapted for such communications. The device may additionally or alternatively be adapted to process data and carry out operations on data in response to user commands for any number of purposes, including productivity and entertainment. Thus, the embodiments described herein may be implemented on computing devices including without limitation cellular phones, smartphones, wireless organizers, personal digital assistants, desktop computers, terminals, laptops, tablets, handheld wireless communication devices, notebook computers, entertainment devices such as MP3 or video players, and the like. Unless expressly stated, the device described herein may include any such device.","Accordingly, the embodiments described herein provide a method, comprising: receiving one of a plurality of security codes at a computing device via a user input interface while the computing device is in a locked state, a first one of the plurality of security codes comprising an authentication code which when received by the computing device causes the computing device to transition to an unlocked state, wherein access to data at the computing device is disabled in the locked state; and executing a command at the computing device when a second one of the plurality of security codes is received by the computing device in the locked state, said second security code comprising the authentication code and a command code associated with said command.","There is further provided a computing device, comprising a user input interface; a storage device for storing data; and a processor in operative communication with the user input interface and the storage device, the processor being configured to: receive one of a plurality of security codes at a computing device via a user input interface while the computing device is in a locked state, a first one of the plurality of security codes comprising an authentication code which when received by the computing device causes the computing device to transition to an unlocked state, wherein access to data at the computing device is disabled in the locked state; and execute a command at the computing device when a second one of the plurality of security codes is received by the computing device when in the locked state, said second security code comprising the authentication code and a command code associated with said command.","In an aspect, the computing device is in the locked state upon completion of said execution of said command.","In another aspect, the access comprises user interface access.","In still another aspect, user interface access to said data remains disabled while the command is executed.","In yet another aspect, access to data at the computing device is disabled by encryption of said data, and access to said data is enabled by decryption of said data.","Further, in another aspect, said data is encrypted using an encryption key, the encryption key being encrypted for storage at the computing device using the authentication code, wherein when access to said data is enabled, the authentication code comprised in the received first security code is used to decrypt the encryption key, and said decrypted encryption key is used to decrypt said data.","In still a further aspect, executing the command comprises launching an application associated with the command code at the computing device.","In yet a further aspect, executing the command comprises passing the command to an application associated with the command code executing at the computing device.","Further, the first one of the plurality of security codes may be the authentication code, or the command code may be a prefix to the authentication code in the second security code.","A computer program product is also provided, comprising a non-transitory computer readable medium storing code which, when executed, causes a computing device to carry out the methods described herein.","The embodiments described herein for implementation on a computing device may be implemented on a communication device such as that illustrated in . The communication device may communicate with other devices over a wireless communication system. The communication device  may be a mobile device with two-way communication and advanced data communication capabilities including the capability to communicate with other mobile devices or computer systems through a network of transceiver stations. The communication device  can also have voice communication capabilities. Throughout the specification, terms such as \u201cmay\u201d and \u201ccan\u201d are used interchangeably and use of any particular term should not be construed as limiting the scope or requiring experimentation to implement the claimed subject matter or embodiments described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","100","104","100","103"]},"The communication subsystem  receives messages from and sends messages to a wireless network . In this exemplary embodiment of the communication device , the communication subsystem  is configured in accordance with one or more of Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM), General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) standards, Enhanced Data GSM Environment (EDGE) and Universal Mobile Telecommunications Service (UMTS). New standards are still being defined, but it is believed that they will have similarities to the network behavior described herein, and it will also be understood by persons skilled in the art that the embodiments described herein are intended to use any other suitable standards that are developed in the future. The wireless link connecting the communication subsystem  with the wireless network  represents one or more different Radio Frequency (RF) channels, operating according to defined protocols specified for GSM, GPRS, EDGE, or UMTS, and optionally other network communications. With newer network protocols, these channels are capable of supporting both circuit switched voice communications and packet switched data communications.","Other wireless networks can also be associated with the communication device  in variant implementations. The different types of wireless networks that can be employed include, for example, data-centric wireless networks, voice-centric wireless networks, and dual-mode networks that can support both voice and data communications over the same physical base stations. Combined dual-mode networks include, but are not limited to, Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) or CDMA2000 networks, GSM\/GPRS networks, third-generation (3G) networks like EDGE, HSPA, HSPA+, EVDO and UMTS, or fourth-generation (4G) networks such as LTE and LTE Advanced. Some other examples of data-centric networks include WiFi 802.11\u2122, Mobitex\u2122 and DataTAC\u2122 network communication systems. Examples of other voice-centric data networks include Personal Communication Systems (PCS) networks like GSM and Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) systems. The mobile device  may be provided with additional communication subsystems, such as the wireless LAN (WLAN) communication subsystem  also shown in . The WLAN communication subsystem may operate in accordance with a known network protocol such as one or more of the 802.11\u2122 family of standards developed by IEEE. The communication subsystem  may be separate from, or integrated with, the communication subsystem  or with the short-range communications module . The main processor  also interacts with additional subsystems such as a Random Access Memory (RAM) , a flash memory , a display , other data and memory access interfaces such as an auxiliary input\/output (I\/O) subsystem  or a data port , a keyboard , a speaker , a microphone , the short-range communications  and other device subsystems . The communication device may also be provided with an accelerometer , which may be used to detect gravity- or motion-induced forces and their direction. Detection of such forces applied to the device  may be processed to determine a response of the device , such as an orientation of a graphical user interface displayed on the display assembly  in response to a determination of the current orientation of the device .","In some embodiments, the user device  may comprise a touchscreen-based device, in which the display interface  is a touchscreen interface that provides both a display for communicating information and presenting graphical user interfaces, as well as an input subsystem for detecting user input that may be converted to instructions for execution by the device . The touchscreen display interface  may be the principal user interface provided on the device , although in some embodiments, additional buttons, variously shown in the figures or a trackpad, or other input means may be provided. In one embodiment, a transmissive TFT LCD screen  is overlaid with a clear touch sensor assembly  that supports single and multi-touch actions such as tap, double-tap, tap and hold, tap and drag, scroll, press, flick, and pinch. The touchscreen display interface  detects these single and multi-touch actions, for example through the generation of a signal or signals in response to a touch, which may then be processed by the processor  or by an additional processor or processors in the device  to determine the location of the touch action, whether defined by horizontal and vertical screen position data or other position data. Touch location data may include an area of contact or a single point of contact, such as a point at or near a center of the area of contact. The touchscreen display interface  may be provided with separate horizontal and vertical sensors or detectors to assist in identifying the location of a touch. A signal is provided to the controller , shown in , in response to detection of a touch. The controller  and\/or the processor  may detect a touch by any suitable contact member on the touch-sensitive display .","Some of the subsystems of the communication device  perform communication-related functions, whereas other subsystems can provide \u201cresident\u201d or on-device functions. By way of example, the display  and the keyboard  can be used for both communication-related functions, such as entering a text message for transmission over the network , and device-resident functions such as a calculator or task list.","A rendering circuit  is included in the device . When a user specifies that a data file is to be viewed on the display , the rendering circuit  analyzes and processes the data file for visualization on the display . Rendering data files originally optimized or prepared for visualization on large-screen displays on a portable electronic device display often requires additional processing prior to visualization on the small-screen portable electronic device displays. This additional processing may be accomplished by the rendering engine . As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art, the rendering engine can be implemented in hardware, software, or a combination thereof, and can comprise a dedicated image processor and associated circuitry, or can be implemented within main processor .","The communication device  can send and receive communication signals over the wireless network  after required network registration or activation procedures have been completed. Network access is associated with a subscriber or user of the communication device . To identify a subscriber, the communication device  requires a SIM\/RUIM card  (i.e. Subscriber Identity Module or a Removable User Identity Module) or another suitable identity module to be inserted into a SIM\/RUIM interface  in order to communicate with a network. The SIM\/RUIM card  is one type of a conventional \u201csmart card\u201d that can be used to identify a subscriber of the communication device  and to personalize the communication device , among other things. Without the SIM\/RUIM card , the communication device  is not fully operational for communication with the wireless network . By inserting the SIM\/RUIM card  into the SIM\/RUIM interface , a subscriber can access all subscribed services. Services can include: web browsing and messaging such as e-mail, voice mail, Short Message Service (SMS), and Multimedia Messaging Services (MMS). More advanced services can include: point of sale, field service and sales force automation. The SIM\/RUIM card  includes a processor and memory for storing information. Once the SIM\/RUIM card  is inserted into the SIM\/RUIM interface , it is coupled to the main processor . In order to identify the subscriber, the SIM\/RUIM card  can include some user parameters such as an International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI). An advantage of using the SIM\/RUIM card  is that a subscriber is not necessarily bound by any single physical mobile device. The SIM\/RUIM card  can store additional subscriber information for a mobile device as well, including datebook (or calendar) information and recent call information. Alternatively, user identification information can also be programmed into the flash memory .","The communication device  may be a battery-powered device including a battery interface  for receiving one or more rechargeable batteries . In at least some embodiments, the battery  can be a smart battery with an embedded microprocessor. The battery interface  is coupled to a regulator (not shown), which assists the battery  in providing power V+ to the communication device . Although current technology makes use of a battery, future technologies such as micro fuel cells can provide the power to the communication device .","The communication device  also includes an operating system  and software components  to  which are described in more detail below. The operating system  and the software components  to  that are executed by the main processor  are typically stored in a persistent store such as the flash memory , which can alternatively be a read-only memory (ROM) or similar storage element (not shown). Those skilled in the art will appreciate that portions of the operating system  and the software components  to , such as specific device applications, or parts thereof, can be temporarily loaded into a volatile store such as the RAM . Other software components can also be included, as is well known to those skilled in the art.","The subset of software applications  that control basic device operations, including data and voice communication applications, will normally be installed on the communication device  during its manufacture. Other software applications include a message application  that can be any suitable software program that allows a user of the communication device  to send and receive electronic messages. Various alternatives exist for the message application  as is well known to those skilled in the art. Messages that have been sent or received by the user are typically stored in the flash memory  of the communication device  or some other suitable storage element in the communication device . In at least some embodiments, some of the sent and received messages can be stored remotely from the device  such as in a data store of an associated host system that the communication device  communicates with.","The software applications can further include a device state module , a Personal Information Manager (PIM) , and other suitable modules (not shown). The device state module  provides persistence, i.e. the device state module  ensures that important device data is stored in persistent memory, such as the flash memory , so that the data is not lost when the communication device  is turned off or loses power.","The PIM  includes functionality for organizing and managing data items of interest to the user, such as, but not limited to, e-mail, contacts, calendar events, voice mails, appointments, and task items. A PIM application has the ability to send and receive data items via the wireless network . PIM data items can be seamlessly integrated, synchronized, and updated via the wireless network  with the mobile device subscriber's corresponding data items stored and\/or associated with a host computer system. This functionality creates a mirrored host computer on the communication device  with respect to such items. This can be particularly advantageous when the host computer system is the mobile device subscriber's office computer system. Some or all of the data items stored at the communication device  may be indexed for searching on the device  either through a corresponding application, such as the PIM , or another suitable module. In addition, the items may be searchable using a unified search process implemented in the device operating system . For example, application data items can be encapsulated in a searchable entity class and registered with a unified search engine on the device  that executes searches against all registered data repositories on the device based on received queries. The search engine can also be configured to invoke a search process of external resources, such as Internet search engines or remote databases.","The communication device  also includes a connect module , and an information technology (IT) policy module . The connect module  implements the communication protocols that are required for the communication device  to communicate with the wireless infrastructure and any host system, such as an enterprise system, that the communication device  is authorized to interface with.","The connect module  includes a set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that can be integrated with the communication device  to allow the communication device  to use any number of services associated with the enterprise system or with other systems accessible over the network . The connect module  allows the communication device  to establish an end-to-end secure, authenticated communication pipe with the host system. A subset of applications for which access is provided by the connect module  can be used to pass IT policy commands from the host system to the communication device . This can be done in a wireless or wired manner. These instructions can then be passed to the IT policy module  to modify the configuration of the device . Alternatively, in some cases, the IT policy update can also be done over a wired connection.","Other types of software applications can also be installed on the communication device . These software applications can be third party applications, which are added after the manufacture of the communication device . Examples of third party applications include games, calculators, utilities, etc.","The additional applications can be loaded onto the communication device  through at least one of the wireless network , the auxiliary I\/O subsystem , the data port , the short-range communications subsystem , or any other suitable device subsystem . This flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of the communication device  and can provide enhanced on-device functions, communication-related functions, or both. For example, secure communication applications can enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using the communication device .","The data port  enables a subscriber to set preferences through an external device or software application and extends the capabilities of the communication device  by providing for information or software downloads to the communication device  other than through a wireless communication network. The alternate download path can, for example, be used to load an encryption key onto the communication device  through a direct and thus reliable and trusted connection to provide secure device communication. The data port  can be any suitable port that enables data communication between the communication device  and another computing device. The data port  can be a serial or a parallel port. In some instances, the data port  can be a USB port that includes data lines for data transfer and a supply line that can provide a charging current to charge the battery  of the communication device .","The short-range communications subsystem  provides for communication between the communication device  and different systems or devices, without the use of the wireless network . For example, the subsystem  can include an infrared device and associated circuits and components for short-range communication. Examples of short-range communication standards include standards developed by the Infrared Data Association (IrDA), Bluetooth\u2122, and the 802.11\u2122 family of standards.","In use, a received signal such as a text message, an e-mail message, or web page download will be processed by the communication subsystem  and input to the main processor . The main processor  will then process the received signal for output to the display  or alternatively to the auxiliary I\/O subsystem . A subscriber can also compose data items, such as e-mail messages, for example, using the keyboard  in conjunction with the display  and possibly the auxiliary I\/O subsystem . The auxiliary subsystem  can include devices such as: a touchscreen, mouse, track ball, infrared fingerprint detector, or a roller wheel with dynamic button pressing capability. The keyboard  may be an alphanumeric keyboard and\/or telephone-type keypad. However, other types of keyboards can also be used. A composed item can be transmitted over the wireless network  through the communication subsystem . It will be appreciated that if the display  comprises a touchscreen, then the auxiliary subsystem  may still comprise one or more of the devices identified above.","For voice communications, the overall operation of the communication device  is substantially similar, except that the received signals are output to the speaker , and signals for transmission are generated by the microphone . Alternative voice or audio I\/O subsystems, such as a voice message recording subsystem, can also be implemented on the communication device . Although voice or audio signal output is accomplished primarily through the speaker , the display  can also be used to provide additional information such as the identity of a calling party, duration of a voice call, or other voice call related information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["104","104","150","152","154","156","158","160","104","200","100"]},"Signals received by the antenna  through the wireless network  are input to the receiver , which can perform such common receiver functions as signal amplification, frequency down conversion, filtering, channel selection, and analog-to-digital (A\/D) conversion. A\/D conversion of a received signal allows more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding to be performed in the DSP . In a similar manner, signals to be transmitted are processed, including modulation and encoding, by the DSP . These DSP-processed signals are input to the transmitter  for digital-to-analog (D\/A) conversion, frequency up conversion, filtering, amplification and transmission over the wireless network  via the antenna . The DSP  not only processes communication signals, but also provides for receiver and transmitter control. For example, the gains applied to communication signals in the receiver  and the transmitter  can be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP .","The wireless link between the communication device  and the wireless network  can contain one or more different channels, typically different RF channels, and associated protocols used between the communication device  and the wireless network . An RF channel is a limited resource that should be conserved, typically due to limits in overall bandwidth and limited battery power of the communication device . When the communication device  is fully operational, the transmitter  is typically keyed or turned on only when it is transmitting to the wireless network  and is otherwise turned off to conserve resources. Similarly, the receiver  is periodically turned off to conserve power until it is needed to receive signals or information (if at all) during designated time periods. Other communication subsystems, such as the WLAN communication subsystem  shown in , may be provided with similar components as those described above configured for communication over the appropriate frequencies and using the appropriate protocols.","When operating the communication device , the user may wish to have e-mail messages retrieved for delivery to the communication device . The message application  operating on the communication device  can also request messages associated with the user's account over the network . The message application  can be configured (either by the user or by an administrator, possibly in accordance with an organization's IT policy) to make this request at the direction of the user, at some pre-defined time interval, or upon the occurrence of some pre-defined event. In some implementations, the communication device  is assigned its own e-mail address, and messages addressed specifically to the communication device  are automatically redirected to the communication device  as they are received by a message server.","A computing device such as the communication device  described above, which as noted previously may comprise any one of a number of different types of data processing or communication devices, may be controllable by the user by means of one or more user input systems, such as a user input device or interface, including without limitation the keyboard , display  where the display is comprised in a touchscreen interface, microphone , trackball, buttons, trackpad, scroll wheel, and the like. These user input devices may be external to the computing device itself; for example, a pointing device such as a mouse, trackball, tablet or touchpad may be provided as a peripheral component. In the case of a mobile device such as a smartphone or tablet computer, the user input devices or interfaces are advantageously incorporated into the computing device itself, rather than provided as an external device. These various user input devices and interfaces may be actuated by the user (for example, through the application of touch or pressure) to control the operation of the computing device, for example to navigate through graphical user interfaces, menu structures, and the like, to select and initiate application or operating system commands for execution, and to input data for processing or transmission by the computing device. User input received via the input interfaces or devices may thus be used to control the operation of an application, or to change settings on the computing device.","For example, applications available for execution on the computing device may include messaging applications for use in association with the email, voice mail, SMS and MMS services mentioned above, as well as for use with other network messaging services, including both server-based and peer-to-peer messaging. Other PIM applications may also be provided, and may be integrated with location-based services. User input may thus be used not only to compose messages for transmission from the computing device, but also to initiate transmission, and to retrieve and present messages at the computing device via an output interface (such as via the display  or speaker ). Similarly, user input may be used to compose, save, transmit and retrieve for display calendar-based data objects such as appointments, meeting invitations, tasks, and alarms.","Other examples of applications that may be available for execution on the device can include media players for playback of music or sound files, video files, as well as viewers or readers for presentation of text information, such as e-book applications. The user may select files for display or playback, by way of input commands. For example, menu commands or graphical user interface elements may be selected and actuated in order to instruct a media player to change tracks.","The data retrieved and rendered for presentation to the user may be stored in local storage at the computing device, for example in flash memory . In some cases, the data may be streamed from a remote location, such as a web server or media server accessible over a wireless or fixed network. Other applications on the device, such as browser applications or mapping and geolocation applications, may also retrieve data over a network in response to user commands.","Other operations that may be carried out at the computing device include alteration of settings, such as audio and visual notification preferences. For example, a user may wish to change the audio, visual or vibrate ringer notifications for incoming telephone calls or change audio, visual or vibrate notifications for incoming messages. As a specific example, a user may wish to turn off the audio ringer notification and switch to a vibrate ringer notification. The foregoing examples of applications, user commands, and other operations are non-exhaustive. Other tasks, operations, and applications that may be implemented on computing devices such as the exemplary mobile communication device described above will be known to those skilled in the art.","During use, the various user input systems typically consume a small amount of power from the battery  or other computing device power source. To preserve battery life or otherwise reduce power consumption by the computing device, the device may enter into a \u201csleep\u201d mode (or \u201cstandby\u201d or \u201cinactive\u201d mode), in which certain functions of the computing device or its peripherals are halted or suspended pending reactivation by the user. For example, in a personal computer including a separate processor unit, monitor, keyboard and pointing device, after a predetermined period of inactivity (e.g., a period of time during which no user input is received) detected by the computer's processor, a signal may be sent to the monitor to enter into a screen saver mode, reducing its power consumption, or to enter a sleep mode, in which it receives little to no power. In addition to automatically entering sleep mode after a timeout is detected in this manner, the computer may be expressly placed in sleep mode through a user command, for example invocation of a menu option, a predefined keystroke combination, movement of a cursor (by means of a pointing device) to a particular location on the display, and so forth. The processor itself may also halt certain processes or disk (or other local storage) activity until a signal is received from the user to \u201cwake up\u201d, or to reactivate the various processes or the monitor. The signal may be received from one of the user input interface devices, such as the keyboard or the pointing device; for example, clicking a button on the pointing device, or depressing a key on the keyboard, may be sufficient to \u201cwake up\u201d the computer and reactivate the monitor and other processes.","Similarly, in computing devices with integrated displays  (such as in a smartphone or tablet computer) to conserve power the device may be configured to enter a sleep mode in which the screen is blanked, either automatically upon detection of a period of inactivity or in response to an express command. The screen may be reactivated upon detection of an input received via a user input interface that may also be integrated into the device, such as the keypad or a convenience key. In the case of a computing device equipped with a touchscreen display, one of the primary user input interfaces may be the touchscreen interface. The entire touchscreen interface, including the display component as well as the touch-sensitive component of the interface, may be inactivated in sleep mode to reduce power consumption. Other user input interfaces on the device, such as optical joysticks, trackballs, scroll wheels, capacitive components such as touchpads and buttons, keyboards, and other buttons utilizing other types of switch technology, may also be configured to be inactivated while in sleep mode, leaving only select ones of the input interfaces sufficiently powered (i.e., active) to detect a user input. When a user input is detected via one of those active input interfaces, the processor  can then be signalled to reactivate the other input interfaces on the device and return the device to an awake and operative state.","In a simple embodiment, the sleep mode simply conserves power. Sleep mode may be combined with a secure or locked state that enhances the security of the device, by making the device's functions or data, or both, accessible only if the correct security code, such as a PIN or password, has been entered by the user. The security code may be an alphanumeric key that may be input using the keyboard  or a virtual keyboard displayed on a touchscreen interface, or it may be a defined sequence of user manipulation of various input mechanisms (for example, a particular sequence of button presses). In the case of a computing device with a touchscreen or touchpad interface, the security code may be one or more gestures or symbols traced on the touchscreen or touchpad surface, and detected by sensing the contact or pressure by the interface. Correct entry of the security code places the device in an insecure state in which the device's data and functions are accessible.","This secure or locked state may include activating of content protection on the device, if content protection is enabled. The PIN or password, or a value derived from the security code, can be used to encrypt user data stored on the device as well. For example, the security code or a value derived therefrom may be used to decrypt an encryption key stored at the computing device, which can then be stored in temporary memory and used to decrypt encrypted data and encrypt plaintext data during the current session. Again, after a period of user input inactivity or in response to an instruction, the device may enter the secure state, in which any unencrypted data that is marked for content protection is encrypted, and the encryption key (and the security code, if it is still stored in memory) deleted from memory. In addition, the secure state can be combined with the sleep mode; upon the expiry of the period of inactivity or upon receipt of an express instruction, the computing device not only enters the secure state, but the display  may also be blanked, and power may be cut off or reduced to other user input and output interfaces. Thus, when the user subsequently wishes to use the computing device, the user must again input the security code to obtain access to functions or data on the device. Further, where the user input interface used for entering the security code has been powered down in sleep mode, this particular user input interface must also be woken up, i.e., powered up and placed in a state in which it can receive user input. In the secure state, then, access to at least some functions or data\u2014whether the functionality of one of the user input interfaces, the functionality of an application normally executable on the device, or access to the data stored on the device\u2014is disabled or inactivated, and some or all of these disabled or inactivated features are not accessible until the appropriate security code has been received and verified by the device. When the appropriate security code has been received and verified, and full access to functions and data is available, the device is typically considered to be in an \u201cunlocked\u201d or insecure state. Techniques for verifying security codes and the like will be known to those skilled in the art.","Despite the advantages of providing a computing device that can be transitioned to a secure or locked state, there may be attendant inconveniences to users wishing to obtain quick access to select device features. An example of a prior art process that may be implemented on a computing device such as a smartphone is illustrated in . The smartphone is initially in a locked state, with a user input interface (such as the keyboard ) in a powered down or disabled state. If a user wishes to operate the device, the user input interface must first be enabled at block , for example by detecting actuation of a designated button or other user interface component on the device; the device must then receive via the user input interface the password or other security code at ; the input password or other security code must then be verified at . Upon verification, the device is transitioned to an insecure or unlocked state in which access to functions and\/or data is permitted, at which stage the device can receive a navigation command at , if necessary, so that the user can select a target application for launch at . As two non-limiting examples, the target application may be a messaging application or a media player application. The application that is selected is then launched at . At , the device then receives an input command from the user via a user input interface; the input command may be received at a keyboard, trackpad, scroll wheel, or any other suitable interface. For example, the command may be a command to display the most recently received message, or it may be a command to select a particular track for playback. At , the command is passed to the application for execution. The navigation command, the selection of the target application, or application launch may not be required; for example, if an application is already executing at the device when it transitions to the unlocked state, the user interface for the application may already be displayed in the device, and the device may be ready to receive commands to execute using that application. If the application is executing in the background, selection of the appropriate target application and retrieval and rendering of the user interface screen associated with that application may be necessary, although it will not be necessary to launch the application. Even if one or more of those steps is omitted, it can be seen that the process for a user to initiate a change to a state of a given application is onerous; the user input interface must be enabled if it is disabled, a password or other security code must be input; and at least one further input is required, such as input of the command to be passed to the application.","Further, even once these steps are complete and the user has effected the desired operation, the device remains in the unlocked state until a timeout condition is reached (by a period of user inactivity) or until an express command is received to lock the device, as represented by block . Finally, the device then transitions to the locked state at . If the user neglects to invoke the lock command, then the device remains insecure for at least some brief period of time, which increases the risk of unauthorized access. This is particularly undesirable when content protection on the device is employed on the device, and is disabled while the device is in the unlocked state, since unauthorized users may gain access to decrypted data.","Therefore, the device may be configured to carry out operations in response to a plurality of input security codes in a manner that bypasses the need for additional stages of user input to navigate, select target applications, enter commands, and so forth. A plurality of security codes is defined, and associated with sets or subsets of data or functions available on the device. Referring to , security codes such as passwords may be associated as follows: a first password  may be associated with all data and applications or functions on the computing device , such as PIM data and applications  (e.g., message stores, address books, calendar stores, and the like), as well as device settings  (such as ring tones), third-party applications  (such as social networking applications, mapping and geolocation applications, and other applications that may not be provided as a native application or operating system function); and files  that may be stored on an expansion card or other storage medium provided on the device. A second password  would be associated with only device settings , while a third password  is associated with only third-party applications , and a fourth password  is associated with files . These examples are non-limiting; there may be additional passwords, and indeed any one of the additional passwords , ,  may be associated with multiple sets of functions or data. For example, the third password  may be associated not only with third-party applications , but also with files . Further, each of these security codes may be associated with a command associated with its corresponding data set. For example, while the first password  may simply comprise a password that is used to gain access to all data and functions on the device, the second password  may be associated specifically with a command to alter a specific device setting , such as a ringtone or other visual, aural, tactile or other indicator used to alert the user to an event such as receipt of a new message or telephone call. The third password  may be associated with a command to launch a specific application, while the fourth password  is associated with a specific file and a command to launch an application for viewing the file.  illustrates an alternative association between diverse passwords , , ,  and the same data, applications and functions identified in . In this example, the additional passwords ,  are also associated with multiple sets of data or actions; the second password  is associated with both PIM data  and device settings , while the fourth password  is associated with the PIM data  and files .","Each of these security codes and their associated command is stored in a storage device, such as flash memory or other non-volatile memory, at the computing device . Thus, while the device is in locked mode, it may receive an input security code sequence. Upon receipt of the input sequence, the device validates the input sequence by comparing the sequence to the stored security codes. If one of the security codes match, that input sequence is validated, and the corresponding command is then retrieved and executed at the device. Thus, the user need not navigate any menu structure or select a particular application or file; the device can automatically carry out the desired operation associated with the input security code without awaiting further user input. Further, the device may remain in a locked state, in which user interface access to data or functions is still restricted; for example, as soon as the desired operation is carried out, the device may return to the original locked state. Alternatively, while the desired operation is carried out at the computing device, all other functions or data remain in a restricted state, and then once execution of the command is completed, the device returns to the original locked state. In this way, the inherent risk of the device remaining unlocked is reduced.","Each of the security codes , , ,  may be different. However, this increases the burden on the user to memorize a number of different passwords. Thus, in a further embodiment, the various security codes , , ,  each comprise at least an authentication code, and optionally a command code. The authentication code remains consistent for each of the security codes, and only the command code portion will differ between each security code. Further, the command code may also comprise an argument that can be passed to an application or to the device's operating system. Examples of authentication codes and command codes are illustrated in Table 1, below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Command","Authentication",{}]},{"entry":["Code","Code","Command"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["t1, t2 . . . tn","lrU73","skip to track 1, 2 . . . n of the current"]},{"entry":[{},{},"album being played by a media player"]},{"entry":["sh","lrU73","play songs in shuffle mode"]},{"entry":["n","lrU73","play next song in playlist\/album"]},{"entry":["s","lrU73","change device setting to silent mode"]},{"entry":["v","lrU73","change device setting to vibrate mode"]},{"entry":["m","lrU73","view newly received message"]},{"entry":["fb","lrU73","launch social networking application"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Thus, for example, when the device is in a locked state and the user wishes to switch the device to a \u201csilent\u201d mode, in which ringers and other audible or vibratory notification mechanisms are disabled, the user may enter, using an appropriate user input interface, the security code string \u201cslrU73\u201d. When the device detects the input security code the \u201cs\u201d is interpreted as a command to change the device notification setting to silent mode, and the \u201clrU73\u201d portion of the security code is verified to confirm that the user entering the security code has sufficient authorization to do so. Other command codes may be associated with other applications or instructions; in this example, entering \u201ct1lrU73\u201d comprises an instruction to be passed to a media player application to skip to track 1 of an album or playlist that is currently being played back by the device. The security code \u201ct1lrU73\u201d thus includes a command code that has a command portion, \u201ct\u201d, as well as an argument, \u201c1\u201d, that may be passed to the executing media player application. The command code is thus associated with a media player application, and the command comprises an instruction to play a media file associated with the command code. The structure of the security codes can be such that the command portion and optionally the argument is included either at beginning or the end of the security code string, or inserted within the string.","As another example, while the device is locked, the device may still be configured to alert the user to the receipt of a new message. This alert may take the form of an audible, visual, or vibratory notification; for example, the device may be configured to vibrate, cause a light emitting diode to flash in a different colour, or display a special icon in a graphical user interface in the display . Normally, to view the newly received message, the user must unlock the device, invoke the messaging application, and select the newly received message for viewing. In this embodiment, however, while the device is locked, the user may simply type in the security code \u201cmlrU73\u201d. The \u201cm\u201d portion is then interpreted by the device as a command code associated with launch of the messaging application (or with displaying the messaging application user interface screen, if the messaging application is already executing on the device), and the \u201clrU73\u201d authentication code is used to verify that the user has sufficient authorization to access data on the device. The command code is thus associated with the messaging application and comprises an instruction to display a newly received message using the messaging application. Upon verification, the device may then invoke the messaging application and automatically display the newly received message. When the viewer is finished viewing the message, the user may dismiss the message view (i.e., remove the message from the display) by actuating a user interface element (for example, by pressing an escape key or return key on the device, or by actuating a user interface element such as an \u201cOK\u201d or \u201cClose\u201d button displayed on the display ). When the message is dismissed, the device returns to the locked or restricted mode.","As another example, a user may wish to access a social networking service using an application on the device to compose a post or message for sending to the service. Thus, entering the code \u201cfblrU73\u201d is interpreted by the device as a command to invoke an associated social networking application, and to launch a view of the application for text entry. The command code is thus associated with a social networking application, and the command comprises an instruction to display a text input user interface for composing a message for sending using the social networking application. When the user is finished with text entry and initiates transmission of the message to the social networking service, the application can automatically close, and the device can then return to the locked mode. In this way, the user is not required to remember to lock the device when finished using the application. In each case, the device may also close the application after a period of inactivity and return in the locked state.","Finally, as a further non-limiting example, the command code may be associated with a computing device setting such as ringtone or other visual, aural, tactile or other indicator used to alert the user to an event such as receipt of a new message or telephone call, or another setting such as a battery conservation state, display backlight setting, and the like, and the command itself may comprise an instruction to change the computing device setting to a different value.","In these examples, each of the command codes and the authentication code are alphanumeric codes. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the command code can be appended to either the beginning or the end of the authentication code. In still another embodiment, the command code is inserted within the authentication code. Further, while the exemplary authentication code used above is a mix of lower case and upper case alphabetic characters as well as numeric characters, a simpler code could be used; for example, the authentication code may be a simple string of numbers or lower case letters. Typically, when the user enters a security code, which can be done for example at a keyboard or a touchscreen of the computing device, the user signifies that the entire security code has been input by pressing a return or enter key (on a keyboard) or by actuating a user interface element, such as an \u201cOK\u201d or \u201csubmit\u201d button displayed on a device display .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 6"],"b":["170","100","134","136","103","185","180","100","600","605","610","170","180"]},"If either the command codes or authentication codes used at the computing device are of constant length (for example, all permitted authentication codes may be limited to four or six characters, or else all permitted command codes may be three characters long), then the security module , when parsing the input security code, can split the input string into its constituent command and authentication codes. Parsing the string may simply require splitting the input string at a predefined offset, where the length of either the command code, the command code with optional argument, or authentication code is already known. If the command code (and optional argument) is inserted within the authentication code, then again if the offset of the command code within the authentication code string is known, and if the length of the command code, command code with optional argument, or authentication code is known, then the security code may be parsed by splitting the input string into its constituent parts. The authentication code portion may be formed by concatenating the portions of the authentication code that preceded and followed the command code.","However, if both codes may be of varying length, the input security code may also comprise a delimiter to distinguish between the two components of the code. For example, rather than \u201cfblrU73\u201d, the security code may include the delimiter \u201c00\u201d, so the device can parse the input security code by splitting the input code at the \u201c00\u201d.","At , it is determined by the security module  whether the authentication code received in the security code matches the stored authentication code. If there is no match, then the device is maintained in its locked state, and no command is executed. If the authentication code does match, then at  the security module  determines whether the security code comprised a command code. If there was no command code, then the input security code comprised only the authentication code. Thus, the security module  causes the device to transition to an unlocked state, in which access to all data in the data store , programs  and other functions is permitted, at . In this state, the device does not return to the locked state unless there is a user inactivity timeout or an express command to re-enter the locked state, as described above.","If, however, a command code is found in the security code, then at  the command code is parsed if necessary, for example if the code includes an argument to be passed in an instruction to an application. At , the command is executed.","Executing the command may involve the execution of further steps on the device. Turning to , the command identified by the command code is matched to a target application at . This may comprise using the command code to look up an identifier of an associated application stored at the device. Once the target application is identified, it is determined whether the application is already executing on the device. If the target application is already executing on the device, the command may be passed for example by way of a process-to-process communication technique, as is known to a person skilled in the art, to the executing application, at . For example, if a command is detected to instruct a media player application to skip to the next song in a playlist and the media player application is already executing, on the device, the command to skip to the next song is passed to the executing music player application. Alternatively, if the target application of the command is not already executing, the application may be launched and the command passed to the application once launched at .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","802","810","800","806","804","810","812","820","822","824","800","800"]},"If, however, the security code  received at the device includes a command code as well as the authentication code, and both are valid, then the device transitions to a second locked state , in which state the device is able to carry out the operation or command identified by the command code. Thus, it will be appreciated that while the user may not actually have user interface access to functions or data such that data is actually viewable on the device, or such that menu or navigation options or a graphical user interface is accessible on the device, limited access to data or functions is made available by means of the command passed directly to the application associated with the command. In some cases, this application is currently executing on the device; thus, the limited access provided in the second locked state  is limited access only to that data or those functions associated with that currently executing application. Further, this limited access may terminate upon completion of the execution of the command, at which point the device transitions automatically to the original locked state .","As mentioned above, content protection may be implemented at the device such that data stored on the device is encrypted while the device is in the locked state. The encrypted data may be decrypted as needed when the device is in the unlocked state. Not all data stored at the computing device need be encrypted. For example, music and other media files may be stored unencrypted, while other data of a potentially more sensitive nature, such as PIM data, is stored in encrypted form. Also, messages that are received at the device may be encrypted after receipt, but prior to storage.","Also as mentioned above, the security code input at the device, or a value derived from the security code, may be used to decrypt the data, or to decrypt an encryption key to be used to decrypt the data. If the security code comprises at least an authentication code, the authentication code may be used to decrypt data or decrypt the encryption key. This additional content protection enhancement is illustrated in the flowchart of ; if, after receipt of an input security code, the authentication code is verified at  and there is no command code found at , then the device is transitioned to the unlocked state at . In this unlocked state, content protection may be disabled, i.e., the encryption key may be obtained by the device and used to decrypt any encrypted data required for the operation of the device. When the device returns to the locked state, content protection is enabled again, and any unencrypted data that is intended to be stored in encrypted form is re-encrypted.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["800","902","910","910","900","906","904","908","910","912","920","920","900","922","924"]},"If, however, the security code  received at the device includes a command code as well as the authentication code, and both are valid, then the device transitions to a second locked state , in which state the device is able to carry out the operation or command identified by the command code. If the required data to carry out the operation or command is encrypted, content protection must also be disabled so that the encrypted data can be decrypted for use by the device. However, to enhance the security of the device in this state, the user still may not have user interface access to functions or data such that data is actually viewable on the device, or such that menu or navigation options or a graphical user interface is accessible on the device. Rather, as with the second locked state  described above, limited access to data or functions is provided only because the command identified by the command code is passed directly to the application associated with the command. This locked state  differs from the locked state  in that the device may be able to decrypt encrypted data necessary for executing the command. Once the command execution is completed, however, the device returns to the original locked state , and content protection is again enabled, with any unencrypted data being re-encrypted. If decryption of encrypted data is not required to execute the command, however, content protection may not be disabled in the locked state . The locked state  would then resemble the locked state  of .","By allowing select commands to be executed on the device, especially in connection with applications that are invocable or already executing on the device, inconvenience to the user is reduced. Applications on the device, such as a music player or social networking applications are often interactive or operate in a real-time manner. For example, with social networking applications, a user may wish to transmit updates on his or her current activities to a social network, simultaneously with the occurrence of those activities. The security codes described herein reduce the potential delay incurred in unlocking a device, navigating to the appropriate application, and selecting the correct options so as to be able to post a status update using a social networking application.","The various command codes described above may be preset in the operating system of the device, or may alternatively be configurable by the user. Advantageously these command codes may be stored at the device separately from the authentication code, since the authentication code portion may be changed on a regular or irregular basis according to the user's security needs or security policies implemented for the computing device. Alternatively, security codes comprising both the authentication code and the command code portions are stored at the device for each different authentication code or command code (with optional argument). If the authentication code portion is later changed, then the security codes can be recomputed to use the new authentication code and re-stored at the device. The same command codes, however, may be used in connection with different authentication codes. In other embodiments, a given computing device may be used by multiple users, each with their own authentication code; however, the same command codes may be used by each user as described above, in connection with their respective authentication codes.","The systems and methods disclosed herein are presented only by way of example and are not meant to limit the scope of the subject matter described herein.
