title: Query language
abstract: Novel methods for expressing paths contained in queries are provided. The path expressions are composed from tokens selected from the group consisting of object identifiers, attribute identifiers, a relationship operator, and path qualifiers. Path expressions can be more easily created than by creating the path expressions directly in SQL. The path expressions can easily be incorporated into queries for querying data structured according to an object model. Examples of such queries include queries for implementing rules for checking data corresponding to IT infrastructures to see if the IT infrastructure is compliant with policies created for the IT infrastructure.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present disclosure relates generally to searching collections of data. For example, inventive matter disclosed herein includes ways of expressing paths contained in queries useful for querying the collections of data.","Advances in computer technology, such as microprocessor speed, memory and storage capacity, data transfer bandwidth, and software functionality, provide for an increasing amount of electronic data to be collected and stored. As the amount of this electronic data grows, it becomes increasingly important to store the data in a manner that provides for data searches and retrieval. A common approach is to store the electronic data in a structured manner in one or more databases. For example, database designers can structure the data according to a model using data modeling languages, such as the Entity Relationship Model and the Unified Data Model Language. Such models can represent the data in terms of entities and relationships. In particular examples, the model used to structure the data is referred to as an object model.","Typically, database designers create a database management system (\u201cDBMS\u201d) to facilitate the searching and retrieval of data stored in the one or more structured databases. The DBMS provides a query language that provides a means for users to construct queries in order to access the data in the one or more databases. For example, Structured Query Language (\u201cSQL\u201d) allows users to create SQL queries to search structured databases.","Conventional systems providing access to data in a database, such as systems that help a user perform analysis of the data in the database, commonly provide an application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) that enables a user to query the database. The API may provide the user with access to some or all of the functionality provided by an underlying DBMS. Accordingly, the user typically formulates queries for querying the database using a query language such as SQL.","One example of such a system is a compliance-analysis system. Compliance-analysis systems performing compliance analysis on data in a configuration-management database (\u201cCMDB\u201d) enable a respective user to create a rule and perform certain functions such as compliancy checks. For example, conventional compliance-analysis systems can be used to ensure that a resource in an information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) infrastructure, such as a client computer, is compliant with a data security regulatory rule. If the client computer is not compliant, the conventional compliance-analysis system can provide notification to an IT administrator regarding the violation.","Conventional compliance-analysis systems commonly provide an application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) that enables a user (e.g., an IT administrator) to query a configuration-management database (\u201cCMDB\u201d) to help the user detect violations of compliance policies. Typically, the user queries the CMDB using a query language such as SQL.","Users can have difficulty working with a system that provides the user with a SQL API or a SQL-like API. SQL queries can be difficult for users to work with for at least two reasons. First, because of the verbosity of SQL, SQL queries tend to be long and SQL queries tend to contain a significant amount of programming boilerplate that can be distracting and unfriendly to users. For example, SQL keywords, such as \u201cSELECT\u201d and \u201cFROM,\u201d can appear in every query. Second, SQL queries are non-sequential. An SQL query includes different clauses: \u201cSELECT,\u201d \u201cFROM,\u201d \u201cWHERE,\u201d etc. As an SQL query is constructed, each logical addition to the query may manifest in a plurality of the clauses. Thus, the construction of a SQL query does not have a sequential flow and the query is not read in the same order that it is written.","Conventional compliance-analysis systems are examples of systems that provide a user with SQL or SQL-like APIs. Although conventional compliance-analysis systems may provide tools that can be used to manage a set of rules and test for compliancy of an IT infrastructure to a policy as mentioned above, use of conventional compliance-analysis systems can be quite tedious and time-consuming, especially when used to manage IT infrastructures that include large groups of resources. A typical IT infrastructure can include various systems and resources such as IP networks, storage arrays, servers, and distributed applications, for example. In conventional compliance-analysis systems, users typically implement compliancy rules using SQL queries that are constructed by the users of the conventional compliance-analysis system. SQL queries can be difficult for users to work with for at least the reasons discussed above.","Inventive matter disclosed herein deviates with respect to and improves upon conventional technology, such as discussed above, and other technology also known in the prior art. For example, embodiments of inventive matter disclosed herein enable users to create path expressions more easily than when using methods known in the prior art such as by creating the path expression in an SQL query. In query languages, a path expression identifies at least one object or attribute of at least one object by describing how to navigate to the at least one object or the attribute of at least one object. A path expression can be thought of as a traversal or sequence of steps for getting from a first object in an object model to other objects in the object model or to attributes of other objects in the object model. A path expression can also be thought of as linking a first object in the object model to other objects in the object model or to attributes of other objects in the object model.","Queries including path expressions in accordance with embodiments disclosed herein can be created for querying data structured in accordance with an object model. In particular embodiments, a system can receive input identifying at least one path, each path being from an object in an object model to a related object in the object model or to an attribute of a related object in the object model. The system can also create a path expression for each identified path, each path expression being composed from tokens selected from the group consisting of object identifiers, attribute identifiers, a relationship operator, and path qualifiers.","Embodiments of inventive matter disclosed herein enable users to easily and intuitively create compliance policies against a CMDB without having to use complex SQL-like APIs. Users are provided with a High-Level Query API into a CMDB that is not only general and powerful, the query interface also enables users to easily read, understand, and author queries into the CMDB.","Developers of compliance-analysis systems in accordance with embodiments disclosed herein do not necessarily need to replace conventional SQL-like APIs with the High-Level Query APIs disclosed herein. Thus, in particular embodiments, High-Level Query APIs as disclosed herein may operate on top of a conventional SQL-like API. That is, a user may interface with a High-Level Query API as disclosed herein and the High-Level Query API can interface with a convention SQL-like API. In other embodiments, the High-Level Query API may interface directly with the CMDB.","In particular embodiments, a compliance manager executing on a computer system has access to a repository of collected data. The collected data may be obtained as a result of direct or indirect queries to resources in a respective IT infrastructure. The collected data may also be obtained as a result of monitoring message information transmitted between resources in the IT infrastructure.","Based on input from a user, the compliance manager enables creation of policies and rules to test compliance of IT infrastructure resources via evaluation of the corresponding collected data. Each of one or more rules associated with a respective compliance policy for an IT infrastructure is defined by specifying three items: 1) the type of configuration items to which the rule is to be applied, 2) the rule scope that determines which configuration items of the configuration type are to be checked for compliance, and 3) a desired state that each configuration item checked must satisfy in order to be considered in compliance.","In embodiments disclosed herein, a compliance manager accumulates query fragments associated with the rule scope. The compliance manager also accumulates query fragments associated with the desired state of a rule. The compliance manager merges the accumulated query fragments into a query for applying the rule to data corresponding to the IT infrastructure being checked for compliance. At least one query fragment, the query, or both the query and the at least one query fragment, includes the path expression for at least one identified path.","Embodiments of inventive matter disclosed herein enable users to create path expressions more easily than when using methods know in the art. The syntax of path expressions disclosed herein allow users to incrementally build path expressions by choosing tokens of path expressions that can be sequentially added together to create the path expression. There are four different tokens that a user can select from in order to create a path expression. These four tokens are object identifiers (e.g., the name of an object), attribute identifiers (e.g., the name of an attribute), a relationship operator, and path qualifiers. In particular embodiments, a user can select a token either by selecting text associated with the token from a menu of displayed text or by entering text that represents the token.","Path expressions disclosed herein can be incorporated into queries that can be executed to query structured data. The present disclosure describes in some detail a particular application for path expressions and queries created in accordance with embodiments disclosed herein. That is, the present disclosure describes in some detail example embodiments (e.g., compliance manager and compliance rules) useful in compliance-analysis systems.","Accordingly, inventive matter disclosed herein provides for compliance rules. In particular embodiments of the inventive matter disclosed herein, an administrator for an IT infrastructure can interact with a compliance manager application to more easily create compliance rules and make the rules part of a policy to which a particular IT infrastructure may be expected to comply. The compliance manager can execute the rules to determine whether the IT infrastructure is in compliance with the policy.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["140","100","190","120","180","110","130","140","108"]},"The data collection manager  collects data (e.g., resource information) from resources, services, processes, switch applications, etc. operating and\/or present in the IT infrastructure . The IT infrastructure  can include one or more networks of sub-resources having data collected by data collection manager .","Data collection manager  can be configured to collect information in many different ways. For example, data collection manager  can initiate direct queries to resources in the respective IT infrastructure . Queries can include requests for configuration data associated with a queried resource. Responses to queries can include data such as version information associated with a particular application, vendor information, etc. associated with a queried resource. Data collection manager  then stores the received information in the CMDB  for application of compliance policies and corresponding rules. In particular embodiments, the received information is stored in the CMDB  in accordance with one or more object models.","Note that the data collection manager  can also retrieve information from resources based on indirect queries. For example, the data collection manager  can communicate with software agents that collect resource data on behalf of the data collection manager .","In addition to direct and indirect queries, the data collection manager  can also monitor connections or connectivity by monitoring message information transmitted between the resources present in the IT infrastructure . For example, the data collection manager  can be configured to analyze the message data transmitted in the IT infrastructure  and store appropriate information about different monitored connections in the CMDB .","Based on analyzing the message data, the data collection manager  can identify different types of information such as a protocol used to support communicates between applications, whether two or more applications communicate via encrypting data, types of information exchanged between the two or more, which applications communicate with each other, etc. The compliance manager  can apply rules to identify whether certain applications are allowed to communicate with each other or whether the applications communicate with each other using a proper protocol as specified by a rule.","In particular embodiments, the data collection manager  analyzes the collected data and stores the information as objects in the CMDB  in accordance with one or more object models. Each object in the CMDB  includes information associated with a respective resource in the IT infrastructure . Each object in the CMDB  may be referred to herein as a configuration item. Storage of the collected information (and\/or other derived information) can include classifying the information in one of three classes such as whether the resource information is associated with a host resource, a connection, or a service in the IT infrastructure . Although this classification is sufficient in particular embodiments to store information for an IT infrastructure, such as an IT infrastructure for a storage area network, this classification can be extended to any number of classes, sub-classes, etc.","In an example embodiment, the IT infrastructure  can include resources such as clients, servers, switches, storage devices, host resource, connections supporting communications between computer systems, services, etc. in IT infrastructure . A resource such as a client resource (e.g., a computer system) can be classified as a host resource. The computer system can support a number of applications such as operating systems, text editor applications, e-mail applications, etc. Upon collection of data associated with the sub-resources (e.g., operating system, text editors applications, etc.), the data collection manager  stores the information in objects. Each object (e.g., representing a resource or sub-resource) in the CMDB  includes information about the resource such as software version information, vendor information, computer system on which the application operates, etc.","In particular embodiments, the data collection manager  stores the information in the CMDB  as a hierarchical tree of information. Pointers associated with the objects indicate how the objects are related to each other.","In particular embodiments, the compliance manager , via a graphical user interface on the display screen , enables a respective user to create compliance policies and the compliance rules corresponding to the policies. In this manner, the compliance manager may receive input defining a compliance rule, wherein the input includes: 1) input identifying a configuration-item type, 2) input defining a scope of the compliance rule, and 3) input defining a desired state for each of the configuration items to be checked by the compliance rule.","A configuration item can be any object in the CMDB . The configuration-item type determines what type of configuration item to which the compliance rule applies. In particular embodiments, the identified configuration-item type will be one of three types: hosts, services, or connections.","The scope of the compliance rule determines which configuration items of the identified type are to be checked by the rule for compliance. The default rule scope is to apply the rule to all the configuration items of the identified configuration-item type. Typically, the compliance manager  receives input that narrows the scope of the compliance rule to some subset of the configuration items of the identified type. For example, in particular embodiments, the rule scope includes at least one conditional expression. The configuration items of the identified type that satisfy the at least one conditional expression are considered within the rule scope. However, if the received input does not narrow the rule scope, then the rule scope is to apply the compliance rule to all configuration items of the identified type.","During application of the compliance rule, each of the configuration items that fall within the rule scope will be checked by the compliance rule to see if the configuration item satisfies the defined desired state. The desired state includes at least one compliance condition that must be satisfied for a checked configuration item to be in compliance.","The compliance rules of a policy can be applied to the data in the CMDB  to check whether the IT infrastructure  is in compliance with the policy. The compliance manager applies a compliance rule to the data by first creating a query corresponding to the compliance rule and then executing the query to apply the compliance rule to the data corresponding to the IT infrastructure  (e.g., the data in the CMDB ) to determine compliance of the IT infrastructure .","To create the query corresponding to a compliance rule, the compliance manager  accumulates query fragments associated with the rule scope, accumulates query fragments associated with the desired state, and merges the accumulated query fragments into a query corresponding to the compliance rule. The accumulated query fragments with the rule scope may contain path expressions as defined herein and the accumulated query fragments associated with the desired state may contain path expressions as defined herein. Consequently, the query corresponding to the rule may contain path expressions as defined herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","140","130","200","204","202","108","204","202","200","108","206"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 4"],"b":["300","140","300","108","206","200","140","300","308","108","108","302","300","108","304","140","306","108","310","140","400"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","108","402","108","404","190","406","408"]},"Once the compliance manager  receives input identifying a scope of the compliance policy, the compliance manager  may display information about the policy scope in the \u201cPreview Policy Scope\u201d region .

In this manner, the user's  input identifies the configuration-item type selected by the user . In particular embodiments, the configuration-item type is either hosts, services, or connections. As disclosed herein, the configuration-item type corresponds to a type or category of resources in the IT infrastructure . For example, a configuration-item type of hosts corresponds to host resources in the IT infrastructure , a configuration-item type of services corresponds to service resources providing a respective service function in the IT infrastructure , and a configuration-item type of connections corresponds to connection resources between two or more resources communicating with each other in the IT infrastructure . As shown in screenshot , the user  has selected a configuration-item type of hosts.","In particular embodiments, the compliance manager  will have associated a query fragment with each selectable configuration-item type. For example, the compliance manager  may associate the hosts selection with the token \u201chosts,\u201d associate the services selection with the token \u201cservices,\u201d and associate the connections selection with the token \u201cconnections.\u201d Similarly, the compliance manager  may, as explained herein, associate query fragments with other items selectable by the user . As the user  makes selections, the compliance manager  accumulates the associated query fragments. For example, when the user  selects a configuration-item type of hosts as shown in screenshot , the compliance manager  saves the associated query fragment (e.g., the token \u201chosts\u201d) so that the saved query fragment can be later merged with other saved query fragments to create a query.","In addition to enabling selection of a configuration-item type via menu , the compliance manager  provides a scope menu , enabling the user  to define a scope for the currently-displayed compliance rule. The rule scope determines which configuration items of the identified type are to be checked by the compliance rule for compliance. Once the user  selects a configuration-item type, the compliance manager  may update the scope menu  so that the scope menu  presents the user  with a selection of scope attributes pertaining to the selected configuration-item type. Each scope attribute, when selected by the user , narrows the scope of the rule. Dynamically displaying a list of relevant attributes in the scope menu  depending on selection of the configuration-item type helps the user  to create a respective rule more quickly because the user  can select from a listing rather that create attributes from scratch. Additionally, the compliance manager  can utilize the object model to present a selection of scope attributes that is appropriate for the selection configuration-item type. In this manner, the user  can not select a scope attribute that is inconsistent with the underlying object model. If the user  does not select any of the attributes presented by the scope menu , then the compliance rule will apply to all configuration items of the identified configuration-item type.","To facilitate selection of one or more scope attributes, the compliance manager  displays a check box associated with each selectable attribute. The user  can select a scope attribute by clicking (i.e., with a computer mouse) on the check box associated with the scope attribute to be selected. Similar to the selection of a configuration-item type, the compliance manager  can associate each selectable rule scope attribute with a query fragment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["900","140","900","108","806","800","9","108","140","140","140","902","108"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["1000","140","1000","108","902","900","140","808","1004"]},"In particular embodiments, the compliance manager  may associate the query fragment \u201c.type=\u2018windows\u2019\u201d with the selection of Windows as the particular operating system family. Upon adding this query fragment to the query fragments previously saved as discussed above, the compliance manager creates the expression \u201chost.operating_system.type=\u2018Windows\u2019\u201d. This expression contains a path expression: host.operating_system.type. The expressed path is traversed by going from a first configuration item (i.e., a host) to a second configuration item (i.e., an operating system) having a \u201c.operating_system\u201d relationship to the first configuration item and then going to an attribute (i.e., type) of the second configuration item having the value \u201cWindows.\u201d","After completing a rule scope definition via selection of one or more scope attributes, the user  may initiate the defining of a desired state for each of the configuration items to be checked by the rule.

As the compliance manager  receives input identifying a rule definition (i.e., configuration-item type, scope of the rule, and desired state) as herein described, the compliance manager  accumulates the query fragments associated with the rule definition.","In accordance with embodiments disclosed herein, the compliance manager  merges accumulated query fragments into a query for applying the compliance rule to data corresponding to the IT infrastructure . In particular embodiments, the compliance manager  does not merge the accumulated query fragments until all the query fragments have been accumulated. That is, the compliance manager  merges all accumulated query fragments after the rule definition is complete. However, in other embodiments, the compliance manager  may incrementally merge the query fragments as the compliance manager  receives input defining the rule. That is, each time the compliance manager  receives input selecting a part (e.g., configuration-item type, rule scope attribute(s), or compliance conditions), the query fragment associated with the part is merged into a query.","The queries formed as described herein will typically contain at least one path expression. The structure of path expressions formable in accordance with embodiments disclosed herein is designed to mitigate the verbosity problem of SQL by providing for compact expressions. The structure is also designed to provide for path expressions that are sequential. The path expressions can be stored in any computer-readable format.","Path expressions as described herein are composed of object identifiers (e.g., a name), attribute identifiers (e.g., a name), a relationship operator, and path qualifiers. An example of an object identifier is the name (e.g., \u201chosts\u201d) of a configuration-item type as described above. Another configuration item might be named \u201coperating system,\u201d also as described above. Similarly, attribute names identify attributes of configuration items. The path expressions describe, in a short an accurate manner, a traversal between a current configuration-item and related configuration items or attributes. The relationship operator (e.g., \u201c.\u201d) is used to indicate in the path expression a traversal from one configuration item to a second configuration item. The relationship operator is followed by the name of the relationship between the two configuration items. For example, a path expression can indicate a traversal from a service to the host on which the service is running by adding \u201c.host\u201d to the path. An example of such a path expression includes the following path expression: \u201cservice.host\u201d.","A path qualifier is used to narrow a path. For example, suppose there is a path expression that traverses from a host to installed products. This path expression may look like the following: \u201chost.operating_system.installedProducts.\u201d If the user  desires to only refer to those installed products which represent an installation of a product having a particular name a path qualifier can be added to the path expression. That is, the path qualifier can be placed after the traversal to the \u201cinstalled product\u201d configuration item. In particular embodiments, a path qualifier is indicated by square brackets. An example of such a qualifier is \u201c[name=Professional Edition 2003].\u201d Thus, the path expression becomes \u201chost.operating_system.installedPoducts[name=\u2018Professional Edition 2003]\u201d. In this manner, the path expression has been narrowed, and instead of traversing to each of the installed products, the path now traverses only to those installed products named \u201cProfessional Edition 2003.\u201d Path qualifiers can include other comparison operators other than the \u201c=\u201d (i.e., equal) operator in the above example. Other useable comparison operators include \u201c< >\u201d (i.e., not equal) and \u201c\u02dc\u201d (i.e., containing).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 10","FIG. 9","FIG. 14"],"b":["1400","1402","1000","140","1404","1000","140","806","806","108","900","140","108","140","1404","140"]},"The compliance-condition lines  define the desired state of the compliance rule applied by the script . In this example, the desired state is that the hosts being checked for compliance have a disk labeled \u201cc\u201d that has a capacity greater than 100. Thus, the path expression  determines an attribute to be checked. And the compliance condition is that the attribute (i.e., the capacity of the \u201cc\u201d disk on a host) must be greater than 100. The query  checks for violations of the compliance rule. A host is in violation of a compliance rule when the scope constraints are met (i.e., scope_constraint is true) and not all the compliance conditions are met (i.e., !all_conditions is true) where ! is a \u201cnot\u201d operator.

Each path expression created is composed from tokens selected from the group consisting of object identifiers, attribute identifiers, a relationship operator, and path qualifiers. A first example of a path expression can be found in the constraint expression , wherein the expressed path (i.e., host.operating_system.type) is from a host to a type attribute of an operating system. The constraint expression  checks to see if the type attribute indicated by the path expression is equal to \u201cWindows.\u201d A second example of a path expression can also be found in .

In step , the compliance manager creates a path expression for each path identified in step . Step  comprises step . In , the compliance manager creates a path expression by adding a token for a first path expression to produce a second path expression. An example of this step is discussed in the text above describing the creation of the path expression found in the constraint expression . In general, a path expression can be extended by adding the relationship operator followed by either the name of a configuration item or the name of an attribute.","In step , the compliance manager creates a query for querying data structured in accordance with the object model, wherein the created query includes at least one of the path expressions created by step . That is the created query will comprise one or more path expressions created in accordance with embodiments disclosed herein.","In particular embodiments, the query created in step  may be executed directly to query the data. However, in other embodiments the created query can be translated into a second query before being executed. For example, in step , the compliance manager translates the created query into an SQL query. An example, of such a translation is shown in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0096","num":"0095"},"figref":["FIG. 19","FIG. 17"],"b":["1900","1700","1710","1720","1910"]},"In step , the compliance manager accumulates query fragments associated with the defined rule scope.
