title: Machine vision system editing environment for a part program in which a continuous stream of image acquisition operations are performed during a run mode
abstract: A machine vision system editing environment is provided for a part program in which a continuous stream of image acquisition operations are performed during a run mode. In one embodiment, a new common syntax and representations are utilized wherein continuous image acquisition operations are recorded in the same way as regular operations, with the running of the part program being performed in two stages. In the first stage, the portion of the part program that is to have the continuous stream of image acquisition is scanned for image acquisition operations, and the most efficient order for acquiring the images is determined, after which the image acquisition process is begun. Then, in the second stage, while the image acquisition process is being performed, the portion of the part program is scanned again, with the image analysis operations then being performed.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention relates generally to machine vision inspection systems, and more particularly to editing environments for part programs that include continuous high-speed image acquisition in such systems.","Precision machine vision inspection systems (or \u201cvision systems\u201d for short) can be utilized to obtain precise dimensional measurements of inspected objects and to inspect various other object characteristics. Such systems may include a computer, a camera and optical system, and a precision stage that is movable in multiple directions so as to allow the camera to scan the features of a workpiece that is being inspected. One exemplary prior art system that is commercially available is the QUICK VISION\u00ae series of PC-based vision systems and QVPAK\u00ae software available from Mitutoyo America Corporation (MAC), located in Aurora, Ill. The features and operation of the QUICK VISION\u00ae series of vision systems and the QVPAK\u00ae software are generally described, for example, in the 3, published January 2003, and the 3, published September 1996, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. This product, as exemplified by the QV-302 Pro model, for example, is able to use a microscope-type optical system to provide images of a workpiece at various magnifications, and move the stage as necessary to traverse the workpiece surface beyond the limits of any single video image. A single video image typically encompasses only a portion of the workpiece being observed or inspected, given the desired magnification, measurement resolution, and physical size limitations of such systems.","Machine vision inspection systems generally utilize automated video inspection. U.S. Pat. No. 6,542,180 teaches various aspects of such automated video inspection and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. As taught in the '180 patent, automated video inspection metrology instruments generally have a programming capability that allows an automatic inspection event sequence to be defined by the user for each particular workpiece configuration. This can be implemented by text-based programming, for example, or through a recording mode which progressively \u201clearns\u201d the inspection event sequence by storing a sequence of machine control instructions corresponding to a sequence of inspection operations performed by a user with the aid of a graphical user interface, or through a combination of both methods. Such a recording mode is often referred to as \u201clearn mode\u201d or \u201ctraining mode.\u201d Once the inspection event sequence is defined in \u201clearn mode,\u201d such a sequence can then be used to automatically acquire (and additionally analyze or inspect) images of a workpiece during \u201crun mode.\u201d","Video tools (or \u201ctools\u201d for short) and other graphical user interface features may be used manually to accomplish manual inspection and\/or machine control operations (in \u201cmanual mode\u201d). Their set-up parameters and operation can also be recorded during learn mode, in order to create automatic inspection programs, or \u201cpart programs.\u201d Video tools may include, for example, edge\/boundary detection tools, autofocus tools, shape or pattern matching tools, dimension measuring tools, and the like. Other graphical user interface features may include dialog boxes related to data analysis, step and repeat loop programming, and the like. For example, such tools are routinely used in a variety of commercially available machine vision inspection systems, such as the QUICK VISION\u00ae series of vision systems and the associated QVPAK\u00ae software, discussed above.","The machine control instructions including the specific inspection event sequence (i.e., how to acquire each image and how to analyze\/inspect each acquired image) are generally stored as a \u201cpart program\u201d or \u201cworkpiece program\u201d that is specific to the particular workpiece configuration. For example, a part program defines how to acquire each image, such as how to position the camera relative to the workpiece, at what lighting level, at what magnification level, etc. Further, the part program defines how to analyze\/inspect an acquired image, for example, by using one or more video tools such as edge\/boundary detection video tools. The ability to create part programs with instructions that perform a predetermined sequence of inspection operations provides several benefits, including enhanced inspection repeatability, as well as the ability to automatically execute the same part program repeatedly on one or more compatible machine vision inspection systems.","For general-purpose machine vision inspection systems that are intended to be rapidly programmable for a wide variety of workpieces, as exemplified by the previously referenced QUICK VISION\u00ae series of PC-based vision systems, it has been conventional for image acquisition operations to be interspersed with image analysis operations and\/or feature inspection operations that are performed on the most recently acquired image (referred to herein as \u201cinterspersed\u201d type operations). However, there is an increasing demand for general-purpose machine vision inspection systems to provide higher throughput. According to one method, this may be accomplished by performing image acquisition while using continuous relative motion between the camera and the workpiece stage (as opposed to intermittently stopping and starting the relative motion, as required for interspersed type operations), thereby significantly increasing inspection throughput. Such operations are referred to herein as continuous-motion type operations. It is advantageous for such systems to include strobe lighting illumination to assist with the acquisition of images during continuous motion without smearing (or blurring) the image.","High-speed \u201cin-line\u201d vision inspection systems used in high-speed production lines have provided continuous-motion type image acquisition. However, such in-line vision systems typically are dedicated to a single production line and acquire the \u201csame\u201d image over and over again, for successive workpieces on a conveyor system, for example. In such cases, for each image, the motion speed and strobe illumination parameters, etc., are the same. Furthermore, workpiece configurations and\/or image acquisition parameters, etc., are rarely changed. Thus, programming methods for such systems have not facilitated rapid programming for an unlimited variety of workpieces, camera positions, image acquisition parameters, etc., by relatively unskilled users.","In contrast, experience has shown that it is essential for general-purpose machine vision inspection systems to facilitate rapid programming for an unlimited variety of workpieces, camera positions, image acquisition parameters, etc., by relatively unskilled users. Previous programming methods for general-purpose machine vision inspection systems have not made the programming of continuous-motion type operations sufficiently easy or fast. Furthermore, previous programming methods have not made the programming of continuous-motion type operations in combination with interspersed-type operations sufficiently easy or fast. Programming systems and methods that can overcome these problems and shortcomings, either separately or in combination, would be desirable.","One exemplary prior art method that overcomes some of these problems and shortcomings is illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 7,590,276, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. As described in the '276 patent, a method of part programming is provided which permits a user to readily define multiple image acquisition operations interspersed with associated image analysis operations during learn mode operations, in a natural and intuitively understandable relationship. Then, in the resulting part program, image acquisition operations for at least some of the images are automatically rearranged into a continuous motion image acquisition sequence that acquires images and stores images in a \u201cnon-interspersed\u201d manner in order to increase the throughput of the machine vision inspection system.","However, one drawback of certain previous programming methods, such as that illustrated in the '276 patent, is that the continuous stream of image acquisition operations has typically been achieved by analyzing various operations entered by the user during learn mode, and altering or \u201cregrouping\u201d their order in the part program instructions using \u201cregrouped\u201d programming representations and syntax, such that the image acquisition instructions are grouped together for acquiring a plurality of images using continuous motion, and their corresponding image analysis instructions are altered or \u201cregrouped\u201d to follow the image acquisition instructions, such that the image analysis operations need not be interspersed with, or interrupt, the high-speed image acquisition during the continuous motion. As a result, when the part program instructions are recalled for editing or viewing, the image analysis instructions are separated from the acquisition instructions for their corresponding image. This has proven to be confusing for the users of such systems, in that related image acquisition and analysis instructions are separated by intervening \u201cunrelated\u201d image acquisition and image processing instructions, which is non-intuitive and leads to inefficiencies and errors when a user attempts to read or edit the \u201crearranged\u201d part program instructions. In other words, the rearranged programming representations and syntax for grouping the image acquisition operations together in the part program have made programming and editing of such part programs more difficult for users. A need exists for a part programming syntax, and editing operations and features which overcome these and other deficiencies to allow more efficient, intuitive, and flexible programming and editing of continuous image acquisition part programs for precision machine vision inspection systems.","This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify key features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a precision machine vision system editing environment is provided for a part program in which a continuous or uninterrupted sequential stream of image acquisition operations is performed during a run mode. The precision machine vision inspection system includes an imaging portion, a stage for holding one or more workpieces in a field of view (FOV) of the imaging portion, a control portion, a display, and a user interface.","In accordance with another aspect of the invention, the machine vision inspection system further comprises a learn mode that is operable to receive user input to control operations of the machine vision inspection system and record instructions corresponding to the controlled operations in order to create a part program. The learn mode is also operable to edit the part program, and to execute previously recorded part program instructions according to an edit mode of execution. The learn mode includes user interface features such as a user-controllable stream mode instruction element and an editable part program representation of part program instructions.

In some configurations, stage motion may be operable to physically move a workpiece in a horizontal plane (e.g., an X-Y plane) but not move the imaging portion, whereas the stage motion may be operable to move the imaging portion in a vertical direction (e.g., a Z direction), but not the workpiece. In other configurations, stage motion may be operable to physically move a workpiece in one horizontal direction (e.g., an X direction) but not the imaging portion, whereas the stage motion may be operable to move the imaging portion in a different horizontal direction (e.g., a Y direction) and a vertical direction (e.g., a Z direction), but not the workpiece. In various embodiments, the image acquisition operations are performed in a continuous motion sequence for at least two images.","In accordance with another aspect of the invention, the performance of the image analysis operations after their corresponding images are acquired is performed at least partly during the sequential order of image acquisition operations.","In accordance with another aspect of the invention, the non-stream mode of execution executes the image acquisition instructions and corresponding image analysis instructions of the first plurality of part program instructions that are not in a stream mode segment to perform the image acquisition operations and corresponding image analysis operations in a manner that is consistent with the first order.","In accordance with another aspect of the invention, the learn mode is configured such that when a part program including a stream mode segment is recalled for editing, the editable part program representation is displayed in the first order, and the edit mode of execution executes the image acquisition operations and corresponding image analysis operations in a manner that is consistent with the first order.

With reference to , this indicates that the stage would be moved such that the field of view window  would show the movement from the circle feature C to the circle features C and C, respectively, for the acquisition of the corresponding images. The edge points that are determined by the circle tools are then utilized by the instruction representations C and C to define the circles C and C. The instruction representation  is a stream mode instruction element, which designates the end of the stream mode segment . The instruction representation  indicates the end of the part program.","With regard to the original creation of the part program , part program instructions are recorded during a learn mode in accordance with user input (e.g., as provided through the user interface to control operations of the machine vision inspection system). Thereafter, during an edit mode, the above described part program instruction representations - are provided in an editing interface, such as the editing interface  of , to represent the corresponding part program instructions (e.g., as written in a programming language) in a simplified form for convenience and ease of use. As will be described in more detail below, while the sequence of part program instruction representations - in the stream mode segment  are represented in the editing mode in a first order (i.e., in the order illustrated in ), during a run mode, in accordance with the present invention the corresponding part program instructions may be executed according to a second order.","More specifically, in one embodiment, the run mode comprises a stream mode of execution applicable to identified stream segments and the stream mode is configured such that the part program instructions corresponding to the stream mode segment representation  are processed to identify the image acquisition operations included in the stream segment (e.g., a plurality of image acquisition operations). The image acquisition process for the plurality of images may begin as soon as this processing allows. Furthermore, the part program instructions corresponding to the stream mode segment representation  are processed to identify the image analysis operations corresponding to the acquired images, and the identified image analysis instructions (e.g., video tool operations) may begin as soon as their corresponding images are acquired, provided that this does not interrupt the sequence of image acquisition operations (e.g., a continuous motion used for acquiring the images may continue without dependence on the image analysis operations).","As a specific example, the order of operations of the part program  is performed as follows. The instruction representation  for the prologue node, as well as the instruction representations  and  for the setting of the lights and moving of the stage (which are part of the non-stream mode segment representation ), are performed in the order shown. As described above, once the instruction representation  is reached, this indicates the start of the stream mode segment representation , which begins the stream mode processing. In the stream mode, the stream mode segment  is gone through a first time to determine a list of image acquisition operations, which is then executed, and then a second time to begin execution of image analysis operations (e.g., video tool operations).","More specifically, the first time through the stream mode segment , in one embodiment, any operations that are required for acquiring images are added to the list for an image acquisition routine, while any operations that are not required for image acquisition operations are ignored. In one specific example embodiment, the instruction representations -, which are all part of setting up the machine vision inspection system for acquiring the images, are thus added to the list of operations that will be part of the image acquisition routine. In contrast, the part program instruction representation , which indicates that a circle measurement tool will need to be opened, is not added to the list for the image acquisition routine, because it is not required for acquiring the corresponding image. However, the instruction representation A, which indicates a setup for measurement, which includes going to a position and collecting an image, is added to the list for the image acquisition routine. The instruction representations B and C, which relate to running the circle tool and defining the circle, are not required for image acquisition, and thus are ignored rather than being added to the list. In a similar manner, the instruction representation  is ignored, the instruction representation A is added to the list, the instruction representations B, C, and  are ignored, the instruction representation A is added to the list, and the instruction representations B and C are ignored.","After the first time through the stream mode segment , once the image acquisition routine has been determined according to the instruction representations -, A, A, and A, the execution of the image acquisition routine is begun. While the image acquisition routine is being executed, the stream mode segment  is gone through a second time, during which the image analysis operations (e.g., video tool operations) are executed. During the second time through, in one embodiment the instruction representations -, which do not include any image analysis operations, are ignored. The instruction representation , which indicates that a circle measurement will need to be opened, is executed.","The instruction representation A is a special case, which indicates both image acquisition and image analysis operations, as will be described in more detail below. Briefly, during the second time through, the instruction representation A, which previously indicated image acquisition operations, also indicates that an image needs to be loaded, which is an image analysis operation, and so is executed. More specifically, if the image indicated by the instruction representation A has already been acquired by the image acquisition routine that was started as indicated above, then the image is loaded. If the image has not yet been acquired, then the process for the second time through is temporarily halted until the image is acquired by the image acquisition routine. Thus, as illustrated by the instruction representation A, certain instruction representations may indicate operations that are executed during both the first and second times through the stream mode segment .","After the execution of the instruction representation A, the second time through continues with the instruction representations B and C, which are executed for running the circle tool and defining the circle C according to the edge points determined by the circle tool. Similarly, the instruction representation  is executed, and the instruction representation A for loading the corresponding image of the circle C is executed if the image has been acquired by the image acquisition routine, and waited for if the image has not yet been acquired. After the execution of the instruction representation A, the instruction representations B, C, and  are executed, with the instruction representation A being executed if the corresponding image is available, or otherwise waited for if the image has not yet been acquired. After the execution of the instruction representation A, the instruction representations B and C are executed, with the instruction representation  indicating the end of the stream mode segment  and the end of the stream mode. It will be appreciated that in an embodiment where additional instruction representations followed the stream mode segment , that these would be outside of the stream mode, and would be executed in the order shown according to the non-stream mode, similar to the instruction elements  and  of the non-stream mode segment .","It will be appreciated that the above described operations and editing environment for a stream mode segment are advantageous over certain prior art implementations. More specifically, in certain previous implementations, an explicit list of commands was utilized for image acquisition, and a different explicit list of commands were utilized for analyzing the images that were acquired. In order to achieve continuous-motion type image acquisitions, at the time of programming, the image acquisition instructions were organized into a separate list, and were in different programming representations and syntax in the part program. This made editing and \u201cdebugging\u201d of the corresponding part programs more difficult. More specifically, when a user returned to a part program where the operations had been reordered and different programming representations and syntax had been used for continuous-motion type image acquisition, it was more confusing to determine how to edit or reprogram instructions that were inside of the continuous motion image acquisition routine, as opposed to outside. In addition, debugging of the part program was further complicated, in that there was no easily viewable representation of the steps as they had originally been performed, which thus made it more difficult to determine which instructions had caused which results.","In accordance with the present invention, as described above a more desirable editing environment is provided in which the part program instruction representations may be provided in their original order. Furthermore, instruction representations inside of a stream mode segment (e.g., stream mode segment ) are made to have an identical appearance to those outside of a stream mode segment. As a specific example, if the instruction representations , A, B, and C had been recorded outside of the stream mode segment  (e.g., within the non-stream mode segment ), they would have an identical appearance in the editing interface  aside from the representation of being \u201ccontained\u201d by the instruction representation . This is in contrast to the prior art methods described above, wherein such instruction representations would be provided in a different programming representation and syntax inside of a stream mode segment as compared to outside. As described above, the representation of the part program  as illustrated in the editing interface  also allows debugging of the part program to be performed in a sequential manner even within the stream mode segment . More specifically, during a debugging process (e.g., during the editing mode), a user may elect to have the instruction representations within the stream mode segment  be executed in the first order (i.e., the order indicated in the editing representation ), which is the order they were originally programmed in, in a step-by-step process, in order to simplify the determination of which instruction representations are causing which results.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":["FIGS. 5A and 5B","FIG. 5A"],"b":["500","500","500","510"]},"At a block , user interface features are provided including a user-controllable stream mode instruction element and an editable part program representation of part program instructions. The user-controllable stream mode instruction element is usable to designate a stream mode segment which comprises a segment of a part program that is designated for stream mode execution. The editable part program representation may include image acquisition instruction representations corresponding to image acquisition operations, image analysis instruction representations corresponding to image analysis operations, and a stream mode segment representation.","At a block , a run mode is provided which is operable to execute a previously created part program, the run mode comprising a non-stream mode for executing part program instructions which are not in a stream mode segment, and a stream mode for executing part program instructions which are in a stream mode segment. From the block , the routine continues to a point A, as will be described in more detail below with respect to .","As shown in , from the point A, the routine continues to a block . At the block , the learn mode is configured such that the editable part program representation represents a first plurality of part program instructions comprising image acquisition and corresponding image analysis instructions in a first order corresponding to an order in which the corresponding controlled operations were performed to create the part program. The learn mode is further configured such that the edit mode of execution executes the part program instructions to perform the image acquisition operations and corresponding image analysis operations in a manner that is consistent with the first order, regardless of whether or not the first plurality of part program instructions are included in a stream mode segment.","At a block , the run mode is configured such that the stream mode executes the first plurality of part program instructions, when included in a stream mode segment, according to a second order.

In one embodiment, the image acquisition operations may be performed in the sequential order during a continuous motion sequence. The second order further includes performing the first plurality of part program image analysis instructions to perform their corresponding image analysis operations after their corresponding images are acquired.","While various preferred and exemplary embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described, it will be appreciated that various changes can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The foregoing aspects and many of the attendant advantages of this invention will become more readily appreciated as the same become better understood by reference to the following detailed description, when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIGS. 5A and 5B"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
