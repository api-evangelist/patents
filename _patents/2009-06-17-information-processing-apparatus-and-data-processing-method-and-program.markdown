Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to an information processing apparatus and a data processing method and a program. To be more specific, the present invention relates to an information processing apparatus and a data processing method and a program that are configured to execute content recording processing and copy processing on recording media.","2. Description of the Related Art","For recording media for recording various kinds of content, such as music and video, the DVD (Digital Versatile Disc, the Blu-ray Disc (registered trademark) are in a wide use. These information recording media include media that are recorded with data beforehand and does not allow new data writing (ROM type) and media that allow data writing (R type, RE type, etc.), for example. Use of data-writing enabled information recording media allows content recorded to one media to be copied or moved to another media. Further, for example, it is practicable to download content through networks or devices installed in public spaces and record the downloaded content.","Recording media for recording content may also include hard disk drives and flash memories, for example, in addition to the above-mentioned DVDs and Blu-ray Discs (registered trademark).","The processing modes in which content is recorded to recording media include the following, for example:","(a) copying or moving content from a media (a ROM disc for example) already recorded content;","(b) downloading and recording content from servers; and","(c) recording content through terminals installed in stores or public spaces.","The above-mentioned processing is assumed, for example.","It should be noted here that many kinds of content, such as music data, image data, and so on, are protected in copyright and distribution, for example. Therefore, it is a general practice that, in providing content to users, content is provided to those users who are granted with certain use restrictions, namely, legal use rights, thereby preventing illegal manipulation of content, for example.","For example, AACS (Advanced Access Content System) is known as a standard associated with the use control of content. According to the AACS standard, the execution of content copy between media as described in processing mode (a) above requires the acquisition of copy permission information from a management server. Namely, under predetermined management, the copy of content is permitted. This copy processing is referred to as managed copy (MC).","The content providing mode of (b) above, namely, the download-type content providing processing is also referred to as EST (Electric Sell Through). The content providing mode of (c) above based on the use of shared terminal is referred to as MoD (Manufacturing on Demand). The AACS standard also requires these content providing modes to comply with predetermined rules.","The following describes the overview of the following three processing modes with reference to .","(a) MC","(b) EST","(c) MoD","(a) MC","Managed copy denotes a processing operation in which user  sets an information recording media (disc)  recorded with content beforehand onto an information processing apparatus  for executing data recording and reproduction processing and copies content from the information recording media  to a second information recording media , such as a data-writing enabled R\/RE disc of R type or RE type, or a hard disk drive or a flash memory, and the like, as shown in , for example.","In executing this content copy processing, the information processing apparatus  must connect to a management server  via a network  to get the permission of content copy from the management server .","It should be noted that  shows one information processing apparatus, namely, a configuration in which content copy processing between two or more media is executed by a single unit of apparatus; it is also practicable to provide an apparatus loaded with a copy source media and an apparatus loaded with a copy destination media, which are interconnected with a USB cable for example.","(b) EST","A processing operation in which content is downloaded from a server and the downloaded content is recorded to information recording media is referred to as EST. As shown in , EST is a processing operation in which a media, for example, a disc  of R type or RE type that enables data writing, is loaded on an information processing unit  such as a PC of the user  and content is received from a content server (EST server)  via a network  to be recorded to the loaded media.","(c) MoD","The content providing processing of shared terminal use type is referred to as MoD. As shown in , in MoD, a user  records content to a media by use of a content server  that is a terminal installed in a public space, such as a convenience store or a railroad station, and purchases the copied content. Namely, the user  sets his disc  of R type or RE type enabled for data writing onto the content server (MoD server)  that is a terminal of a convenience store  and writes desired content to the disc  by executing a content selecting operation, for example.","It should be noted that the above-mentioned processing configurations (a) through (c) are described in Patent Document 1 (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Hei 2008-98765), for example.","As described above, the user is able to record content to data recordable media to use (or reproduce for example) the recorded data. However, if the content is copy-protected for example, it may be necessary to control the use of content to prevent unconditional usage.","As described above, AACS is known as a standard associated with content copy protection technologies. The AACS standard specifies usage control information (or usage rules) corresponding to content to employ a control configuration for executing the content usage compliant with the usage rules. Further, strict usage control is realized by dividing a piece of content into units to provide the encrypted content with unit keys applied to these units, the unit keys being obtained by a particular user.","If the disc to which content has been recorded is a media that allows reproduction of the content and does not allow new recording of content, for example, a ROM disc, no new additional recording or editing of content is executed on the disc, so that the content-unique usage rules and the unit keys corresponding to media-recorded content can be provided to the user as recorded to the media.","However, in the mode where content is recorded to a disc of R type or RE type, a hard disk drive, or a flash memory, for example, and the recorded content is used, the recorded content is not fixed, so that update operations such as recording of new contents and deletion of recorded contents are supported. In accordance with the updating of media stored content as described above, the processing of updating usage control information and unit keys may be required.","When the user records content to media, complicated processings, such as the recording of various auxiliary data corresponding to the recorded content may be required, in addition to the recording of content. Therefore, for example, if the above-mentioned managed copy is executed, it is a general practice to executing the copy processing by using a program specified a series of processing sequences in advance.","For example, a program (or a player application) for executing the above-mentioned managed copy is stored in each information processing apparatus compliant with the AACS standard. In order to execute the managed copy by use of a device compliant with AACS, the user executes the player application stored in that device. When this program is executed, a sequence of processing operations, such as the connection with the management server and the acquisition of copy permission information from the management server, are executed and then content copy processing is executed under the condition of the acquisition of copy permission information.","In copying content recorded to a Blu-ray Disc (registered trademark), managed copy is executed by invoking the player application stored in an AACS compliant device. For a method of invoking this player application, any one of the following methods is admitted in AACS:","(a) invoking from a menu presented on the UI of the device; and","(b) invoking by first invoking BD-J (Blue-ray Disc Java (registered trademark)) application program that is a Java program (registered trademark) stored in the disc with content recorded, thereby invoking the player application via the BD-J application.","AACS specifies to execute one of the above-mentioned methods (a) and (b).","The player application is a program stored in the device for executing content reproduction and recording and created as a program for common use to various kinds of content. On the other hand, the BD-J application is recordable on discs and can be set unique to content corresponding to disc-recorded content. Namely, this is a program that can be created by a content creator in accordance with disc-recorded content.","Namely, the BD-J application is a program that can be created by the content creating side to a certain degree of freedom, thereby allowing various settings in accordance with various content configurations. Therefore, setting such that managed copy is executed by applying the BD-J application also allows the content creator to execute content-unique processing for example in accordance with content configurations and the like.","However, the execution of managed copy may require the processing corresponding to the AACS-specified programs, such as the processing of converting the content data stored in the copy source into a format in accordance with the media of the copy destination and setting an AACS-specified directory such that the reproduction of the media of the copy destination can be executed in accordance with the AACS rules. The execution of these processing operations may require the processing on the execution layer (or the AACS layer) of each AACS-specified managed program.","Therefore, if the BD-J application is set as a managed copy execution program, at least a part of the processing must be executed on the AACS layer.","As described above, in order to execute managed copy, the processing in two data processing blocks, the BD-J application and the AACS layer, has to be executed in the information processing apparatus. However, the information processing apparatus is limited in resource. For example, the memory size of the information processing apparatus is limited.","In the AACS layer, content data stored in the copy source is converted into the format according to the media of the copy destination. However, if a memory area large enough is not allocated for this processing, this processing takes a long time.","The BD-J application is a Java (registered trademark) application program and executes processing by setting a virtual machine as a virtual hardware environment for executing Java (registered trademark) applications. This processing uses a large memory area in the information processing apparatus.","Therefore, if the processing operations in the two data processing blocks, the BD-J application and the AACS layer, are executed at the same time, the limited memory space in the information processing apparatus is used by both the AACS layer and the BD-J application to possibly lead to the insufficient allocation of the memory space required by both the data processing blocks, thereby delaying the processing of each data processing block and protracting the processing time.","Therefore, the present invention addresses the above-identified and other problems associated with related-art methods and apparatuses and solves the addressed problems by providing an information processing apparatus and a data processing method and a program that are configured, in executing a sequence of processing involved in the content copy processing between media to be executed under the control of a server, to efficiently use the resources of an information processing apparatus by defining a proper processing sequence, thereby realizing high-speed processing without causing delay.","In carrying out the invention and according to a first embodiment thereof, there is provided an information processing apparatus including a first data processing block configured by a virtual machine as a virtual hardware environment for executing a program read from a first recording media recording content and the program for executing data processing and a second data processing block configured to execute data conversion of the content and copy processing of the converted content onto a second recording media. The first data processing block executes acquisition of copy permission information from a management server by execution of the program and shuts down the virtual machine after completion of the acquisition of the copy permission information. The second data processing block is configured to execute data conversion of content recorded to the first recording media and copy processing of the converted content onto a second recording media after the virtual machine is shut down.","In the above-mentioned information processing apparatus, the first data processing block frees a memory area of the information processing apparatus before shutting down the virtual machine and the second data processing block executes data conversion of the content recorded to the first recording media and copy processing of the converted content onto the second recording media by use of the memory area of the information processing apparatus freed by the first data processing block.","In the above-mentioned information processing apparatus, the first data processing block executes data processing on a Java (registered trademark)\u2014VM (Virtual Machine) that is a virtual machine as a virtual hardware environment for executing a Java (registered trademark) application program.","In the above-mentioned information processing apparatus, the first data processing block acquires data necessary for requesting copy permission information from the second data processing block and transmits the acquired data to the management server.","In the above-mentioned information processing apparatus, the first data processing block executes processing of requesting the second data processing block for verifying copy permission information acquired from the management server and, after receiving a response indicative of successful verification, shuts down the virtual machine.","In the above-mentioned information processing apparatus, the first data processing block requests the second data processing block for data necessary for requesting copy permission information.","In the above-mentioned information processing apparatus, the first data processing block requests the second data processing block for processing by applying an API (Application Programming Interface) defined with processing to be executed.","In carrying out the invention and according to a second embodiment thereof, there is provided an information recording media recording content and a program for data processing as recorded data, wherein the program is executed on a virtual machine as a virtual hardware environment in an information processing apparatus to shut down the virtual machine before data conversion or copy recording processing of the content to make a data processing block for executing data conversion or copy recording processing free a memory area in the information processing apparatus.","In the above-mentioned information recording media, the program is a Java (registered trademark) application program.","In carrying out the invention and according to a third embodiment thereof, there is provided a data processing method that is executed in an information processing apparatus. This data processing method has the steps of executing, by a first data processing block, a program read from a first recording media recording content and the program for executing data processing on a virtual machine as a virtual hardware environment for executing, acquiring copy permission information from a management server, and shutting down the virtual machine after completion of acquisition processing of the copy permission information and executing, by a second data processing block, data conversion of content recorded to the first recording media and copy processing of the converted content onto a second recording media after the virtual machine is shut down.","In carrying out the invention and according to a fourth embodiment thereof, there is provided a program for making an information processing apparatus execute data processing. This program has the steps of acquiring, in a virtual machine as a virtual hardware environment, copy permission information from a management server and shutting down the virtual machine after completion of acquisition of the copy permission information and executing, in a data processing block, after shutting down of the virtual machine, data conversion of content recorded to a first recording media and copy processing of the converted content onto a second recording media.","It should be noted that the program according to the present embodiment is a computer program that can be provided, in a storage media or via a communication media that are computer readable, for general-purpose computer systems configured to execute various program codes. By providing the program above in a computer readable manner, processing corresponding to the program is realized on computer systems.","Other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will be clarified by detail description with reference to embodiments of the present invention and accompanying drawings. It should be noted that a system as referred to herein denotes a logical aggregation of two or more units of apparatuses and each component apparatus is not always accommodated in one housing.","According to the configurations of embodiments of the present invention, in executing the content copy processing between media in an information processing apparatus, processing sequences in a first data processing block for executing processing operations such as acquiring copy permission information from a server and a second data processing block for executing data conversion and copy recording processing involved in content copy processing are set with the use of resources of the information processing apparatus taken into consideration. To be more specific, after the completion of the processing in the first data processing block for executing processing operations such as acquiring copy permission information from a server, a virtual machine configuring the first data processing block is shut down to free a memory area and then data conversion and copy recording processing are started in the second data processing block. This novel setting allows the first data processing block and the second data processing block to allocate a memory area large enough for the execution of various data processing operations, thereby realizing efficient processing without causing delay.","The following describes in detail an information processing apparatus and a data processing method and a program practiced as embodiments of the present invention with reference to the accompanying drawings.","First, with reference to , a processing example of managed copy (MC: Managed Copy) to be executed by the information processing apparatus practiced as one embodiment of the present invention is described. As described above, managed copy is processing for copying content to another media under the condition that copy permission information is obtained from the management server.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["110","120","110","150","150","140"]},"The disc  is a ROM disc or a Blu-ray Disc (registered trademark), for example.","The second information recording media  to which content is copied is a recording media, such as a hard disk drive, an R\/RE disc, or a flash memory.","The information processing apparatus , configured by a PC or a recording\/reproducing apparatus, for example, has capabilities of reading data from the disc  and recording the read data to the second information recording media .","As shown in the figure, the disc  stores a BD-J application  that is a Java (registered trademark) application program, a copy processing management file (MCMF) , management data , and encrypted content .","The BD-J application  is a program that is executed by the information processing apparatus  when content copy is executed; for example, the BD-J application  is a program to execute the processing, such as communication with the management server , for example. It should be noted that the BD-J application  may be configured as a single application program or a combination of two or more BD-J applications for executing a particular processing operation.","For example, the above-mentioned combination includes a BD-J application for executing communication with servers and a BD-J application dedicated to charging processing. In executing content copying, the plurality of BD-J applications is executed in the information processing apparatus .","The copy processing management file  is applied when executing content copy processing. For example, the copy processing management file  is an XML described data file containing the following information:","(a) content ID that is an identifier (ID) uniquely indicative of the content recorded to an information recording media (the disc );","(b) URI (URL) that is information for connecting to the management server  that executes the permission of copy for executing content copy and the generation of a token by bind processing, for example, that is access information for the management server ; and","(c) information about directory and file names that records the data for permitting copy processing of a directory name and\/or a file name.","The management data  is specified by AACS (Advanced Access Content System) that is a standard management system associated with content copyright technologies for example and includes a CPS unit key file storing a key (a unit key) that is applied to the decryption of the encrypted content , usage control information, a content certificate (CC) indicative of the authenticity of the content, and am MKB (Media Key Block) that is an encrypted key block storing key information (media key) for getting a CPS unit key.","The encrypted content  is encrypted content compliant with the AACS standard for example. For example, the encrypted content  is content composed of an AV (Audio Visual) stream such as HD (High Definition) movie content that is high-definition moving image data, music data, a game program, an image file, audio data, and text data, for example.","The encrypted content  is encrypted content having a configuration in which usage management on a content management unit (CPS unit) basis for example to which different unit keys (CPS unit keys) for different content management units are applied. The key different from unit to unit is allocated, encrypted, and stored.","The information processing apparatus  has two data processing blocks.","A first data processing block is a BD-JVM (a BD-J virtual machine) . The BD-JVM  is set as a virtual machine as a virtual hardware environment for executing the BD-J application  recorded to the disc .","A second data processing block is an AACS layer . The AACS layer  is set as a data processing block for executing the handling of high-security information, such as the acquisition of the ID recorded to the disc , and the data processing compliant with the AACS standard, such as the data conversion in content copy processing, for example.","Thus, in executing the processing of copying content recorded to the disc  to another media, the BD-JVM  as an execution area of the BD-J application  recorded to the disc  and the AACS layer  that is a program execution area for executing the processing compliant with the AACS standard are set, thereby executing mutual processing requests and processing result transfer, for example.","API (Application Programming Interface) is used for these mutual processing requests and processing result transfer between the BD-J application and the AACS layer. API is a set of functions and so on for executing various kinds of processing necessary for the execution of content copy processing. API is recoded in the BD-J application  or in an area that the information processing apparatus  is able to read. Specific examples of API will be described in detail later.","The information processing apparatus  executes the BD-J application  in the BD-JVM  to make communication with the management server , thereby executing the processing of getting copy permission information  (Permission), for example.","In copying the encrypted content  stored in the disc  to the second recording media , the processing, such as converting the content and the usage control information (Usage Rules) so that they become compatible with the destination recording media. These processing operations are executed in a program execution area (the AACS layer ) in which AACS-compliant processing operations are executed.","The BD-J application  is a program for executing the processing necessary for the execution of content copy processing and is executed in the BD-JVM  of the information processing apparatus . For the processing with the BD-J application applied, the following processing for example is executed:","(a) server access processing by use of the URI of a copy processing management file;","(b) acquisition of a permission processing list from the server;","(c) transmission of processing select information to the server by the user;","(d) account settlement processing;","(e) acquisition of copy permission information from the server, check processing, outputting of the copy permission information to the recording control block;","(f) monitoring the content copy processing executed by the recording control block; and","(g) monitoring the writing of data downloaded from the server executed by the recording control block.","These processing operations are executed by applying the BD-J application.","It should be noted that, as described above, the BD-J application  is may be configured as a single application or a combination of two or more BD-J applications for executing particular processing. For example, the above-mentioned processing operations (a) through (g) may be executed by two or more BD-J applications.","The following describes the processing by the BD-J application with reference to . The BD-J application is started, in step S shown in , in the BD-JVM  that is set to the information processing apparatus .","It should be noted that, in the execution of this processing, a guide screen as a user interface is presented on a display device of the information processing apparatus , the guide screen being a menu provided by the BD-J application. Thus, a sequence of processing operations for executing content copy processing is started in accordance with a user instruction.","As instructed by the user, the BD-J application first applies the server URI included in the copy processing management file  to access the management server . In this operation, the content ID corresponding to the content subject to copy is transmitted to the management server .","In step S, the management server  generates a permission processing list that is list data of processing operations permitted for that content on the basis of the content ID received from the information processing apparatus  and transmits the generated list to the information processing apparatus . For example, this list is composed of the information indicative whether content copy is permitted or not and the information about the fee of copy processing, for example.","The information processing apparatus  receives the permission processing list  from the management server  and, in step S, shows the permission processing list on the display for the user to select a processing operation to be executed.","When a processing operation to be executed is selected by the user, the information processing apparatus  executes settlement processing by transferring settlement data  with the management server . For example, the user enters the data necessary for the settlement, such as a credit card number for example, through a settlement screen and transmits the entered data. Next, in step S, the management server  permits the processing and transmits the copy permission information to the information processing apparatus .","The information processing apparatus  passes the copy permission information received from the management server  to the AACS layer . In the AACS layer , the processing operations of steps S and the subsequent steps are executed. The AACS layer  executes the processing of converting the management data  read from the disc  into the management data corresponding to the media type of the second information recording media , such as a hard disk drive, an R\/RE disc, or a flash memory, for example, that is the copy destination. For example, the AACS layer  executes the processing of adding an encryption key (unit key) corresponding to the copy content and converting the usage control information and content certificate and the like, into the data corresponding to the copy content. The information necessary for these data conversion operations is included in copy permission information . The converted management data  is recorded to the second information recording media .","Further, in step S, the information processing apparatus  enters the encrypted content  recorded to the disc  and outputs the content copy data with the data conversion such as format conversion executed. Thus, the copy data recorded to the disc  is recorded to the second information recording media  as encrypted content . It should be noted that the management data  to be recorded to the second information recording media  is composed of the usage control information, the content certificate, the MKB, the CPS unit key file, and the token that correspond to the content to be recorded to the second information recording media .","It should be noted that, in the content copy processing, the media identifier (or the serial number) of the second information recording media  is checked between the information processing apparatus  and the management server  and a token is generated by the signature processing based on a secret key of the management server  for the media identifier, thereby sometimes including the generated token in the management data, for example. The management data made up of this token and so on is shown as management data  inside the management server  in . The management data (CP data)  to be recorded to the second information recording media  may include this token information.","Thus, the content copy processing has been outlined above with reference to . As described above, the content copy processing is executed by use of the BD-J application and the program that is executed on the AACS layer.","Therefore, it is required to transfer necessary information between the BD-J application and the execution program of the AACS layer. API is applied to this processing. The following describes an example of API between the BD-J application and the AACS layer to be used in the content copy processing with reference to  and .","The APIs between the BD-J application and the AACS layer to be used in the content copy processing are as follows.","(1) GenerateOfferRequestInfo( )","This API specifies the processing of requesting the AACS layer for the data to be transmitted to the management server  and receiving the request data when the BD-J application requests the management server  for transmitting a permission processing list (Offer) corresponding to the content.","The input from the BD-J application to the AACS layer and the output from the AACS layer to the BD-J application in the processing using this API are as follows.","Input from the BD-J application to the AACS layer: none.","Output from the AACS layer to the BD-J application: random number (mcmNonce), media ID (Serial Number) made up of PMSN, for example.","(2) VerifyOffer(Offer)","This API specifies the processing in which the BD-J application requests the AACS layer for verifying a permission processing list (Offer) received from the management server  and receives a result of the verification.

It should be noted that, if the verification is successful, the content copy processing is ready for execution, upon which the processing of BD-J application may be ended, thereby shutting down the BD-JVM at this point of time. Then, the content copy processing starts.","Thus, between the BD-J application and the execution program of the AACS layer, the transfer of necessary information is smoothly executed by the API, so that the managed copy processing can be executed under the initiative of the BD-J application.","The following describes sequences of the content copy processing using the API to be executed in the information processing apparatus , with reference to the flowcharts shown in  to .","First, after loading a disc recorded with the content subject to copy and a BD-J application onto the information processing apparatus to set the disc in a reproducible state, the information processing apparatus reads the BD-J application recorded to the disc to start the execution of the BD-J application in step S. It should be noted that, in starting this processing, the information processing apparatus invokes the BD-JVM (the BD-JVM  shown in ) that is the execution block of the BD-J application.
