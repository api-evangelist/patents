title: Guidance of treatment devices on target surfaces
abstract: A pair of vertical guide supports are slidably received in horizontally spaced rails removably mounted on a vertical target surface to be treated, such as the hull of a ship. A rack support interconnects the vertical guide supports and is vertically displaceable relative thereto with a rack plate thereby positioned in spaced relation to the target surface. A treatment device such as a pressurized paint ejector is positioned on the rack plate for selectively imposed movement therewith along linear paths to positions at which it is aligned perpendicular to the target surface to be completely treated by application or removal of paint for example.

Such surfaces are also treated for removal of paint therefrom, involving discharges of grit or water under high pressures from de-paint devices attached to manipulating facilities requiring use of additional labor and materials. Patent protection was heretofore provided for surface attachable guidance apparatus and method for different devices, to the exclusion of coating of vertical surfaces such as ship hulls with paint. It is therefore an important object of the present invention to provide for efficient transfer of coatings such as paint to and from surfaces such as ship hulls.","In accordance with the present invention rail track guidance facilities are attachable to a target surface, such as a ship hull, on which it is exclusively supported to thereby establish horizontal and vertical guide paths in spaced relation to the target surface along which a guide support for a surface treatment device is displaced to plural locations at which the treatment device is positioned preferably along an ejection axis aligned perpendicular to the target surface so as to perform paint coating or de-coating operations with maximized efficiency.","Referring now to the drawing in detail,  illustrates a guidance assembly, generally referred to by reference numeral , through which movement of a surface treatment device  is selectively controlled in spaced relation to a vertical target surface  to which the guidance assembly  is removably attached at different locations. As shown in , the surface treatment device  is in the form of a pressurized paint spray ejection nozzle connected to a paint supply . A spray  of liquid paint is accordingly shown ejected from the ejection nozzle type treatment device  so as to paint the target surface , which may be on the exterior of a ship hull  on which a pair of fixed guide rails  of the guidance assembly  are attached in parallel spaced relation to each other so as to exclusively support the guidance assembly . A pair of vertical rail guide supports  are associated with the guidance assembly  as shown in . Upper and lower arms  and  extending from the vertical supports  are slidably received in the guide rails  for guided displacement of the supports  relative to the vertical target surface  in a horizontal direction. As shown in , the vertical guide supports  are interconnected and held in horizontally spaced relation to each other by a pair of horizontal support rails  having end sections  slidably received within vertical guide slots  formed in the guide supports .","It will be apparent from the foregoing description that the treatment ejection device  positioned on the rack plate  at each of a plurality of locations along the support rails  and guide slots  in perpendicular alignment with the target surface  as shown in  so as to apply the spray  to the surface  between the supports  and the upper and lower surface guide rails  with maximized surface treatment. A portion of the surface  between the horizontal rails  and the vertical supports  may thereby be efficiently and completely treated. The vertical supports  may be shifted horizontally along linear paths on the surface  along the rails  to sequentially cover other portions of the surface  during a treatment process. The horizontal guide rails  removably attached to the surface  may be furthermore shifted to other locations on the surface  for treatment purposes to thereby cover the entire surface  to be treated.","Obviously, other modifications and variations of the present invention may be possible in light of the foregoing teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING","p":["A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of its attendant advantages will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawing wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIGS. 3","b":["4","5","3","3","4","4","5","5","2"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
