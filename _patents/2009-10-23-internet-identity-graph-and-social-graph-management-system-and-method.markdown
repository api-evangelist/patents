No. 12\/540,173 filed Aug. 12, 2009, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/088,264 filed Aug. 12, 2008.","1. Field of the Invention","The invention relates generally to the field of social web sites on global computer networks and in particular to a system and method for managing information personal to individual users of social web sites.","2. Statement of the Problem","The Internet started as an information source and communication tool, and these functions remain important aspects of the Internet. It is also a truism that the Internet is a powerful sales tool. Companies that provide useful internet services have cash flows of more then ten billion dollars a year, much of which comes from advertising. The Internet has become the most important medium for distribution of music, and is rapidly becoming the most important medium for distribution of videos. The Internet has also become an important vehicle for telecommunications, including telephone communication. Because the Internet lends itself to immediate feedback to advertisers and service providers, new Internet uses, such as directed advertising are rapidly evolving.","The Internet has also grown to become an important social network. From one point of view, the Internet is the largest social network on the planet. Moreover, on a more explicit level, there are scores, if not hundreds of social network sites on the Internet, and millions of blogs. Social network sites are defined as web sites or applications that provide people with designated relationships to each other access to information that is not available to others who do not have such designated relationships. Because the Internet can be accessed from a myriad of points, such as desktop computers connected to wires, laptop computers connected to wireless networks, hand-helds, cell phones, and integrated products such as Ipods\u2122, for many individuals, the Internet has become their primary means of communication. The explicit social web sites encourage individuals to share their ideas, experiences and thoughts with their friends, sometimes on an hourly or more frequent basis. These social web sites are uniquely different from conventional informational and shopping web sites in that they provide interactions between the web site users, and not just between the web site and individual users. The actions on these web sites are more complex, including actions such as adding a contact, deleting a contact, sending a message to a contact, inviting, such as to a social event, blocking, staring, which also is called bookmarking or placemarking, depending on the web site, linking as in assigning an attribute or giving credit, set a trust level, and voting.","The Internet permits individuals to live in many different social circles that would not be available without the Internet. However, it also creates problems in that it is difficult to control identities on the internet. A person may select an identity, and find that the identity may be taken by another.","An even greater problem is created by the fact that after an individual or company registers an identity on one site, others may intentionally usurp that identity on another site. The proliferation of sites makes it difficult for an individual or company to capture an identity on all sites.","All of the above problems are particularly exacerbated in social network sites. The key purpose of such sites is social networking, and if a user's identity is not known or varies, such social networking becomes difficult to impossible. Moreover, reconnecting among friends on new social network sites is laborious and thus seriously impedes social networking.","For the above and other reasons, it would be highly desirable if a method and apparatus were available that allowed an individual, corporation or other entity to better control their identities on the internet.","The invention solves the above problems, as well as other problems of the prior art, by providing a global Internet identity repository and management system. Preferably, the internet identity management system permits the user to register an internet identity, sometimes referred to herein as \u201cusername\u201d, on a plurality of websites. The system of the invention will register the user on three hundred or more websites, by filing out information on a single web page. The system also allows the user to easily check to see if their internet identity is already registered on specific web sites.","The invention provides a method of securing an internet identity on a plurality of web sites, the method comprising: providing a web page permitting an internet user to enter the internet identity to be secured; receiving an input indicating that an internet user has entered an identity and requested that the identity be secured on the plurality of web sites; registering the internet identity on the plurality of web sites; and verifying to the internet user that the identity has been registered on the plurality of web sites. Preferably, the providing a web page further comprises providing a web page that permits the user to enter a website URL, and the registering further comprises adding the URL to the plurality of websites. Preferably, the registering further comprises enter a link back to the URL on the plurality of web sites. Preferably, the providing a web page further comprises providing a web page that permits the user to enter a user biography, and the registering further comprises adding the biography to the plurality of websites. Preferably, the providing a web page comprises providing a web page permitting an internet user to enter variants of the internet identity to be secured. Preferably, the providing a web page further comprises providing a web site showing a list of possible web sites on which the internet identity may be secured, and the receiving an input comprises receiving a signal that one or more of the possible web sites have been indicated. Preferably, the providing a list comprises displaying a plurality of icons, each icon representing a different web site on which the internet identity may be secured. Preferably, the providing a web page further comprises providing a web page that permits the internet user to select the number of web sites on which the internet identity is to be secured. Preferably, the providing a web page further comprises providing a web page permitting the internet user to order the registering on a recurring basis. Preferably, the verifying comprises sending an email to an email address. Preferably, the providing a web page comprises providing a web page on which the internet user may pay for the securing service. Preferably, the providing a web page comprises providing a web page offering a plurality of different payments for the securing services, with the number of the web sites on which the internet identity is secured being different for each of the plurality of different payments. Preferably, the providing a web page further comprises providing a web page on which the user may attest the user has the right to the internet identity to be secured.","The invention also provides a method for permitting an internet user to discovering web sites on which a user identifier is registered, the method comprising: using a server computer, providing on a client computer remote from the server computer, a display of a web page permitting an internet user to enter an identifier the user desires to check for registration on a web site, wherein the web site to be checked is not the web site associated with the server computer; receiving at the server computer an input indicating the user has entered an identifier to be checked and requesting that the identifier be checked on at least one web site; and in response to the input, going out to the at least one web site and checking if the identifier is in use on the web site; and indicating on the client computer that the identifier is registered on the web site. Preferably, the providing a display on the client computer comprises providing a display showing a plurality of icons, each icon representing a different web site; and the receiving an input comprises receiving a signal that the user has clicked on one of the icons. Preferably, the method further comprises recording the web sites on which the identifier is registered.","In a further aspect, the invention provides a system for permitting an internet user to discovering web sites on which a user identifier is registered, the system comprising: a computer readable medium embodying instructions for directing a first processing unit to: provide a display of a web page permitting the internet user to enter an identifier the user desires to check for registration on a web site, wherein the web site to be checked is not the web site associated with the first processing unit; receive an input indicating the user has entered an identifier to be checked and requesting that the identifier be checked on at least one web site; and in response to the input, going out to the at least one web site and checking if the identifier is in use on the web site; and provide a display indicating that the identifier is registered on the web site. Preferably, the instructions further include instructions for directing the first processing unit to provide a display showing a plurality of icons, each icon representing a different web site; and the receiving an input comprises receiving a signal that the user has clicked on one of the icons. Preferably, the instructions for directing further comprise instructions for directing the first processing unit to record the web sites on which the identifier is registered.","The invention not only provides a method and apparatus for creating a repository for identity graphs and social graphs without any laborious entering of information, but also provides a method and apparatus for allowing users\u2014and third parties on the users' behalf\u2014to manage, distribute, discover and synchronize their identity information and subsequent social connections online. Numerous other features, objects, and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","This disclosure describes a repository and distribution system  () for collecting users' online identities, and allowing them to be discovered, retrieved and\/or updated through a central access point  by third parties ,  and  and other users , , . The system also includes collection, discovery and distribution of a user's social graph , that is, the user's connections and communities on sites and applications throughout the web (see, ). The system further includes user-set permissions (see below) for access, management and sharing of the user's information. The system also provides analytics, statistics and normalization for operations and data relating to users' behaviors throughout the web (see , , , and ). Thus, the system lends itself to web service or application recommendations and advertising decisions based on the collected identity graphs (IGs), social graphs (SGs) and statistics.","It should be understood that in this disclosure the term \u201cweb site\u201d also means \u201cweb service\u201d and \u201capplication\u201d. The term \u201capplication\u201d means a software application that connects to the internet. While we shall try to use the terms web site, web service and application throughout this disclosure, it should be understood that the use of one includes the others. It should also be understood that the system described herein is currently in the state of development, and those skilled in the art will recognized that many of the elements will be changed in further development iterations. For example, to accelerate the pace of development, software shortcuts are sometimes taken. Thus, it should be recognized that the disclosure is not meant to limit the application, but is intended to be exemplary. It is expected that those skilled in the art will be able to create many variations and more sophisticated versions of the application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","20","34","38","39","40","48","49","40","48","49","50","34","38","39","40","48","49","50","22","20","34","38","39","33","35","36","37","50","20","40","48","42","44","46","34","38","39","32","50","52","56","54","58"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","40","48","49","60","62","64","50","72","74","76","60","62","64","18","72","74","72","74","60","62","64"]},"Turning now to , one embodiment of a collection  of identity graphs , , ,  and  are shown. The user represented by identity graph  has identities on n web sites or applications  through . The specific name the user has on each web site or application may be the same or different. However, even if the names are the same, each web site or application can result in a different identity, since the fact that that person is associated with a particular web site is preferably part of the identity graph. These identities are collected by the system  of the invention into the identity graph . Each of the users represented by identity graphs , ,  and  has identities , , , , respectively, on m, p, q, and r, respectively, different web services or applications, and these identities are collected into identity graphs, , , , and , respectively. The users represented by identity graphs , ,  and  have relationships  with the user represented by IG  on a first web site or application.

The system provides a widget , which shall be describe below, and, simply by clicking on an icon for the web site or application, the user can use the widget to retrieve information as the user desires. A third way that the system may collect IG or SG information is for the user  to enter the information directly via link . With permission of the user, the system  according to the invention also enables the sharing of the information in repository  with any interested third party . This will also be described below. This sharing through link  provides an additional method for IG or SG information to be passed to repository . Whenever shared information is updated by a third party, this updated information may be transferred back to the repository. In addition, the sharing function encourages third parties to sign up on the system and thus enhances the collection of information.","Turning to , , , , and  there is shown exemplary documentation describing a portion of the method in which third party web services and applications , , and  may interact with the repository .  is shown out of order because the call function for contacts could be completed only after much of the other software was developed. Specifically, , , ,  and  describe how a third party web service or application can obtain an API key and pull IG\/SG information from the repository and push IG\/SG information into the repository.  illustrates a preferred embodiment according to the invention of documentation  of an API call to obtain an identity graph of an Internet user. The documentation  first describes the usefulness of the call, i.e., to learn more about a particular user's other on line services, and explains that the lookup is preferably done via an email address. However, lookups can also be done via other identifiers, particularly if the user requests it. It also notes that the system does not return anything without the user's permission, which is provided via a permissions page (see below) or otherwise, such as through the web service via the API or via the widget described below. The GET is shown at . The get directs the call to the system web site services engine and indicates at  that the request must include an API key and at  that it must include a user identifier. The GET request parameters are described at  and include a parameter column , a type column , and a description column . As indicated, both the API key and the user identifier are preferably strings. We shall discuss below how the caller gets an API key and user identifier and the preferred form of the API key and the user identifier.","The documentation  describes the values returned by the call  at , which description includes a parameter column , a type column  and a description column . All the parameters are preferably strings. The first parameter returned, svcid, is the ID of the service in the repository . The second parameter svcName, is the displayable name of the web service, and is used to output information to users. The fourth parameter returned, usrSvcid, is the unique identifier of the user on the particular web service. As we will see below, the user can specify this.

As it passes through the invention numerous statistics are collected including the date and time, the referring site, referring host, ip address, etc. It should also be noted that type of URL redirection (sometimes referred to as URL forwarding) used by the invention in this process affects the ranking of the link's final destination in popular search engines.

A permissions page includes a listing, similar to  () of all the web services, application, and users registered with the repository management system . For each such entity, there are entries, preferably each under a separate column, for the user to grant specific permissions, such as the permission to share public data, the permission to share certain data, such as photographs or relationships, the permission to share private data, or only specific private data, such as email addresses. A user can grant permissions globally, globally for specific permissions, or individually. The permissions can be for within the repository web site , or for other web sites, either individually or globally. Permissions are preferably data specific. That is, permissions for a first piece of data may be different for a second piece of data. For example, one my restrict viewing of data on Twitter to only specific family members, while viewing of data on LinkedIn is restricted only to professional contacts. One listing, similar to , for web sites and applications is generated by activating a Service Permissions button, and another listing of individual users is generated by clicking a User Permissions button. Preferably, the User Permissions button activates a drop down menu with a set of alphabetic buttons, a, b, c, d, etc., each of which generates the users whose identities begin with that letter of the alphabet. Service Permissions button may also activate a drop down menu that allows selection of services either alphabetically or by service types, or both.","A feature of the invention is that it provides an identity graph and the ability for a user to manage the identity graph and makes the identity graph portable to other web sites and applications.","A related feature of the invention is that it provides an social graph and the ability for a user to manage the social graph and makes the social graph portable to other web sites and applications.","Another feature of the invention is that it permits identity and social graph discovery, autodiscovery, recording and updating.","Still another feature of the invention is that it provides an identity graph and social graph analysis and statistics package, which are also portable to different web sites.","Yet another feature of the invention is that it provides for normalization of actions and data over the social web site and applications space, particularly that space relating to identity graphs and social graphs.","There has been described a novel system and method for creation, portability, and normalization of actions and data in the social web and application space. The identity and social graphs and the openness of the system results in a highly desirable comprehensive and decentralized internet identity graph, social graph and repository management system. The system is simple, universal, and economical, without requiring any additional data entry above what normally occurs when individuals register at a web site. In fact, the system reduces the requirement for data entry since the system requires only one entry to normalize data across the entire social web space, and is able to go out and find all identities of a user if only one is known, as well as find all web sites and applications to which a target user belongs. This reduces internet traffic because one does not have to get this information by trial and error. It also reduces internet traffic in that it significantly lowers the numbers of errors in performing actions and entering data, since each user selects a preferred system. Since the user constantly uses the same form of actions and data, it is easier for the user to remember how to perform actions and the names for different types of data. A feature that significantly reduces internet traffic is that all the web sites and applications on which a user is registered can be managed from a single site. The invention has numerous other novel features and advantages. For example, the invention can be integrated into any web site at little cost or labor.","It should be understood that the particular embodiments shown in the drawings and described within this specification are for purposes of example and should not be construed to limit the invention, which will be described in the claims below.
