title: Instrument for delivery of implant
abstract: A surgical instrument has a main shaft underlying a slide member. The slide member is movable in a proximal-distal direction. The distal end of the slide member has an open position and a closed position. The closed position is spaced from the open position in the proximal-distal direction. There is a gap between the distal end of the slide member and the distal end of the main shaft when the instrument is in the open position. The gap is smaller when the instrument is in the closed position. An implant can be received in the gap and delivered to a damaged tissue site using the instrument. An implant protector can be used when delivering the implant with the instrument. A pivotable implant cover can be used to protect the implant instead of the slide member.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO U.S. PROVISIONAL PATENT APPLICATION","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application is a Utility Application based upon a U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/483,805 entitled \u201cINSTRUMENT FOR DELIVERY OF IMPLANT\u201d filed by Anthony D. Zannis, John W. Kemppainen, Andrew M. Jacobs, Carolyn K. Day, Rhonda B. Clarke, Herbert E. Schwartz, Prasanna Malaviya and Danny E. McAdams filed on Jun. 30, 2003, the complete disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.","The present invention relates generally to a surgical instrument for delivering an implant to a damaged tissue site in the human body.","Several different types of soft tissue are found in human joints. For example, a joint can include articular hyaline cartilage, intra-articular fibrocartilage, tendons and ligaments. Articular hyaline cartilage is found on the surfaces of the bones of the joint. Intra-articular cartilage is found between the joint surfaces. Tendons connect muscle to the bones of the joint, and ligaments connect articular extremities of the bones of the joint.","When the soft tissue of a joint is no longer healthy, there can be debilitating pain in the joint. Soft tissue health can be adversely affected by disease, aging, or trauma. The adverse effects of disease, aging and trauma can be, for example, in the form of a tear in the soft tissue, or in the form of a breakdown, thinning or delamination of the tissue.","One form of intra-articular cartilage that is frequently damaged or degenerated is the meniscus of the knee. The meniscus is frequently damaged in twisting injuries. It is also damaged with repetitive impact over time. Meniscus degeneration can also occur by aging; as a person ages, the meniscus can become soft in places, so that even common motions like squatting can cause meniscal tears.","Common surgical procedures for treating meniscal damage include tear repairs and menisectomies. A tear repair is most commonly performed when the tear is a clean longitudinal vertical lesion in the vascular red zone of the meniscus. The basic strategy is to stabilize the tear by limiting or eliminating radial separation of the faces of the tear when the meniscus is load bearing. Many devices and surgical procedures exist for repairing meniscal tears by approximating the faces of the meniscus at the tear. Examples of such devices and procedures are disclosed in the following U.S. Pat. Nos.: 6,319,271; 6,306,159; 6,306,156; 6,293,961; 6,156,044; 6,152,935; 6,056,778; 5,993,475; 5,980,524; 5,702,462; 5,569,252; 5,374,268; 5,320,633; and 4,873,976.","Menisectomies involve the surgical removal of part of the meniscus. Such procedures have generally been performed in cases of radial tears, horizontal tears, vertical longitudinal tears outside the vascular zone, complex tears, or defibrillation. Although menisectomies provide immediate relief to the patient, in the long term the absence of part of the meniscus can cause cartilage wear on the condylar surface, eventually leading to arthritic conditions in the joint.","Such surgical procedures are commonly performed arthroscopically. In arthroscopy, small incisions are made at the affected joint to form portals for the insertion of instruments, including a small lens and lighting system (an arthroscope). The arthroscope is connected to a viewing device, such as a television monitor to allow the surgeon to see the interior of the joint. Other instruments are inserted through other portals to perform a variety of tasks. For example, the surgical instrument may include an implement for manipulating native tissue (for example, tissue grasping, tissue cutting, bone abrading).","Typical surgical instruments used in arthroscopic procedures include rongeurs, such as the Kerrison rongeur, punch forceps, basket forceps, suction punches and cup curet, for example. Examples of arthroscopic instruments are described and illustrated in O'Connor's Textbook of Arthroscopic Surgery, 2ed., 1992, Chapter 19.","Other common surgical techniques in orthopaedic surgery include open surgery and mini-arthrotomy. For example, for knee surgery, the surgery may be performed by an open knee arthrotomy, where the incision may typically be 20-30 cm in length, and wherein the patella is everted during surgery. Knee surgery may also be performed by a mini-knee arthrotomy, where the incision is typically 10-13 cm in length and patella tension is avoided.","Intra-articular fibrocartilage is also present, for example, in the temporomandibular joint and between vertebrae. Injury and degeneration can also occur to the intra-articular fibrocartilage in these other joints.","Another common site of soft tissue injury and degeneration is the rotator cuff in the shoulder. The rotator cuff comprises the tendons that attach muscles to a bone in the shoulder. Where one of the tendons is thin, delaminated or frayed to the point that surgical repair or reconstruction is necessary, the damaged tendon can be reinforced with graft tissue or with an orthopaedic implant.","A variety of orthopaedic implants are available for treating damaged soft tissue at a joint site. One commercially available orthopaedic implant is the RESTORE orthobiologic implant. The RESTORE orthobiologic implant comprises layers of small intestine submucosa. The commercial RESTORE product is typically sold in the form of a thin circular sheet with a diameter of about 2.5 inches in diameter. Other shapes and sizes of RESTORE orthobiologic implants can be used. In addition, the surgeon can cut the commercial RESTORE product intra-operatively to the desired shape and size. The RESTORE implant is used in treating rotator cuff injuries.","Orthopaedic implants for treatment of damaged menisci are disclosed in the following U.S. Pat. Nos.: 6,042,610; 5,735,903; 5,681,353; 5,306,311; 5,108,438; 5,007,934; and 4,880,429.","Orthopaedic implants useful in approximating, repair or regeneration of fibrocartilage are disclosed in the following applications for U.S. patent application Ser.

Cross reference is also made to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/172,347 entitled \u201cHybrid Biologic-Synthetic Bioabsorbable Scaffolds\u201d which was filed on Jun. 14, 2002, which is assigned to the same assignee as the present application, and which is incorporated by reference herein. Additional orthopaedic implants are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,176,880, entitled \u201cTissue Grant Construct for Replacement of Cartilaginous Structures\u201d and U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 09\/767,345 and 09\/767,346 of the same title, both filed on Jan. 23, 2001 and claiming priority to U.S. Pat. No. 6,176,880, which are incorporated by reference herein.","As used herein \u201cimplant\u201d is intended to mean any device that is intended to be implanted at a damaged tissue site for the approximation, repair or regeneration of tissue at the damaged tissue site. \u201cOrthopaedic implant\u201d is intended to mean any device that is intended to be implanted at a joint site for the approximation, repair or regeneration of soft tissue at the joint site. While \u201cimplant\u201d and \u201corthopaedic implant\u201d are intended to include all of the devices identified in the preceding paragraph and commercial devices such as the RESTORE\u2122 orthobiologic implant, \u201cimplant\u201d and \u201corthopaedic implant\u201d should not be limited to these particular devices or to any particular material unless expressly set forth in the claims. For example, \u201cimplant\u201d and \u201corthopaedic implant\u201d as used herein are intended to include devices made from synthetic sources, from purified natural fibers as well as devices made from naturally occurring tissue. An implant may comprise a tissue scaffold, patch or graft (including autografts, allografts and hetergrafts), for example. In addition, \u201cimplant\u201d and \u201corthopaedic implant\u201d are intended to include such devices either alone or in combination with bioactive agents, biologically-derived agents, cells, a biological lubricant, a biocompatible synthetic or a biocompatible inorganic material, for example.","Materials forming orthopaedic implants can find use in other parts of the body as well. Accordingly, the term \u201cimplant\u201d is intended to mean such materials regardless of their intended end use.","The present invention provides a surgical instrument that allow for delivery of implants to a damaged tissue site. The damaged tissue site can be a damaged joint site, such as in the area of the meniscus in the human knee joint or in the area of the rotator cuff of the shoulder joint, and the implant can be an orthopaedic implant used to approximate, repair or regenerate damaged or diseased soft tissue at the damaged joint site.","In one aspect, the present invention provides a surgical instrument for delivering an implant to a damaged tissue site. The surgical instrument comprises a main shaft and a slide member. The main shaft has a proximal end and a distal end. The side member is juxtaposed with the main shaft and also has a proximal end and a distal end. The surgical instrument has open and closed positions. The slide member is movable in a proximal-distal direction with respect to the main shaft to move the surgical instrument between the open and closed positions. The distal end of the slide member has an open position when the surgical instrument is in the open position and a closed position when the surgical instrument is in the closed position. The closed position of the distal end of the slide member is spaced from the open position of the distal end of the slide member in the proximal-distal direction. There is a gap between the distal end of the slide member and the distal end of the main shaft when the instrument is in the open position. There is a smaller gap between the distal end of the slide member and the distal end of the main shaft when the instrument is in the closed position.","In another aspect, the present invention provides a surgical instrument for delivering an implant to a damaged tissue site. The surgical instrument comprises a main shaft and a cover. The main shaft has a distal end shaped to define a well for receiving a substantial portion of the implant. The cover is movable between a position substantially overlying the well to protect the implant to another position wherein a substantial part of the well is exposed.","In another aspect, the present invention provides a combination comprising a surgical instrument for delivering an implant to a damaged tissue site and an implant. The implant includes an edge. The surgical instrument includes a main shaft having a distal end and a slide member juxtaposed with the main shaft. The slide member has a distal end. The edge of the implant is received between the distal end of the main shaft and the distal end of the slide member. The shape of the distal end of the main shaft and the shape of the distal end of the slide member follow the shape of the edge of the implant.","The instrument of the present invention is useful in delivering an orthopaedic implant, as defined above, to a damaged joint site in the body. The damaged joint site may for example be an intra-articular site such as the knee, where the instrument can be used to deliver an orthopaedic implant for use in approximating, repairing or regenerating a diseased or damaged meniscus. The damaged intra-articular site may be in other locations in the body, such as the temporomandibular joint, between vertebrae, or any site where there is fibrocartilage in need of approximation, repair or regeneration. The instrument of the present invention can also be used to deliver an orthopaedic implant to location outside of the intra-articular space of a joint site. For example, the instrument of the present invention can be used to deliver an orthopaedic implant to a damaged joint site such as the area of the rotator cuff of the shoulder joint site. Unless expressly limited in the claims, \u201cjoint site\u201d as used herein is intended to include the intra-articular space and other areas near the bones comprising a joint. \u201cDamaged joint site\u201d, unless expressly limited in the claims, is intended to mean such a joint site that requires surgical repair, whether due to injury, degeneration or disease.","The instrument of the present invention may also find utility in delivering an implant to damaged tissue sites other than the joints. \u201cDamaged tissue site\u201d, unless expressly limited in the claims, is intended to mean a tissue site that requires surgical repair, whether due to injury, degeneration or disease.","Several embodiments of the instrument of the present invention are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. The first embodiment of the instrument is illustrated in  and -. The first illustrated instrument  includes a handle  at the proximal end , a main shaft  and a slide rod . The main shaft  and slide rod  extend from the handle  to the distal end  of the instrument . The first illustrated instrument  may also optionally include a delivery guide , shown in , ,  and  but not in ,  and -.","The handle  of the first illustrated instrument  includes two arms ,  connected together at a pivot . Each arm ,  includes a grip portion ,  through which the surgeon may insert a thumb and a finger and squeeze to pivot the arms about pivot . As the grip portions ,  are brought closer together, the slide arm  is moved from the open or unclamped position shown in ,  and  to the closed or clamped position shown in ,  and .  also illustrate a possible locking mechanism  that cooperates with the arms ,  for locking the slide arm  in either the open or closed positions.","One arm  has a body portion  that is connected to a proximal end  of the main shaft  of the instrument  through standard means, such as a set screw or the like. The body portion  of the arm  is opposite the grip portion  and has an opening and channel (not shown) extending in a proximal-distal direction to receive the proximal end portion  of the main shaft . As shown in , the proximal end portion  of the main shaft  may have indentations or cavities ,  that align with holes (not shown) in the body portion  of the arm  so that screws or the like can be used to secure the main shaft  to the body  of the arm . It will be appreciated that other means of connecting the main shaft  to the arm  may be used, and that the main shaft  and arm  could be made integral if desired.","The other arm  has a top end  opposite its grip portion . The pivot  that connects the two arms ,  is positioned between the top end  and grip portion . When the grip portions ,  are squeezed together, the top portion  of the arm  is pivoted in a generally proximal direction. When the grip portions ,  are released, the top end  of the arm  is pivoted in a generally distal direction.","The top end  of the arm  has a hole or slot  (see ) that receives the proximal end  of the slide rod . A pin  or other suitable mechanical connector is used to connect the slide rod  to the top end  of the arm; this pin may provide a pivotable connection. As shown in , the proximal end  of the slide rod  has a hole  to receive the pin . A portion of the slide rod  at its proximal end  has a reduced height or thickness; this portion, designated  in , extends through the channel (not shown) in the body  of arm . Thus, when the top end  of the arm  is moved in a distal direction, the slide rod  is also moved in a distal direction; when the top end  of the arm  is moved in a proximal direction, the side rod  is also moved in a proximal direction.","As shown in the top plan view of , the slide rod  has a thin elongate portion  extending from its proximal end  to a thicker curved portion  at its distal end . As shown in the side elevation view of , the slide rod also has a pair of spaced, integral downward-extending extensions , . Each extension ,  has a distal edge or surface ,  defining an obtuse angle with the bottom edge or surface  of the adjacent segments of the thin elongate portion . The distal edges ,  are parallel to each other. Each extension ,  also has a through slot ,  (see  and ). The through slots ,  of both extensions ,  are parallel to each other and extend upward in a distal direction. As shown in , the through slots ,  each receive a pin , .","A substantial part of the thin elongate portion  of the slide rod  is received in an elongate channel  of the main shaft . The channel  is defined by two spaced parallel side walls ,  and a bottom wall . The channel  extends from the junction of the main shaft  with the body  of the arm  to a thick curved portion  at the distal end  of the main shaft . As shown in , the curved portion  of the main shaft  is displaced downward from the bottom edge or surface  of the bottom wall .","As shown in , the side walls ,  of the main shaft  have spaced, aligned through holes , , , . These through holes , , ,  receive pins ,  to mount the slide rod  to the main shaft . As shown in , the bottom wall  has a pair of slots ,  positioned near the through holes , , , . As shown in , the extensions ,  of the slide rod  are received in these slots , .","As can be seen in , the curved portions ,  of the main shaft  and slide rod  are similarly shaped. Each has a radius of about 1.1 inches. In the illustrated embodiment, the curved portion  of the slide rod has a length of 0.773 inches and the curved portion  of the main shaft  has a length of 0.783 inches. It should be understood that these dimensions are provided as examples only; the present invention is not limited to any particular dimension unless expressly set forth in the claims.","To use the first illustrated instrument , the grips ,  are moved apart to place the instrument in the open or unclamped position shown in ,  and . In this position, the distal end  of the slide rod  extends distally beyond the distal end  of the main shaft . As shown in , the curved portions ,  of the slide rod  and main shaft  are spaced apart by a gap  of about 1-2 mm. The total height of the distal end of the instrument, including the heights of the gap  (at the fully open or unclamped position) and the heights of the curved portions ,  is about 5 mm.","With the instrument in the open or unclamped position, the surgeon can then place a portion of the implant in the gap between the spaced curved portions ,  of the slide rod  and main shaft . As shown in , a meniscal implant, shown at  may comprise a flat periphery  and an inner wedge-shaped portion  with curved inner and outer edges , . Such a meniscal implant  may be used to replace a part of a damaged meniscus removed in a menisectomy. In the illustrated embodiment, the curvature of the spaced curved portions ,  of the slide rod  and main shaft  follows the curvature of the inner edge  of the wedge-shaped portion  of the implant. Thus, the curvature of the spaced portions ,  of the slide rod and main shaft protect the inner edge  of the wedge-shaped portion  of the implant as it is introduced to the damaged tissue site.","The flat periphery  of the implant  is inserted in the gap  between the curved portions ,  of the main shaft  and slide rod . The curved inner edge  of the inner wedge-shaped portion  of the implant is placed along side the curved edges of the portions ,  of the main shaft and slide rod.","When the instrument is in this fully open or unclamped position, the pins ,  are at the lowest ends of the slots ,  in the slide rod , and the slide rod is slightly raised with respect to the channel  of the main shaft . As shown in , in this position, substantial portions of the slide rod extensions ,  are above the slots ,  and the distal end  of the slide rod  extends slightly beyond the distal end  of the main shaft .","Once the implant  is in position in the gap , the surgeon may close the instrument to clamp the implant between the curved portions ,  of the main shaft  and slide rod . The surgeon moves the grip portions ,  of the arms ,  closer together, causing the top end  of the arm  to pivot away from the body  of the arm . As the top end  of the arm  moves away from the body  of arm , the slide rod  is pulled in a proximal direction. As the slide rod  moves proximally, it also moves deeper into the channel  as the slots ,  of the extensions ,  move downward along the pins ,  until the pins ,  are at or near the top ends of the slots , . As the slide rod  is moved proximally and deeper into the channel , the extensions ,  move deeper into the slots ,  of the main shaft , and the curved portion  of the slide rod  moves closer to the curved portion of the main shaft . As the two curved portions ,  moves closer together, the gap  is closed, clamping the periphery  of the implant  between the two curved portions , . Thus, the total height of the distal end of the instrument decreases.","The surgeon may then deliver the implant  to the damaged tissue site. If the surgery is an arthroscopic procedure, or a mini-arthrotomy, access to the damaged tissue site may be confined. To prevent the implant  from being damaged by the close confines of the damaged tissue site, the surgeon may use the first illustrated instrument in combination with an implant protector.","One form of implant protector that may be used is an elongate tube as illustrated in . As there shown, the implant protector  comprises a hollow, open-ended tube that is oval-shaped in cross-section. The implant protector  has a slot  extending along its length. In the illustrated embodiment, the slot  is along the top of the tube. To use the instrument  with the implant protector , the surgeon may place the distal end  of the implant protector at the damaged tissue site, such as in the intra-articular space of the knee near the area where a portion of the meniscus has been removed. The implant protector  is long enough so that its proximal end  is exposed outside of the patient's body.","The surgeon may insert the distal end  of the instrument , with the implant  captured by the curved portions , , into the implant protector  and move the distal end  of the instrument  in a distal direction along the length of the implant protector  until the distal end  of the instrument  and the implant  are at the damaged tissue site beyond the distal end  of the implant protector . The surgeon may then release the implant  from the instrument .","To release the implant  from the instrument , the grip portions ,  of the arms ,  are moved apart. As the grip portions ,  are moved apart, the slide rod  is moved in a distal direction. As the slide rod  moves distally, the extensions ,  move upwardly and distally along the pins ,  and the entire slide rod  moves upward in the channel . As the slide rod  moves in an upward and distal direction, the curved portion  of the slide rod separates from the curved portion  of the main shaft , releasing the implant . The released implant may then be moved into its final position and secured to native tissue.","The surgeon may also use the device disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/609,768 entitled \u201cImplant Stabilizing Instrument, Kit and Method,\u201d filed concurrently herewith by Andrew M. Jacobs, Carolyn K. Day, Rhonda B. Clarke, Herbert E. Schwartz, John W. Kemppainen, Prasanna Malaviya and Anthony D. Zannis, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The instrument, kit and method disclosed in that patent application may be used to move and stabilize the implant while securing the implant to the native tissue.","It will be appreciated that the instrument  requires little space when in the open or unclamped position. This feature of the invention is particularly advantageous when delivering an implant to a damaged tissue site that is closely confined, such as in the intra-articular space of a joint.","To remove the instrument  from the implant protector , the instrument may be pulled in a proximal direction until its distal end  is free from the implant protector  outside of the patient's body. Alternatively, the surgeon may raise the instrument so that the main shaft  and slide rod  are raised through the slot  of the implant protector . Once the main shaft  and slide rod  are clear of the implant protector , the instrument may be moved out of the patient's body.","Alternative implant protectors can be used with the instrument . For example, as shown in , an implant protector  can comprise an elongate hollow, open-ended tube of circular cross-section. If desired, the implant protector  can have a slot as in the first illustrated implant protector .","Another implant protector  is illustrated in . This implant protector  is used in conjunction with the delivery guide  illustrated mounted on the instrument  in , ,  and . This implant protector  comprises an elongate guide shaft  and an integral protector  at its distal end . A portion of the guide shaft  is received in a complementary channel on the top of the delivery guide  to mount the implant protector  to the instrument . The integral protector  is sized and shaped to substantially surround the curved portions ,  of the instrument and an implant fixed between these curved portions , .","All of the implant protectors may be sized to fit through a standard arthroscopic portal. Typical arthroscopic portals have a length of about 8-12 mm. However, the surgical instrument  and implant protectors may also be used in a minimally invasive procedure, such as a mini-arthrotomy, as well as in an open arthrotomy or other orthopaedic surgical procedure. The instruments and protectors could have larger sizes for use in these other procedures. In addition, it should be understood that the present invention is not limited to any particular dimension unless expressly called for in the claims.","It will be appreciated that the structure of the first illustrated instrument  can be modified if desired. For example, parts shown as assembled may be made integral and parts shown as a single element may be constructed as assemblies. In addition, instead of providing curved end portions , , the end portions of the main shaft  and the slide rod  can be shaped to correspond with the shape of the implant if the implant is different from that shown in the drawings; for example, the distal ends ,  of the main shaft  and slide rod  could be straight. By following the shape of the inner edge of the implant, the end portions of the main shaft and slide rod protect the inner edge of the implant from potential damage as the implant is introduced to the damaged tissue site.","Another embodiment of a surgical instrument illustrating the principles of the present invention is illustrated in . The second illustrated instrument  includes a handle  at the proximal end , a main shaft  and a slide arm . The main shaft  and slide arm  extend from the handle  to the distal end  of the instrument .","The handle  of the second illustrated instrument  includes two arms ,  connected together at a pivot . Each arm ,  includes a grip portion ,  that the surgeon squeeze to pivot the arms about pivot . As the grip portions ,  are brought closer together, the slide arm  is moved from an open or unclamped position, shown in ,  and , to a closed or clamped position, shown in ,  and .","One arm  is integral with the main shaft  of the instrument . The other arm  is integral with the slide arm  of the instrument . When the grip portions ,  of the arms ,  are squeezed together, the top portion of the arm  and the integral slide arm  are moved in a generally distal direction. When the grip portions ,  are released, a spring mechanism  urges the arms ,  and the integral main shaft  and slide arm  to the open or unclamped position shown in .","The slide arm  of the second illustrated instrument  has a distal end  illustrated in side elevation in . As there shown, the distal end  is tapered in side elevation. The height of the distal end  of the slide arm  gradually increases in the proximal direction. The top surface  of the distal end  of the slide arm  defines an angle \u03b1 with the bottom surface  of the distal end  of the slide arm .","The main shaft  of the second illustrated instrument  has a distal end  that is smoothly curved, or bull-nosed in shape. The distal end  is shaped to define an enlarged well  that may receive part of an implant. The well  is open at its top facing the bottom surface  of the slide arm . The well  may be sized and shaped so that a substantial part of the implant is received within the well .","The minimum vertical distance between the bottom surface  of the slide arm  and the top surface  of the main shaft  surrounding the well  is shown in  at d. Generally, distance dis greater than the thickness of the implant. Also as shown in  and , a substantial part of the well  is exposed or uncovered when the instrument  is in the open or unclamped position.","In contrast, when the instrument  is placed in the closed or clamped position, the minimum vertical distance between the bottom surface  of the slide arm  and the top surface  of the main shaft  surrounding the well  decreases substantially to the distance shown at din . Generally, distance dis equal to or slightly less than the thickness of the implant. Also as shown in  and , when a substantial part of the well  is covered by the distal end  of the slide arm  when the instrument  is in the closed or clamped position.","Thus, as shown in , when the instrument  is in the open or unclamped position, the implant  rests loosely on and in the well  at the distal end  of the main shaft  and the implant is substantially uncovered. When the instrument  is in the closed or clamped position a shown in , part of the implant  is secured or squeezed between the bottom surface  of the slide arm  and the top surface  of the main shaft  and the implant is substantially covered by the distal end of the slide arm . Only a small part of the periphery of the implant  is exposed. With the instrument  and implant  in the position shown in , the implant  will be substantially protected from damage as it is introduced to the damaged tissue site. The surgeon can use standard surgical procedures to introduce the implant using the second illustrated instrument , and may use the technique described above using implant protectors like those shown in . However, with the second illustrated instrument , it may not be necessary to use separate implant protectors like those shown in  since the distal end of the instrument  substantially encloses the implant to protect the implant from damage. In addition, if no implant protector is used, the bull-nose distal end of the second instrument  may be smooth and rounded to prevent cutting or abrasion of native tissue as the bull-nose distal end is moved through native tissue to deliver the implant.","An alternative distal end for the instrument of  is shown in . As there shown, the distal end of the main shaft could be open instead of bull-nosed as in the embodiment illustrated in . The distal surfaces of the distal end of the main shaft may be finished to be smooth with no sharp edges to damage tissue as the instrument is introduced to the damaged tissue site. In , the same reference numbers have been used as in , followed by the letter \u201ca\u201d to indicate that  is an alternative embodiment. The remaining features of the instrument of  may be like those described above for the instrument of .","With both the first and second illustrated instruments , , the distal end ,  of the slide rod or arm ,  is displaced in the proximal-distal direction as the instrument is moved between the open and closed position. In both of these instruments, the gap between the distal end ,  of the slide rod or arm ,  and the distal end ,  of the main shaft ,  decreases as the instrument is closed or clamped. In both of these instruments, the distal end of the slide rod or arm moves between the open and closed positions without pivoting. And in both of these instruments , , the maximum distance between the top surface of the distal end of the slide rod or arm and the bottom surface of the distal end of the main shaft can be made to be less than 12 mm so that the instrument can be used in arthroscopic surgery and so that the instrument can be opened to release the implant in a confined space, such as that present in a typical intra-articular site.","If the maximum dimension of the instrument is of less concern, the distal ends of the slide arm and main shaft may be modified from the structures described above. For example, as shown in , a main shaft  could be provided with a distal end  shaped like that of the second instrument , with a bull-nosed end and an enlarged well . Instead of comprising a slide member, the top member could comprise a pivotable cover  at the distal end , connected to one of the arms (not shown) through an actuator cable  and to the main shaft  through a hinge pin . The design shown in  should be suitable to protect the implant from damage as the implant is delivered to the damaged tissue site, since a substantial part of the implant can be received in the well  and since the implant will be substantially covered by the pivotable cover . In this embodiment, the distal surfaces of the main shaft  and pivotable cover  can be curved and smooth to prevent damage to native tissue as the implant is delivered.","All of the above illustrated instruments ,  can be made of standard materials for surgical instruments. The implant protectors ,  can also be made of standard materials, including surgical grade plastic such as ABS plastic.","Alternative designs for the delivery of implants to damaged tissue sites are disclosed in the following U.S. Patent Applications, filed concurrently herewith and incorporated by reference herein in their entireties: U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/610,287 entitled \u201cSlide and Kit for Delivering Implants,\u201d filed concurrently herewith by Thomas S. Camino, Anthony D. Zannis, John W. Kemppainen and Herbert E. Schwartz, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/610,288 entitled \u201cImplant Delivery Instrument,\u201d filed concurrently herewith by Anthony D. Zannis, Thomas S. Camino, John W. Kemppainen, Herbert E. Schwartz and Danny E. McAdams.","The present invention is expected to have particular utility in delivering orthopaedic implants to damaged joint sites, although it will be appreciated that the invention has broader applications. For example, the instrument of the present invention can also be used to deliver other types of implants to other damaged tissue sites in the body. The present invention could be used to deliver any type of tissue scaffold, patch, or graft (allograft, autograft or heterograft) to any type of tissue, and the illustrated embodiments may be modified if desired to allow for such use. Unless otherwise expressly limited, the claims should not be construed as being limited to the delivery of orthopaedic implants to damaged joint sites.","While only specific embodiments of the invention have been described and shown, it is apparent that various alternatives and modifications can be made thereto. Those skilled in the art will also recognize that certain additions can be made to the illustrative embodiments. It is, therefore, the intention in the appended claims to cover all such alternatives, modifications and additions as may fall within the true scope of the invention."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The invention will be better understood by reference to the figures of the drawings wherein like numbers denote like parts throughout and wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 1-2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 1-3","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIGS. 1-4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIGS. 1-5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIGS. 1-6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIGS. 1-6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIGS. 1-8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIGS. 1-8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 11"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIGS. 1-8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIGS. 1-8","FIG. 11"],"b":["14","14"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIGS. 1-8","FIG. 12"],"b":["15","15"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIGS. 9-10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 17","FIG. 6"],"b":["17","17"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 18","FIGS. 1-6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 19","FIG. 18"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 21","FIGS. 1-6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 22","FIG. 21"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 23","FIGS. 21-22"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 24"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 25","FIG. 24"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 26","FIG. 24","FIG. 25"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 27","FIG. 24","FIG. 26"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 28","FIG. 24"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 29","FIG. 24"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 30","FIG. 24"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 31","FIG. 24","FIG. 29"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 32","FIG. 24","FIG. 30"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 33"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 34","FIG. 33"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIG. 35","FIGS. 24-32"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 36","FIG. 35"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 37","FIG. 35"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":["FIG. 38","FIG. 36"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
