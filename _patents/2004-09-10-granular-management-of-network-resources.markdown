title: Granular management of network resources
abstract: The present invention provides a method and apparatus for granular management of network resources by accessing network device resources through associated references. In one embodiment, the references are group names, and one or more resources (i.e., a resource collection) within each network device in a telecommunications network may be linked with one or more group names. Group names (or other types of references) may then be used to limit a user's access to particular network device resources. That is, a user may only have access to those resources associated with group names to which the user has access. Over time, network device resources may be associated or disassociated with particular group names. As a result, group names provide users with dynamic access to network device resources. In one embodiment, the groups to which a user has access are defined within a user profile associated with the user. Grouping network device resources, therefore, allows for a granular view of each network device in the network by limiting a user's access to those resources corresponding to group names listed in their user profile. As one example, grouping may allow for customer network managementâ€”that is a customer's view is limited to only those network device resources for which they have subscribed.

Most network management software is based on the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), and a user connects to a network device by issuing an SNMP command, for example, read\/write or read only, followed by a password in the form of a community string. Often, only one community string is used to access the network device, and thus, all users allowed to access the network device must \u201cshare\u201d the community string. Sharing the community string and directly connecting a user to the network device reduces the security of the network device.","More advanced systems allow multiple SNMP community strings to be used to gain access to a network device. Generally, these community strings are stored in a table within the network device. Where a large number of users may be connected to the device, however, community strings may still need to be shared or the table in the network device must be very large.","Although one or more community strings may be shared by multiple users and used to access the same network device, community strings are normally different for each network device. Thus, to connect to multiple network devices, a user must separately connect (i.e., issue an SNMP command and community string) to each network device. This may take considerable time and requires the user to remember multiple community strings.","In addition, if the one or more community strings needed to access a network device must be changed\u2014for example, in response to a security problem\u2014every user allowed to access the device must be notified of the community string change. If the community string is changed quickly, then some users may be denied access until they receive the notification including the new password. If the community string is not changed until after an amount of time necessary to notify all users, then until the change is implemented, the security problem will continue.","The present invention provides a method and apparatus for granular management of network resources by accessing network device resources through associated references. In one embodiment, the references are group names, and one or more resources (i.e., a resource collection) within each network device in a telecommunications network may be linked with one or more group names. Group names (or other types of references) may then be used to limit a user's access to particular network device resources. That is, a user may only have access to those resources associated with group names to which the user has access. Over time, network device resources may be associated or disassociated with particular group names. As a result, group names provide users with dynamic access to network device resources. In one embodiment, the groups to which a user has access are defined within a user profile associated with the user. Grouping network device resources, therefore, allows for a granular view of each network device in the network by limiting a user's access to those resources corresponding to group names listed in their user profile. As one example, grouping may allow for customer network management\u2014that is a customer's view is limited to only those network device resources for which they have subscribed.","In one aspect, the present invention provides a method of managing a telecommunications network including associating a network device resource corresponding to a network device with a reference, generating a network device data request including the reference and retrieving network device data corresponding to the network device resource in accordance with the reference. Retrieving network device data corresponding to the network device resource in accordance with the reference may include using the reference to dynamically determine which network device data to retrieve, and the reference may be a group name. The method may also include storing network device resource data corresponding to the network device resource in a first data repository, where the network device resource data includes the reference, sending the network device data request including the reference to the first data repository, and retrieving network device data corresponding to the network device resource in accordance with the reference may include searching the first data repository for the reference and retrieving the network device resource data including the reference from the first data repository. In addition, the method may include storing user profile data in a second data repository, where the user profile data includes the reference, and generating a network device data request including the reference may include generating a network data request using the reference from the user profile data in the second data repository. The first data repository may be embedded within the network device, and both first and second data repositories may be databases. The network device resource may be a configured resource, and the configured resource may be a network protocol layer one resource, for example, a SONET path. The configured resource may be a network protocol upper layer resource, for example, a virtual ATM interface, an ATM permanent virtual circuit, an ATM interface, an MPLS interface, an IP interface or an MPLS path. Associating a network device resource corresponding to a network device with a reference may include associating multiple network device resources corresponding to a network device with a reference and retrieving network device data corresponding to the network device resource in accordance with the reference may include retrieving network device data corresponding to the resources in accordance with the reference.","The network device resource may be a first network device resource, the network device data request may be a first network device data request and the reference may be a first reference and the method may further include associating a second network device resource corresponding to the network device with a second reference, generating a second network device data request including the second reference and retrieving network device data corresponding to the second network device resource in accordance with the second reference.","In another aspect, the present invention provides a method of managing a telecommunications network including storing a reference in a first data repository, where the reference is associated with a network device in the telecommunications network, storing the reference in a second data repository, where the second data repository stores network device data corresponding to the network device and where the reference is associated with network device data corresponding to one or more network device resources, detecting a request from a user for data corresponding to the network device, generating a data access request to the second data repository using the reference from the first data repository and retrieving network device data associated with the reference from the second data repository. Retrieving network device data associated with the reference from the second data repository may include using the reference to dynamically determine which data in the second data repository is retrieved. The first and second data repositories may be databases and retrieving network device data associated with the reference from the second database may include using the reference in a database query to actively filter which data in the second database is retrieved. Generating a data access request to the second database using the reference from the first database may include generating a where clause including the reference and sending the where clause to the second database. The reference may be a group name, and the first and second data repositories may be databases. The first data repository may be a central data repository and the second data repository may be embedded within the network device. The method may further include displaying the retrieved data in a user interface. The first and second data repositories may be relational databases and the reference may be stored in a first table in the first database and in a second table in the second database, and the first table may be a user resource group table and the second table may be a managed resource group table.","The method may further include generating a user profile logical managed object (LMO) including the reference from the first data repository and generating a data access request to the second data repository using the reference from the first data repository may include generating a data access request to the second data repository using the reference from the user profile LMO. Prior to generating a user profile LMO, the method may include detecting a user log-on request. Detecting a request from a user for data corresponding to the network device may include detecting the user request through a network management system (NMS) client and sending a data request from the NMS client to an NMS server, where the NMS server generates the data access request to the second data repository using the reference from the first data repository and retrieves the network device data associated with the reference from the second data repository and the method may further include sending the retrieved data from the NMS server to the NMS client. The method may include generating a user profile logical managed object (LMO) at the NMS server, where the user profile LMO includes the reference from the first data repository, sending the NMS client the user profile LMO and generating a data access request to the second data repository using the reference from the first data repository may include generating a data access request to the second data repository utilizing the reference from the user profile LMO. Instead, the method may include generating a user profile LMO at the NMS server, where the user profile LMO includes the reference from the first data repository, generating a client user profile LMO at the NMS server, where the client user profile LMO includes the reference from the user profile LMO, sending the client user profile LMO to the NMS client and generating a data access request to the second data repository using the reference from the first data repository may include generating a data access request to the second data repository utilizing the reference from the client user profile LMO.","The method may also include removing the reference in the second data repository, detecting another request from the user for data corresponding to the network device, generating a data access request to the second data repository using the reference from the first data repository and returning an empty data set in response to the user request. The reference may be a first reference and the one or more network device resources may be a first one or more network device resources and the method may further include storing a second reference in the first data repository, where the second reference is associated with the network device, storing the second reference in the second data repository, where the second reference is associated with network device data corresponding to a second one or more network device resources, and generating a data access request to the second data repository using the reference from the first data repository may include generating a data access request to the second data repository using the first and second references from the first data repository and retrieving network device data associated with the reference from the second data repository may include retrieving network device data associated with the first and second references from the second data repository. The first and second one or more network device resources may comprise different network device resources or at least one common network device resource. The reference may be a first reference, the one or more network device resources may be a first one or more network device resources and the user may be a first user, and the method may further include storing a second reference in the first data repository, where the second reference is associated with the network device, storing the second reference in the second data repository, where the second reference is associated with network device data corresponding to a second one or more network device resources, detecting a request from a second user for data corresponding to the network device, generating a data access request to the second data repository using the second reference from the first data repository, and retrieving network device data associated with the second reference from the second data repository. The first and second references may comprise the same reference or different references. The reference may be a first reference and the network device may be a first network device, and the method may further include storing a second reference in the first data repository, where the second reference is associated with a second network device in the telecommunications network, storing the second reference in a third data repository, where the third data repository stores network device data corresponding to the second network device and where the second reference is associated with network device data corresponding to one or more network device resources within the second network device, detecting a request from the user for data corresponding to the second network device, generating a second data access request to the third data repository using the second reference from the first data repository and retrieving network device data associated with the second reference from the third data repository. The reference may be a first reference, the user may be a first user and the network device may be a first network device, and the method may further include storing a second reference in the first data repository, where the second reference is associated with a second network device in the telecommunications network, storing the second reference in a third data repository, where the third data repository stores network device data corresponding to the second network device and where the second reference is associated with network device data corresponding to one or more network device resources within the second network device, detecting a request from a second user for data corresponding to the second network device, generating a second data access request to the third data repository using the second reference from the first data repository and retrieving network device data associated with the second reference from the third data repository.","In yet another aspect, the present invention provides a method of managing a telecommunications network including storing a group name in a first database, storing the group name in a second database, detecting a request from a user for data corresponding to a network device in the telecommunications network, generating a data access request to the second database using the group name from the first database, retrieving data from the second database associated with the group name in response to the user request and displaying the data in a user interface.","In another aspect, the present invention provides a central switch fabric timing subsystem and distributed switch fabric timing subsystems. Distributed switch fabric subsystems reduce the cost of a minimally configured network device by providing a network device that separates the switch fabric functionality into a central switch fabric provided with a minimally configured network device and distributed switch fabrics that may be added to the network device as services are needed. Locating certain switch fabric components onto each forwarding card or other cards reduces the cost of a minimally configured network device. Additional costs may be achieved by providing 1:N redundancy for the distributed switch fabric subsystems as opposed to 1:1 redundancy.","In one aspect, the present invention provides a network device including a central switch fabric subsystem including at least one local switch fabric timing subsystem, a distributed switch fabric subsystem coupled to the central switch fabric subsystem and including at least one local switch fabric timing subsystem, and a central switch fabric timing subsystem for providing a reference signal to each of the local switch fabric timing subsystems. The reference signal may be a segment demarcation signal which may in turn be a start of segment signal.

The logical system model is layered on the physical network device to add a layer of abstraction between the network device hardware and the software applications executed by the network device. Each model within the logical system model contains metadata defining an object\/entity, attributes for the object and the object's relationships with other objects. Upgrading\/modifying an object is, therefore, much simpler than in current systems, since the relationship between objects and attributes required for each object are clearly defined in one location. When changes are made, the logical system model clearly shows what other models\/objects are affected and, therefore, may also need to be changed.

In addition, periodic roll calls between NMS clients and NMS servers may be executed over the out-of-band management channels to allow for quick discovery of any disconnects and reclaiming associated client resources. Further, periodic roll calls may be conducted between the NMS servers and the network devices to which they are connected, and if a server discovers that a network device has gone down, it may send a high priority notification to appropriate NMS clients over the out-of-band management channels to ensure a fast response by the clients. Sending high priority messages over out-of-band management channels maximizes client\/server management availability and, hence, network availability.","In one aspect, the present invention provides a management system for a telecommunications network including a server program capable of connecting to at least one network device in the telecommunications network and a client program capable of connecting to the server program and capable of registering a high priority application programming interface (API) with the server program, where the server program is capable of sending messages to the client program through the high priority API.","In another aspect, the present invention provides a management system for a telecommunications network including a server program capable of connecting to at least one network device in the telecommunications network and a client program capable of connecting to the server program, where the server program is capable of registering a high priority API with the client program and where the client program is capable of sending messages to the server program through the high priority API.","In still another aspect, the present invention provides a management system for a telecommunications network including a server program capable of connecting to at least one network device in the telecommunications network and a client program capable of connecting to the server program and capable of registering a first high priority API with the server program, where the server program is capable of sending messages to the client program through the first high priority API, and where the server program is further capable of registering a second high priority API with the client program and the client program is capable of sending messages to the server program through the second high priority API.","In another aspect, the present invention provides a management system for a telecommunications network including a plurality of server programs capable of connecting to plurality of network devices in the telecommunications network and a plurality of client programs capable of connecting to the server programs and capable of registering a plurality of high priority APIs with the server programs, where the server programs are capable of sending messages to the client programs through the high priority APIs.","In yet another aspect, the present invention provides a management system for a telecommunications network including a plurality of server programs capable of connecting to a plurality of network devices in the telecommunications network and a plurality of client programs capable of connecting to the server programs, where the server programs are capable of registering a plurality of high priority APIs with the client programs and where the client programs are capable of sending messages to the server programs through the high priority APIs.","In still another aspect, the present invention provides a management system for a telecommunications network including a plurality of server programs capable of connecting to a plurality of network devices in the telecommunications network and a plurality of client programs capable of connecting to the server programs and capable of registering a first plurality of high priority APIs with the server programs, where the server programs are capable of sending messages to the client programs through the first plurality of high priority APIs, and where the server programs are further capable of registering a second plurality of high priority APIs with the client programs and the client programs are capable of sending messages to the server programs through the second plurality of high priority APIs.","In another aspect, the present invention provides a method of managing a telecommunications network including executing a server program, executing a client program, initiating a connection between the client program and the server program, registering a high priority API with the server program, and sending messages from the server program to the client program through the high priority API.","In yet another aspect, the present invention provides a method of managing a telecommunications network including executing a server program, executing a client program, initiating a connection between the client program and the server program, registering a high priority API with the client program, and sending messages from the client program to the server program through the high priority API.","In another aspect, the present invention provides a method and apparatus for improving the configuration of virtual connections. Specifically, virtual path identifier (VPI) and virtual channel identifier (VCI) Availability Indexes are made available to network administrators. The Availability Indexes present valid, available values. Thus, the potential for misconfigurations is reduced and even less experienced network administrators may easily configure virtual connections. The Availability Indexes provide administrators with control over exactly which paths and channels are allocated for each connection while eliminating the guesswork and tracking burden present in current network\/element management systems. Availability Indexes also reduce the time and frustration required to configure virtual connections.","In one aspect, the present invention provides a method of managing a telecommunications network including detecting a selection of a virtual connection configuration option, detecting a selection of an Availability Index option and displaying a list of available values.","In another aspect, the present invention provides a method of managing a telecommunications network including detecting a selection of a virtual path connection configuration option, detecting a selection of a virtual path identifier (VPI) Availability Index option and displaying a list of available VPI values.","In still another aspect, the present invention provides a method of managing a telecommunications network including detecting a selection of a virtual channel connection configuration option, detecting a selection of a virtual channel identifier (VCI) Availability Index option and displaying a list of available VCI values.","In yet another aspect, the present invention provides a management system for a telecommunications network including a virtual path identifier (VPI) availability index including a list of available VPI values.","In another aspect, the present invention provides a management system for a telecommunications network including a virtual channel identifier (VCI) availability index including a list of available VCI values.","In another aspect, the present inventions provides a method of apparatus for addressing distributed network devise processors coupled together thorough an isolated control plane. Specifically, where an Ethernet switch control plane is isolated within a network device, each processor is associated with an identifier unique within the network device and the identifiers are used as Media Access Control (MAC) addresses. Where control planes within multiple network devices may be connected together and the connected control planes remain isolated between the connected network devices, each processor is associated with an identified unique across the connected network devices and the identifiers are used as control plan addresses. Using identifiers as addresses in isolated control planes avoids the need to assign and track globally unique addresses.","In one aspect, the present invention provides a method of managing a telecommunications network device, including a plurality of distributed processors coupled together through an isolated Ethernet switch control plane including associating each of the distributed processors with an identifier that is unique within the network device and using the identifiers as Media Access Control (MAC) control plane addresses on the Ethernet switch control plan.","In another aspect, the present invention provides a method of managing a telecommunications network, including a plurality of network devices, wherein each network decide includes a plurality of distributed processors coupled together through a control plane, and wherein the control planes of the plurality of network devices are coupled together and isolated between the plurality of network devices, including associating each of the distributed processors within each of the network devices with an identified that is unique across the plurality of network devices and using the identifiers as control plane addresses.","A modular software architecture solves some of the more common scenarios seen in existing architectures when software is upgraded or new features are deployed.","Software modularity involves functionally dividing a software system into individual modules or processes, which are then designed and implemented independently. Inter-process communication (IPC) between the processes is carried out through message passing in accordance with well-defined application programming interfaces (APIs) generated from the same logical system model using the same code generation system. A database process is used to maintain a primary data repository within the computer system\/network device, and APIs for the database process are also generated from the same logical system model and using the same code generation system ensuring that all the processes access the same data in the same way. Another database process is used to maintain a secondary data repository external to the computer system\/network device; this database receives all of its data by exact database replication from the primary database.","A protected memory feature also helps enforce the separation of modules. Modules are compiled and linked as separate programs, and each program runs in its own protected memory space. In addition, each program is addressed with an abstract communication handle, or logical name. The logical name is location-independent; it can live on any card in the system. The logical name is resolved to a physical card\/process during communication. If, for example, a backup process takes over for a failed primary process, it assumes ownership of the logical name and registers its name to allow other processes to re-resolve the logical name to the new physical card\/process. Once complete, the processes continue to communicate with the same logical name, unaware of the fact that a switchover just occurred.","Like certain existing architectures, the modular software architecture dynamically loads applications as needed. Beyond prior architectures, however, the modular software architecture removes significant application dependent data from the kernel and minimizes the link between software and hardware. Instead, under the modular software architecture, the applications themselves gather necessary information (i.e., metadata and instance data) from a variety of sources, for example, text files, JAVA class files and database views, which may be provided at run time or through the logical system model.","Metadata facilitates customization of the execution behavior of software processes without modifying the operating system software image. A modular software architecture makes writing applications\u2014especially distributed applications\u2014more difficult, but metadata provides seamless extensibility allowing new software processes to be added and existing software processes to be upgraded or downgraded while the operating system is running. In one embodiment, the kernel includes operating system software, standard system services software and modular system services software. Even portions of the kernel may be hot upgraded under certain circumstances. Examples of metadata include, customization text files used by software device drivers; JAVA class files that are dynamically instantiated using reflection; registration and deregistration protocols that enable the addition and deletion of software services without system disruption; and database view definitions that provide many varied views of the logical system model. Each of these and other examples are described below.","The embodiment described below includes a network computer system with a loosely coupled distributed processing system. It should be understood, however, that the computer system could also be a central processing system or a combination of distributed and central processing and either loosely or tightly coupled. In addition, the computer system described below is a network switch for use in, for example, the Internet, wide area networks (WAN) or local area networks (LAN). It should be understood, however, that the modular software architecture can be implemented on any network device (including routers) or other types of computer systems and is not restricted to a network switch.","A distributed processing system is a collection of independent computers that appear to the user of the system as a single computer. Referring to , computer system  includes a centralized processor  with a control processor subsystem  that executes an instance of the kernel  including master control programs and server programs to actively control system operation by performing a major portion of the control functions (e.g., booting and system management) for the system. In addition, computer system  includes multiple line cards -. Each line card includes a control processor subsystem -, which runs an instance of the kernel -including slave and client programs as well as line card specific software applications.","Each control processor subsystem , -operates in an autonomous fashion but the software presents computer system  to the user as a single computer.","Each control processor subsystem includes a processor integrated circuit (chip) , -, for example, a Motorola  or an Intel Pentium processor. The control processor subsystem also includes a memory subsystem , -including a combination of non-volatile or persistent (e.g., PROM and flash memory) and volatile (e.g., SRAM and DRAM) memory components. Computer system  also includes an internal communication bus  connected to each processor , -. In one embodiment, the communication bus is a switched Fast Ethernet providing 100 Mb of dedicated bandwidth to each processor allowing the distributed processors to exchange control information at high frequencies. A backup or redundant Ethernet switch may also be connected to each board such that if the primary Ethernet switch fails, the boards can fail-over to the backup Ethernet switch.","In this example, Ethernet  provides an out-of-band control path, meaning that control information passes over Ethernet  but the network data being switched by computer system  passes to and from external network connections -over a separate data path . External network control data is passed from the line cards to the central processor over Ethernet . This external network control data is also assigned a high priority when passed over the Ethernet to ensure that it is not dropped during periods of heavy traffic on the Ethernet.","In addition, another bus  is provided for low level system service operations, including, for example, the detection of newly installed (or removed) hardware, reset and interrupt control and real time clock (RTC) synchronization across the system. In one embodiment, this is an Inter-IC communications (IC) bus.","Alternatively, the control and data may be passed over one common path (in-band).","Network\/Element Management System (NMS):","Exponential network growth combined with continuously changing network requirements dictates a need for well thought out network management solutions that can grow and adapt quickly. The present invention provides a massively scalable, highly reliable comprehensive network management system, intended to scale up (and down) to meet varied customer needs.","Within a telecommunications network, element management systems (EMSs) are designed to configure and manage a particular type of network device (e.g., switch, router, hybrid switch-router), and network management systems (NMSs) are used to configure and manage multiple heterogeneous and\/or homogeneous network devices. Hereinafter, the term \u201cNMS\u201d will be used for both element and network management systems. To configure a network device, the network administrator uses the NMS to provision services. For example, the administrator may connect a cable to a port of a network device and then use the NMS to enable the port. If the network device supports multiple protocols and services, then the administrator uses the NMS to provision these as well. To manage a network device, the NMS interprets data gathered by programs running on each network device relevant to network configuration, security, accounting, statistics, and fault logging and presents the interpretation of this data to the network administrator. The network administrator may use this data to, for example, determine when to add new hardware and\/or services to the network device, to determine when new network devices should be added to the network, and to determine the cause of errors.","Preferably, NMS programs and programs executing on network devices perform in expected ways (i.e., synchronously) and use the same data in the same way. To avoid having to manually synchronize all integration interfaces between the various programs, a logical system model and associated code generation system are used to generate application programming interfaces (APIs)\u2014that is integration interfaces\/integration points\u2014for programs running on the network device and programs running within the NMS. In addition, the APIs for the programs managing the data repositories (e.g., database programs) used by the network device and NMS programs are also generated from the same logical system model and associated code generation system to ensure that the programs use the data in the same way. Further, to ensure that the NMS and network device programs for managing and operating the network device use the same data, the programs, including the NMS programs, access a single data repository for configuration information, for example, a configuration database within the network device.","Referring to , in the present invention, the NMS  includes one or more NMS client programs -and one or more NMS server programs -. The NMS client programs provide interfaces for network administrators. Through the NMS clients, the administrator may configure multiple network devices (e.g., computer system , ; network device , ). The NMS clients communicate with the NMS servers to provide the NMS servers with configuration requirements from the administrator. In addition, the NMS server provides the NMS client with network device management information, which the client then makes available to the administrator. \u201cPushing\u201d data from a server to multiple clients synchronizes the clients with minimal polling. Reduced polling means less management traffic on the network and more device CPU cycles available for other management task. Communication between the NMS client and server is done via Remote Method Invocation (RMI) over Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), a reliable protocol that ensures no data loss.","The NMS client and server relationship prevents the network administrator from directly accessing the network device. Since several network administrators may be managing the network, this mitigates errors that may result if two administrators attempt to configure the same network device at the same time.","The present invention also includes a configuration relational database  within each network device and an NMS relational database  external to the network device. The configuration database program may be executed by a centralized processor card or a processor on another card (e.g., , ; , ) within the network device, and the NMS database program may be executed by a processor within a separate computer system (e.g., , ). The NMS server stores data directly in the configuration database via JAVA Database Connectivity (JDBC) over TCP, and using JDBC over TCP, the configuration database, through active queries, automatically replicates any changes to NMS database . By using JDBC and a relational database, the NMS server is able to leverage database transactions, database views, database journaling and database backup technologies that help provide unprecedented system availability. Relational database technology also scales well as it has matured over many years. An active query is a mechanism that enables a client to post a blocked SQL query for asynchronous notification by the database when data changes are made after the blocked SQL query was made.","Similarly, any configuration changes made by the network administrator directly through console interface  are made to the configuration database and, through active queries, automatically replicated to the NMS database. Maintaining a primary or master repository of data within each network device ensures that the NMS and network device are always synchronized with respect to the state of the configuration. Replicating changes made to the primary database within the network device to any secondary data repositories, for example, NMS database , ensures that all secondary data sources are quickly updated and remain in lockstep synchronization.","Instead of automatically replicating changes to the NMS database through active queries, only certain data, as configured by the network administrator, may be replicated. Similarly, instead of immediate replication, the network administrator may configure periodic replication. For example, data from the master embedded database (i.e., the configuration database) can be uploaded daily or hourly. In addition to the periodic, scheduled uploads, backup may be done anytime at the request of the network administrator.","Referring again to , for increased availability, the network device may include a backup configuration database \u2032 maintained by a separate, backup centralized processor card (e.g., , ; , ). Any changes to configuration database  are replicated to backup configuration database \u2032. If the primary centralized processor card experiences a failure or error, the backup centralized processor card may be switched over to become the primary processor and configuration database \u2032 may be used to keep the network device operational. In addition, any changes to configuration database  may be written immediately to flash persistent memory  which may also be located on the primary centralized processor card or on another card, and similarly, any changes to backup configuration database \u2032 may be written immediately to flash persistent memory \u2032 which may also be located on the backup centralized processor card or another card. These flash-based configuration files protect against loss of data during power failures. In the unlikely event that all copies of the database within the network device are unusable, the data stored in the NMS database may be downloaded to the network device.","Instead of having a single central processor card (e.g., , ; , ), the external control functions and the internal control functions may be separated onto different cards as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/574,343, filed May 20, 2000 and entitled \u201cFunctional Separation of Internal and External Controls in Network Devices\u201d, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. As shown in and , the chassis may support internal control (IC) processor cards and and external control (EC) processor cards and . In this embodiment, configuration database  may be maintained by a processor on internal control processor card and configuration database \u2032 may be maintained by a processor on internal control processor card , and persistent memory  may be located on external control processor card and persistent memory \u2032 may be located on external control processor card . This increases inter-card communication but also provides increased fault tolerance.","The file transfer protocol (FTP) may provide an efficient, reliable transport out of the network device for data intensive operations. Bulk data applications include accounting, historical statistics and logging. An FTP push (to reduce polling) may be used to send accounting, historical statistics and logging data to a data collector server , which may be a UNIX server. The data collector server may then generate network device and\/or network status reports -in, for example, American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) format and store the data into a database or generate Automatic Message Accounting Format (AMA\/BAF) outputs.","Selected data stored within NMS database  may also be replicated to one or more remote\/central NMS databases -, as described below. NMS servers may also access network device statistics and status information stored within the network device using SNMP (multiple versions) traps and standard Management Information Bases (MIBs and MIB-2). The NMS server augments SNMP traps by providing them over the conventional User Datagram Protocol (UDP) as well as over Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which provides reliable traps. Each event is generated with a sequence number and logged by the data collector server in a system log database for in place context with system log data. These measures significantly improve the likelihood of responding to all events in a timely manner reducing the chance of service disruption.","The various NMS programs\u2014clients, servers, NMS databases, data collector servers and remote NMS databases\u2014are distributed programs and may be executed on the same computer or different computers. The computers may be within the same LAN or WAN or accessible through the Internet. Distribution and hierarchy are fundamental to making any software system scale to meet larger needs over time. Distribution reduces resource locality constraints and facilitates flexible deployment. Since day-to-day management is done in a distributed fashion, it makes sense that the management software should be distributed. Hierarchy provides natural boundaries of management responsibility and minimizes the number of entities that a management tool must be aware of. Both distribution and hierarchy are fundamental to any long-term management solution. The client server model allows for increased scalability as servers and clients may be added as the number of network managers increase and as the network grows.","The various NMS programs may be written in the JAVA programming language to enable the programs to run on both Windows\/NT and UNIX platforms, such as Sun Solaris. In fact the code for both platforms may be the same allowing consistent graphical interfaces to be displayed to the network administrator. In addition to being native to JAVA, RMI is attractive as the RMI architecture includes (RMI) over Internet Inter-Orb Protocol (IIOP) which delivers Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) compliant distributed computing capabilities to JAVA. Like CORBA, RMI over IIOP uses IIOP as its communication protocol. IIOP eases legacy application and platform integration by allowing application components written in C++, SmallTalk, and other CORBA supported languages to communicate with components running on the JAVA platform. For \u201cmanage anywhere\u201d purposes and web technology integration, the various NMS programs may also run within a web browser. In addition, the NMS programs may integrate with Hewlett Packard's (HP's) Network Node Manager (NNM\u2122) to provide the convenience of a network map, event aggregation\/filtering, and integration with other vendor's networking. From HP NNM a context-sensitive launch into an NMS server may be executed.","The NMS server also keeps track of important statistics including average client\/server response times and response times to each network device. By looking at these statistics over time, it is possible for network administrators to determine when it is time to grow the management system by adding another server. In addition, each NMS server gathers the name, IP address and status of other NMS servers in the telecommunication network, determines the number of NMS clients and network devices to which it is connected, tracks its own operation time, the number of transactions it has handled since initialization, determines the \u201ctop talkers\u201d (i.e., network devices associated with high numbers of transactions with the server), and the number of communications errors it has experienced. These statistics help the network administrator tune the NMS to provide better overall management service.","NMS database  may be remote or local with respect to the network device(s) that it is managing. For example, the NMS database may be maintained on a computer system outside the domain of the network device (i.e., remote) and communications between the network device and the computer system may occur over a wide area network (WAN) or the Internet. Preferably, the NMS database is maintained on a computer system within the same domain as the network device (i.e., local) and communications between the network device and the computer system may occur over a local area network (LAN). This reduces network management traffic over a WAN or the Internet.","Many telecommunications networks include domains in various geographical locations, and network managers often need to see data combined from these different domains to determine how the overall network is performing. To assist with the management of wide spread networks and still minimize the network management traffic sent over WANs and the Internet, each domain may include an NMS database  and particular\/selected data from each NMS database may be replicated (or \u201crolled up\u201d) to remote NMS databases -that are in particular centralized locations. Referring to , for example, a telecommunications network may include at least three LAN domains -where each domain includes multiple network devices  and an NMS database . Domain may be located in the Boston, Mass. area, domain may be located in the Chicago, Ill. area and domain may be located in the San Francisco, Calif. area. NMS servers -may be located within each domain or in a separate domain. Similarly, one or more NMS clients may be coupled to each NMS server and located in the same domain as the NMS server or in different domains. In addition, one NMS client may be coupled with multiple NMS servers. For example, NMS servers -and NMS clients -may be located in domain (e.g., Dallas, Tex.) while NMS servers -and NMS clients -may be located in domain (e.g., New York, N.Y.). Each NMS server may be used to manage each domain -or, preferably, one NMS server in each server domain -is used to manage all of the network devices within one network device domain -. A single domain may include network devices and NMS clients and servers.","Network administrators use the NMS clients to configure network devices in each of the domains through the NMS servers. The network devices replicate changes made to their internal configuration databases (, ) to a local NMS database . In addition, the data collector server copies all logging data into NMS database  or a separate logging database (not shown). Each local NMS database may also replicate selected data to central NMS database(s) -in accordance with instructions from the network administrator. Other programs may then access the central database to retrieve and combine data from multiple network devices in multiple domains and then present this data to the network administrator. Importantly, network management traffic over WANs and the Internet are minimized since all data is not copied to the central NMS database. For example, local logging data may only be stored in the local NMS databases  (or local logging database) and not replicated to one of the central NMS database.","Logical System Model:","As previously mentioned, to avoid having to manually synchronize all integration interfaces between the various programs, the APIs for both NMS and network device programs are generated using a code generation system from the same logical system model. In addition, the APIs for the data repository software used by the programs are also generated from the same logical system model to ensure that the programs use the data in the same way. Each model within the logical system model contains metadata defining an object\/entity, attributes for the object and the object's relationships with other objects. Upgrading\/modifying an object is, therefore, much simpler than in current systems, since the relationship between objects, including both hardware and software, and attributes required for each object are clearly defined in one location. When changes are made, the logical system model clearly shows what other programs are affected and, therefore, may also need to be changed. Modeling the hardware and software provides a clean separation of function and form and enables sophisticated dynamic software modularity.","A code generation system uses the attributes and metadata within each model to generate the APIs for each program and ensure lockstep synchronization. The logical model and code generation system may also be used to create test code to test the network device programs and NMS programs. Use of the logical model and code generation system saves development, test and integration time and ensures that all relationships between programs are in lockstep synchronization. In addition, use of the logical model and code generation system facilitates hardware portability, seamless extensibility and unprecedented availability and modularity.","Referring to , a logical system model  is created using the object modeling notation and a model generation tool, for example, Rational Rose 2000 Modeler Edition available from Rational Software Corporation in Lexington, Mass. A managed device  represents the top level system connected to models representing both hardware  and data objects used by software applications . Hardware model  includes models representing specific pieces of hardware, for example, chassis , shelf , slot  and printed circuit board . The logical model is capable of showing containment, that is, typically, there are many shelves per chassis (1:N), many slots per shelf (1:N) and one board per slot (1:1). Shelf  is a parent class generalizing multiple shelf models, including various functional shelves -as well as one or more system shelves, for example, for fans  and power . Board  is also a parent class having multiple board models, including various functional boards without external physical ports -(e.g., central processor , ; -, ; and switch fabric cards, ) and various functional boards -(e.g., cross connection cards -and forwarding cards -, ) that connect to boards  with external physical ports (e.g., universal port cards -, ). Hardware model  also includes an external physical port model . Port model  is coupled to one or more specific port models, for example, synchronous optical network (SONET) protocol port , and a physical service endpoint model .","Hardware model  includes models for all hardware that may be available on computer system  (FIG. )\/network device  () whether a particular computer system\/network device uses all the available hardware or not. The model defines the metadata for the system whereas the presence of hardware in an actual network device is represented in instance data. All shelves and slots may not be populated. In addition, there may be multiple chassis. It should be understood that SONET port  is an example of one type of port that may be supported by computer system . A model is created for each type of port available on computer system , including, for example, Ethernet, Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) or Digital Signal, Level 3 (DS3). The NMS (described below) uses the hardware model and instance data to display a graphical picture of computer system \/network device  to a user.","Service endpoint model  spans the software and hardware models within logical model . It is a parent class including a physical service endpoint model  and a logical service endpoint model . Since the links between the software model and hardware model are minimal, either may be changed (e.g., upgraded or modified) and easily integrated with the other. In addition, multiple models (e.g., ) may be created for many different types of managed devices (e.g., ). The software model may be the same or similar for each different type of managed device even if the hardware\u2014and hardware models\u2014corresponding to the different managed devices are very different. Similarly, the hardware model may be the same or similar for different managed devices but the software models may be different for each. The different software models may reflect different customer needs.","Software model  includes models of data objects used by each of the software processes (e.g., applications, device drivers, system services) available on computer system \/network device . All applications and device drivers may not be used in each computer system\/network device. As one example, ATM model  is shown. It should be understood that software model  may also include models for other applications, for example, Internet Protocol (IP) applications, Frame Relay and Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) applications. Models of other processes (e.g., device drivers and system services) are not shown for convenience.","For each process, models of configurable objects managed by those processes are also created. For example, models of ATM configurable objects are coupled to ATM model , including models for a soft permanent virtual path (SPVP) , a soft permanent virtual circuit (SPVC) , a switch address , a cross-connection , a permanent virtual path (PVP) cross-connection , a permanent virtual circuit (PVC) cross-connection , a virtual ATM interface , a virtual path link , a virtual circuit link , logging , an ILMI reference , PNNI , a traffic descriptor , an ATM interface  and logical service endpoint . As described above, logical service endpoint model  is coupled to service endpoint model . It is also coupled to ATM interface model .","The logical model is layered on the physical computer system to add a layer of abstraction between the physical system and the software applications. Adding or removing known (i.e., not new) hardware from the computer system will not require changes to the logical model or the software applications. However, changes to the physical system, for example, adding a new type of board, will require changes to the logical model. In addition, the logical model is modified when new or upgraded processes are created. Changes to an object model within the logical model may require changes to other object models within the logical model. It is possible for the logical model to simultaneously support multiple versions of the same software processes (e.g., upgraded and older). In essence, the logical model insulates software applications from changes to the hardware models and vice-versa.","To further decouple software processes from the logical model\u2014as well as the physical system\u2014another layer of abstraction is added in the form of version-stamped views. A view is a logical slice of the logical model and defines a particular set of data within the logical model to which an associated process has access. Version stamped views allow multiple versions of the same process to be supported by the same logical model since each version-stamped view limits the data that a corresponding process \u201cviews\u201d or has access to, to the data relevant to the version of that process. Similarly, views allow multiple different processes to use the same logical model.","Code Generation System:","Referring to , logical model  is used as input to a code generation system . The code generation system creates a view identification (id) and an application programming interface (API)  for each process that requires configuration data. For example, a view id and an API may be created for each ATM application -, each SONET application -, each MPLS application -and each IP application -. In addition, a view id and API is also created for each device driver process, for example, device drivers -, and for modular system services (MSS) -(described below), for example, a Master Control Driver (MCD), a System Resiliency Manager (SRM), and a Software Management System (SMS). The code generation system provides data consistency across processes, centralized tuning and an abstraction of embedded configuration and NMS databases (described below) ensuring that changes to their database schema (i.e., configuration tables and relationships) do not affect existing processes.","The code generation system also creates a data definition language (DDL) file  including structured query language (SQL) commands used to construct the database schema, that is, the various tables and views within a configuration database , and a DDL file  including SQL commands used to construct various tables and SQL views within a network management (NMS) database  (described below). This is also referred to as converting the logical model into a database schema and various SQL views look at particular portions of that schema within the database. If the same database software is used for both the configuration and NMS databases, then one DDL file may be used for both.","The databases do not have to be generated from a logical model for views to work. Instead, database files can be supplied directly without having to generate them using the code generation system. Similarly, instead of using a logical model as an input to the code generation system, a MIB \u201cmodel\u201d may be used. For example, relationships between various MIBs and MIB objects may be written (i.e., coded) and then this \u201cmodel\u201d may be used as input to the code generation system.","Referring to , applications -(e.g., SONET driver , SONET application , MSS , etc.) each have an associated view -of configuration database . The views may be similar allowing each application to view similar data within configuration database . For example, each application may be ATM version 1.0 and each view may be ATM view version 1.3. Instead, the applications and views may be different versions. For example, application may be ATM version 1.0 and view may be ATM view version 1.3 while application is ATM version 1.7 and view is ATM view version 1.5. A later version, for example, ATM version 1.7, of the same application may represent an upgrade of that application and its corresponding view allows the upgraded application access only to data relevant to the upgraded version and not data relevant to the older version. If the upgraded version of the application uses the same configuration data as an older version, then the view version may be the same for both applications. In addition, application may represent a completely different type of application, for example, MPLS, and view allows it to have access to data relevant to MPLS and not ATM or any other application. Consequently, through the use of database views, different versions of the same software applications and different types of software applications may be executed on computer system  simultaneously.","Views also allow the logical model and physical system to be changed, evolved and grown to support new applications and hardware without having to change existing applications. In addition, software applications may be upgraded and downgraded independent of each other and without having to re-boot computer system \/network device . For example, after computer system  is shipped to a customer, changes may be made to hardware or software. For instance, a new version of an application, for example, ATM version 2.0, may be created or new hardware may be released requiring a new or upgraded device driver process. To make this a new process and\/or hardware available to the user of computer system , first the software image including the new process must be re-built.","Referring again to , logical model  may be changed (\u2032) to include models representing the new software and\/or hardware. Code generation system  then uses new logical model \u2032 to re-generate view ids and APIs \u2032 for each application, including, for example, ATM version two  and device driver , and DDL files \u2032 and \u2032. The new application(s) and\/or device driver(s) processes then bind to the new view ids and APIs. A copy of the new application(s) and\/or device driver process as well as the new DDL files and any new hardware are sent to the user of computer system . The user can then download the new software and plug the new hardware into computer system . The upgrade process is described in more detail below. Similarly, if models are upgraded\/modified to reflect upgrades\/modifications to software or hardware, then the new logical model is provided to the code generation system which re-generates view ids and APIs for each process\/program\/application. Again, the new applications are linked with the new view ids and APIs and the new applications and\/or hardware are provided to the user.","Again referring to , the code generation system also creates NMS JAVA interfaces  and persistent layer metadata . The JAVA interfaces are JAVA class files including get and put methods corresponding to attributes within the logical model, and as described below, the NMS servers use the NMS JAVA interfaces to construct models of each particular network device to which they are connected. Also described below, the NMS servers use the persistent layer metadata as well as run time configuration data to generate SQL configuration commands for use by the configuration database.","Prior to shipping computer system  to customers, a software build process is initiated to establish the software architecture and processes. The code generation system is the first part of this process. Following the execution of the code generation system, each process when pulled into the build process links the associated view id and API into its image. For example, referring to , to build a SONET application, source files, for example, a main application file , a performance monitoring file and an alarm monitoring file , written in, for example, the C programming language (.c) are compiled into object code files (.o) \u2032, \u2032 and \u2032. Alternatively, the source files may be written in other programming languages, for example, JAVA (.java) or C++(.cpp). The object files are then linked along with view ids and APIs from the code generation system corresponding to the SONET application, for example, SONET API . The SONET API may be a library (.a) of many object files. Linking these files generates the SONET Application executable file (.exe) .","Referring to , each of the executable files for use by the network device\/computer system are then provided to a kit builder . For example, several SONET executable files (e.g., , ), ATM executable files (e.g., -), MPLS executable files (e.g., -), MSS executable files -and a DDL configuration database executable file  may be provided to kit builder . Alternatively, the DDL configuration database executable file may be executed and some data placed in the database prior to supplying the DDL file to the kit builder. The kit builder creates a computer system\/network device installation kit  that is shipped to the customer with the computer system\/network device or, later, alone after modifications and upgrades are made.","Referring to , similarly, each of the executable files for the NMS is provided separately to the kit builder. For example, a DDL NMS database executable file , an NMS JAVA interfaces executable file , a persistent layer metadata executable file , an NMS server  and an NMS client  may be provided to kit builder . The kit builder creates an NMS installation kit  that is shipped to the customer for installation on a separate computer  (). In addition, new versions of the NMS installation kit may be sent to customers later after upgrades\/modifications are made. When installing the NMS, the customer\/network administrator may choose to distribute the various NMS processes as described above. Alternatively, one or more of the NMS programs, for example, the NMS JAVA interfaces and Persistent layer metadata executable files may be part of the network device installation kit and later passed from the network device to the NMS server, or part of both the network device installation kit and the NMS installation kit.","When the computer system is powered-up for the first time, as described below, configuration database software uses DDL file  to create a configuration database  with the necessary configuration tables and active queries. The NMS database software uses DDL file  to create NMS database  with corresponding configuration tables. Memory and storage space within network devices is typically very limited. The configuration database software is robust and takes a considerable amount of these limited resources but provides many advantages as described below.","As described above, logical model  () may be provided as an input to code generation system  in order to generate database views and APIs for NMS programs and network device programs to synchronize the integration interfaces between those programs. Where a telecommunications network includes multiple similar network devices, the same installation kit may be used to install software on each network device to provide synchronization across the network. Typically, however, networks include multiple different network devices as well as multiple similar network devices. A logical model may be created for each different type of network device and a different installation kit may be implemented on each different type of network device.","Instead, of providing a logical model (e.g., , ) that represents a single network device, a logical model may be provided that represents multiple different managed devices\u2014that is, multiple network devices and the relationship between the network devices. Alternatively, multiple logical models  and -\u2014representing multiple network devices\u2014may be provided, including relationships with other logical models. In either case, providing multiple logical models or one logical model representing multiple network devices and their relationships as an input(s) to the code generation system allows for synchronization of NMS programs and network device programs (e.g., -) across an entire network. The code generation system in combination with one or more logical models provides a powerful tool for synchronizing distributed telecommunication network applications.","The logical model or models may also be used for simulation of a network device and\/or a network of many network devices, which may be useful for scalability testing.","In addition to providing view ids and APIs, the code generation system may also provide code used to push data directly into a third party code API. For example, where an API of a third party program expects particular data, the code generation system may provide this data by retrieving the data from the central repository and calling the third-party programs API. In this situation, the code generation system is performing as a \u201cdata pump\u201d.","Configuration:","Once the network device programs have been installed on network device  (), and the NMS programs have been installed on one or more computers (e.g., ), the network administrator may configure the network device\/provision services within the network device. Hereinafter, the term \u201cconfigure\u201d includes \u201cprovisioning services\u201d. Referring to , the NMS client displays a graphical user interface (GUI)  to the administrator including a navigation tree\/menu . Selecting a branch of the navigation tree causes the NMS client to display information corresponding to that branch. For example, selecting Devices branch within the tree causes the NMS client to display a list of IP addresses and\/or domain name server (DNS) names corresponding to network devices that may be managed by the administrator. The list corresponds to a profile associated with the administrator's user name and password. Profiles are described in detail below.","If the administrator's profile includes the appropriate authority, then the administrator may add new devices to list . To add a new device, the administrator selects Devices branch and clicks the right mouse button to cause a pop-up menu () to appear. The administrator then selects the Add Devices option to cause a dialog box () to appear. The administrator may then type in an IP address (e.g., 192.168.9.203) or a DNS name into field and select an Add button to add the device to Device list window (). The administrator may then add one or more other devices in a similar manner. The administrator may also delete a device from the Device list window by selecting the device and then selecting a Delete button , or the administrator may cancel out of the dialog box without adding any new devices by selecting Cancel button . When finished, the administrator may select an OK button to add any new devices in Device list to navigation tree ().","To configure a network device, the administrator begins by selecting (step , ) a particular network device to configure, for example, the network device corresponding to IP address 192.168.9.202 (). The NMS client then informs (step , ) an NMS server of the particular network device to be configured. Since many NMS clients may connect to the same NMS server, the NMS server first checks its local cache to determine if it is already managing the network device for another NMS client. If so, the NMS server sends data from the cache to the NMS client. If not, the NMS server using JDBC connects to the network device and reads the data\/object structure for the physical aspects of the device from the configuration database within the network device into its local cache and uses that information with the JAVA interfaces to construct (step ) a model of the network device. The server provides (step ) this information to the client, which displays (step ) a graphical representation () of the network device to the administrator indicating the hardware and services available in the selected network device and the current configuration and currently provisioned services. Configuration changes received by an NMS server\u2014from either an NMS client or directly from the network device's configuration database when changes are made through the network device's CLI interface\u2014are sent by the NMS server to any other NMS clients connected to that server and managing the same network device. This provides scalability, since the device is not burdened with multiple clients subscribing for traps, and ensures each NMS client provides an accurate view of the network device.","Referring to -, graphical representation (i.e., device view, device mimic) in graphic window may include many views of the network device. For example, device mimic is shown in displaying a front view of the components in the upper portion of network device  (). The administrator may use scroll bar to scroll down and view lower portions of the front of the network device as shown in . The administrator may also use image scale button to change the size of graphic . For example, the administrator may shrink the network device image to allow more of the device image to be visible in graphic window , as shown in . This view corresponds to the block diagram of network device  shown in . For instance, upper fan tray  and middle fan trays  and  are shown. In addition, forwarding cards (e.g., and ), cross-connection cards (e.g., , , , , ), and external processor control cards (e.g., and ) are shown.","GUI  also includes several splitter bars -() to allow the administrator to change the size of the various panels (e.g., ,  and ). In addition, GUI  includes a status bar . The status bar may include various fields such as a server field , a Mode field , a Profile field and an active field . The server filed may provide the IP address or DNS name of the NMS server, and the profile field may provide the username that the administrator logged in under. The active field will provide updated status, for example, ready, or ask the administrator to take particular steps. The mode field will indicate an on-line mode (i.e., typical operation) or an off-line mode (described in detail below).","Device mimic may also provide one or more visual indications as to whether a card is present in each slot or whether a slot is empty. For example, in one embodiment, the forwarding cards (e.g., and ) in the upper portion of the network device are displayed in a dark color to indicate the cards are present while the lower slots (e.g., and ) are shown in a lighter color to indicate that the slots are empty. Other visual indications may also be used. For example, a graphical representation of the actual card faceplate may be added to device mimic when a card is present and a blank faceplate may be added when the slot is empty. Moreover, this may be done for any of the cards that may or may not be present in a working network device. For example, the upper cross-connection cards may be displayed in a dark color to indicate they are present while the lower cross-connection card slots may be displayed in a lighter color to indicate the slots are empty.","In addition, a back view and other views of the network device may also be shown. For example, the administrator may use a mouse to move a cursor into an empty portion of graphic window and click the right mouse button to cause a pop-up menu to appear listing the various views available for the network device. In one embodiment, the only other view is a back view and pop-up menu  is displayed.","Alternatively, short cuts may be set up. For example, double clicking the left mouse button may automatically cause graphic to display the back view of the network device, and another double click may cause graphic to again display the front view. As another alternative, a pull down menu may be provided to allow an administrator to select between various views.","Device mimic is shown in displaying a back view of the components in the upper portion of network device  (). Again the administrator may use scroll bar and\/or image scale button to view lower portions (and ) of the back of the network device or more of the network device by shrinking the graphic (). These views correspond to the block diagram of network device  shown in . For example, upper fan tray  (), management interface (MI) card  () and lower fan tray  () are shown. In addition, universal port cards (e.g., , and , ), switch fabric cards (e.g., and ) and internal processor control cards (e.g., and ) are also shown. Again, graphic may use a visual indicator to clearly show whether a card is present in a slot or whether the slot is empty. In this example, the visual indicator for universal port cards is the display of the ports available on each card. For example, universal port card is present as indicated by the graphical representation of ports (e.g., , ) available on that card, while universal port card () is not present as indicated by a blank slot .","Since the GUI has limited screen real estate and the network device may be large and loaded with many different types of components (e.g., modules, ports, fan trays, power connections), in addition to the device mimic views described above, GUI  may also provide a system view menu option  (). If an administrator selects this option, a separate pull away window  () is displayed for the administrator including both a front view and a back view of the network device corresponding to the front and back views displayed by the device mimic. The administrator may keep this separate pull away window up and visible while provisioning services through the GUI. Moreover, the GUI remains linked with the pull away window such that if the administrator selects a component in the pull away window, the device mimic displays that portion of the device and highlights that component. Similarly, if the administrator selects a component within the device mimic, the pull away window also highlights the selected component. Thus, the pull away window may further help the administrator navigate in the device mimic.","Device mimic may also indicate the status of components. For example, ports and\/or cards may be green for normal operation, red if there are errors and yellow if there are warnings. In one embodiment, a port may be colored, for example, light green or gray if it is available but not yet configured and colored dark green after being configured. Other colors or graphical textures may also be used show visible status. To further ease a network administrator's tasks, the GUI may present pop-up windows or tool tips containing information about each card and\/or port when the administrator moves the cursor over the card or port. For example, when the administrator moves the cursor over universal port card (), pop-up window may be displayed to tell the administrator that the card is a 16 Port OC3 Universal Port Module in Shelf \/Slot . Similarly, if the administrator moves the cursor over universal port card (), pop-up window appears indicating that the card is a 16 Port OC12 Universal Port Module in Shelf \/Slot , and if the cursor is moved over universal port cards () or (), then pop-up windows and appear indicating the cards are 4 Port OC48 Universal Port Module in Shelf \/Slot  and 8 Port OC12 Universal Port Module in Shelf \/Slot , respectively. If the administrator moves the cursor over a port, for example, port  (), then pop-up window appears indicating the port is an OC12 in Shelf \/Slot \/Port .","The views are used to provide management context. The GUI may also include a configuration\/service status window  for displaying current configuration and service provisioning details. Again, these details are provided to the NMS client by the NMS server, which reads the data from the network device's configuration database. The status window may include many tabs\/folders for displaying various data about the network device configuration. In one embodiment, the status window includes a System tab  (), which is displayed when the server first accesses the network device. This tab provides system level data such as the system name , System Description , System Contact , System Location , System IP Address (or DNS name), System Up Time , System identification (ID) and System Services . Modifications to data displayed in -may be made by the administrator and committed by selecting the Apply button . The NMS client then passes this information to the NMS server, which then writes a copy of the data in the network device's configuration database and broadcasts the changes to any other NMS clients managing the same network device. The administrator may also reset the network device by selecting the Reset System button and then refresh the System tab data by selecting the Refresh button ","The status window may also include a Modules tab  (), which includes an inventory of the available modules in the network device and various details about those modules such as where they are located (e.g., shelf and slot, back or front). The inventory may also include a description of the type of module, version number, manufacturing date, part number, etc. In addition, the inventory may include run time data such as the operational status and temperature. The NMS server may continuously supply the NMS client(s) with the run time data by reading the network device configuration database or NMS database. Device mimic is linked with status window , such that selecting a module in device mimic causes the Module tab to highlight a line in the inventory corresponding to that card. For example, if an administrator selects universal port card , device mimic highlights that module and the Module tab highlights a line  in the inventory corresponding to the card in Shelf \/Slot . Similarly, if the administrator selects a line in the Module tab inventory, device mimic highlights the corresponding module. Double clicking the left mouse button on a selected module may cause a dialog box to appear and the administrator may modify particular parameters such as an enable\/disable parameter.","The status window may also include a Ports tab  (), which displays an inventory of the available ports in the network device and various details about each port such as where they are located (shelf, slot and port; back or front). The inventory may also include a description of the port name, type and speed as well as run time data such as administrative status, operational status and link status. Again, device mimic is linked with status window  such that selecting a port within device mimic causes the Port tab to highlight a line in the inventory corresponding to that port. For example, if the administrator selects port (port , slot ) on card , then the Port tab highlights a line within the inventory corresponding to that port. Similarly, if the administrator selects a line from the inventory in the Port tab, device mimic highlights the corresponding port. Again double clicking the left mouse button on a selected port may cause a dialog box to appear and the administrator may modify particular parameters such as an enable\/disable parameter.","Another tab in the status window may be a SONET Interface tab  (), which includes an inventory of SONET ports in the network device and various details about each port such as where they are located (shelf and slot; back or front). Medium type (e.g., SONET, Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH)) may also be displayed as well as circuit ID, Line Type, Line Coding, Loopback, Laser Status, Path Count and other details. Again, device mimic is lined with status window  such that selecting a port within device mimic causes the SONET Interface tab to highlight a line in the inventory corresponding to that SONET port. For example, if the administrator selects port (port , slot ) on card , then the SONET Interface tab highlights line corresponding to that port. Similarly, if the administrator selects a line from the inventory in the SONET Interface tab, device mimic highlights the corresponding port. Again, double clicking the left mouse button on a selected SONET interface may cause a dialog box to appear and the administrator may modify particular parameters such as an enable\/disable parameter.","The System tab data as well as the Modules tab, Ports tab and SONET Interface tab data all represent physical aspects of the network device. The remaining tabs, including SONET Paths tab  (), ATM Interfaces tab , Virtual ATM Interfaces tab  and Virtual Connections tab , display configuration details and, thus, display no data until the device is configured. In addition, these configuration tabs , - are dialog chained together with wizard-like properties to guide an administrator through configuration details. Through these tabs within the GUI (i.e., graphical context), therefore, the administrator then makes (step , ) configuration selections. For example, to configure a SONET path, the administrator may begin by selecting a port (e.g., on card , ) within device mimic and clicking the right mouse button (i.e., context sensitive) to cause a pop-up menu  to be displayed listing available port configuration options. The administrator may then select the \u201cConfigure SONET Paths\u201d option, which causes the GUI to display a SONET Path configuration wizard  ().","The SONET Path configuration wizard guides the administrator through the task of setting up a SONET Path by presenting the administrator with valid configuration options and inserting default parameter values. As a result, the process of configuring SONET paths is simplified, and required administrator expertise is reduced since the administrator does not need to know or remember to provide each parameter value. In addition, the SONET Path wizard allows the administrator to configure multiple SONET Paths simultaneously, thereby eliminating the repetition of similar configuration process steps required by current network management systems and reducing the time required to configure many SONET Paths. Moreover, the wizard validates configuration requests from the administrator to minimize the potential for mis-configuration.","In one embodiment, the SONET Path wizard displays SONET line data (e.g., slot , port , OC12) and three configuration choices , and . The first two configuration choices provide \u201cshort cuts\u201d to typical configurations. If the administrator selects the first configuration option (), the SONET Path wizard creates a single concatenated path. In the current example, the selected port is an OC12, and the single concatenated path is an STS-12c. The wizard assigns and graphically displays the position and width of the STS-12c path and also displays a SONET Path table including an inventory having an entry for the SONET STS-12c path and each of the default parameters assigned to that SONET path. The position of each SONET path is chosen such that each path lines up on a valid boundary based on SONET protocol constraints.","If the administrator selects the second configuration option (and ), the SONET Path wizard creates one or more valid SONET paths that fully utilize the port capacity. In the current example, where the selected port is an OC12 port, in one embodiment, the second configuration option allows the administrator to quickly create four STS-3c paths () or one concatenated STS-12c (). The user may select the number of paths in window or the type of path in window . Windows and are linked and, thus, always present the user with consistent options. For example, if the administrator selects 4 paths in window , window displays STS-3c and if the administrator selects STS-12c in window , window displays 1 path. Again, the SONET path wizard graphically displays the position and width of the SONET paths created and also displays them in SONET Path table along with the default parameters assigned to each SONET path.","The third configuration option allows the administrator to custom configure a port thereby providing the administrator with more flexibility. If the administrator selects the third configuration option (), the SONET Path wizard displays a function window . The function window provides a list of available SONET Path types and also displays an allocated SONET path window . In this example, only the STS-3path type is listed in the available SONET Path types window, and if the administrator wishes to configure a single STS-12c path, then they need to select the first or second configuration option or . To configure one or more SONET STS-3c paths, the administrator selects the STS-3c SONET path type and then selects ADD button . The SONET Path wizard adds STS-3c path to the allocated SONET paths window and then displays the position and width of the SONET path and updates Path table with a listing of that SONET path including the assigned parameters. In this example, two STS-3c paths and are configured in this way on the selected port. The administrator may select an allocated path (e.g., or ) in window and then select the remove button to delete a configured path, or the administrator may select the clear button to delete each of the configured paths from window . Moreover, the administrator may select an allocated path and use up arrow and down arrow to change the position ","In any of the SONET Path windows (-), the administrator may select a path in the SONET path table and double click on the left mouse button or select a modify button to cause the GUI to display a dialog box through which the administrator may modify the default parameters assigned to each path. The wizard validates each parameter change and prevents invalid values from being entered. The administrator may also select a cancel button to exit the SONET path wizard without accepting any of the configured or modified paths. If, instead, the administrator wants to exit the SONET Path wizard and accept the configured SONET Paths, the administrator selects an OK button ","Once the administrator selects the OK button, the NMS client validates the parameters as far as possible within the client's view of the device and passes (step , ) this run time\/instance configuration data, including all configured SONET path parameters, to the NMS server. The NMS server validates (step ) the data received based on its view of the world and if not correct, sends an error message to the NMS client, which notifies the administrator. Thus, the NMS server re-validates all data from the NMS clients to ensure that it is consistent with changes made by any other NMS client or by an administrator using the network device's CLI. After a successful NMS server validation, the Persistent layer software within the server uses this data to generate (step ) SQL commands, which the server sends to the configuration database software executing on the network device. This is referred to as \u201cpersisting\u201d the configuration change. Receipt of the SQL commands triggers a validation of the data within the network device as well. If the validation is not successful, then the network device sends an error message to the NMS server, and the NMS server sends an error message to the NMS client, which displays the error to the administrator. If the validation is successful, the configuration database software then executes (step ) the SQL commands to fill in or change the appropriate configuration tables.","As just described, the configuration process provides a tiered approach to validation of configuration data. The NMS client validates configuration data received from an administrator according to its view of the network device. Since multiple clients may manage the same network device through the same NMS server, the NMS server re-validates received configuration data. Similarly, because the network device may be managed simultaneously by multiple NMS servers, the network device itself re-validates received configuration data. This tiered validation provides reliability and scalability to the NMS.","The configuration database software then sends (step ) active query notices, described in more detail below, to appropriate applications executing within the network device to complete the administrator's configuration request (step ). Active query notices may also be used to update the NMS database with the changes made to the configuration database. In addition, a Configuration Synchronization process running in the network device may also be notified through active queries when any configuration changes are made or, perhaps, only when certain configuration changes are made. As previously mentioned, the network device may be connected to multiple NMS Servers. To maintain synchronization, the Configuration Synchronization program broadcasts configuration changes to each attached NMS server. This may be accomplished by issuing reliable (i.e., over TCP) SNMP configuration change traps to each NMS server. Configuration change traps received by the NMS servers are then multicast\/broadcast to all attached NMS clients. Thus, all NMS servers, NMS clients, and databases (both internal and external to the network device) remain synchronized.","Even a simple configuration request from a network administrator may require several changes to one or more configuration database tables. Under certain circumstances, all the changes may not be able to be completed. For example, the connection between the computer system executing the NMS and the network device may go down or the NMS or the network device may crash in the middle of configuring the network device. Current network management systems make configuration changes in a central data repository and pass these changes to network devices using SNMP \u201csets\u201d. Since changes made through SNMP are committed immediately (i.e., written to the data repository), an uncompleted configuration (series of related \u201csets\u201d) will leave the network device in a partially configured state (e.g., \u201cdangling\u201d partial configuration records) that is different from the configuration state in the central data repository being used by the NMS. This may cause errors or a network device and\/or network failure. To avoid this situation, the configuration database executes groups of SQL commands representing one configuration change as a relational database transaction, such that none of the changes are committed to the configuration database until all commands are successfully executed. The configuration database then notifies the server as to the success or failure of the configuration change and the server notifies the client. If the server receives a communication failure notification, then the server re-sends the SQL commands to re-start the configuration changes. Upon the receipt of any other type of failure, the client notifies the user.","If the administrator now selects the same port (), clicks the right mouse button and selects the Configure SONET Paths option in pop-up menu , the SONET path wizard may be displayed as shown in , or alternatively, a SONET Path Configuration dialog box  () may be displayed. The SONET Path dialog box is similar to the SONET Path wizard except that it does not include the three configuration options -. Similar to the SONET Path wizard, dialog box  displays SONET line data (e.g., slot , port , OC12), SONET Path table and SONET path position and width . The administrator may modify parameters of a configured SONET path by selecting the path in the Path table and double clicking the right mouse button or selecting a Modify button . The administrator may also add a SONET path by selecting an Add button , which causes the SONET path dialog box to display another SONET path in the path table. Again, the administrator may modify the parameters by selecting the new SONET path and then the Modify button. The administrator may also delete a SONET path by selecting it within the SONET Path table and then selecting a Delete button . The administrator may cancel any changes made by selecting a Cancel button , or the administrator may commit any changes made by selecting an OK button .","The SONET path wizard provides the administrator with available and valid configuration options. The options are consistent with constraints imposed by the SONET protocol and the network device itself. The options may be further limited by other constraints, for example, customer subscription limitations. That is, ports or modules may be associated with particular customers and the SONET Path wizard may present the administrator with configuration options that match services to which the customer is entitled and no more. For example, a particular customer may have only purchased service on two STS-3c SONET paths on an OC12 SONET port, and the SONET Path wizard may prevent the administrator from configuring more than these two STS-3c SONET paths for that customer.","By providing default values for SONET Path parameters and providing only configuration options that meet various protocol, network device and other constraints, the process of configuring SONET paths is made simpler and more efficient, the necessary expertise required to configure SONET paths is reduced and the potential for mis-configurations is reduced. In addition, as the administrator provides input to the SONET path configuration wizard, the wizard validates the input and presents the administrator with configuration options consistent with both the original constraints and the administrator's configuration choices. This further reduces the necessary expertise required to configure SONET paths and further minimizes the potential for mis-configurations. Moreover, short cuts presented to the administrator may increase the speed and efficiency of configuring SONET paths.","If the administrator now selects SONET path tab  (), GUI  displays an inventory including the two STS-3c paths (and ) just configured. The SONET path tab includes information about each SONET path, such as SONET line information (e.g., shelf, slot and port), Path Position, Path Width, Ingress Connection and Egress Connection. It may also include Path Type and Service (e.g., Terminated ATM, Switched SONET), and a Path Name. The SONET Path configuration wizard may automatically assign the Path Name based on the shelf, slot and port. Parameters, such as Path Name, Path Width, Path Number and Path Type, may be changed by selecting a SONET path from the inventory and double clicking on that SONET path or selecting a Modify button (not shown) causing a dialog box to appear. The administrator may type in different parameter values or select from a pull-down list of available options within the dialog box.","Similarly, if the administrator selects an ATM Interfaces button or directly selects the ATM Interfaces tab  (), GUI  displays an inventory including two ATM interfaces (and ) corresponding to the two STS-3c paths just configured. The SONET Path configuration wizard automatically assigns an ATM interface name based again on the shelf, slot and port. The SONET Path wizard also automatically assigns a minimum VPI bits and maximum VPI bits and a minimum and maximum VCI bits. Again, the ATM Interfaces tab lists information such as the shelf, port and slot as well as the Path name and location of the card. The ATM Interfaces tab also lists the Virtual ATM (V-ATM) interfaces (IF) count. Since no virtual ATM interfaces have yet been configured, this value is zero and Virtual ATM Interfaces tab  and Virtual Connections tab  do not yet list any information. The administrator may return to the SONET Paths tab to configure additional SONET paths by selecting a Back button or by directly selecting the SONET Paths tab.","Referring to , instead of selecting a port (e.g., , ) and then selecting a Configure SONET Paths option from a pop-up menu, the administrator may instead select a path from the inventory of paths in SONET Interfaces tab  and then select a Paths button to cause SONET Path wizard  () to be displayed. For example, the administrator may select line corresponding to port on card and then select Paths button to cause SONET Path wizard  to be displayed. As shown, SONET line data indicates that this is port two in slot  and is an OC48 type port. Again, the administrator is presented with three configuration options , and ","If the administrator selects option (), then the SONET Path Wizard creates a single STS-48c concatenated SONET Path and inventories the new path in Path table and displays the path position and path width . If the administrator instead selects option (-), the SONET Path wizard creates one or more valid SONET paths that fully utilize the port capacity. For example, as pull down window () shows one single concatenated STS-48c path () may be created, four STS-12c paths (), or sixteen STS-3c paths () may be created. Instead, the administrator may select option () to custom configure the port. Again, function window is displayed including a list of Available SONET Path types and a list of Allocated SONET Paths . In this instance where the port is an OC48, both an STS-3c and STS-12c are listed as available SONET Path types. The administrator may select one and then select Add button to add a path to the Allocated SONET Paths list and cause the wizard to display the path in Path Table and to display the path position and width . In this example, two STS-3c paths are added in positions  and  and two STS-12c paths are added in positions  and .","Now when the administrator selects SONET Paths tab  (), the inventory of paths includes the four new paths (-). Similarly, when the administrator selects ATM Interfaces tab  (), the inventory of ATM interfaces includes four new interfaces (-) corresponding to the newly created SONET paths.","Instead of selecting a port in device mimic and then the Configure SONET Paths option from a pop-up menu and instead of selecting a SONET interface in the SONET Interfaces tab and then selecting the Paths button, the SONET Path wizard may be accessed by the administrator from any view in the GUI by simply selecting a Wizard menu button  and then selecting a SONET Path option () from a pull-down menu . When the SONET path wizard appears, the SONET line data (i.e., slot, port and type) will be blank, and the administrator simply needs to provide this information to allow the SONET path wizard to select the appropriate port. If the administrator selects a port in the Ports tab prior to selecting the SONET path option from the wizard pull-down menu, then the SONET wizard will appear with this information displayed as the SONET line data but the administrator may modify this data to select a different port from the SONET wizard.","To create virtual connections between various ATM Interfaces\/SONET Paths within the network device, the administrator first needs to create one or more virtual ATM interfaces for each ATM interface. At least two virtual ATM interfaces are required since two discrete virtual ATM interfaces are required for each virtual connection. In the case of a multipoint connection there will be one root ATM interface and many leafs. To do this, the administrator may select an ATM interface (e.g., ) from the inventory in the ATM Interfaces tab and then select a Virtual Interfaces button to cause Virtual Interfaces tab  () to appear and display an inventory of all virtual interfaces associated with the selected ATM interface. In this example, no virtual ATM interfaces have yet been created, thus, none are displayed.","The Virtual ATM Interfaces tab also includes a device navigation tree . The navigation tree is linked with the Virtual Interfaces button () such that the device tree highlights the ATM interface (e.g., ATM-Path211\/4, ) that was selected when the Virtual Interfaces button was selected. When the Virtual Interfaces button is selected, the NMS client automatically requests virtual interface data corresponding to the selected ATM interface from the NMS server and then the NMS client displays this data in the Virtual ATM Interfaces tab. This saves memory space within the NMS client since only a small amount of data relevant to the virtual ATM interfaces associated with the selected ATM interface must be stored. In addition, since the amount of data is small, the data transfer is quick and reduces network traffic.","Instead the administrator may directly select Virtual ATM Interfaces tab  and then use the device tree to locate the ATM interface they wish to configure with one or more virtual ATM interfaces. In this instance, the NMS client may again automatically request virtual interface data from the NMS server, or instead, the NMS client may simply use data stored in cache.","To return to the ATM Interfaces tab, the administrator may select a Back button or directly select the ATM Interfaces tab. Once the appropriate ATM interface has been selected (e.g., ATM-Path211\/4\/1) in the Virtual ATM Interfaces tab device tree , then the administrator may select an ADD button to cause a virtual ATM (V-ATM) Interfaces dialog box  () to appear.","GUI  automatically fills in dialog box  with default values for Connection type , Version and Administration Status . The administrator may provide a Name or Alias and may modify the other three parameters by selecting from the options provided in pull down menus. This and other dialog boxes may also have wizard-like properties. For example, only valid connection types, versions and administrative status choices are made available in corresponding pull-down menus. For instance, Version may be UNI Network 3.1, UNI Network 4.0, IISP User 3.0, IISP User 3.1, PNNI, IISP Network 3.0 or IISP Network 3.1, and Administration Status may be Up or Down. When Down is selected, the virtual ATM interface is created but not enabled. With regard to connection type, for the first virtual ATM interface created for a particular ATM interface, the connection type choices include Direct Link or Virtual Uni. However, for any additional virtual ATM interfaces for the same ATM interface the connection type choices include only Logical Link. Hence the dialog box provides valid options to further assist the administrator. When finished, the administrator selects an OK button to accept the values in the dialog box and cause the virtual ATM interface (e.g., , ) to be inventoried in Virtual ATM tab .","The administrator may then select ADD button again to add another virtual ATM interface to the selected ATM interface (ATM-Path211\/4\/1). Instead, the administrator may use device tree to select another ATM interface, for example, ATM path () designated ATM-Path111\/5\/2 () in device tree . The administrator may again select the ADD button or the administrator may select port on card , click the right mouse button and select the \u201cAdd Virtual Connection\u201d option from pop-up menu . This will again cause dialog box  () to appear, and the administrator may again modify parameters and then select OK button to configure the virtual ATM interface.","To create a virtual connection, the administrator selects a virtual ATM interface (e.g., , ) and then selects a Virtual Connections button or a Virtual Connection option () from wizard pull-down menu . This causes GUI  to start a Virtual Connection configuration wizard  (). Just as the SONET Path configuration wizard guides the administrator through the task of setting up a SONET Path, the Virtual Connection configuration wizard guides the administrator through the task of setting up a virtual connection. Again, the administrator is presented with valid configuration options and default parameter values are provided as a configuration starting point. As a result, the process of configuring virtual connections is simplified, and required administrator expertise is reduced since the administrator does not need to know or remember to provide each parameter value. In addition, the wizard validates configuration requests from the administrator to minimize the potential for mis-configuration.","The Virtual Connection configuration wizard includes a Connection Topology panel and a Connection Type panel . Within the Connection Topology panel the administrator is asked whether they want a point-to-point or point-to-multipoint connection, and within the Connection Type panel, the administrator is asked whether they want a Virtual Path Connection (VPC) or a Virtual Channel Connection (VCC). In addition, the administrator may indicate that they want the VPC or VCC made soft (SPVPC\/SPVCC). Where the administrator chooses a point-to-point, VPC connection, the Virtual Connection wizard presents dialog box  ().","The source (e.g., test in End Point  window ) for the point-to-point connection is automatically set to the virtual ATM interface (e.g., , ) selected in Virtual ATM Interface tab  when the virtual connection button was selected. The administrator may change the source simply by selecting another virtual ATM interface in device tree , for example, test. Similarly, the administrator selects a destination (e.g., test in End Point  window ) for the point-to-point connection by selecting a virtual ATM interface in device tree , for example, test. If the administrator had selected point-to-multipoint in Connection Topology panel (), then the user would select multiple destination devices from device tree or the wizard may present the administrator with multiple End Point  windows in which to select the multiple destination devices. In addition, if within Connection Topology panel () the administrator had elected to make the VPC or VCC soft (SPVPC\/SPVCC), then the user may select in End Point  window () a virtual ATM interface in another network device.","The virtual Connection wizard also contains a Connections Parameters window , an End Point  Parameters window and an End Point  Parameters window . Again for point-to-multipoint, there will be multiple End Point  Parameters windows. Within the Connections Parameters window, the administrator may provide a Connection name (e.g., test). The administrator also determines whether the connection will be configured in an Up or Down Administration Status, and may provide a Customer Name (e.g., Walmart) or select one from a customer list, which may be displayed by selecting Customer List button ","Within the End Point  and  Parameters windows, the administrator provides a Virtual Path Identifier (VPI) in window , or selects a Use Any VPI Value indicator , . If the administrator chooses a VCC connection in Connection Type window (), then the administrator must also provide a Virtual Channel Indicator (VCI) in window , or select a Use Any VCI Value indicator , . The administrator also selects a Transmit and a Receive Traffic Descriptor (e.g., Variable Bit Rate (VBR)-high, VBR-low, Constant Bit Rate (CBR)-high, CBR-low) from a pull down menu or selects an Add Traffic Descriptor button , . If the administrator selects one of the Add Traffic Descriptor buttons, then a traffic descriptor window  () is displayed and the administrator may add a new traffic descriptor by providing a name and selecting a quality of service (QoS) class and a traffic descriptor type from corresponding pull down menus. Depending upon the QoS class and type selected, the administrator may also be prompted to input peak cell rate (PCR), sustainable cell rate (SCR), maximum burst size (MBS) and minimum cell rate (MCR), and for each PCR, SCR, MBS and MCR, the administrator will be prompted for a cell loss priority (CLP) value where CLP=0 corresponds to high priority traffic and CLP=0+1 corresponds to combined\/aggregated high and low priority traffic. The traffic descriptors indicate the priority of the traffic to be sent over the connection thereby allowing parameterization of quality of service. The administrator may select a Use the same Traffic Descriptor for both Transmit and Receive indicator , ().","Within the Virtual Connection wizard, the administrator may select a Back button () to return to screen  () or a Cancel button to exit out of the wizard without creating a virtual connection. On the other hand, if the administrator has provided all parameters and wants to commit the virtual connection, then the administrator selects a Finish button . The NMS client passes the parameters to the NMS server, which validates the data and then writes the data into the network device's configuration database. The data is validated again within the network device and then through active queries modular processes throughout the device are notified of the configuration change to cause these processes to implement the virtual connection. GUI  then displays the newly created virtual connection () in a list within Virtual Connections tab . The administrator may then create multiple virtual connections between the various virtual ATM interfaces, each of which will be listed in the Virtual Connections tab . The administrator may also select a Back button to return to the Virtual ATM Interfaces tab or select the Virtual ATM Interfaces tab directly.","The Virtual Connections tab also includes a device navigation tree . The device tree is linked with Virtual Connections button such that the device tree highlights the virtual ATM interface that was selected in Virtual ATM Interfaces tab  when the Virtual Connections button was selected. The Virtual Connections tab then only displays data relevant to the highlighted portion of the device tree.","As described above, the SONET Paths tab, ATM Interfaces tab, Virtual ATM Interfaces tab and Virtual Connections tabs are configuration tabs that are chained together providing wizard-like properties. Both the order of the tabs from right to left and the forward buttons (e.g., ATM Interfaces button ) and back buttons (e.g., Back button ) allow an administrator to easily and quickly sequence through the steps necessary to provision services. Although device navigation trees were shown in only the Virtual ATM Interface tab and the Virtual Connection tab, a device navigation tree may be included in each tab and only data relevant to the highlighted portion of the navigation tree may be displayed.","In addition to the SONET Interface and SONET Paths tabs, the status window may include tabs for other physical layer protocols, for example, Ethernet. Moreover, in addition to the ATM Interfaces and Virtual ATM Interfaces tabs, the status window may include tabs for other upper layer protocols, including MPLS, IP and Frame Relay. Importantly, other configuration wizards in addition to the SONET Path configuration wizard and Virtual Connection configuration wizard may also be used to simplify service provisioning.","Custom Navigator:","In typical network management systems, the graphical user interface (GUI) provides static choices and is not flexible. That is, the screen flow provided by the GUI is predetermined and the administrator must walk through a predetermined set of screens each time a service is to be provisioned. To provide flexibility and further simplify the steps required to provision services within a network device, GUI , described in detail above, may also include a custom navigator tool that facilitates \u201cdynamic menus\u201d. When the administrator selects the custom navigator menu button  (), a pop-up menu displays a list of available \u201cscreen marks\u201d. The list of screen marks may include default screen marks (e.g., Virtual ATM IF and Virtual Connection ) and\/or administrator created screen marks (e.g., test ).","When the administrator selects a particular screen mark, the custom navigator shortcuts the configuration process by jumping forward past various configuration screens to a particular configuration screen corresponding to the screen mark. For example, if the administrator selects a Virtual ATM IF screen mark , the custom navigator presents the Virtual ATM Interface tab (). The administrator may then select an ATM interface from device tree and select Add button to add a virtual ATM interface. Similarly, the administrator may select a Virtual Connection screen mark , and the custom navigator automatically presents Virtual Connection wizard  ().","Moreover, the custom navigator allows the administrator to create unique screen marks. For example, the administrator may provision SONET paths and ATM interfaces as described above, then select an ATM interface (e.g., , ) in ATM interfaces tab  and select Virtual Interfaces button to display Virtual ATM Interfaces tab  (), and as described above, the devices tree will highlight the selected ATM interface. If the administrator believes they may want to return to the Virtual Interfaces tab multiple times to provision multiple virtual ATM interfaces for the selected ATM interface or other ATM interfaces near the selected ATM interface in device tree , then the administrator would select a screen mark button  to create a screen mark for this configuration position. A dialog box would appear in which the administrator enters the name of the new screen mark (e.g., test , ) and this new screen mark name is added to the list of screen marks . The custom navigator then takes a \u201csnap shot\u201d of the metadata necessary to recreate the screen and the current configuration position (i.e., highlight ATM-Path211\/4\/1). If the administrator now selects this screen mark while another tab is displayed, the custom navigator uses the metadata associated with the screen mark to present the screen shot displayed in to the administrator updated with any other configuration changes made subsequent to the creation of the screen mark.","As a result, the administrator is provided with configuration short cuts, both default short cuts and ones created by the administrator himself. Many other screen marks may be created through GUI , and in each case, the screen marks may simplify the configuration process and save the administrator configuration time.","Custom Wizard:","To provide additional flexibility and efficiency, an administrator may use a custom wizard tool to create unique custom wizards to reflect common screen sequences used by the administrator. To create a custom wizard, the administrator begins by selecting a Custom Wizard menu button  () to cause a pull-down menu to appear and then selecting a Create Wizard option from the pull-down menu. The administrator then begins using the particular sequence of screens that they wish to turn into a custom wizard and the custom wizard tool records this sequence of screens. For example, the administrator may begin by selecting a port within device mimic , clicking the right mouse button and selecting the Configure SONET Paths option to cause the SONET Path configuration wizard  () to appear. The custom wizard tool records the first screen to be included in the new custom wizard as the SONET Path configuration wizard screen . After filling in the appropriate data for the current port configuration, the administrator presses the OK button and the SONET Paths tab  () appears. The custom wizard records the SONET Paths tab screen as the next screen in the new custom wizard. The administrator may then select Virtual ATM interfaces tab  () to cause this tab to be displayed. Again, the custom navigator records this screen as the next screen in the new custom wizard.","The administrator may continue to select further screens to add to the new custom wizard (for example, by selecting an ATM interface from device tree and then selecting the Add button to cause the Add V-ATM Interface dialog box  () to appear) or, if the administrator is finished sequencing through all of the screens that the administrator wants added to the new custom wizard, the administrator again selects Custom Wizard menu button  () and then selects a Finish Wizard option . This causes a dialog box to appear, and the administrator enters a name (e.g., test) for the custom wizard just created.","To access a custom wizard, the administrator again selects Custom Wizard  menu button and then selects a Select Wizard option to cause an inventory of custom wizards to be displayed. The administrator then selects a custom wizard (e.g., test), and the custom wizard automatically presents the administrator with the first screen of that wizard. In the continuing example, the custom navigator presents SONET Path configuration wizard screen  (). Since the administrator may start a custom wizard from any screen within GUI , SONET Path wizard screen  is different from the screen  displayed in because SONET line data (i.e., slot, port, type) is not provided. That is, the administrator may not have selected a particular SONET Path to configure prior to selecting the custom wizard. Hence, the SONET line data is blank and the administrator must fill this in. After the administrator enters and\/or modifies the SONET line data and any other data within the first screen, the administrator selects a Next button (or an OK button) to move to the next screen in the sequence of screens defined by the custom wizard. In the next and subsequent screens, the administrator may also select a Back button to return to a previous screen within the custom wizard screen sequence. Thus, the custom wizard tool allows an administrator to make their provisioning tasks more efficient by defining preferred screen sequences for each task.","Off-Line Configuration:","There may be times when a network manager\/administrator wishes to jump-start initial configuration of a new network device before the network device is connected into the network. For example, a new network device may have been purchased and be in the process of being delivered to a particular site. Generally, a network manager will already know how they plan to use the network device to meet customer needs and, therefore, how they would like to configure the network device. Because configuring an entire network device may take considerable time once the device arrives and because the network manager may need to get the network device configured as soon as possible to meet network customer needs, many network managers would like the ability to perform preparatory configuration work prior to the network device being connected into the network.","In the current invention, network device configuration data is stored in a configuration database within the network device and all changes to the configuration database are copied in the same format to an external NMS database. Since the data in both databases (i.e., configuration and NMS) is in the same format, the present invention allows a network device to be completely configured \u201coff-line\u201d by entering all configuration data into an NMS database using GUI  in an off-line mode. When the network device is connected to the network, the data from the NMS database is reliably downloaded to the network device as a group of SQL commands using a relational database transaction. The network device then executes the SQL commands to enter the data into the internal configuration database, and through the active query process (described below), the network device may be completely and reliably configured.","Referring to , the network manager begins by selecting Devices branch in navigation tree , clicking the right mouse button to cause pop-up menu to appear and selecting the Add Devices option causing dialog box () to be displayed. The network manager then enters the intended IP address or DNS name (e.g., 192.168.9.201) of the new network device into field and de-selects a Manage device in on-line mode option \u2014that is, the network manager moves the cursor over box and clicks the left mouse button to clears box . De-selecting the Manage device in on-line mode option indicates that the network device will be configured in off-line mode. The network manager then selects Add button to cause dialog box to add the IP address to window (). However, in this example, box is blank indicating the network device is to be configured off-line.","Referring to , the new network device (e.g., 192.168.9.201) is now added to the list of devices to be managed. However, the icon includes a visual indicator (e.g., red \u201cX\u201d) indicating the off-line status of the device. To begin off-line configuration, the network manager selects the new device. Since the NMS client and NMS server are not connected to the actual network device, no configuration data may be read from the network device's configuration database. The network manager must, therefore, populate a device mimic with modules representing the physical inventory that the network device will include. To do this, the network manager begins by clicking on the right mouse button to display pop-up menu , and selects the Add Chassis option to cause a device mimic () to be displayed in window including only a chassis. All slots in the chassis may be empty and visually displayed, for example, in a gray or light color. Alternatively, particular modules that are required for proper network device operation may be automatically included in the chassis. If more than one chassis type is available, a dialog box would appear and allow the network manager to select a particular chassis. In the current example, only one chassis is available and is automatically displayed when the network manager selects the Add Chassis option.","Again, the cursor provides context sensitive pop-up windows. For example, the network manager may move the cursor over a particular slot (e.g., , ) to cause a pop-up window (e.g., ) to appear and describe the slot (e.g., Empty Forwarding Processor Slot Shelf \/Slot ). The network manager may then select an empty slot (e.g., , ) to cause the device mimic to highlight that slot, click the right mouse button to cause a pop-up menu (e.g., ) to appear and select the Add Module option. In this example, only one type of forwarding card is available. Thus, it is automatically added (visually indicated in dark green, ) to the device mimic. This forwarding card corresponds to forwarding card in . The network manager may also remove a module by selecting the module (e.g., ), clicking the right mouse button to cause a pop-up menu to appear and then selecting the Remove Module option.","If there are multiple types of modules that may be inserted in a particular slot, then a dialog box will appear after the network manager selects the Add Module option and the network manager will select the particular module that the network device will include in this slot upon delivery. For example, while viewing the back of the chassis (), the manager may select an empty universal port card slot (e.g., ), click the right mouse button causing pop-up menu () to appear and select the Add Module option. Since multiple universal port cards are available, selecting the Add Module option causes a dialog box () to appear. The network manager may then select the type of universal port card to be added into the empty slot from an inventory provided in pull-down menu (). Once the network manager selects the appropriate card and an OK button , the device mimic adds a representation of this card (e.g., , and see also ).","Typically, a network device may include many similar modules, for example, many 16 port OC3 universal port cards and many forwarding cards. Instead of having the network manager repeat each of the steps described above to add a universal port card or a forwarding card, the network manager may simply select an inserted module (e.g., 16 port OC3 universal port card , ) by pressing down on the left mouse button, dragging an icon to an empty slot (e.g., ) also requiring a similar module and releasing the left mouse button to drop a similar module (e.g., 16 port OC3 universal port card , ) into that empty slot. Similarly, the network manager may drag and drop a forwarding card module to an empty forwarding card slot and other inserted modules into other empty slots. The network manager may use the drag and drop method to quickly populate the entire network device with the appropriate number of similar modules. To add a different type of universal port card, the network manager will again select the empty slot, click on the right mouse button, select the Add Module button from the pop-up menu and then select the appropriate type of universal port card from the dialog box.","Once the network manager is finished adding appropriate modules into the empty slots such that the device mimic represents the physical hardware that will be present in the new network device, then the network manager may configure\/provision services within the network device. Off-line configuration is the same as on-line configuration, however, instead of sending the configuration data to the configuration database within the network device, the NMS server stores the configuration data in an external NMS database. After the network device arrives and the network manager connects the network device's ports into the network, the network manager selects the device (e.g., 192.168.9.201, ), clicks the right mouse button to cause pop-up menu to appear and selects the Manage On-line option.","The NMS client notifies the NMS server that the device is now to be managed on-line. The NMS server first reconciles the physical configuration created by the network manager and stored in the NMS database against the physical configuration of the actual network device and stored in the internal configuration database. If there are any mismatches, the NMS server notifies the NMS client, which then displays any discrepancies to the network manager. After the network manager fixes any discrepancies, the network manager may again select the Manage On-Line option in pop-up menu . If there are no mismatches between the physical device tables in the NMS database and the configuration database, then the NMS server reconciles all service provisioning data in the NMS database against the service provisioning data in the configuration database. In this example, the network device is new and thus, the configuration database has no service provisioning data. Thus, the reconciliation will be successful.","The NMS server then instructs the network device to stop replication between the primary configuration database within the network device and the backup configuration database within the network device. The NMS server then pushes the NMS database data into the backup configuration database, and then instructs the network device to switchover from the primary configuration database to the backup configuration database. If any errors occur after the switchover, the network device may automatically switch back to the original primary configuration database. If there are no errors, then the network device is quickly and completely configured to work properly within the network while maximizing network device availability.","In the previous example, the network manager configured one new network device off-line. However, a network manager may configure many new network devices off-line. For example, a network manager may be expecting the receipt of five or more new network devices. Referring to , to simplify the above process, a network manager may select an on-line device (e.g., 192.168.9.202) or off-line device (e.g., 192.168.9.201) by pressing and holding the left mouse button down, dragging an icon over to a newly added off-line device (e.g., 192.168.203) and dropping the icon over the newly added off-line device by releasing the left mouse button. The NMS client notifies the NMS server to copy the configuration data from the NMS database associated with the first network device (e.g., 192.168.9.202 or 192.168.9.201) to a new NMS database associated with the new network device and to change the data in the new NMS database to correspond to the new network device. The network manager may then select the new network device and modify any of the configuration data, as described above, to reflect the current network device requirements. As a result, off-line mode configuration is also made more efficient.","A network manager may also choose to re-configure an operational device in off-line mode without affecting the operation of the network device. For example, the network manager may want to add one or more new modules or provision services in a network device during a time when the network sees the least amount of activity, for example, midnight. Through the off-line mode, the network manager may prepare the configuration data ahead of time.","Referring to , the network manager may select an operational network device (e.g., 192.168.9.202), click on the right mouse button to cause pop-up menu to appear and select the Manage On-Line option, which de-selects the current on-line mode and causes the GUI to enter an off-line mode for this device. Although the GUI has entered the off-line mode, the network device is still operating normally. The network manager may then add one or more modules and\/or provision services as described above just as if the GUI were still in on-line mode, however, all configuration changes are stored by the NMS server in the NMS database corresponding to the network device instead of the network device's configuration database. Alternatively, when the NMS server is notified that a network device is to be managed off-line, the NMS server may copy the NMS database data to a temporary NMS database and store all off-line configuration changes there. When the network manager is ready (i.e., at the appropriate time and\/or after adding any new modules to the network device) to download the configuration changes to the operational network device, the network manager again selects the network device (e.g., 192.168.9.202), clicks on the right mouse button to cause pop-up menu to appear and selects the Manage On-Line option.","The NMS client notifies the NMS server that the device is now to be managed on-line. The NMS server first reconciles the physical configuration stored in the NMS database (or the temporary NMS database) against the physical configuration of the actual network device stored in the internal configuration database. If there are any mismatches, the NMS server notifies the NMS client, which then displays any discrepancies to the network manager. After the network manager fixes any discrepancies, the network manager may again select the Manage On-Line option in pop-up menu . If there are no mismatches between the physical device tables in the NMS database and the configuration database, then the NMS server reconciles all service provisioning data in the NMS database (or the temporary NMS database) against the service provisioning data in the configuration database. If any conflicts are discovered, the NMS server notifies the NMS client, which displays the discrepancies to the network manager. After fixing any discrepancies, the network manager may again select the Manage On-Line option in pop-up menu ","If there are no conflicts, the NMS server instructs the network device to stop replication between the primary configuration database within the network device and the backup configuration database within the network device. The NMS server then pushes the NMS database data into the backup configuration database, and then instructs the network device to switchover from the primary configuration database to the backup configuration database. If any errors occur after the switchover, the network device may automatically switch back to the original primary configuration database. If there are no errors, then the network device is quickly re-configured to work properly within the network.","Off-line configuration, therefore, provides a powerful tool to allow network managers to prepare configuration data prior to actually implementing any configuration changes. Such preparation, allows a network manager to carefully configure a network device when they have time to consider all their options and requirements, and once the network manager is ready, the configuration changes are implemented quickly and efficiently.","FCAPS Management:","Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance and Security (FCAPS) management are the five functional areas of network management as defined by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Fault management is for detecting and resolving network faults, configuration management is for configuring and upgrading the network, accounting management is for accounting and billing for network usage, performance management is for overseeing and tuning network performance, and security management is for ensuring network security. Referring to , GUI  provides a status button -for each of the five FCAPS. By clicking on one of the status buttons, a status window appears and displays the status associated with the selected FCAPS button to the network administrator. For example, if the network administrator clicks on the F status button , a fault event summary window  () appears and displays the status of any faults.","Each FCAP button may be colored according to a hierarchical color code where, for example, green means normal operation, red indicates a serious error and yellow indicates a warning status. Today there are many NMSs that indicate faults through color coded icons or other graphics. However, current NMSs do not categorize the errors or warnings into the ISO five functional areas of network management\u2014that is, FCAPS. The color-coding and order of the FCAPS buttons provide a \u201cstatus bar code\u201d allowing a network administrator to quickly determine the category of error or warning and quickly take action to address the error or warning.","As with current NMSs, a network administrator may actively monitor the FCAPS buttons by sitting in front of the computer screen displaying the GUI. Unfortunately, network administrators do not have time to actively monitor the status of each network device\u2014passive monitoring is required. To assist passive monitoring, the FCAPS buttons may be enlarged or \u201cstretched\u201d to fill a large portion of the screen, as shown in . The FCAPS buttons may be stretched in a variety of ways, for example, a stretch option in a pull down menu may be selected or a mouse may be used to drag and drop the boarders of the FCAPS buttons. Stretching the FCAPS buttons allows a network administrator to view the status of each FCAP button from a distance of 40 feet or more. Once stretched, each of the five OSI management areas can be easily monitored at a distance by looking at the bar-encoded FCAPS strip. The \u201cstretchy FCAPS\u201d provide instant status recognition at a distance.","The network administrator may set the FCAPS buttons to represent a single network device or multiple network devices or all the network devices in a particular network. Alternatively, the network administrator may have the GUI display two or more FCAPS status bars each of which represents one or more network devices.","Although the FCAPS buttons have been described as a string of multiple stretched bars, many different types of graphics may be used to display FCAPS status. For example, different colors may be used to represent normal operation, warnings and errors, and additional colors may be added to represent particular warnings and\/or errors. Instead of a bar, each letter (e.g., F) may be stretched and color-coded. Instead of a solid color, each FCAPS button may repeatedly flash or strobe a color. For example, green FCAPS buttons may remain solid (i.e., not flashing) while red errors and yellow warnings are displayed as a flashing FCAPS button to quickly catch a network administrator's attention. As another example, green\/normal operation FCAPS buttons may be a different size relative to yellow\/warnings and red\/errors FCAPS buttons. For example, an FCAPS button may be automatically enlarged if status changes from good operation to a warning status or an error status. In addition, the FCAPS buttons may be different sizes to allow the network administrator to distinguish between each FCAPS button from a further distance. For example, the buttons may have a graduated scale where the F button is the largest and each button is smaller down to the S button, which is the smallest. Alternatively, the F button may be the smallest while the S button is the largest, or the A button in the middle is the largest, the C and P buttons are smaller and the F and S buttons are smallest.","Many variations are possible for quickly alerting a network administrator of the status of each functional area.","Referring to , for more detailed FCAPS information, the network administrator may double click the left mouse button on a particular network device (e.g., 192.168.9.201) to cause device navigation tree  to expand and display FCAPS branches, for example, Fault branch , Configuration branch , Accounting branch , Performance branch and Security branch . The administrator may then select one of these branches to cause status window  to display tabs\/folders of data corresponding to the selected branch. For example, if Fault branch is selected (), an Events tab is displayed in status window  as well as tab holders for other tabs (e.g., System Log tab () and Trap Destinations ()). If the administrator double clicks the left mouse button on the Fault branch, then device tree  displays a list of the available fault tabs. The administrator may then select a tab by selecting the tab holder from status window  or device tree .","Events tab () displays an event number, date, time, source, category and description of each fault associated with a module or port selected in device mimic . System Log tab () displays an event number, date, time, source, category and description of each fault associated with the entire network device (e.g., 192.168.9.201), and Trap Destination tab () displays a system\/network device IP address or DNS name, port and status corresponding to each detected trap destination. Various other tabs and formats for displaying fault information may also be provided.","Referring to , if the administrator double clicks the left mouse button on Configuration branch , then device tree  expands to display a list of available configuration sub-branches, for example, ATM protocol sub-branch , System sub-branch and Virtual Connections sub-branch . When the device branch (e.g., 192.168.9.201), Configuration branch or System branch is selected, System tab , Module tab , Ports tab , SONET Interface tab , SONET Paths tab , ATM Interfaces tab , Virtual ATM Interfaces tab  and Virtual Connections tab  are displayed. These configuration tabs are described above in detail (see -and -).","If ATM protocol branch is selected, then tabs\/folders holding ATM protocol information are displayed, for example, Private Network-to-Network Interface (PNNI) tab  (). The PNNI tab may display PNNI cache information such as maximum path (per node), maximum entries (nodes), timer frequency (seconds), age out (seconds) and recently referenced (seconds) data. The PNNI tab may also display PNNI node information for each PNNI node such as domain name, administrative status, ATM address and node level. The PNNI cache and PNNI node information may be for a particular ATM interface, all ATM interfaces in the network device or ATM interfaces corresponding to a port or module selected by the administrator in device mimic . Various other tabs displaying ATM information, for example, an Interim Link Management Interface (ILMI) tab, may also be provided. In addition, various other upper layer network protocol branches may be included in list , for example, MuliProtocol Label Switching (MPLS) protocol, Frame Relay protocol or Internet Protocol (IP) branches, depending upon the capabilities of the selected network device. Moreover, various physical layer network protocol branches (and corresponding tabs) may also be included, for example, Synchronous Optical NETwork (SONET) protocol and\/or Ethernet protocol branches, depending upon the capabilities of the selected network device.","If Virtual Connections branch is selected, then tabs\/folders holding virtual connection information are displayed, for example, Soft Permanent Virtual Circuit (PVC) tab () and Switched Virtual Circuits tab (). Soft PVC tab may display information relating to source interface, Virtual Path Identifier (VPI), Virtual Channel Identifier (VCI), status, date and time. Switched Virtual Circuits tab may display information relating to interface, VPI, VCI, address format, address, status, date and time. The information in either tab may be for a particular virtual connection, all virtual connections in the network device or only those virtual connections corresponding to a port or module selected by the administrator in device mimic . Various other tabs displaying virtual connection information, for example, virtual connections established through various different upper layer network protocols, may also be provided, depending upon the capabilities of the selected network device.","For detailed accounting information, the administrator may select Accounting branch (). This will cause one or more tabs\/folders to be displayed which contain accounting data. For example, a Collection Setup tab  may be displayed that provides details on a primary and a backup archive host\u2014that is, the system executing the Data Collection Server (described above). The Collection Setup tab may also provide statistics timer data and backup file storage data. Various other tabs displaying accounting information may also be provided. For example, a tab may be created for each particular customer to track the details of each account.","For detailed performance information, the administrator may select Performance branch () and double click the left mouse button to review a list of available sub-branches, for example, ATM sub-branch , Connections sub-branch , Interfaces sub-branch , System sub-branch , and SONET sub-branch . Selecting Performance branch or System sub-branch provides general performance tabs in stats window , for example, System tab and Fans tab (). System tab may provide graphical representations of various system performance parameters, for example, an odometer style graphic may be used to display CPU Utilization and power supply voltage level and and a temperature gauge may be used to show Chassis Temperature . Fans tab may provide graphical representations of the status of the network device's fans. For example, fans may be colored green and shown spinning for normal operation, yellow and spinning for a warning status and red and not spinning for a failure status. Various other graphical representations may be used, for example, bar graphs or pie charts, and instead of graphical representations, the data may be provided in a table or other type of format. Moreover, the data in the other tabs displayed in status window  may also be displayed in various formats including graphical representations.","If the administrator selects ATM sub-branch (), various tabs are displayed containing ATM related performance information, for example, ATM Stats In tab , ATM Stats out tab (), Operations Administration Maintenance (OAM) Performance tab (), OAM Loopback tab (), ATM Switched Virtual Circuit (SVC) In tab (), ATM SVC Out tab (), ATM Signaling ATM Adaptation Layer (SAAL) In tab () and ATM SAAL Out tab (). The data displayed in each of these tabs may correspond to a particular ATM path (e.g., ATM-Path111\/2\/1), to all ATM paths corresponding to a particular port or module selected by the administrator in device mimic or to all the ATM paths in the network device. ATM Stats In tab () and ATM Stats Out tab () may display, for example, the type, description, cells, cells per second and bits per second for each ATM path. OAM Performance tab () may display, for example, VPI, VCI, status, session type, sink source, block size and end point statistics for each ATM path, while OAM Loopback tab () may display, for example, VPI, VCI, status, send count, send trap, endpoint and flow statistics for each ATM path. ATM SVC In tab () and ATM SVC Out tab () may display, for example, type, description, total, connected, failures, last cause and setup Protocol Data Unit (PDU) data for each path, and ATM SAAL In tab () and ATM SAAL Out tab () may display, for example, type, description, errors, discards, begin PDUs, begin acknowledge, PDU begin and End PDUs for each ATM path. Various other upper layer network protocol sub-branches may also be displayed in list , including a sub-branch for MPLS, Frame Relay and\/or IP, depending upon the capabilities of the selected network device.","If the administrator selects Connections sub-branch (), various tabs are displayed containing connection related performance information, for example, ATM Connection tab and Priority tab (). ATM Connection tab may include, for example, connection name, transmit, receive cell loss ratio, cell discard total and throughput data for particular ATM connections. Priority tab may include, for example, connection name, Cell Loss Priority (CLP)  transmit, CLP receive, transmit total, CLP receive, CLP receive and receive total data for particular ATM connections. The data in either tab may be for a particular selected ATM connection, each ATM connection in the network device or only those ATM connections corresponding to a particular port or module selected by the administrator in device mimic ","If the administrator selects Interfaces sub-branch (), various tabs are displayed containing interface related performance information, for example, Interfaces tab . Interfaces tab  may include, for example, slot and port location, description, type, speed, in octets, out octets, in errors, out errors, in discards and out discards data for particular ATM interfaces. The data in the tab may be for a particular selected ATM interface, each ATM interface in the network device or only those ATM interfaces corresponding to a particular port or module selected by the administrator in device mimic ","Referring to , if the administrator selects SONET sub-branch , various tabs are displayed containing SONET related performance information, for example, Section tab , Line tab () and Synchronous Transport Signal (STS) Path tab (). Each of the three tabs displays a shelf\/slot\/port location, port descriptor, status, errored seconds, severely errored seconds and coding violation data for each port. The data may correspond to a particular port selected by the administrator, all ports in a selected module or all ports in the entire network device. Various other physical layer network protocol sub-branches may also be displayed in list , including a sub-branch for Ethernet, depending upon the capabilities of the selected network device.","Referring to , if the administrator selects Security branch , various tabs are displayed containing security related information, for example, Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) tab and Configuration Changes tab (). SNMP tab may display, for example, read and read\/write community strings and a command line interpreter (CLI) administrator password for the network device. Configuration Changes tab may display configuration changes made to the network device including event, time, configurer and workstation identification from where the change was made. Various other security tabs may also be provided.","Dynamic Bulletin Boards:","Graphical User Interface (GUI)  described in detail above provides a great deal of information to a network administrator to assist the administrator in managing each network device in a telecommunications network. As shown, however, this information is contained in a large number of GUI screens\/tabs. There may be many instances when a network administrator may want to simultaneously view multiple screens\/tabs. To provide network managers with more control and flexibility personal application bulletin boards (PABBs, i.e., dynamic bulletin boards) are provided that allow the network administrator to customize the information they view by dragging and dropping various GUI screens\/tabs (e.g., windows, table entries, dialog boxes, panels, device mimics, etc.) from GUI  onto one or more dynamic bulletin boards. This allows the administrator to consolidate several GUI screens and\/or dialog boxes into a single view. The information in the dynamic bulletin board remains linked to the GUI such that both the GUI and the bulletin boards are dynamically updated if the screens in either the GUI or in the bulletin boards are changed. As a result, the administrator may manage and\/or configure network devices through the GUI screens or the dynamic bulletin board. Within the dynamic bulletin boards, the administrator may change the format of the data and, perhaps, view the same data in multiple formats simultaneously. Moreover, the administrator may add information to one dynamic bulletin board from multiple different network devices to allow the administrator to simultaneously manage and\/or configure the multiple network devices. The dynamic bulletin boards provide an alternative viewing environment, and administrators can, therefore, choose what they want to view, when they want to view it and how they want to view it.","Referring to , to open a dynamic bulletin board, a network administrator selects a Bulletin Bd option from a view pull-down menu . A bulletin board () is then displayed for the administrator. Instead, a bulletin board may automatically be opened whenever an administrator logs into an NMS client to access GUI . Once the bulletin board is opened, the administrator may use a mouse to move a cursor over a desired GUI screen, press and hold down a left mouse button and drag the selected item onto the bulletin board (i.e., \u201cdrag and drop\u201d). If an item within a GUI screen is capable of being dragged and dropped (i.e., posted) to the bulletin board\u2014that is, the bulletin board supports\/recognizes the GUI object\u2014, a drag and drop icon appears as the administrator drags the cursor over to the bulletin board. If no icon appears, then the selected item is not supported by the bulletin board. Thus, the administrator is provided with visual feedback as to whether or not an item is supported by the PABB.","Referring to , as one example, an administrator may select ATM Stats In tab corresponding to a particular network device (e.g., system 192.168.9.201) and drag and drop (indicated by arrow ) that tab onto bulletin board . Since this is the first item dropped into the bulletin board, the ATM Stats In tab is sized and positioned to use the entire space (or a large portion of the space) dedicated to the bulletin board. Instead of selecting the entire ATM Stats In tab, the administrator may drag and drop only one or only a few entries from the tab, for example, entry , and only those entries would then be displayed in the bulletin board. An item in bulletin board may be removed by clicking on delete button  a. The size of the bulletin board may be increased or decreased by clicking on expand button or by selecting, dragging and dropping a bulletin board boarder (e.g., -), and the bulletin board may be minimized by clicking on minimize button ","The administrator may then select other GUI data to drag and drop onto bulletin board . Referring to , for example, the administrator may select ATM Stats Out tab also corresponding to the same network device and drag and drop (indicated by arrow ) that tab onto bulletin board . The bulletin board automatically splits the screen to include both the ATM Stats In tab and the ATM Stats Out tab . Now the administrator may view both of these screens simultaneously, and since the bulletin board and the screens it displays are linked to GUI , the ATM Stats In and Out tabs are automatically updated with information as the GUI itself is updated with information. Thus, if the administrator changes any data in the items dragged to the bulletin board, the GUI is automatically updated and if any data in the GUI is changed, then any corresponding screens in the bulletin board are also updated. Again, instead of selecting the entire tab, the administrator may select one or more entries in a tab and drag and drop those entries onto the bulletin board. Also, the administrator may delete any bulletin board entry by clicking on the corresponding delete button  a, and change the size of any bulletin board entry using expand button or minimize button ","The administrator may then select other GUI data from the same network device (e.g., system 192.168.9.201) to drag and drop to the bulletin board or the administrator may select a different network device (e.g., system 192.168.9.202, ) in navigation tree  and drag and drop various GUI screens corresponding to that network device to bulletin board . For example, the administrator may select ATM Stats In tab and drag and drop (indicated by arrow ) that tab to bulletin board , and the administrator may then select ATM Stats Out tab () corresponding to system 192.168.9.202 and drag and drop (indicated by arrow ) that tab onto bulletin board . Consequently, the administrator is able to simultaneously view multiple screens corresponding to different network devices. The administrator may also choose to drag and drop related screens. For example, ATM Stats In and Out tabs , and , , respectively, may represent two ends of an ATM connection between the two network devices, and viewing these screens simultaneously may assist the administrator in managing both network devices.","As shown in -, when new items are dropped onto the bulletin board, the bulletin board continues to divide the available space to fit the new items and may shrink the items to fit in the available space. Many more items may be added to a bulletin board, for example eight to ten items. However, instead of continuing to add items to the same bulletin board, the administrator may choose to open multiple bulletin boards (e.g., -, ).","An administrator may wish to view an item dragged to a bulletin board in a different format than that displayed in the GUI. The different format may, for example, have more meaning to them or provide more clarity to the task at hand. For instance, after dragging and dropping ATM Stats In tab to bulletin board (), the administrator may then move the cursor over the ATM Stats In tab and double click the right mouse button to cause a pull-down menu  displaying various format options to appear. A normal format option may cause the item to appear as it did in the GUI\u2014that is, ATM Stats In tab will appear as shown in . A list format option may cause the data in ATM Stats In tab to be displayed as an ordered list as shown in . A graph option may cause the data in ATM Stats In tab to be displayed as a pie chart (), a bar graph () or any other type of graph or graphical representation. A config option may cause the data in the ATM Stats In tab to be displayed as a dialog box () displaying configuration data corresponding to a selected one of the ATM paths within the ATM Stats In tab. The data in a bulletin board entry may be displayed in a variety of different ways to make the administrator's tasks simpler and more efficient.","Referring to , an administrator may wish to view an item dragged to a bulletin board in multiple different formats simultaneously. For example, the administrator may move the cursor over ATM Stats In tab in the bulletin board, press down and hold the left mouse button and drag the cursor (indicated by arrow ) over a blank area of the bulletin board (i.e., drag and drop) to add a second copy of ATM Stats In tab to the bulletin board. The administrator may then move the cursor over the copied ATM Stats In tab, double click the right mouse button to cause pull-down menu  to appear and select a different format in which to display the copied ATM Stats In tab. As a result, the administrator is able to simultaneously view the normal format while also viewing another format, for example, a pie chart.","Although the above examples used the ATM Stats In and Out tabs, it is to be understood that any of the tabs or entries within tabs in status window  may be capable of being dragged and dropped into one or more dynamic bulletin boards. In addition, an administrator may drag and drop one or more of the FCAPS buttons -() to a bulletin board.","Referring to , in addition to dragging and dropping items from status window  or the FCAPS buttons, an administrator may drag and drop (indicated by arrow ) device mimic onto bulletin board . In this example, the administrator has dragged and dropped the device mimic corresponding to network device 192.168.9.201. As previously mentioned, the device mimic may display ports and modules in different colors to indicate status for those components, for example, green for normal operation, yellow for warning status and red for failure status. The administrator may then monitor the device mimic in the bulletin board while continuing to use GUI  for other configuration and management operations. Instead, the administrator may only select, drag and drop portions of the device mimic, for example, only one or more universal port cards or one or more forwarding cards.","Referring to , the administrator may also select a different network device in navigation tree  and then drag and drop (indicated by arrow ) a device mimic  corresponding to that device onto bulletin board . As a result, the administrator may simultaneously view the device mimics of both network devices (or more than two network devices). In addition, the administrator may drag and drop both a front and a back view of a device mimic such that all of a network device's modules may be visible. Instead, the administrator may drag and drop a front and back view , () from a separate pull away window .","A network administrator may save one or more dynamic bulletin boards before exiting out of the NMS client, and the NMS client may persist this data in the administrator's profile (described below). When the administrator logs in to the same or a different NMS client and selects Bulletin Bd option (), their profile may automatically open up any saved dynamic bulletin boards or present the administrator with a list of saved dynamic bulletin boards that the administrator may select to have opened. When saved dynamic bulletin boards are re-opened, the NMS client updates any items posted in those bulletin boards such that the posted items are synchronized with the GUI. Instead, the NMS client may automatically open any saved dynamic bulletin boards as soon as the administrator logs on\u2014that is, without requiring the administrator to select Bulletin Bd option .","Through saved bulletin boards, a senior administrator may guide and instruct junior administrators through various tasks. For example, a senior administrator may drag and drop a sequence of GUI screens onto one or more bulletin boards where the sequence of GUI screens represent a series of steps that the senior administrator wants the junior administrator to take to complete a particular task (e.g., provisioning a SONET path). In addition to providing the series of steps, the senior administrator may fill in various parameters (e.g., traffic descriptors) to indicate to junior administrators the default parameters the senior administrator wants them to use. The saved bulletin board may then be added to the junior administrator's profile or put in a master profile accessible by multiple users. The junior administrator may then use a saved bulletin board to interactively complete provisioning tasks similar to the task shown in the saved bulletin board. For example, the junior administrator may use the saved SONET path bulletin board to provision one or more different SONET paths. In effect, then saved bulletin boards behave as custom wizards.","As described above, the dynamic bulletin boards allow a network administrator to actively monitor\u2014simultaneously\u2014specific information about one or more operational network devices. This provides a powerful customization tool for the administrator of large, complex network devices in large, complex telecommunications networks. By customizing views of one or more devices, the administrator may view only the data they need to see and in a format that best meets their needs.","Custom Object Collections:","As described above with respect to FCAPS management, a network device (e.g., , , ) may include a large number (e.g., millions) of configurable\/manageable objects such as modules, ports, paths, connections, etc. To provide flexibility and scalability, the network management system (NMS) allows users to create custom object collections. Thus, even though a network device or multiple network devices in a telecommunication network may include millions of objects, a network manager may create a collection and add only objects of interest to that collection. The objects may be of a similar or different type and may correspond to the same or different network devices. The network manager may also add and remove objects from existing collections, create additional new collections and remove existing collections. The network manager may then view the various objects in each collection. In addition, the collections are linked to the NMS graphical user interface (GUI), such that changes to objects in either are updated in the other. Custom object collections provide scalability and flexibility. In addition, custom object collections may be tied to user profiles to limit access. For example, a customer may be limited to viewing only the collections of objects related to their account. Similarly, a network manager may be limited to viewing only those collections of objects for which they have authority.","Referring to , when a user first logs into an NMS client by supplying a username and password, a list of network devices (e.g., 192.168.9.201 and 192.168.9.202) is displayed in accordance with the user's profile. Profiles are described in more detail below. In addition, a list of collections that correspond with the user's profile may also be provided. For example, navigation tree  may include a network branch , and if the user double clicks the left mouse button on the network branch a Collections branch is displayed. Similarly, if the user double clicks the left mouse button on the Collections branch, a list is provided of available collections (e.g., Test, New, Walmart, Kmart). Alternatively or in addition, the user may select a Collections option from a view pull-down menu to display list of available collections. List may include collections pre-defined by other users (e.g., senior network administrator) and\/or custom collections previously created by the user.","Referring to , to view collections that include objects corresponding to only one network device, the user may select a network device (e.g., 192.168.9.201) and select a Collections option . If the user double clicks the left mouse button on Collections option , a list (e.g., Test and New) of available collections corresponding to the selected network device is displayed. In addition, as the user selects various FCAPS tabs, collections containing objects from the selected tab may be displayed. For example, collection Test () in navigation tree may include objects selected from Virtual ATM Interfaces tab  and is therefore displayed when the Virtual ATM Interfaces tab is selected.","Referring to , to add an object to an existing or new collection, a network manager first selects the object (e.g., Module object ) and then selects a Collection button to cause an Add to Collection option and a New Collection option to appear. If the network manager selects New Collection option , then a dialog box () appears and the network manager inputs the name of the new collection. After inputting the name of the new collection, the network manager selects OK button and the object is automatically added to the collection and dialog box is closed. If the network manager selects Add to Collection option , a dialog box () appears listing the available collections. The user may then select one of the listed collections and then select OK button to add the object to the collection and close dialog box ","Alternatively, the network manager may add an object to a collection by dragging and dropping an object from an FCAPs tab onto a collection branch in a navigation tree. Referring to , for example, a network manager may select an object by pressing down on the left mouse button, dragging (indicated by arrows and ) the object to a collection and dropping the object on the collection (i.e., drag and drop). For instance, object may be dragged and dropped on collection Test in either navigation tree or . An object may also be dragged and dropped into a named collection in a pull down menu or dialog box.","When a collection is selected by a network manager, customer or other user, for example, by double clicking on the collection name in a navigation tree or pull down menu, the tabs in service status window  are changed to include only objects in the selected collection. For instance, if the collection includes only SONET path objects, then only the SONET Paths tab will include objects once the collection is selected and all other tabs will not include any objects. Alternatively, the other tabs in service status window  may include objects corresponding to or related to the objects in the selected collection.","Referring to , when device 192.168.9.201 is selected and the SONET Paths tab is selected, a large number of SONET paths may be displayed. Referring to , when collection New is selected, the SONET Paths Tab is changed to display only those SONET path objects within the New collection. As a result, the user need only view the objects in which they are interested.","To remove an object from a collection, the network manager selects an object and then selects a Remove button . The network manager may also select an object and double click the left mouse button to cause a dialog box to appear. The network manager may edit certain parameters and then exit from the dialog box. Any changes made to an object in a collection are automatically updated in GUI . Similarly, any changes made to an object in GUI  are automatically updated in any and all collections including that object.","Custom object collections allow a user to view only those objects that are of interest. These may be a few objects from an otherwise very large object list in the same FCAPS tab (that is, the collection acts as a filter), and these may be a few objects from different FCAPS tabs (that is, the collection acts as an aggregator). Consequently, both flexibility and scalability are provided through custom object collections.","Custom object collections may also be used to restrict access to network objects. For example, a senior network administrator may establish a collection of objects and provide access to that collection to a junior network manager through the junior network manager's profile. In one embodiment, the junior network manager may not be provided with the full navigation tree  () after logging in. Instead, only a list of available collections may be provided. Thus, the junior network manager's access to the network is limited to the objects contained in the available collections and the FCAPS tabs will similarly only include those same objects.","Similarly, collections may be created that include objects corresponding to a particular customer, for example, Walmart or Kmart. A customer profile may be established for each customer and one or more collections containing only objects relevant to each customer may be assigned to the relevant customer profile. Consequently, each customer is limited to viewing only those objects corresponding to their own accounts and not the accounts of any other customers. This permits Customer Network Management (CNM) without breaching the security provided to each customer account.","Profiles:","Profiles may be used by the NMS client to provide individual users (e.g., network managers and customers) with customized graphical user interfaces (GUIs) or views of their network and with defined management capabilities. For example, some network managers are only responsible for a certain set of devices in the network. Displaying all network devices makes their management tasks more difficult and may inadvertently provide them with management capabilities over network devices for which they are not responsible or authorized to perform. With respect to customers, profiles limit access to only those network device resources in a particular customer's network\u2014that is, only those network device resources for which the customer has subscribed\/paid. This is crucial to protecting the proprietary nature of each customer's network. Profiles also allow each network manager and customer to customize the GUI into a presentation format that is most efficient or easy for them to use. For example, even two users with access to the same network devices and having the same management capabilities may have different GUI customizations through their profiles. In addition, profiles may be used to provide other important information, for example, SNMP community strings to allow an NMS server to communicate with a network device over SNMP, SNMP retry and timeout values, and which NMS servers to use, for example, primary and secondary servers may be identified.","A network administrator is typically someone who powers up a network device for the first time, installs necessary software on the new network device as well as installs any NMS software on an NMS computer system, and adds any additional hardware and\/or software to a network device. The network administrator is also the person that attaches physical network cables to network device ports. The first time GUI  is displayed to a network administrator, an NMS client application uses a default profile including a set of default values. Referring again to , the administrator may change the default values in his profile by selecting (e.g., clicking on) a profile selection  in a navigation tree\/menu . This causes the NMS client to display a profiles tab  () on the screen. The profile tab displays any existing profiles . The first time the profile tab appears only the network administrator's profile is displayed as no other profiles yet exist.","To save a network manager's time, the profiles tab may also include a copy button . By selecting a profile  and clicking on the copy button, an existing profile is copied. The network manager may then change the parameters within the copied profile. This is helpful where two user profiles are to include the same or similar parameters.","To change the parameters in the network administrator's profile or any other existing profile, including a copied profile, the user double clicks on one of the profiles . To add a new profile, the user clicks on an Add button . In either case, the NMS client displays a profile dialog box  () on the screen. Through the profile dialog box, a user's user name , password and confirmed password may be added or changed. The confirm password field is used to assure that the password was entered properly in the password field. The password and confirmed password may be encrypted strings used for user authentication. These fields will be displayed as asterisks on the screen. Once added, a user simply logs on to an NMS client with this user name and password and the NMS client displays the GUI in accordance with the other parameters of this profile.","A group level access field enables\/disables various management capabilities (i.e., functionality available through the NMS client). Clicking on the group level access field may provide a list of available access levels. In one embodiment, access levels may include administrator, provisioner and viewer (e.g., customer), with administrator having the highest level of management capabilities and viewer having the lowest level of management capabilities (described in more detail below). In one embodiment, users can create profiles for other users at or below their own group access level. For example, a user at the provisioner access level can create user profiles for users at either the provisioner or viewer level but cannot create an administrator user profile.","A description may be added in a description field , including, for example, a description of the user, phone number, fax number and\/or e-mail address. A group name may be added to group field , and a list of network device IP addresses may be provided in a device list field . Alternatively, a domain name server (DNS) name may be provided and a host look up may be used to access the IP address of the corresponding device. Where a group name is provided, the list of network devices is associated with the group such that if the same group name is assigned to multiple user profiles, the users will be presented with the same view\u2014that is, the same list of network devices in device list field . For example, users from the same customer may share a group name corresponding to that customer. A wildcard feature is available for the group field. For example, perhaps an * or ALL may be used as a wildcard to indicate that a particular user is authorized to see all network devices. In most instances, the wildcard feature will only be used for a high-level network administrator. The list of devices indicates which network devices the user may manage or view, for example, configuration status and statistics data may be viewed.","Within a profile certain policy flags (i.e., attributes) may also be set. For example, a flag may be set to indicate that the user is not allowed to change his\/her password, and an account disable flag may be set to disable a particular profile\/account. In addition, a flag may be set to allow the user to add network device IP addresses to device list field , and a number may be added to a timeout field to specify a number of minutes after which a user will be automatically logged out due to inactivity. A zero in this field or no value in this field may be used to indicate unlimited activity, that is, the user will never be automatically logged out.","The profile may also be used to indicate with which NMS servers the NMS client should communicate. An IP address or DNS name may be added to a primary server field and a secondary server field . If the primary server fails, the client will access the secondary server. A port number may be added to primary server port field and to secondary server port field to indicate the particular ports that should be used for RMI connectivity to the primary and secondary NMS servers.","As described below, the information provided in a user profile is stored in tables within the NMS database, and when a user logs onto the network through an NMS client, the NMS client connects to an NMS server that retrieves the user's profile information and sends the information to the NMS client. The NMS client automatically saves the NMS server primary and secondary IP addresses and port numbers from the user's profile to a team session file associated with the user's username and password in a memory  () local to the NMS client. If the user logs into an NMS client through a web browser, then the NMS client may save the NMS server primary and secondary IP addresses and port numbers to a cookie that is then stored in the user's local hard drive. The next time the user logs in to the NMS client, the NMS client uses the IP addresses and port numbers stored in the team session file or cookie to connect to the appropriate NMS server.","The first time a user accesses an NMS client, however, no team session file or cookie will be available. Consequently, during the initial access of the NMS client, the NMS client may use a default IP address to connect with an NMS server or a pop-up menu  () may be displayed in which the user may type in the IP address in a field of the NMS server they want the NMS client to use or select an IP address from a pop-up menu that appears when a dropdown button is selected.","User profiles and team session files\/cookies allow a network administrator or provisioner to push down new NMS server IP addresses, port numbers and other information to users simply by changing those values in the user profiles. For example, an NMS server may be over loaded and a network administrator may wish to move some users from this NMS server to another less utilized NMS server. The administrator need only change the NMS server IP addresses and port numbers in the users' profiles to affect the switch. The NMS server sends the new IP addresses and port numbers to the one or more NMS clients through which the users are logged in, and the NMS clients save the new IP addresses and port numbers in each user's team session file or cookie. The next time the users log in, the NMS client(s) use the new IP addresses and port numbers in the team session files or cookies to access the appropriate NMS server. Thus, the users selected by the administrator are automatically moved to a different NMS server without the need to notify those users or take additional steps. In addition to saving IP addresses and perhaps port numbers in team session files\/cookies, other information from the user profile may also be saved in team session files\/cookies and changes to that information may be pushed down by the administrator simply by changing a user profile.","Referring again to , additional fields may be added to device list to provide more information. For example, a read field may be used to indicate the SNMP community string to be used to allow the NMS server to communicate with the network device over SNMP. The SNMP connection may be used to retrieve statistical data and device status from the network device. In addition, a read\/write field may be used to indicate an SNMP community string to allow the NMS server to configure the network device and\/or provision services. The profile may also include a retry field and a timeout field to provide SNMP retry and timeout values. Many different fields may be provided in a profile.","Instead of providing all the parameters and fields in a single profile dialog box, they may be separated into a variety of a tabbed dialog boxes (-). The tabbed dialog boxes may provide better scalability and flexibility for future needs.","In one embodiment, an administrator level user has both read and write access to the physical and logical objects of the NMS client. Thus, all screens and functionality are available to an administrator level user, and an administrator after physically attaching an external network attachment to a particular network device port may then enable that port and provision SONET paths on that port. All screens are available to a provisioner level user, however, they do not have access to all functionality as they are limited to read-only access of physical objects. For example, a provisioner can see SONET ports available on a device and can provision SONET paths on a port, but the provisioner cannot enable\/disable a SONET port. In other words, a provisioner's power begins at the start of logical objects (not physical objects), for example, SONET paths, ATM interfaces, virtual ATM interfaces, and PVCs, and continues through all the configuration aspects of any object or entity that can be stacked on top of either a SONET path or ATM interface. A viewer (e.g., customer) level user has read-only access to logical entities and only those logical entities corresponding to their group name or listed in the device list field. A viewer may or may not have access to Fault, Configuration, Accounting, and Security categories of FCAPS relative to their devices.","A customer may install an NMS client at a customer site or, preferably, the customer will use a web browser to access the NMS client. To use the web browser, a service provider gives the customer an IP address corresponding to the service provider's site. The customer supplies the IP address to their web browser and while at the service provider site, the customer logs in with their username and password. The NMS client then displays the customer level GUI corresponding to that username and password.","Referring to , a user preference dialog box  may be used to customize the GUI into a presentation format that is most efficient or easy for a user to work with. For example, show flags (i.e., attributes) may be used to add tool tips (flag ), add horizontal grid lines on tables (flag ), add vertical grid lines on tables (flag ) and add bookmarks\/short cuts (e.g., create a short cut to a PVC dialog box). Look and feel flags may also be used to make the GUI appear as a JAVA GUI would appear (flag ) or as a native application, for example, Windows, Windows\/NT or Motif, GUI would appear (flag ).","As an alternative to providing a Group Name () or a Customer Name (), when a profile is created or changed the administrator or provisioner may double click the left mouse button on a network device (e.g., 192.168.9.202, or ) in the device list to cause a pop-up menu  () to be displayed. The pop-up menu provides a list of available groups corresponding to the selected network device, and the administrator or provisioner may select one or more groups (e.g., Walmart-East, Walmart-West) from the list for which the user corresponding to profile will be authorized to access.","Each group may include one or more configured resources (e.g., SONET paths, VATM interfaces, ATM PVCs) within the network device, and the resources in each group may be related in some way. For instance, a group may include resources configured by a particular provisioner. As another example, a group may include configured resources purchased by a particular customer. For instance, Walmart Corporation may be a customer of a network service provider and each network device resource paid for\/subscribed to by Walmart may be included in a Walmart group. In addition, if Walmart subscribes to a larger number of configured resources, the network service provider may create several groups within the same network device for Walmart, for example, Walmart-East may include network device resources associated with Walmart activities in the eastern half of the United States and Walmart-West may include network device resources associated with Walmart activities in the western half of the United States. In addition, the network service provider may create a Walmart-Total group including all configured resources within the network device paid for by Walmart. Various users may be given access to one or more groups. For example, a Walmart employee responsible for network service in the eastern half of the United States may be given access to only the Walmart-East group while another higher level Walmart employee is given access to both the Walmart-East and Walmart-West groups. In addition, the same group name may be used in multiple network devices to simplify tracking. Through profiles multiple users may be given access to the same or different groups of configured resources within each network device, and users may be given access to multiple groups of configured resources in different network devices.","When an administrator or a provisioner configures a network device resource, they may assign that resource to a particular group. For example, when an administrator or provisioner configures one or more SONET paths, they may assign each SONET path to a particular group. Referring to -, within a SONET Path configuration wizard , an administrator or provisioner may select a SONET Path within the SONET path table and type in a group name in field or select a group name from a pop-up menu displayed when dropdown button is selected. When the administrator\/provisioner selects OK button or Modify button , the NMS client sends the SONET path data to the NMS server. The NMS server uses this data to fill in a SONET path table (e.g., \u2032, and ) in configuration database . A new row is added to the SONET path table for each newly configured SONET path, and data in existing rows are modified for modified SONET paths.","In addition, the NMS server searches a Managed Resource Group table  () within the configuration database for a match with each assigned group name. If no match is found for a group name, indicating the group name represents a new group, then the NMS server adds a row to the Managed Resource Group table, and the NMS server assigns the group an LID (e.g., ) and inserts the LID into an LID column . The NMS server also inserts the Managed Device PID (e.g., ) from column in Managed Device table  (and ) in the configuration database into a column and inserts the group name in column ","The NMS server also uses the SONET path data from the NMS client to add a row in a Managed Resource Table  (and ) in configuration database  for each newly configured SONET path or to modify data in existing rows for modified SONET paths. The NMS server assigns an LID (e.g., ) to each row and inserts the assigned LID into a column . The NMS server then inserts the assigned SONET path LID (e.g., ) from Path LID column () in the SONET path table into a Resource LID column . The NMS server also inserts the assigned group LID (e.g., ) from column in Managed Resource Group table  () into a managed resource group LID column ","Just as each SONET path may be assigned to a group, each other type of configured resource\/manageable entity within the network device may be assigned to a group. For example, when an administrator or provisioner configures a virtual ATM (VATM) interface, they may also assign the VATM interface to a group. Referring to , within an Add V-ATM Interface dialog box , an administrator or provisioner may type in a group name in a field or select a group name from a pop-up menu displayed when expansion button is selected. As another example, when an administrator or provisioner configures an ATM PVC, they may assign the ATM PVC to a particular group. Referring to , in a virtual connection wizard , the administrator or provisioner may assign an ATM PVC to a group by typing in a group name in a field or by selecting a group name from a pop-up menu displayed when expansion button (e.g., Group List) is selected. Again, when the administrator or provisioner selects OK button () or Finish button (), the NMS client sends the relevant data to the NMS server. The NMS server updates Virtual ATM Interface table  (), a Virtual Connection table  (), Virtual Link table  () and Cross-Connect table  (), as described below, and similar to the actions taken for the configured SONET paths, the NMS server adds a row to Managed Resource Group table  () for each new group and a row to Managed Resource table  () for each new managed resource\u2014that is, for each new VATM interface and for each new ATM PVC. This same process may be used to add any manageable entity to a group.","Instead of using a Managed Resource Group table and a Managed Resource table, the configured network device resource tables (e.g., SONET path table, Virtual ATM IF table, etc.) could include a group name field. However, the Managed Resource Group adds a layer of abstraction, which may allow each configured resource to belong to multiple groups. Moreover, the Managed Resource table provides scalability and modularity by not being tied to a particular resource type. That is, the Managed Resource table will include a row for each different type of configured resource and if the network device is upgraded to include new types of configurable resources, they too may be added to the Managed Resource table without having to upgrade other processes. If each configurable resource is limited to belonging to only one group, then the Managed Resource Table  () may include only Resource LID and not LID ","Referring again to -, after adding or changing a user profile, the administrator or provisioner selects OK button . Selection of the OK button causes the NMS client (e.g., NMS client , ) to send the information provided in the dialog box (or boxes) to an NMS server (e.g., NMS server ), and the NMS server uses the received information to update various tables in NMS database . In one embodiment, for a newly added user, the NMS server assigns a unique logical identification number (LID) to the user and adds a new row in a User table  (and ) in the NMS database including the assigned LID and the username , password and group access level provided by the NMS client. For example, the NMS server may add a new row including an assigned user LID of , a username of Dave, a password of Marble and a group access level of provisioner.","The NMS server also adds a row to a User Managed Device table  (and ) for each network device listed in the user profile. For each row, the NMS server assigns a user managed device LID (e.g., ) and inserts it in an LID column . The NMS server also inserts a user LID , a host LID , a retry value and a timeout value . The inserted retry and timeout values are from the user profile information sent from the NMS client. The user LID includes the previously assigned user LID (e.g., ) from column of User Table . The host LID is retrieved from an Administration Managed Device table  (and ).","The Administration Managed Device table includes a row for each network device (i.e., managed device) in the telecommunications network. To add a network device to the network, an administrator selects an Add Device option in a pop-up menu () in GUI  to cause dialog box  () to be displayed. The administrator enters the intended IP address or DNS name (e.g., 192.168.9.202) of the new network device into a device host field and may also enter a device port (e.g., ) into a device port field . The administrator also adds SNMP retry and timeout values, which may be overridden later by values supplied within each user profile. In addition, the administrator adds a password for each user access level. In one embodiment, the administrator adds an administrator password , a provisioner password and a viewer password for the managed device.","The Administration Managed Device table, therefore, provides a centralized set of device records shared by all NMS servers, and since the records are centralized, the Administration Managed Device table facilitates centralized changes to the devices in the network. For example, a network device may be added to the network by adding a record and removed from the network by deleting a record. As another example, a network device's parameters (e.g., IP address) may be changed by modifying data in a record. Because the changes are made to centralized records accessed by all NMS servers, no change notifications need to be sent and the NMS servers may automatically receive the changed data during the next access of the table. Alternatively, the NMS server that makes a change to the central database may send notices out to each connected NMS client and other NMS servers in the network.","For newly added devices, after the information is input in the dialog box, the administrator selects an Add button causing the NMS client to send the data from the dialog box to the NMS server. Similarly, for changes to device data, after the information is changed in the dialog box, the administrator selects an OK button to cause the NMS client to send the data from the dialog box to the NMS server. For new devices, the NMS server uses the received information to add a row to Administration Managed Device table  in NMS database , and for existing devices, the NMS server uses the received information to update a previously entered row in the Administration Managed Device table. For each managed device\/row, the NMS server assigns a host LID (e.g., ) and inserts it in LID column ","When the NMS server adds a new row to the User Managed Device table  (), corresponding to a managed device in a user profile, the NMS server searches column in the Administration Managed Device table  for a host address matching the IP address (e.g., 192.168.9.202) provided in the user profile information sent from the NMS client. When a match is found, the NMS server retrieves the host LID (e.g., ) from column and inserts it in host LID column in the User Managed Device table.","After receiving user profile information from an NMS client, the NMS server also updates a User Resource Group Map table  (and ) in NMS database . For each group identified in the user profile information\u2014one or more groups may be selected in each Group List dialog box  associated with each network device in the user profile\u2014the NMS server adds a row to the User Resource Group Map table. The NMS server assigns an LID (e.g., ) for each row and inserts the LID in a column . The NMS server then inserts the User LID (e.g., ) into User LID column from User table  column corresponding to the user profile. In addition, the NMS server inserts a User Resource Group LID into column ","For each group name received by the NMS server, the NMS server searches a User Resource Group table  (and ), group name column , for a match. If a match is not found, then the group is a new group, and the NMS server adds a row to the User Resource Group table. The NMS server assigns an LID (e.g., ) to each row and inserts the assigned LID into an LID column . This User Resource Group LID is also added to column in the User Resource Group Map table  (). Within the User Resource Group table  (), the NMS server also inserts the network device's host LID in a column from Administration Managed Device table  (), column , and the NMS server inserts the group name (e.g., Walmart-East) in column . Through the group name, the User Resource Group table in the NMS database provides for dynamic binding with the Managed Resource Group table  () in the configuration database, as described below.","After a user's profile is created, the user may log in through an NMS client (e.g., , ) by typing in their username and password. The NMS client then sends the username and password to an NMS server (e.g., ), and in response, the NMS server sends a query to NMS database  to search User table  () column for a username matching the username provided by the NMS client. If the username is not found, then the user is denied access. If the username is found, then, for additional security, the NMS server may compare the password provided by the NMS client to the password stored in column of the User table. If the passwords do not match, then the user is denied access. If the passwords match, then the NMS server creates a user profile logical managed object (LMO).","In one embodiment, the user profile LMO is a JAVA object and a JAVA persistence layer within the NMS server creates the user profile LMO. For each persistent JAVA class\/object, metadata is stored in a class table  () within the NMS database. Thus, the JAVA persistence layer within the NMS server begins by retrieving metadata from the class table in the NMS database corresponding to the user profile LMO. The metadata may include simple attributes and association attributes.","Referring to , the metadata for a user profile LMO  includes three simple attributes\u2014username , password and group access level \u2014and two association attributes\u2014resource group maps and managed devices . The NMS server inserts the username (e.g., Dave), password (e.g., Marble) and group access level (e.g., provisioner) retrieved from the User table  into the user profile LMO  () being created. The managed devices association attribute causes the NMS server to create a user managed device properties LMO  for each network device in the user's profile.","The NMS server first retrieves metadata from class table  associated with the user managed device properties LMO . The metadata includes two simple attributes (retry and timeout ) and one association attribute (managed device ). The metadata causes the NMS server to search User Managed Device table  () column for a user LID (e.g., ) corresponding to the user LID in column () of User table  in a row associated with the username and password received from the NMS client. For each row in the User Managed Device table having the matching user LID (e.g., ), the NMS server creates a user managed device properties LMO  and inserts the retry value from column as the retry simple attribute and the timeout value from column as the timeout simple attribute ","In response to the managed device associated attribute, the NMS server retrieves metadata from class table  associated with administration managed device properties LMO . The metadata includes a list of simple attributes including host address , port address , SNMP retry value , SNMP timeout value and a database port address for connecting to the configuration database within the network device. The metadata also includes simple attributes corresponding to passwords for each of the possible group access levels, for example, an administrator password , a provisioner password and a viewer password ","The NMS server uses the host LID (e.g., ) from column in the User Managed Device table () as a primary key to locate the row (e.g., , ) in the Administration Managed Device table  corresponding to the network device. The NMS server uses the data in this table row to insert values for the simple attributes in the Administration Managed Device LMO . For example, a host address of 192.168.9.202 and a port address of  may be inserted. The NMS server also selects a password corresponding to the user's group access level. For instance, if the user's group access level is provisioner, then the NMS server inserts the provisioner password of, for example, team, from column into the Administration Managed Device LMO.","The NMS server then inserts the newly created Administration Managed Device LMO  into the corresponding User Managed Device Properties LMO , and the NMS server also inserts each newly created User Managed Devices Properties LMO  into User Profile LMO . Thus, the information necessary for connecting to each network device listed in the user profile is made available within user LMO .","The resource group maps association attribute () within user LMO  causes the NMS server to create a user resource group map LMO  for each group in the user's profile. The user resource group map LMO  includes one simple attribute\u2014user profile \u2014and one association attribute\u2014user resource group . The NMS server inserts the user LID (e.g., ) corresponding to the user LID in column () in User table  associated with the username, password and group access level received from the NMS client.","In response to user resource group associated attribute , the NMS server creates a User Resource Group LMO . The NMS server begins by retrieving metadata from class table  corresponding to the User Resource Group LMO. The metadata includes three simple attributes: host address , port address and group name . The NMS server searches User Resource Group Map table  () for the user LID (e.g., ) corresponding to the username and password received from the NMS client. The NMS server then uses the corresponding user resource group LID (e.g., ) from column as a primary key to locate a row (e.g., , ) in User Resource Group table . The NMS server inserts the group name (e.g., Walmart-East) from the located row in User Resource Group table  as simple attribute in user resource group LMO . The NMS server then uses the host LID (e.g., ) from the located row to search column in the Administration Managed Device table  () for a match. Once a match is found, the NMS server uses data in the located row (e.g., ) to insert the host address (e.g., 192.168.9.202) from column as simple attribute and the port address (e.g., ) from column as simple attribute in user resource group LMO . The NMS server then inserts the user resource group LMO  into the user resource group map LMO , and the NMS server inserts each of the user resource group map LMOs  into the user profile LMO . Thus, the data (e.g., host and port address and group name) required to locate each group included in the user profile is inserted within user profile LMO .","The NMS server sends data from the user profile LMO to the NMS client to allow the NMS client to present the user with a graphical user interface such as GUI  shown in . If the user selects one of the network devices listed in navigation tree , the NMS server retrieves the group level access (e.g., provisioner) and the password (e.g., team) corresponding to that group level access from the user profile LMO and then connects to the selected network device. The NMS server then retrieves the network device's physical data as described below under the heading \u201cNMS Server Scalability.\u201d","Alternatively, a more robust set of data may be sent from the NMS server to the NMS client such that for each transaction issued by the NMS client, the data provided with the transaction eliminates the need for the NMS server to access the user profile LMO in its local memory. This reduces the workload of the NMS server, which will likely be sent transactions from many NMS clients. In one embodiment, the NMS server may send the NMS client the entire user profile LMO. Instead, the server may create a separate client user profile LMO that may present the data in a format expected by the NMS client and perhaps include only some of the data from the user profile LMO stored locally to the NMS server. In the preferred embodiment, the client user profile LMO includes at least data corresponding to each device in the user profile and each group selected within the user profile for each device. If the user selects one of the network devices listed in navigation tree , the NMS client includes the selected network device's IP address, the password corresponding to the user's group access level and the database port number in the \u201cGet Network Device\u201d transaction sent to the NMS server. The NMS server uses this information to connect to the network device and return the network device's physical data to the NMS client.","If the user selects a tab in configuration status window  that includes logical data corresponding to configured network device resources (e.g., SONET Paths tab  (), ATM Interfaces tab  (), Virtual ATM Interfaces tab  (), Virtual Connections tab  ()), then the NMS server searches the user profile LMO for group names corresponding to the selected network device or the NMS client provides the group names in the transaction. The NMS server then retrieves data from the selected network device for configured resources corresponding to each group name and the selected tab. If no group names are listed, the NMS server may retrieve data for all configured resources corresponding to the selected tab.","For example, if a user selects SONET Paths tab  (), then the NMS server searches the user profile LMO for all group names corresponding to the selected network device (e.g., Walmart-East) or the NMS client provides all group names (e.g., Walmart-East) corresponding to the selected network device to the NMS server as part of the \u201cGet SONET paths\u201d transaction. The NMS server then dynamically issues a where clause such as \u201cwhere SONET path is in group Walmart-East\u201d. This causes group name column in the Managed Resource Group table  () in the network device's configuration database  to be searched for a match with the group name of Walmart-East. Additional where clauses may be dynamically issued corresponding to other group names found in the user profile LMO. If no match is found for a group name in column , then the NMS server simply returns an empty set to the NMS client. If a match is found for a group name (e.g., Walmart-East), then the NMS server retrieves the managed resource group LID (e.g., ) from column in the same row (e.g., row ) as the matching group name.","The NMS server then searches column in the Managed Resource table  () for one or more matches with the retrieved managed resource group LID (e.g., ). As described above, the Managed Resource Table includes one row for each configured network device resource in a particular group. For each match found for the retrieved managed resource group LID (e.g., ), the NMS server uses the resource LID (e.g., ) from column as a primary key to a row in a table including the data corresponding to the configured resource. In this example, a resource LID of  corresponds to a row in SONET Path Table \u2032 (). Since the user selected the SONET Paths tab, the NMS server retrieves the data in the corresponding row and sends it to the NMS client. The NMS client uses the data to update graphical user interface (GUI) tables  in local memory , which causes GUI  to display the SONET path to the user. Other SONET paths may also be included in the group Walmart-East, and those would be similarly located and retrieved by the NMS server and sent to the NMS client for display to the user.","Since each group may include different types of configured resources, the NMS server may locate configured resources other than SONET paths, for example, VATMs or ATM PVCs, in Managed Resource table . If configured resources are found that do not correspond to the tab selected by the user, the NMS server does not retrieve the associated data or send it to the NMS client. The NMS server follows a similar process if the user selects another tab including logical data, for example, ATM Interfaces tab  (), Virtual ATM Interfaces tab  () or Virtual Connections tab  (). Although the above discussion has used SONET paths, VATM interfaces and ATM PVCs as examples of configurable resources that may be included in a group, other configurable resources may also be included, for example, configurable resources corresponding to different layer one or upper layer network protocols (e.g., Ethernet, MPLS, Frame Relay, IP).","When data is stored in tables within the same database, references from one table to another may provide a direct binding and referential integrity may be maintained by only deleting the upper most record\u2014that is, not leaving any dangling records. Referential integrity prevents references from being orphaned, which may lead to data loss or other more severe problems, such as a system crash. In the current embodiment, tables are stored across multiple databases. Certain tables are stored in NMS database  and certain other tables are stored in the configuration database within each network device in the network. Direct binding between tables cannot be maintained since a database may be removed or a record deleted without maintaining referential integrity. To address this issue, group names are used to provide a \u201cdynamic binding\u201d between the User Resource Group table  () in the NMS database and the Managed Resource Group table  () in each configuration database. Since there is no direct binding, if a group name is not found in the Managed Resource Group table, the NMS server simply returns an empty set and no data is lost or other more serious problems caused. If the group name is later added to the Managed Resource Group table, then through dynamic binding, it will be found.","Through a user profile, a user may log-on to the network with a single, secure username and password through any NMS client, access any network device in their user profile and access configured resources corresponding to groups in their user profile. Since the tables including the data necessary for the creation of user profile LMOs are stored in the NMS database, any NMS server capable of connecting to the NMS database\u2014that is, any NMS server in the network\u2014may access the tables and generate a user LMO. As a result, users may log-on with a single, secure username and password through any NMS client that may be connected to an NMS server capable of connecting to the NMS database. Essentially, users may log on through any computer system\/workstation (e.g., , ) on which an NMS client is loaded or remotely through internet web access to an NMS client within the network and gain access to the network devices listed in their user profile. Thus, each user need only remember a single username and password to configure\/manage any of the network devices listed in their user profile or any of the resources included within groups listed in their user profile through any NMS client in the network.","In addition, user profiles provide a level of indirection to better protect the passwords used to access each network device. For example, access to the passwords may be limited to only those users capable of adding network devices to the network, for example, users with the administrator group access level. Other users would not see the passwords since they are automatically added to their user profile LMO, which is not accessible by users. The level of indirection provided by user profiles also allows network device passwords to be easily changed across the entire network. Periodically the passwords for access to the network devices in a network may be changed for security. The network device passwords may be quickly changed in the Administration Managed Device table  (), and due to the use of profiles, each user does not need to be notified of the password changes. The new passwords will be utilized automatically each time users log in. This provides for increased scalability since thousands of users will not need to be notified of the new passwords. Moreover, if a rogue user is identified, they can be quickly prevented from further access to the network through any NMS client by simply changing the user's username and\/or password in the user's profile or by deleting the user's profile. Changing the username and\/or password in the user profile would cause the NMS server to change the data in user table  (), and deleting a user profile would cause the NMS server to remove the corresponding row in the User table. In either case, the user would no longer be able to log in.","User profiles and group names also simplify network management tasks. For example, if an administrator adds a newly configured resource to a group, all users having access to that group will automatically be able to access the newly configured resource. The administrator need not send out a notice or take other steps to update each user.","Group names in a user profile define what the user can view. For instance, one customer may not view the configured resources subscribed for by another customer if their resources are assigned to different groups. Thus, groups allow for a granular way to \u201cslice\u201d up each network device according to its resources.","The user access level in a user profile determines how the NMS server behaves and affects what the user can do. For example, the viewer user access level provides the user with read-only capability and, thus, prevents the NMS server from modifying data in tables. In addition, the user access level may be used to restrict access\u2014even read access\u2014to certain tables or columns in certain tables.","Network Device Power-Up:","Referring again to , on power-up, reset or reboot, the processor on each board (central processor and each line card) downloads and executes boot-strap code (i.e., minimal instances of the kernel software) and power-up diagnostic test code from its local memory subsystem. After passing the power-up tests, processor  on central processor  then downloads kernel software  from persistent storage  into non-persistent memory in memory subsystem . Kernel software  includes operating system (OS), system services (SS) and modular system services (MSS).","In one embodiment, the operating system software and system services software are the OSE operating system and system services from Enea OSE Systems, Inc. in Dallas, Tex. The OSE operating system is a pre-emptive multi-tasking operating system that provides a set of services that together support the development of distributed applications (i.e., dynamic loading). The OSE approach uses a layered architecture that builds a high level set of services around kernel primitives. The operating system, system services, and modular system services provide support for the creation and management of processes; inter-process communication (IPC) through a process-to-process messaging model; standard semaphore creation and manipulation services; the ability to locate and communicate with a process regardless of its location in the system; the ability to determine when another process has terminated; and the ability to locate the provider of a service by name.","These services support the construction of a distributed system wherein applications can be located by name and processes can use a single form of communication regardless of their location. By using these services, distributed applications may be designed to allow services to transparently move from one location to another such as during a fail over.","The OSE operating system and system services provide a single inter-process communications mechanism that allows processes to communicate regardless of their location in the system. OSE IPC differs from the traditional IPC model in that there are no explicit IPC queues to be managed by the application. Instead each process is assigned a unique process identification that all IPC messages use. Because OSE IPC supports inter-board communication the process identification includes a path component. Processes locate each other by performing an OSE Hunt call on the process identification. The Hunt call will return the Process ID of the process that maps to the specified path\/name. Inter-board communication is carried over some number of communication links. Each link interface is assigned to an OSE Link Handler. The path component of a process path\/name is the concatenation of the Link Handler names that one must transverse in order to reach the process.","In addition, the OSE operating system includes memory management that supports a \u201cprotected memory model\u201d. The protected memory model dedicates a memory block (i.e., defined memory space) to each process and erects \u201cwalls\u201d around each memory block to prevent access by processes outside the \u201cwall\u201d. This prevents one process from corrupting the memory space used by another process. For example, a corrupt software memory pointer in a first process may incorrectly point to the memory space of a second processor and cause the first process to corrupt the second processor's memory space. The protected memory model prevents the first process with the corrupted memory pointer from corrupting the memory space or block assigned to the second process. As a result, if a process fails, only the memory block assigned to that process is assumed corrupted while the remaining memory space is considered uncorrupted.","The modular software architecture takes advantage of the isolation provided to each process (e.g., device driver or application) by the protected memory model. Because each process is assigned a unique or separate protected memory block, processes may be started, upgraded or restarted independently of other processes.","Referring to , the main modular system service that controls the operation of computer system  is a System Resiliency Manager (SRM). Also within modular system services is a Master Control Driver (MCD) that learns the physical characteristics of the particular computer system on which it is running, in this instance, computer system . The MCD and the SRM are distributed applications. A master SRM  and a master MCD  are executed by central processor  while slave SRMs -and slave MCDs -are executed on each board (central processor  and each line card -). The SRM and MCD work together and use their assigned view ids and APIs to load the appropriate software drivers on each board and to configure computer system .","Also within the modular system services is a configuration service program  that downloads a configuration database program  and its corresponding DDL file from persistent storage into non-persistent memory  on central processor . In one embodiment, configuration database  is a Polyhedra database from Polyhedra, Inc. in the United Kingdom.","Hardware Inventory and Set-Up:","Master MCD  begins by taking a physical inventory of computer system  (over the IC bus) and assigning a unique physical identification number (PID) to each item. Despite the name, the PID is a logical number unrelated to any physical aspect of the component being numbered. In one embodiment, pull-down\/pull-up resistors on the chassis mid-plane provide the number space of Slot Identifiers. The master MCD may read a register for each slot that allows it to get the bit pattern produced by these resistors. MCD  assigns a unique PID to the chassis, each shelf in the chassis, each slot in each shelf, each line card -inserted in each slot, and each port on each line card. (Other items or components may also be inventoried.)","Typically, the number of line cards and ports on each line card in a computer system is variable but the number of chassis, shelves and slots is fixed. Consequently, a PID could be permanently assigned to the chassis, shelves and slots and stored in a file. To add flexibility, however, MCD  assigns a PID even to the chassis, shelves and slots to allow the modular software architecture to be ported to another computer system with a different physical construction (i.e., multiple chassis and\/or a different number of shelves and slots) without having to change the PID numbering scheme.","Referring to -, for each line card -in computer system , MCD  communicates with a diagnostic program (DP) -being executed by the line card's processor to learn each card's type and version. The diagnostic program reads a line card type and version number out of persistent storage, for example, EPROM -, and passes this information to the MCD. For example, line cards and could be cards that implement Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) protocol over Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) protocol as indicated by a particular card type, e.g., 0XF002, and line card could be a card that implements Internet Protocol (IP) over SONET as indicated by a different card type, e.g., 0XE002. In addition, line card could be a version three ATM over SONET card meaning that it includes four SONET ports -each of which may be connected to an external SONET optical fiber that carries an OC-48 stream, as indicated by a particular port type 00620, while line card may be a version four ATM over SONET card meaning that it includes sixteen SONET ports -each of which carries an OC-3 stream as indicated by a particular port type, e.g., 00820. Other information is also passed to the MCD by the DP, for example, diagnostic test pass\/fail status. With this information, MCD  creates card table (CT)  and port table (PT)  in configuration database . As described below, the configuration database copies all changes to an NMS database. If the MCD cannot communicate with the diagnostic program to learn the card type and version number, then the MCD assumes the slot is empty.","Even after initial power-up, master MCD  will continue to take physical inventories to determine if hardware has been added or removed from computer system . For example, line cards may be added to empty slots or removed from slots. When changes are detected, master MCD  will update CT  and PT  accordingly.","For each line card -, master MCD  searches a physical module description (PMD) file  in memory  for a record that matches the card type and version number retrieved from that line card. The PMD file may include multiple files. The PMD file includes a table that corresponds card type and version number with name of the mission kernel image executable file (MKI.exe) that needs to be loaded on that line card. Once determined, master MCD  passes the name of each MKI executable file to master SRM . Master SRM  requests a bootserver (not shown) to download the MKI executable files -from persistent storage  into memory  (i.e., dynamic loading) and passes each MKI executable file -to a bootloader (not shown) running on each board (central processor and each line card). The bootloaders execute the received MKI executable file.","Once all the line cards are executing the appropriate MKI, slave MCDs -and slave SRMs -on each line card need to download device driver software corresponding to the particular devices on each card. Referring to , slave MCDs -search PMD file  in memory  on central processor  for a match with their line card type and version number. Just as the master MCD  found the name of the MKI executable file for each line card in the PMD file, each slave MCD -reads the PMD file to learn the names of all the device driver executable files associated with each line card type and version. The slave MCDs provide these names to the slave SRMs on their boards. Slave SRMs -then download and execute the device driver executable files (DD.exe) -from memory . As one example, one port device driver -may be started for each port -on line card . The port driver and port are linked together through the assigned port PID number.","In order to understand the significance of the PMD file (i.e., metadata), note that the MCD software does not have knowledge of board types built into it. Instead, the MCD parameterizes its operations on a particular board by looking up the card type and version number in the PMD file and acting accordingly. Consequently, the MCD software does not need to be modified, rebuilt, tested and distributed with new hardware. The changes required in the software system infrastructure to support new hardware are simpler modify logical model  () to include: a new entry in the PMD file (or a new PMD file) and, where necessary, new device drivers and applications. Because the MCD software, which resides in the kernel, will not need to be modified, the new applications and device drivers and the new DDL files (reflecting the new PMD file) for the configuration database and NMS database are downloaded and upgraded (as described below) without re-booting the computer system.","Network Management System (NMS):","Referring to , as described above, a user\/network administrator of computer system  works with network management system (NMS) software  to configure computer system . In the embodiment described below, NMS  runs on a personal computer or workstation  and communicates with central processor  over Ethernet network  (out-of-band). Instead, the NMS may communicate with central processor  over data path  (, in-band). Alternatively (or in addition as a back-up communication port), a user may communicate with computer system  through a console interface\/terminal (, ) connected to a serial line  connecting to the data or control path using a command line interface (CLI) protocol. Instead, NMS  could run directly on computer system  provided computer system  has an input mechanism for the user.","During installation, an NMS database  is established on, for example, work-station  using a DDL executable file corresponding to the NMS database. The DDL file may be downloaded from persistent storage  in computer system  or supplied separately with other NMS programs as part of an NMS installation kit. The NMS database mirrors the configuration database through an active query feature (described below). In one embodiment, the NMS database is an Oracle database from Oracle Corporation in Boston, Mass.","The NMS and central processor  pass control and data over Ethernet  using, for example, the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) protocol. Use of the JDBC protocol allows the NMS to communicate with the configuration database in the same manner that it communicates with its own internal storage mechanisms, including the NMS database. Changes made to the configuration database are passed to the NMS database to ensure that both databases store the same data. This synchronization process is much more efficient, less error-prone and timely than older methods that require the NMS to periodically poll the network device to determine whether configuration changes have been made. In these systems, NMS polling is unnecessary and wasteful if the configuration has not been changed. Additionally, if a configuration change is made through some other means, for example, a command line interface, and not through the NMS, the NMS will not be updated until the next poll, and if the network device crashes prior to the NMS poll, then the configuration change will be lost. In computer system , however, command line interface changes made to configuration database  are passed immediately to the NMS database through the active query feature ensuring that the NMS, through both the configuration database and NMS database, is immediately aware of any configuration changes.","Asynchronously Providing Network Device Management Data:","Typically, work-station  () is coupled to many network computer systems, and NMS  is used to configure and manage each of these systems. In addition to configuring each system, the NMS also interprets management data gathered by each system relevant to each system's network accounting data, statistics, security and fault logging (or some portion thereof) and presents this to the user. In current systems, two distributed carefully synchronized processes are used to move data from a network system\/device to the NMS. The processes are synchronized with each other by having one or both processes maintain the state of the other process. To avoid the problems associated with using two synchronized processes, in the present invention, internal network device management subsystem processes are made asynchronous with external management processes. That is, neither the internal nor external processes maintain each other's state and all processes operate independently of the other processes. This also minimizes or prevents data loss (i.e., lossless system), which is especially important for revenue generating accounting systems.","In addition, instead of having the NMS interpret each network device's management data in the same fashion, flexibility is added by having each system send the NMS (e.g., data collector server , ) class files  including compiled source code indicating how its management data should be interpreted. Thus, the NMS effectively \u201clearns\u201d how to process (and perhaps display) management data from the network device via the class file. Through the reliable File Transfer Protocol (FTP), management subsystem processes  () running on central processor  push data summary files  and binary data files  to the NMS. Each data summary file indicates the name of the class file the NMS should use to interpret a corresponding binary data file. If the computer system has not already done so, it pushes the class file to the NMS. In one embodiment, the management subsystem processes, class files and NMS processes are JAVA programs, and JAVA Reflection is used to dynamically load the data-specific application class file and process the data in the binary data file. As a result, a new class file can be added or updated on a network device without having to reboot or upgrade the network device or the NMS. The computer system simply pushes the new class file to the NMS. In addition, the NMS can use different class files for each network device such that the data gathered on each device can be particularized to each device.","Referring to , in one embodiment, the management subsystem  () is broken into two pieces: a usage data server (UDS) and a file transfer protocol (FTP) client . The UDS is executed on internal processor control card (see also and ) while the FTP client is executed on external processor control card (see also and ). Alternatively, in a network device with one processor control card or a central processor control card, both the UDS and FTP client may be executed on that one card. When each device driver, for example, SONET driver -and ATM driver -(only SONET driver and ATM driver are shown for convenience and it is to be understood that multiple drivers may be present on each card), within network device  is built, it links in a usage data monitoring library (UDML).","When device drivers are first started, upgraded or re-booted, the device driver makes a call into the UDML to notify the UDML as to which statistical data the device driver is able to gather. For example, an ATM device driver may be able to gather virtual circuit (VC) accounting statistics and Virtual ATM (VATM) interface statistics while a SONET device driver may be able to gather SONET statistics. The device driver then makes a call into the UDML to notify the UDML as to each interface (including virtual circuits) for which the device driver will be gathering data and the types of data the device driver will provide for each interface.","The UDML sends a registration packet to the UDS providing one or more string names corresponding to the types of data that the UDML will send to the UDS. For example, for ATM drivers the UDML may register \u201cAcct_PVC\u201d to track permanent virtual circuit statistics, \u201cAcct_SVC\u201d to track soft permanent virtual circuit statistics, \u201cVir_Intf\u201d to track quality of service (QoS) statistics corresponding to virtual interfaces, and \u201cBw_Util\u201d to track bandwidth utilization. As another example, for SONET drivers the UDML may register \u201cSection\u201d to track section statistics, \u201cLine\u201d to track line statistics and \u201cPath\u201d to track path statistics. The UDML need only register each string name with the UDS once, for example, for the first interface registered, and not for each interface since the UDML will package up the data from multiple interfaces corresponding to the same string name before sending the data with the appropriate string name to the UDS.","The UDML includes a polling timer to cause each driver to periodically poll its hardware for \u201ccurrent\u201d statistical\/accounting data samples . The current data samples are typically gathered on a frequent interval of, for example, 15 minutes, as specified by the polling timer. The UDML also causes each driver to put the binary data in a particular format, time stamp the data and store the current data sample locally. When a current data sample for each interface managed by the device driver and corresponding to a particular string name is stored locally, the UDML packages all of the current data samples corresponding to the same string name into one or more packets containing binary data and sends the packets to the UDS with the registered string name.","In addition, the UDML adds each gathered current data sample to a local data summary . The UDML clears the data summary periodically, for example, every twenty-four hours, and then adds newly gathered current data samples to the cleared data summary. Thus, the data summary represents an accumulation of current data samples gathered over the period (e.g., 24 hours).","The UDS maintains a list of UDMLs expected to send current data samples and data summaries corresponding to each string name. For each poll, the UDS combines the data sent from each UDML with the same string name into a common binary data file (e.g., binary data files -) associated with that string name in non-volatile memory, for example, a hard drive  located on internal control processor . When all UDMLs in the list corresponding to a particular string name have reported their current data samples or data summaries, the UDS closes the common data file, thus ending the data collecting period. Preferably, the data is maintained in binary form to keep the data files smaller than translating it into other forms such as ASCII. Smaller binary files require less space to store and less bandwidth to transfer.","If after a predetermined period of time has passed, for example, 5 minutes, one or more of the UDMLs in a list has not sent binary data with the corresponding string name, the UDS closes the common data file, ending the data collecting period. The UDS then sends a notice to the non-responsive UDML(s). The UDS will repeat this sequence a predetermined number of times, for example, three, and if no binary data with the corresponding string name is received, the UDS will delete the UDML(s) from the list and send a trap to the NMS indicating which specific UDML is not responsive. As a result, maintaining the list of UDMLs that will be sending data corresponding to each string name allows the UDS to know when to close each common data file and also allows the UDS to notify the NMS when a UDML becomes non-responsive. This provides for increased availability including fault tolerance\u2014that is, a fault on one card or in one application cannot interrupt the statistics gathering from each of the other cards or other applications on one card\u2014and also including hot swapping where a card and its local UDMLs may no longer be inserted within the network device.","Since a large number of UDMLs may be sending data to the UDS, the potential exists for the data transfer rate to the UDS to be larger than the amount of data that the UDS can process and larger than local buffering can support. Such a situation may result in lost data or worse, for example, a network device crash. A need exists, therefore, to be able to \u201cthrottle\u201d the amount of data being sent from the UDMLs to the UDS depending upon the current backlog of data at the UDS.","In one embodiment, the UDML is allowed to send up to a maximum number of packets to the UDS before the UDML must wait for an acknowledge (ACK) packet from the UDS. For example, the UDML may be allowed to send three packets of data to the UDS and in the third packet the UDML must include an acknowledge request. Alternatively, the UDML may follow the third packet with a separate packet including an acknowledge request. Once the third packet is sent, the UDML must delay sending any additional packets to the UDS until an acknowledge packet is received from the UDS. The UDML may negotiate the maximum number of packets that can be sent in its initial registration with the UDS. Otherwise, a default value may be used.","Many packets may be required to completely transfer a binary current data sample or data summary to the UDS. Once the acknowledge packet is received, the UDML may again send up to the maximum number (e.g., 3) of packets to the UDS again including an acknowledge request in the last packet. Requiring the UDML to wait for an acknowledge packet from the UDS, allows the UDS to throttle back the data received from UDMLs when the UDS has a large backlog of data to process.","A simple mechanism to accomplish this throttling is to have the UDS send an acknowledge packet each time it processes a packet containing an acknowledge request. Since the UDS is processing the packet that is a good indication that it is steadily processing packets. If the number of packets received by the UDS is large, it will take longer to process the packets and, thus, longer to process packets containing acknowledge requests. Thus, the UDMLs must wait longer to send more packets. On the other hand, if the number of packets is small, the UDS will quickly process each packet received and more quickly send back the acknowledge request and the UDMLs will not have to wait as long to send more packets.","Instead of immediately returning an acknowledge packet when the UDS processes a packet containing an acknowledge request, the UDS may first compare the number of packets waiting to be processed against a predetermined threshold. If the number of packets waiting to be processed is less than the predetermined threshold, then the UDS immediately sends the acknowledge packet to the UDML. If the number of packets waiting to be processed is more than the predetermined threshold, then the UDS may delay sending the acknowledge packet until enough packets have been processed that the number of packets waiting to be processed is reduced to less than the predetermined threshold. Instead, the UDS may estimate the amount of time that it will need to process enough packets to reduce the number of packets waiting to be processed to less than the threshold and send an acknowledge packet to the UDML including a future time at which the UDML may again send packets. In other words, the UDS does not wait until the backlog is diminished to notify the UDMLs but instead notifies the UDMLs prior to reducing the backlog and based on an estimate of when the backlog will be diminished.","Another embodiment for a throttling mechanism requires polls for different statistical data to be scheduled at different times to load balance the amount of statistical traffic across the control plane. For example, the UDML for each ATM driver polls and sends data to the UDS corresponding to PVC accounting statistics (i.e., Acct_PVC) at a first time, the UDML for each ATM driver polls and sends data to the UDS corresponding to SPVC accounting statistics (i.e., Acct_SPVC) at a second time, and the UDML for each ATM driver and each SONET driver polls and sends data to the UDS corresponding to other statistics at other times. This may be accomplished by having multiple polling timers within the UDML corresponding to the type of data being gathered. Load balancing and staggered reporting provides distributed data throttling which may smooth out control plane bandwidth utilization (i.e., prevent large data bursts) and reduce data buffering and data loss.","Referring to , instead of having each device driver on a card package the binary data and send it to the UDS, a separate, low priority packaging program (PP) -may be resident on each card and responsible for packaging the binary statistical management data from each device driver and sending it to the UDS. Running the PP as a lower priority program ensures that processor cycles are not taken away from time-critical processes. Load balancing and staggered reporting may still be accomplished by having each PP send acknowledge requests in the last of a predetermined number of packets and wait for the UDS to send an acknowledge packet as described above.","As mentioned, the UDML causes the device driver to periodically gather the current statistical management data samples for each interface and corresponding to each string name. The period may be relatively frequent, for example, every 15 minutes. In addition, the UDML causes the device driver or separate packaging program to add the current data sample to a data summary corresponding to the same string name each time a current data sample is gathered. The UDML clears the data summary periodically, for example, every twenty-four hours. To reduce bandwidth utilization, the data summary and corresponding string name is sent to the UDS periodically but with an infrequent time period of, for example, every 6 to 12 hours. The data summary provides resiliency such that if any of the current data samples are lost in any of the various transfers, the data summary is still available. Local resiliency may be provided by storing a backlog of both current data sample files and summary data files in hard drive . For example, the four most recent current data sample files and the two most recent summary data files corresponding to each string name may be stored.","If FTP client cannot send data from hard drive  to file system  for a predetermined period of time, for example, 15 minutes, the FTP client may notify the UDS and the UDS may notify each UDML. Each UDML then continues to cause the device driver to gather current statistical management data samples and add them to the data summaries at the same periodic interval (i.e., current data interval, e.g., 15 minutes), however, the UDML stops sending the current data samples to the UDS. Instead, the UDML sends only the data summaries to the UDS but at the more frequent current data interval (e.g., 15 minutes) instead of the longer time period (e.g., 6 to 12 hours). The UDS may then update the data summaries stored in hard drive  and cease collecting and storing current data samples. This will save space in the hard drive and minimize any data loss.","To reduce the amount of statistical management data being transferred to the UDS, a network manager may selectively configure only certain of the applications (e.g., device drivers) and certain of the interfaces to provide this data. As each UDML registers with the UDS, the UDS may then inform each UDML with respect to each interface as to whether or not statistical management data should be gathered and sent to the UDS. There may be many circumstances in which gathering this data is unnecessary. For example, each ATM device driver may manage multiple virtual interfaces (VATMs) and within each VATM there may be several virtual circuits. A network manager may choose not to receive statistics for virtual circuits on which a customer has ordered only Variable Bit Rate (VBR) real time (VBR-rt) and VBR non-real time (VBR-nrt) service. For VBR-rt and VBR-nrt, the network service provider may provide the customer only with available\/extra bandwidth and charge a simple flat fee per month. However, a network manager may need to receive statistics for virtual circuits on which a customer has ordered a high quality of service such as Constant Bit Rate (CBR) to ensure that the customer is getting the appropriate level of service and to appropriately charge the customer. In addition, a network manager may want to receive statistics for virtual circuits on which a customer has ordered Unspecified Bit Rate (UBR) service to police the customer's usage and ensure they are not receiving more network bandwidth than what they are paying for. Allowing a network manager to indicate that certain applications or certain interfaces managed by an application (e.g., a VATM) need not provide statistical management data or some portion of that data to the UDS reduces the amount of data transferred to the UDS\u2014that is, reduces internal bandwidth utilization\u2014, reduces the amount of storage space required in the hard drive, and reduces the processing power required to transfer the statistical management data from remote cards to external file system .","For each binary data file, the UDS creates a data summary file (e.g., data summary files -) and stores it in, for example, hard drive . The data summary file defines the binary file format, including the type based on the string name, the length, the number of records and the version number. The UDS does not need to understand the binary data sent to it by each of the device drivers. The UDS need only combine data corresponding to similar string names into the same file and create a summary file based on the string name and the amount of data in the binary data file. The version number is passed to the UDS by the device driver, and the UDS includes the version number in the data summary file.","Periodically, FTP client asynchronously reads each binary data file and corresponding data summary file from hard drive . Preferably, the FTP client reads these files from the hard drive through an out-of-band Ethernet connection, for example, Ethernet  (). Alternatively, the FTP client may read these files through an in-band data path  (). The FTP client then uses an FTP push to send the binary data file to a file system  accessible by the data collector server and, preferably local to the data collector server. The FTP client then uses another FTP push to send the data summary file to the local file system. Since binary data files may be very long and an FTP push of a binary data file may take some time, the data collector server may periodically search the local file system for data summary files. The data collector server may then attempt to open a discovered data summary file. If the data collector server is able to open the file, then that indicates that the FTP push of the data summary file is complete, and since the data summary file is pushed after the binary data file, the data collector server's ability to open the data summary file may be used as an indication that a new binary data file has been completely received. Since data summary files are much smaller than binary data files, having the data collector server look for and attempt to open data summary files instead of binary data files minimizes the thread wait within the data collector server.","In one embodiment, the data collector server is a JAVA program, and each different type of binary data file has a corresponding JAVA class file (e.g., class file ) that defines how the data collector server should process the binary data file. When a device driver is loaded into the network device, a corresponding JAVA class file is also loaded and stored in hard drive . The FTP client periodically polls the hard drive for new JAVA class files and uses an FTP push to send them to file system . The data collector server uses the binary file type in the data summary file to determine which JAVA class file it should use to interpret the binary data file. The data collector server then converts the binary data into ASCII or AMA\/BAF format and stores the ASCII or AMA\/BAF files in the file system. The data collector server may use a set of worker threads for concurrency.","As described, the data collector server is completely independent of and asynchronous with the FTP client, which is also independent and asynchronous of the UDS. The separation of the data collector server and FTP client avoids data loss due to process synchronization problems, since there is no synchronization, and reduces the burden on the network device by not requiring the network device to maintain synchronization between the processes. In addition, if the data collector server goes down or is busy for some time, the FTP client and UDS continue working and continue sending binary data files and data summary files to the file system. When the data collector server is again available, it simply accesses the data summary files and processes the binary files as described above. Thus, there is no data loss and the limited storage capacity within the network device is not strained by storing data until the data collector server is available. In addition, if the FTP client or UDS goes down, the data collector server may continue working.","An NMS server (e.g., NMS server ), which may or may not be executing on the same computer system  as the data collector server, may periodically retrieve the ASCII or AMA\/BAF files from the file system. The files may represent accounting, statistics, security, logging and\/or other types of data gathered from hardware within the network device. The NMS server may also access the corresponding class files from the file system to learn how the data should be presented to a user, for example, how a graphical user interface (GUI) should be displayed, what data and format to display, or perhaps which one of many GUIs should be used. The NMS server may use the data to, for example, monitor network device performance, including quality of service guarantees and service level agreements, as well as bill customers for network usage. Alternatively, a separate billing server or statistics server , which may or may not be executing on the same computer system  as the data collector server and\/or the NMS server, may periodically retrieve the ASCII or AMA\/BAF files from the file system in order to monitor network device performance, including quality of service guarantees and service level agreements, and\/or bill customers for network usage. One or more of the data collector server, the NMS server, the billing server and the statistics server may be combined into one server.","Moreover, management files created by the data collector server may be combined with data from the configuration or NMS databases to generate billing records for each of the network provider's customers.","The data collector server may convert the ASCII or AMA\/BAF files into other data formats, for example, Excel spread sheets, for use by the NMS server, billing server and\/or statistics server. In addition, the application class file for each data type may be modified to go beyond conversion, including direct integration into a database or an OSS system. For example, many OSS systems use a Portal billing system available from Portal Software, Inc. in Cupertino, Calif. The JAVA class file associated with a particular binary data file and data summary file may cause the data collector server to convert the binary data file into ASCII data and then issue a Portal API call to give the ASCII data directly to the Portal billing system. As a result, accounting, statistics, logging and\/or security data may be directly integrated into any other process, including third party processes, through JAVA class files.","Through JAVA class files, new device drivers may be added to a network device without having to change UDS or FTP client and without having to re-boot the network device and without having to upgrade\/modify external processes. For example, a new forwarding card (e.g., forwarding card ) may be added to an operating network device and this new forwarding card may support MPLS. An MPLS device driver , linked within the UDML, is downloaded to the network device as well as a corresponding class file (e.g., class file ). When the FTP client discovers the new class file in hard drive , it uses an FTP push to send it to file system . The FTP client does not need to understand the data within the class file it simply needs to push it to the file system. Just as with other device drivers, the UDML causes the MPLS driver to register appropriate string names with the UDS and poll and send data to the UDS with a registered string name. The UDS stores binary data files (e.g., binary data file ) and corresponding data summary files (e.g., data summary file ) in the hard drive without having to understand the data within the binary data file. The FTP client then pushes these files to the file system again without having to understand the data. When the data summary file is discovered by the data collector server, the data collector server uses the binary file type in the data summary file to locate the new MPLS class file in the file system and then uses the class file to convert the binary data in the corresponding binary data file into ASCII format and perhaps other data formats. Thus, a new device driver is added and statistical information may be gathered without having to change any of the other software and without having to re-boot the network device.","As described, having the data collector server be completely independent of and asynchronous with the FTP client avoids the typical problems encountered when internal and external management programs are synchronized. Moreover, modularity of device drivers and internal management programs is maintained by providing metadata through class files that instruct the external management programs as to how the management data should be processed. Consequently, device drivers may be modified, upgraded and added to an operating network device without disrupting the operation of any of the other device drivers or the management programs.","Configuration:","As described above, unlike a monolithic software architecture which is directly linked to the hardware of the computer system on which it runs, a modular software architecture includes independent applications that are significantly decoupled from the hardware through the use of a logical model of the computer system. Using the logical model and a code generation system, a view id and API are generated for each application to define each application's access to particular data in a configuration database and programming interfaces between the different applications. The configuration database is established using a data definition language (DDL) file also generated by the code generation system from the logical model. As a result, there is only a limited connection between the computer system's software and hardware, which allows for multiple versions of the same application to run on the computer system simultaneously and different types of applications to run simultaneously on the computer system. In addition, while the computer system is running, application upgrades and downgrades may be executed without affecting other applications and new hardware and software may be added to the system also without affecting other applications.","Referring again to , initially, NMS  reads card table  and port table  to determine what hardware is available in computer system . The NMS assigns a logical identification number (LID)  (and ) to each card and port and inserts these numbers in an LID to PID Card table (LPCT)  and an LID to PID Port table (LPPT)  in configuration database . Alternatively, the NMS could use the PID previously assigned to each board by the MCD. However, to allow for hardware redundancy, the NMS assigns an LID and may associate the LID with at least two PIDs, a primary PID  and a backup PID . (LPCT  may include multiple backup PID fields to allow more than one backup PID to be assigned to each primary PID.)","The user chooses the desired redundancy structure and instructs the NMS as to which boards are primary boards and which boards are backup boards. For example, the NMS may assign LID  to line card \u2014previously assigned PID  by the MCD\u2014as a user defined primary card, and the NMS may assign LID  to line card \u2014previously assigned PID  by the MCD\u2014as a user defined back-up card (see row , ). The NMS may also assign LID  to port \u2014previously assigned PID  by the MCD\u2014as a primary port, and the NMS may assign LID  to port \u2014previously assigned PID  by the MCD\u2014as a back-up port (see row , ).","In a 1:1 redundant system, each backup line card backs-up only one other line card and the NMS assigns a unique primary PID and a unique backup PID to each LID (no LIDs share the same PIDs). In a 1:N redundant system, each backup line card backs-up at least two other line cards and the NMS assigns a different primary PID to each LID and the same backup PID to at least two LIDs. For example, if computer system  is a 1:N redundant system, then one line card, for example, line card , serves as the hardware backup card for at least two other line cards, for example, line cards and . If the NMS assigns an LID of  to line card , then in logical to physical card table  (see row , ), the NMS associates LID  with primary PID  (line card ) and backup PID  (line card ). As a result, backup PID  (line card ) is associated with both LID  and .","The logical to physical card table provides the user with maximum flexibility in choosing a redundancy structure. In the same computer system, the user may provide full redundancy (1:1), partial redundancy (1:N), no redundancy or a combination of these redundancy structures. For example, a network manager (user) may have certain customers that are willing to pay more to ensure their network availability, and the user may provide a backup line card for each of that customer's primary line cards (1:1). Other customers may be willing to pay for some redundancy but not full redundancy, and the user may provide one backup line card for all of that customer's primary line cards (1:N). Still other customers may not need any redundancy, and the user will not provide any backup line cards for that customer's primary line cards. For no redundancy, the NMS would leave the backup PID field in the logical to physical table blank. Each of these customers may be serviced by separate computer systems or the same computer system. Redundancy is discussed in more detail below.","The NMS and MCD use the same numbering space for LIDs, PIDs and other assigned numbers to ensure that the numbers are different (no collisions).","The configuration database, for example, a Polyhedra relational database, supports an \u201cactive query\u201d feature. Through the active query feature, other software applications can be notified of changes to configuration database records in which they are interested. The NMS database establishes an active query for all configuration database records to insure it is updated with all changes. The master SRM establishes an active query with configuration database  for LPCT  and LPPT . Consequently, when the NMS adds to or changes these tables, configuration database  sends a notification to the master SRM and includes the change. In this example, configuration database  notifies master SRM  that LID  has been assigned to PID  and  and LID  has been assigned to PID  and . The master SRM then uses card table  to determine the physical location of boards associated with new or changed LIDs and then tells the corresponding slave SRM of its assigned LID(s). In the continuing example, master SRM reads CT  to learn that PID  is line card , PID  is line card and PID  is line card . The master SRM then notifies slave SRM on line card that it has been assigned LID  and is a primary line card, SRM on line card that it has been assigned LID  and is a primary line card and SRM on line card that it has been assigned LIDs  and  and is a backup line card. All three slave SRMs , and then set up active queries with configuration database  to insure that they are notified of any software load records (SLRs) created for their LIDs. A similar process is followed for the LIDs assigned to each port.","The NMS informs the user of the hardware available in computer system . This information may be provided as a text list, as a logical picture in a graphical user interface (GUI), or in a variety of other formats. The user then uses the GUI to tell the NMS (e.g., NMS client , ) how they want the system configured.","The user will select which ports (e.g., -, -, -) the NMS should enable. There may be instances where some ports are not currently needed and, therefore, not enabled. The user also needs to provide the NMS with information about the type of network connection (e.g., connection -, -, -). For example, the user may want all ports -on line card enabled to run ATM over SONET. The NMS may start one ATM application to control all four ports, or, for resiliency, the NMS may start one ATM application for each port. Alternatively, each port may be enabled to run a different protocol (e.g., MPLS, IP, Frame Relay).","In the example given above, the user must also indicate the type of SONET fiber they have connected to each port and what paths to expect. For example, the user may indicate that each port -is connected to a SONET optical fiber carrying an OC-48 stream. A channelized OC-48 stream is capable of carrying forty-eight STS-1 paths, sixteen STS-3c paths, four STS-12c paths or a combination of STS-1, STS-3c and STS-12c paths. A clear channel OC-48c stream carries one concatenated STS-48 path. In the example, the user may indicate that the network connection to port isath manager  a clear channel OC-48 SONET stream having one STS-48 path, the network connection to port is a channelized OC-48 SONET stream having three STS-12c paths (i.e., the SONET fiber is not at full capacity\u2014more paths may be added later), the network connection to port is a channelized OC-48 SONET stream having two STS-3c paths (not at full capacity) and the network connection to port is a channelized OC-48 SONET stream having three STS-12c paths (not at full capacity). In the current example, all paths within each stream carry data transmitted according to the ATM protocol. Alternatively, each path within a stream may carry data transmitted according to a different protocol.","The NMS (e.g., NMS server -) uses the information received from the user (through the GUI\/NMS client) to create records in several tables in the configuration database, which are then copied to the NMS database. These tables are accessed by other applications to configure computer system . One table, the service endpoint table (SET)  (see also ), is created when the NMS assigns a unique service endpoint number (SE) to each path on each enabled port and corresponds each service endpoint number with the physical identification number (PID) previously assigned to each port by the MCD. Through the use of the logical to physical port table (LPPT), the service endpoint number also corresponds to the logical identification number (LID) of the port. For example, since the user indicated that port (PID ) has a single STS48 path, the NMS assigns one service endpoint number (e.g. SE , see row , ). Similarly, the NMS assigns three service endpoint numbers (e.g., SE , , , see rows -) to port (PID ), two service endpoint numbers (e.g., SE , , see rows , ) to port (PID ) and three service endpoint numbers (e.g., SE , , , see rows , , ) to port ","Service endpoint managers (SEMs) within the modular system services of the kernel software running on each line card use the service endpoint numbers assigned by the NMS to enable ports and to link instances of applications, for example, ATM, running on the line cards with the correct port. The kernel may start one SEM to handle all ports on one line card, or, for resiliency, the kernel may start one SEM for each particular port. For example, SEMs -are spawned to independently control ports -","The service endpoint managers (SEMs) running on each board establish active queries with the configuration database for SET . Thus, when the NMS changes or adds to the service endpoint table (SET), the configuration database sends the service endpoint manager associated with the port PID in the SET a change notification including information on the change that was made. In the continuing example, configuration database  notifies SEM that SET  has been changed and that SE  was assigned to port (PID ). Configuration database  notifies SEM that SE , , and  were assigned to port (PID ), SEM that SE  and  were assigned to port (PID ) and SEM that SE , , and  were assigned to port (PID ). When a service endpoint is assigned to a port, the SEM associated with that port passes the assigned SE number to the port driver for that port using the port PID number associated with the SE number.","To load instances of software applications on the correct boards, the NMS creates software load records (SLR) -in configuration database . The SLR includes the name  () of a control shim executable file and an LID  for cards on which the application must be spawned. In the continuing example, NMS  creates SLR including the executable name atm_cntrl.exe and card LID  (row ). The configuration database detects LID  in SLR and sends slave SRMs (line card ) and (line card ) a change notification including the name of the executable file (e.g., atm_cntrl.exe) to be loaded. The primary slave SRMs then download and execute a copy of atm_cntrl.exe  from memory  to spawn the ATM controllers (e.g., ATM controller  on line card ). Since slave SRM is on backup line card , it may or may not spawn an ATM controller in backup mode. Software backup is described in more detail below. Instead of downloading a copy of atm_cntrl.exe  from memory , a slave SRM may download it from another line card that already downloaded a copy from memory . There may be instances when downloading from a line card is quicker than downloading from central processor . Through software load records and the tables in configuration database , applications are downloaded and executed without the need for the system services, including the SRM, or any other software in the kernel to have information as to how the applications should be configured. The control shims (e.g., atm_cntrl.exe ) interpret the next layer of the application (e.g., ATM) configuration.","For each application that needs to be spawned, for example, an ATM application and a SONET application, the NMS creates an application group table. Referring to , ATM group table  indicates that four instances of ATM (i.e., group number , , , )\u2014corresponding to four enabled ports -\u2014are to be started on line card (LID ). If other instances of ATM are started on other line cards, they would also be listed in ATM group table  but associated with the appropriate line card LID. ATM group table  may also include additional information needed to execute ATM applications on each particular line card. (See description of software backup below.)","In the above example, one instance of ATM was started for each port on the line card. This provides resiliency and fault isolation should one instance of ATM fail or should one port suffer a failure. An even more resilient scheme would include multiple instances of ATM for each port. For example, one instance of ATM may be started for each path received by a port.","The application controllers on each board now need to know how many instances of the corresponding application they need to spawn. This information is in the application group table in the configuration database. Through the active query feature, the configuration database notifies the application controller of records associated with the board's LID from corresponding application group tables. In the continuing example, configuration database  sends ATM controller  records from ATM group table  that correspond to LID  (line card ). With these records, ATM controller  learns that there are four ATM groups associated with LID  meaning ATM must be instantiated four times on line card . ATM controller  asks slave SRM to download and execute four instances (ATM -, ) of atm.exe .","Once spawned, each instantiation of ATM - sends an active database query to search ATM interface table  for its corresponding group number and to retrieve associated records. The data in the records indicates how many ATM interfaces each instantiation of ATM needs to spawn. Alternatively, a master ATM application (not shown) running on central processor  may perform active queries of the configuration database and pass information to each slave ATM application running on the various line cards regarding the number of ATM interfaces each slave ATM application needs to spawn.","Referring to and , for each instance of ATM - there may be one or more ATM interfaces. To configure these ATM interfaces, the NMS creates an ATM interface table . There may be one ATM interface - per path\/service endpoint or multiple virtual ATM interfaces - per path. This flexibility is left up to the user and NMS, and the ATM interface table allows the NMS to communicate this configuration information to each instance of each application running on the different line cards. For example, ATM interface table  indicates that for ATM group , service endpoint , there are three virtual ATM interfaces (ATM-IF -) and for ATM group , there is one ATM interface for each service endpoint: ATM-IF  and SE ; ATM-IF  and SE ; and ATM-IF  and SE .","Computer system  is now ready to operate as a network switch using line card and ports -. The user will likely provide the NMS with further instructions to configure more of computer system . For example, instances of other software applications, such as an IP application, and additional instances of ATM may be spawned (as described above) on line cards or other boards in computer system .","As shown above, all application dependent data resides in memory  and not in kernel software. Consequently, changes may be made to applications and configuration data in memory  to allow hot (while computer system  is running) upgrades of software and hardware and configuration changes. Although the above described power-up and configuration of computer system  is complex, it provides massive flexibility as described in more detail below.","Template Driven Service Provisioning:","Instead of using the GUI to interactively provision services on one network device in real time, a user may provision services on one or more network devices in one or more networks controlled by one or more network management systems (NMSs) interactively and non-interactively using an Operations Support Services (OSS) client and templates. At the heart of any carrier's network is the OSS, which provides the overall network management infrastructure and the main user interface for network managers\/administrators. The OSS is responsible for consolidating a diverse set of element\/network management systems and third-party applications into a single system that is used, for example, to detect and resolve network faults (Fault Management), configure and upgrade the network (Configuration Management), account and bill for network usage (Accounting Management), oversee and tune network performance (Performance Management), and ensure ironclad network security (Security Management). FCAPS are the five functional areas of network management as defined by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Through templates one or more NMSs may be integrated with a telecommunication network carrier's OSS.","Templates are metadata and include scripts of instructions and parameters. In one embodiment, instructions within templates are written in ASCII text to be human readable. There are three general categories of templates, provisioning templates, control templates and batch templates. A user may interactively connect the OSS client with a particular NMS server and then cause the NMS server to connect to a particular device. Instead, the user may create a control template that non-interactively establishes these connections. Once the connections are established, whether interactively or non-interactively, provisioning templates may be used to complete particular provisioning tasks. The instructions within a provisioning template cause the OSS client to issue appropriate calls to the NMS server which cause the NMS server to complete the provisioning task, for example, by writing\/modifying data within the network device's configuration database. Batch templates may be used to concatenate a series of templates and template modifications (i.e., one or more control and provisioning templates) to provision one or more network devices. Through the client\/server based architecture, multiple OSS clients may work with one or more NMS servers. Database view ids and APIs for the OSS client may be generated using the logical model and code generation system () to synchronize the integration interfaces between the OSS clients and the NMS servers.","Interactively, a network manager may have an OSS client execute many provisioning templates to complete many provisioning tasks. Instead, the network manager may order and sequence the execution of many provisioning templates within a batch template to non-interactively complete the many provisioning tasks and build custom services. In addition, execution commands followed by control template names may be included within batch templates to non-interactively cause an OSS client to establish connections with particular NMS servers and network devices. For example, a first control template may designate a network device to which the current OSS client and NMS server are not connected. Including an execution command followed by the first control template name in a batch template will cause the OSS client to issue calls to the NMS server to cause the NMS server to access the different network device. As another example, a second control template may designate an NMS server and a network device to which the OSS client is not currently connected. Including an execution command followed by the second control template name will cause the OSS client to set up connections to both the different NMS server and the different network device. Moreover, batch templates may include execution commands followed by provisioning template names after each execution command and control template to provision services within the network devices designated by the control templates. Through batch templates, therefore, multiple control templates and provisioning templates may be ordered and sequenced to provision services within multiple network devices in multiple networks controlled by multiple NMSs.","Calls issued by the OSS client to the NMS server may cause the NMS server to immediately provision services or delay provisioning services until a predetermined time, for example, a time when the network device is less likely to be busy. Templates may be written to apply to different types of network devices.","A \u201ccommand line\u201d interactive interpreter within the OSS client may be used by a network manager to select and modify existing templates or to create new templates. Templates may be generated for many various provisioning tasks, for example, setting up a permanent virtual circuit (PVC), a switched virtual circuit (SVC), a SONET path (SPATH), a traffic descriptor (TD) or a virtual ATM interface (VAIF). Once a template is created, a network manager change default parameters within the template to complete particular provisioning tasks. A network manager may also copy a template and modify it to create a new template.","Referring to , using the interactive interpreter, a network administrator may provision services by selecting (step ) a template and using the default parameters within that template or copying and renaming (step ) a particular provisioning template corresponding to a particular provisioning task and either accepting default parameter values provided by the template or changing (step ) those default values to meet the administrator's needs. The network administrator may also change parameters and instructions within a copy of a template to create a new template. The modified provisioning templates are sent to or loaded into (step ) the OSS client, which executes the instructions within the template and issues the appropriate calls (step ) to the NMS server to satisfy the provisioning need. The OSS client may be written in JAVA and employ script technology. In response to calls received from the OSS client, the NMS server may execute (step ) the provisioning requests defined by a template immediately or in a \u201cbatch-mode\u201d (step ), perhaps with other calls received from the OSS client or other clients, at a time when network transactions are typically low (e.g., late at night).","Referring to , at the interactive interpreter prompt  (e.g., Enetcli>) a network manager may type in \u201chelp\u201d and be provided with a list (e.g., list ) of commands that are available. In one embodiment, available commands may include bye, close, execute, help, load, manage, open, quit, showCurrent, showTemplate, set, status, writeCurrent, and writeTemplate. Many different commands are possible. The bye command allows the network manager to exit the interactive interpreter, the close command allows the network manager to close a connection between the OSS client and that NMS server, and the execute command followed by a template type causes the OSS client to execute the instructions within the loaded template corresponding to that template type.","As shown, the help command alone causes the interactive interpreter to display the list of commands. The help command followed by another command provides help information about that command. The load command followed by a template type and a named template loads the named template into the OSS client such that any commands followed by the template type will use the named\/loaded template. The manage command followed by an IP address of a network device causes the OSS client to issue a call to an NMS server to establish a connection between the NMS server and that network device. Alternatively, a username and password may also need to be supplied. The open command followed by an NMS server IP address causes the OSS client to open a connection with that NMS server, and again, the network manager may also need to supply a username and password. Instead of an IP address, a domain name server (DNS) name may be provided and a host look up may be used to determine the IP address and access the corresponding device.","The showCurrent command followed by a template type will cause the interactive interpreter to display current parameter values for the loaded template corresponding to that template type. For example, showCurrent SPATH  displays a list  of parameters and current parameter values for the loaded template corresponding to the SPATH template type. The showTemplate command followed by a template type will cause the OSS client to display available parameters and acceptable parameter values for each parameter within the loaded template. For example, showTemplate SPATH  causes the interactive interpreter to display the available parameters  within the loaded template corresponding to the SPATH template type. The set command followed by a template type, a parameter name and a value will change the named parameter to the designated value within the loaded template, and a subsequent showCurrent command followed by that template type will show the new parameter value within the loaded.","The status command  will cause the interactive interpreter to display a status of the current interactive interpreter session. For example, the interactive interpreter may display the name  of an NMS server to which the OSS client is currently connected (as shown in , the OSS client is currently not connected to an NMS server) and the interactive interpreter may display the names  of available template types. The writeCurrent command followed by a template type and a new template name will cause the interactive interpreter to make a copy of the loaded template, including current parameter values, with the new template name. The writeTemplate command followed by a template type and a new template name, will cause the interactive interpreter to make a copy of the template with the new template name with placeholders values (i.e., <String>) that indicate the network manager needs to fill in the template with the required datatypes as parameter values. The network manager may then use the load command followed by the new template name to load the new template into the OSS client.","Referring to , from the interactive interpreter prompt (e.g., Enetcli>), a network manager may interactively provision services on a network device. The network manager begins by typing an open command followed by the IP address of an NMS server to cause the OSS client to open a connection with that NMS server. The network manager may then issue a manage command followed by the IP address of a particular network device to cause the OSS client to issue a call to the NMS server to cause the NMS server to open a connection with that network device.","The network manager may now provision services within that network device by typing in an execute command followed by a template type. For example, the network manager may type \u201cexecute SPATH\u201d at the Enetcli>prompt to cause the OSS client to execute the instructions within the loaded SPATH template using the parameter values within the loaded SPATH template. Executing the instructions causes the OSS client to issue calls to the NMS server, and these calls cause the NMS server to complete the provisioning task . For example, following an execute SPATH command, the NMS server will set up a SONET path in the network device using the parameter values passed to the NMS server by the OSS client from the template.","At any time from the Enetcli>prompt, a network manager may change the parameter values within a template. Again, the network manager may use showCurrent followed by a template type to see the current parameter values within the loaded template or showTemplate to see the available parameters within the loaded template. The network manager may then use the set command followed by the template type, parameter name and new parameter value to change a parameter value within the loaded template. For example, after the network manager sets up a SONET path within the network device, the network manager may change one or more parameter values within the loaded SPATH template and re-execute the SPATH template to set up a different SONET path within the same network device.","Once a connection to a network device is open, the network manager may interactively execute any template any number of times to provision services within that network device. The network manager may also create new templates and execute those. The network manager may simply write a new template or use the writeCurrent or writeTemplate commands to copy an existing template into a new template name and then edit the instructions within the new template.","After provisioning services within a first network device, the network manager may open a connection with a second network device to provision services within that second network device. If the NMS server currently connected to the OSS client is capable of establishing a connection with the second network device, then the network manager may simply open a connection to the second network device. If the NMS server currently connected to the OSS client is not capable of establishing a connection with the second network device, then the network manager closes the connections with the NMS server and then opens connections with a second NMS server and the second network device. Thus, a network manager may easily manage\/provision services within multiple network devices within multiple networks even if they are managed by different NMS servers. In addition, other network managers may provision services on the same network devices through the same NMS servers using other OSS clients that are perhaps running on other computer systems. That is, multiple OSS clients may be connected to multiple NMS servers.","Instead of interactively establishing connections with NMS servers and network devices, control templates may be used to non-interactively establish these connections. Referring to , using a showCurrent command  followed by CONTROL causes the interactive interpreter to display parameters available in the loaded CONTROL template. In one embodiment, an execute control command will automatically cause the OSS client to execute instructions within the loaded CONTROL template and open a connection to an NMS server designated within the CONTROL template. Since the OSS client automatically opens a connection with the designated NMS server, the open command may but need not be included within the CONTROL template. In this example, the CONTROL template includes \u201clocalhost\u201d as the DNS name of the NMS server with which the OSS client should open a connection. In one embodiment, \u201clocalhost\u201d refers to the same system as the OSS client. A username and password may also need to be used to open the connection with the localhost NMS server. The CONTROL template also includes the manage command and a network device IP address of 192.168.9.202. With this information (and perhaps the username and password or another username and password), the OSS client issues calls to the localhost NMS server to cause the server to set up a connection with that network device.","The template may also include an output file name where any output\/status information generated in response to the execution of the CONTROL template will be sent. The template may also include a version number . Version numbers allow a new template to be created with the same name as an old template but with a new version number, and the new template may include additional\/different parameters and\/or instructions. Using version numbers, both old (e.g., not upgraded) and new OSS clients may use the templates but only access those templates having particular version numbers that correspond to the functionality of each OSS client.","Once connections with an NMS server and network device are established (either interactively or non-interactively through a control template), services within the network device may be provisioned. As described above, a network manager may interactively provision services by issuing execute commands followed by provisioning template types. Alternatively, a network manager may provision services non-interactively through batch templates, which include an ordered list of tasks, including execute commands followed by provisioning template types.","Referring to , a batch template type named BATCH  includes an ordered list of tasks, including execute commands followed by provisioning template types. When a network manager issues an execute command followed by the BATCH template type at the Enetcli>prompt, the OSS client will carry out each of the tasks within the loaded BATCH template. In this example, task includes \u201cexecute SPATH\u201d which causes the OSS client to establish a SONET path within the network device to which a connection is open, task includes \u201cexecute PVC\u201d to cause the OSS client to set up a permanent virtual circuit within the network device, and task includes \u201cexecute SPVC\u201d to cause the OSS client to set up a soft permanent virtual circuit within the network device.","If multiple similar provisioning tasks are needed, then the network manager may use writeCurrent or writeTemplate to create multiple similar templates (i.e., same template type with different template names), change or add parameter values within these multiple similar templates using the set command, and sequentially load and execute each of the different named templates. For example, SPVC is the template type and task causes the OSS to execute instructions within the previously loaded named template. Spvc and spvc are two different named templates (or template instantiations) corresponding to the SPVC template type for setting up soft permanent virtual circuits having different parameters from each other and the loaded template to set up different SPVCs. In this example, the BATCH template then includes task including \u201cload SPVC spvc\u201d to load the spvc template and then task \u201cexecute SPVC\u201d to cause the OSS client to execute the loaded spvc template and set up a different SPVC. Similarly, task includes \u201cload SPVC spvc\u201d and task includes \u201cexecute SPVC\u201d to cause the OSS client to execute the loaded spvc template and set up yet another different SPVC.","Alternatively, the batch template may include commands for altering an existing template such that multiple similar templates are not necessary. For example, the loaded BATCH template may include task \u201cset SPATH PortID \u201d to cause the OSS client to change the PortID parameter within the SPATH template to . The BATCH template then includes task \u201cexecute SPATH\u201d to cause the OSS client to execute the SPATH template including the new parameter value which sets up a different SONET path. A BATCH template may include many set commands to change parameter values followed by execute commands to provision multiple similar services within the same network device. For example, the BATCH template may further include task \u201cset SPATH SlotID \u201d followed by task \u201cexecute SPATH\u201d to set up yet another different SONET path. Using this combination of set and execute commands eliminates the need to write, store and keep track of multiple similar templates.","Batch templates may also be used to non-interactively provision services within multiple different network devices by ordering and sequencing tasks including execute commands followed by control template types and then execute commands followed by provisioning template types. Referring to , instead of non-interactively establishing connections with an NMS server and a network device using a control template, a batch template may be used. For example, the first task in a loaded BATCH template  may be task \u201cexecute CONTROL\u201d. This will cause the OSS client to execute the loaded CONTROL template to establish connections with the NMS server and the network device designated within the loaded CONTROL template (e.g., localhost and 192.168.9.202). The BATCH template then includes provisioning tasks, for example, task includes \u201cexecute SPATH\u201d to set up a SONET path, and task includes \u201cset SPATH PortID \u201d and task includes \u201cexecute SPATH\u201d to set up a different SONET path. Many additional provisioning tasks for this network device may be completed in this way.","The BATCH template may then have a task including a set command to modify one or more parameters within a control template to cause the OSS client to set up a connection with a different network device and perhaps a different NMS server. Where the network manager wishes to provision a network device capable of being connected to through the currently connected NMS server, for example, localhost, then the BATCH template need only have task including \u201cset CONTROL System\u201d followed by the IP address of the different network device, for example, 192.168.9.201. The BATCH template then has a task including \u201cexecute CONTROL\u201d, which causes the OSS client to issue calls to the localhost NMS server to establish a connection with the different network device. The BATCH template may then have tasks including execute commands followed by provisioning templates, for example, task including \u201cexecute SPATH\u201d, to provision services within the different network device.","If the network manager wishes to provision a network device coupled with another NMS server, then the BATCH template includes, for example, task including \u201cclose\u201d to drop the connection between the OSS client and localhost NMS server. The BATCH template may then have, for example, task including \u201cset CONTROL Server Server\u201d to change the server parameter within the loaded CONTROL template to Server and task including \u201cset CONTROL System 192.168.8.200\u201d to change the network device parameter within the loaded CONTROL template to the IP address of the new network device. The BATCH template may then have task including \u201cexecute CONTROL\u201d to cause the OSS client to set up connections to the Server NMS server and to network device 192.168.8.200. The BATCH template may then include tasks with execute commands followed by provisioning template types to provision services within the network device, for example, task L includes \u201cexecute SPATH\u201d.","The templates and interactive interpreter\/OSS client may be loaded and executed on a central OSS computer system(s) and used to provision services in one or more network devices in one or more network domains. A network administrator may install an OSS client at various locations and\/or for \u201cmanage anywhere\u201d purposes, web technology may be used to allow a network manager to download an OSS client program from a web accessible server onto a computer at any location. The network manager may then use the OSS client in the same manner as when it is loaded onto a central OSS computer system. Thus, the network manager may provision services from any computer at any location.","Provisioning templates may be written to apply to different types of network devices. The network administrator does not need to know details of the network device being provisioned as the parameters required and available for modification are listed in the various templates. Consequently, the templates allow for multifaceted integration of different network management systems (NMS) into existing OSS infrastructures.","Instead of using template executable files and an OSS client, network managers may prefer to use their standard OSS interface to provision services in various network devices. In one embodiment, therefore, a single OSS client application programming interface (API) and a library of compiled code may be linked directly into the OSS software. The library of compiled code is a subset of the compiled code used to create the OSS client, with built-in templates including provisioning, control, batch and other types of templates. The OSS software then uses the supported templates as documentation of the necessary parameters needed for each provisioning task and presents template streams (null terminated arrays of arguments that serialize the totality of arguments required to construct a supported template) via the single API for potential alteration through the OSS standard interface. Since the network managers are comfortable working with the OSS interface, provisioning services may be made more efficient and simple by directly linking the OSS client API and templates into the OSS software.","Typically, OSS software is written in C or C++ programming language. In one embodiment, the OSS client and templates are written in JAVA, and JAVA Native Interface (JNI) is used by the OSS software to access the JAVA OSS client API and templates.","Inter-Process Communication:","As described above, the operating system assigns a unique process identification number (proc_id) to each spawned process. Each process has a name, and each process knows the names of other processes with which it needs to communicate. The operating system keeps a list of process names and the assigned process identification numbers. Processes send messages to other processes using the assigned process identification numbers without regard to what board is executing each process (i.e., process location). Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) define the format and type of information included in the messages.","The modular software architecture configuration model requires a single software process to support multiple configurable objects. For example, as described above, an ATM application may support configurations requiring multiple ATM interfaces and thousands of permanent virtual connections per ATM interface. The number of processes and configurable objects in a modular software architecture can quickly grow especially in a distributed processing system. If the operating system assigns a new process for each configurable object, the operating system's capabilities may be quickly exceeded.","For example, the operating system may be unable to assign a process for each ATM interface, each service endpoint, each permanent virtual circuit, etc,. In some instances, the process identification numbering scheme itself may not be large enough. Where protected memory is supported, the system may have insufficient memory to assign each process and configurable object a separate memory block. In addition, supporting a large number of independent processes may reduce the operating system's efficiency and slow the operation of the entire computer system.","One alternative is to assign a unique process identification number to only certain high level processes. Referring to , for example, process identification numbers may only be assigned to each ATM process (e.g., ATMs , ) and not to each ATM interface (e.g., ATM IFs -) and process identification numbers may only be assigned to each port device driver (e.g., device drivers , , ) and not to each service endpoint (e.g., SE -). A disadvantage to this approach is that objects within one high level process will likely need to communicate with objects within other high level processes. For example, ATM interface  within ATM  may need to communicate with SE  within device driver . ATM IF  needs to know if SE  is active and perhaps certain other information about SE . Since SE  was not assigned a process identification number, however, neither ATM  nor ATM IF  knows if it exists. Similarly, ATM IF  knows it needs to communicate with SE  but does not know that device driver  controls SE .","One possible solution is to hard code the name of device driver  into ATM . ATM  then knows it must communicate with device driver  to learn about the existence of any service endpoints within device driver  that may be needed by ATM IF ,  or . Unfortunately, this can lead to scalability issues. For instance, each instantiation of ATM (e.g., ATM , ) needs to know the name of all device drivers (e.g., device drivers , , ) and must query each device driver to locate each needed service endpoint. An ATM query to a device driver that does not include a necessary service endpoint is a waste of time and resources. In addition, each high level process must periodically poll other high level processes to determine whether objects within them are still active (i.e., not terminated) and whether new objects have been started. If the object status has not changed between polls, then the poll wasted resources. If the status did change, then communications have been stalled for the length of time between polls. In addition, if a new device driver is added (e.g., device driver ), then ATM  and  cannot communicate with it or any of the service endpoints within it until they have been upgraded to include the new device driver's name.","Preferably, computer system  implements a name server process and a flexible naming procedure. The name server process allows high level processes to register information about the objects within them and to subscribe for information about the objects with which they need to communicate. The flexible naming procedure is used instead of hard coding names in processes. Each process, for example, applications and device drivers, use tables in the configuration database to derive the names of other configurable objects with which they need to communicate. For example, both an ATM application and a device driver process may use an assigned service endpoint number from the service endpoint table (SET) to derive the name of the service endpoint that is registered by the device driver and subscribed for by the ATM application. Since the service endpoint numbers are assigned by the NMS during configuration, stored in SET  and passed to local SEMs, they will not be changed if device drivers or applications are upgraded or restarted.","Referring to , for example, when device drivers ,  and  are started they each register with name server (NS) . Each device driver provides a name, a process identification number and the name of each of its service endpoints. Each device driver also updates the name server as service endpoints are started, terminated or restarted. Similarly, each instantiation of ATM ,  subscribes with name server  and provides its name, process identification number and the name of each of the service endpoints in which it is interested. The name server then notifies ATM  and  as to the process identification of the device driver with which they should communicate to reach a desired service endpoint. The name server updates ATM  and  in accordance with updates from the device drivers. As a result, updates are provided only when necessary (i.e., no wasted resources), and the computer system is highly scalable. For example, if a new device driver  is started, it simply registers with name server , and name server  notifies either ATM  or  if a service endpoint in which they are interested is within the new device driver. The same is true if a new instantiation of ATM\u2014perhaps an upgraded version\u2014is started or if either an ATM application or a device driver fails and is restarted.","Referring to , when the SEM, for example, SEM , notifies a device driver, for example, device driver (DD) , of its assigned SE number, DD  uses the SE number to generate a device driver name. In the continuing example from above, where the ATM over SONET protocol is to be delivered to port and DD , the device driver name may be for example, atm.sel. DD  publishes this name to NS along with the process identification assigned by the operating system and the name of its service endpoints.","Applications, for example, ATM , also use SE numbers to generate the names of device drivers with which they need to communicate and subscribe to NS for those device driver names, for example, atm.sel. If the device driver has published its name and process identification with NS , then NS notifies ATM  of the process identification number associated with atm.sel and the name of its service endpoints. ATM  can then use the process identification to communicate with DD  and, hence, any objects within DD . If device driver  is restarted or upgraded, SEM will again notify DD  that its associated service endpoint is SE  which will cause DD  to generate the same name of atm.sel. DD  will then re-publish with NS and include the newly assigned process identification number. NS will provide the new process identification number to ATM  to allow the processes to continue to communicate. Similarly, if ATM  is restarted or upgraded, it will use the service endpoint numbers from ATM interface table  and, as a result, derive the same name of atm.sel for DD . ATM  will then re-subscribe with NS ","Computer system  includes a distributed name server (NS) application including a name server process -on each board (central processor and line card). Each name server process handles the registration and subscription for the processes on its corresponding board. For distributed applications, after each application (e.g., ATM -) registers with its local name server (e.g., -), the name server registers the application with each of the other name servers. In this way, only distributed applications are registered\/subscribed system wide which avoids wasting system resources by registering local processes system wide.","The operating system, through the use of assigned process identification numbers, allows for inter-process communication (IPC) regardless of the location of the processes within the computer system. The flexible naming process allows applications to use data in the configuration database to determine the names of other applications and configurable objects, thus, alleviating the need for hard coded process names. The name server notifies individual processes of the existence of the processes and objects with which they need to communicate and the process identification numbers needed for that communication. The termination, re-start or upgrade of an object or process is, therefore, transparent to other processes, with the exception of being notified of new process identification numbers. For example, due to a configuration change initiated by the user of the computer system, service endpoint  (), may be terminated within device driver  and started instead within device driver . This movement of the location of object  is transparent to both ATM  and . Name server  simply notifies whichever processes have subscribed for SE  of the newly assigned process identification number corresponding to device driver .","The name server or a separate binding object manager (BOM) process may allow processes and configurable objects to pass additional information adding further flexibility to inter-process communications. For example, flexibility may be added to the application programming interfaces (APIs) used between processes. As discussed above, once a process is given a process identification number by the name server corresponding to an object with which it needs to communicate, the process can then send messages to the other process in accordance with a predefined application programming interface (API). Instead of having a predefined API, the API could have variables defined by data passed through the name server or BOM, and instead of having a single API, multiple APIs may be available and the selection of the API may be dependent upon information passed by the name server or BOM to the subscribed application.","Referring to , a typical API will have a predefined message format  including, for example, a message type  and a value  of a fixed number of bits (e.g., ). Processes that use this API must use the predefined message format. If a process is upgraded, it will be forced to use the same message format or change the API\/message format which would require that all processes that use this API also be similarly upgraded to use the new API. Instead, the message format can be made more flexible by passing information through the name server or BOM. For example, instead of having the value field  be a fixed number of bits, when an application registers a name and process identification number it may also register the number of bits it plans on using for the value field (or any other field). Perhaps a zero indicates a value field of 32 bits and a one indicates a value filed of 64 bits. Thus, both processes know the message format but some flexibility has been added.","In addition to adding flexibility to the size of fields in a message format, flexibility may be added to the overall message format including the type of fields included in the message. When a process registers its name and process identification number, it may also register a version number indicating which API version should be used by other processes wishing to communicate with it. For example, device driver  () may register SE  with NS  and provide the name of SE , device driver 's process identification number and a version number one, and device driver  may register SE  with NS  and provide the name of SE , device driver 's process identification number and a version number (e.g., version number two). If ATM  has subscribed for either SE  or SE , then NS  notifies ATM  that SE  and SE  exist and provides the process identification numbers and version numbers. The version number tells ATM  what message format and information SE  and SE  expect. The different message formats for each version may be hard coded into ATM  or ATM  may access system memory or the configuration database for the message formats corresponding to service endpoint version one and version two. As a result, the same application may communicate with different versions of the same configurable object using a different API.","This also allows an application, for example, ATM, to be upgraded to support new configurable objects, for example, new ATM interfaces, while still being backward compatible by supporting older configurable objects, for example, old ATM interfaces. Backward compatibility has been provided in the past through revision numbers, however, initial communication between processes involved polling to determine version numbers and where multiple applications need to communicate, each would need to poll the other. The name server\/BOM eliminates the need for polling.","As described above, the name server notifies subscriber applications each time a subscribed for process is terminated. Instead, the name server\/BOM may not send such a notification unless the System Resiliency Manager (SRM) tells the name server\/BOM to send such a notification. For example, depending upon the fault policy\/resiliency of the system, a particular software fault may simply require that a process be restarted. In such a situation, the name server\/BOM may not notify subscriber applications of the termination of the failed process and instead simply notify the subscriber applications of the newly assigned process identification number after the failed process has been restarted. Data that is sent by the subscriber processes after the termination of the failed process and prior to the notification of the new process identification number may be lost but the recovery of this data (if any) may be less problematic than notifying the subscriber processes of the failure and having them hold all transmissions. For other faults, or after a particular software fault occurs a predetermined number of times, the SRM may then require the name server\/BOM to notify all subscriber processes of the termination of the failed process. Alternatively, if a terminated process does not re-register within a predetermined amount of time, the name server\/BOM may then notify all subscriber processes of the termination of the failed process.","Configuration Change:","Over time the user will likely make hardware changes to the computer system that require configuration changes. For example, the user may plug a fiber or cable (i.e., network connection) into an as yet unused port, in which case, the port must be enabled and, if not already enabled, then the port's line card must also be enabled. As other examples, the user may add another path to an already enabled port that was not fully utilized, and the user may add another line card to the computer system. Many types of configuration changes are possible, and the modular software architecture allows them to be made while the computer system is running (hot changes). Configuration changes may be automatically copied to persistent storage as they are made so that if the computer system is shut down and rebooted, the memory and configuration database will reflect the last known state of the hardware.","To make a configuration change, the user informs the NMS (e.g., NMS client , ) of the particular change, and similar to the process for initial configuration, the NMS (e.g., NMS server  a, ) changes the appropriate tables in the configuration database (copied to the NMS database) to implement the change.","Referring to , in one example of a configuration change, the user notifies the NMS that an additional path will be carried by SONET fiber connected to port . A new service endpoint (SE)  and a new ATM interface  are needed to handle the new path. The NMS adds a new record (row , ) to service endpoint table (SET)  to include service endpoint  corresponding to port physical identification number (PID)  (port ). The NMS also adds a new record (row , ) to ATM instance table  to include ATM interface (IF)  corresponding to ATM group  and SE . Configuration database  may automatically copy the changes made to SET  and ATM instance table  to persistent storage  such that if the computer system is shut down and rebooted, the changes to the configuration database will be maintained.","Configuration database  also notifies (through the active query process) SEM that a new service endpoint (SE ) was added to the SET corresponding to its port (PID ), and configuration database  also notifies ATM instantiation  that a new ATM interface (ATM-IF ) was added to the ATM interface table corresponding to ATM group . ATM  establishes ATM interface  and SEM notifies port driver  that it has been assigned SE. A communication link is established through NS . Device driver  generates a service endpoint name using the assigned SE number and publishes this name and its process identification number with NS . ATM interface  generates the same service endpoint name and subscribes to NS for that service endpoint name. NS provides ATM interface  with the process identification assigned to DD  allowing ATM interface  to communicate with device driver .","Certain board changes to computer system  are also configuration changes. After power-up and configuration, a user may plug another board into an empty computer system slot or remove an enabled board and replace it with a different board. In the case where applications and drivers for a line card added to computer system  are already loaded, the configuration change is similar to initial configuration. The additional line card may be identical to an already enabled line card, for example, line card or if the additional line card requires different drivers (for different components) or different applications (e.g., IP), the different drivers and applications are already loaded because computer system  expects such cards to be inserted.","Referring to , while computer system  is running, when another line card  is inserted, master MCD  detects the insertion and communicates with a diagnostic program  being executed by the line card's processor  to learn the card's type and version number. MCD  uses the information it retrieves to update card table  and port table . MCD  then searches physical module description (PMD) file  in memory  for a record that matches the retrieved card type and version number and retrieves the name of the mission kernel image executable file (MKI.exe) that needs to be loaded on line card . Once determined, master MCD  passes the name of the MKI executable file to master SRM . SRM  downloads MKI executable file  from persistent storage  and passes it to a slave SRM  running on line card . The slave SRM executes the received MKI executable file.","Referring to , slave MCD  then searches PMD file  in memory  on central processor  for a match with its line card's type and version number to find the names of all the device driver executable files associated needed by its line card. Slave MCD  provides these names to slave SRM  which then downloads and executes the device driver executable files (DD.exe)  from memory .","When master MCD  updates card table , configuration database  updated NMS database  which sends NMS  (e.g., NMS Server , ) a notification of the change including card type and version number, the slot number into which the card was inserted and the physical identification (PID) assigned to the card by the master MCD. The NMS is updated, assigns an LID and updates the logical to physical table and notifies the user of the new hardware. The user then tells the NMS how to configure the new hardware, and the NMS implements the configuration change as described above for initial configuration.","Logical Model Change:","Where applications and device drivers for a new line card are not already loaded and where changes or upgrades to already loaded applications and device drivers are needed, logical model  (-) must be changed and new view ids and APIs, NMS JAVA interface files, persistent layer metadata files and new DDL files must be re-generated. Software model  is changed to include models of the new or upgraded software, and hardware model  is changed to include models of any new hardware. New logical model \u2032 is then used by code generation system  to re-generate view ids and APIs for each application, including any new applications, for example, ATM version two , or device drivers, for example, device driver , and to re-generate DDL files \u2032 and \u2032 including new SQL commands and data relevant to the new hardware and\/or software. The new logical model is also used to generate new NMS JAVA interface files \u2032 and new persistent layer metadata files \u2032. Each application, including any new applications or drivers, is then pulled into the build process and links in a corresponding view id and API. The new applications and\/or device drivers, NMS JAVA interface files, new persistent layer metadata files and the new DDL files as well as any new hardware are then sent to the user of computer system .","New and upgraded applications and device drivers are being used by way of an example, and it should be understood that other processes, for example, modular system services and new Mission Kernel Images (MKIs), may be changed or upgraded in the same fashion.","Referring to , the user instructs the NMS to download the new applications and\/or device drivers, for example, ATM version two  and device driver , as well as the new DDL files, for example, DDL files \u2032 and \u2032, into memory on work station . The NMS uses new NMS database DDL file \u2032 to upgrade NMS database  into new NMS database \u2032. Alternatively, a new NMS database may be created using DDL file \u2032 and both databases temporarily maintained.","Application Upgrade:","For new applications and application upgrades, the NMS works with a software management system (SMS) service to implement the change while the computer system is running (hot upgrades or additions). The SMS is one of the modular system services, and like the MCD and the SRM, the SMS is a distributed application. Referring to , a master SMS  is executed by central processor  while slave SMSs -are executed on each board.","Upgrading a distributed application that is running on multiple boards is more complicated than upgrading an application running on only one board. As an example of a distributed application upgrade, the user may want to upgrade all ATM applications running on various boards in the system using new ATM version two . This is by way of example, and it should be understood, that only one ATM application may be upgraded so long as it is compatible with the other versions of ATM running on other boards. ATM version two  may include many sub-processes, for example, an upgraded ATM application executable file (ATMv2.exe ), an upgraded ATM control executable file (ATMv2_cntrl.exe ) and an ATM configuration control file (ATMv2_cnfg_cntrl.exe). The NMS downloads ATMv2.exe , ATMv2_cntrl.exe and ATMv2_cnfg_cntrl.exe to memory  on central processor .","The NMS then writes a new record into SMS table  indicating the scope of the configuration update. The scope of an upgrade may be indicated in a variety of ways. In one embodiment, the SMS table includes a field for the name of the application to be changed and other fields indicating the changes to be made. In another embodiment, the SMS table includes a revision number field  () through which the NMS can indicate the scope of the change. Referring to , the right most position in the revision number may indicate, for example, the simplest configuration update (e.g., a bug fix), in this case, termed a \u201cservice update level\u201d . Any software revisions that differ by only the service update level can be directly applied without making changes in the configuration database or API changes between the new and current revision. The next position may indicate a slightly more complex update, in this case, termed a \u201csubsystem compatibility level\u201d . These changes include changes to the configuration database and\/or an API. The next position may indicate a \u201cminor revision level\u201d  update indicating more comprehensive changes in both the configuration database and one or more APIs. The last position may indicate a \u201cmajor revision level\u201d  update indicative of wholesale changes in multiple areas and may require a reboot of the computer system to implement. For a major revision level change, the NMS will download a complete image including a kernel image.","During initial configuration, the SMS establishes an active query on SMS table . Consequently, when the NMS changes the SMS table, the configuration database sends a notification to master SMS  including the change. In some instances, the change to an application may require changes to configuration database . The SMS determines the need for configuration conversion based on the scope of the release or update. If the configuration database needs to be changed, then the software, for example, ATM version two , provided by the user and downloaded by the NMS also includes a configuration control executable file, for example, ATMv2_cnfig_cntrl.exe , and the name of this file will be in the SMS table record. The master SMS then directs slave SRM on central processor  to execute the configuration control file which uses DDL file \u2032 to upgrade old configuration database  into new configuration database \u2032 by creating new tables, for example, ATM group table \u2032 and ATM interface table \u2032.","Existing processes using their view ids and APIs to access new configuration database \u2032 in the same manner as they accessed old configuration database . However, when new processes (e.g., ATM version two  and device driver ) access new configuration database \u2032, their view ids and APIs allow them to access new tables and data within new configuration database \u2032.","The master SMS also reads ATM group table \u2032 to determine that instances of ATM are being executed on line cards -. In order to upgrade a distributed application, in this instance, ATM, the Master SMS will use a lock step procedure. Master SMS  tells each slave SMS -to stall the current versions of ATM. When each slave responds, Master SMS  then tells slave SMSs -to download and execute ATMv2_cntrl.exe  from memory . Upon instructions from the slave SMSs, slave SRMs -download and execute copies of ATMv2_cntrl.exe -. The slave SMSs also pass data to the ATMv2cntrl.exe file through the SRM. The data instructs the control shim to start in upgrade mode and passes required configuration information. The upgraded ATMv2 controllers -then use ATM group table \u2032 and ATM interface table \u2032 as described above to implement ATMv2 -on each of the line cards. In this example, each ATM controller is shown implementing one instance of ATM on each line card, but as explained below, the ATM controller may implement multiple instances of ATM on each line card.","As part of the upgrade mode, the updated versions of ATMv2 -retrieve active state from the current versions of ATM -. The retrieval of active state can be accomplished in the same manner that a redundant or backup instantiation of ATM retrieves active state from the primary instantiation of ATM. When the upgraded instances of ATMv2 are executing and updated with active state, the ATMv2 controllers notify the slave SMSs -on their board and each slave SMS -notifies master SMS . When all boards have notified the master SMS, the master SMS tells the slave SMSs to switchover to ATMv2 -. The slave SMSs tell the slave SRMs running on their board, and the slave SRMs transition the new ATMv2 processes to the primary role. This is termed \u201clock step upgrade\u201d because each of the line cards is switched over to the new ATMv2 processes simultaneously.","There may be upgrades that require changes to multiple applications and to the APIs for those applications. For example, a new feature may be added to ATM that also requires additional functionality to be added to the Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) application. The additionally functionality may change the peer-to-peer API for ATM, the peer-to-peer API for MPLS and the API between ATM and MPLS. In this scenario, the upgrade operation must avoid allowing the \u201cnew\u201d version of ATM to communicate with itself or the \u201cold\u201d version of MPLS and vice versa. The master SMS will use the release number scheme to determine the requirements for the individual upgrade. For example, the upgrade may be from release 1.0.0.0 to 1.0.1.3 where the release differs by the subsystem compatibility level. The SMS implements the upgrade in a lock step fashion. All instances of ATM and MPLS are upgraded first. The slave SMS on each line card then directs the slave SRM on its board to terminate all \u201cold\u201d instances of ATM and MPLS and switchover to the new instances of MPLS and ATM. The simultaneous switchover to new versions of both MPLS and ATM eliminate any API compatibility errors.","Referring to , instead of directly upgrading configuration database  on central processor , a backup configuration database  on a backup central processor  may be upgraded first. As described above, computer system  includes central processor . Computer system  may also include a redundant or backup central processor  that mirrors or replicates the active state of central processor . Backup central processor  is generally in stand-by mode unless central processor  fails at which point a fail-over to backup central processor  is initiated to allow the backup central processor to be substituted for central processor . In addition to failures, backup central processor  may be used for software and hardware upgrades that require changes to the configuration database. Through backup central processor , upgrades can be made to backup configuration database  instead of to configuration database .","The upgrade is begun as discussed above with the NMS downloading ATM version two \u2014including ATMv2.exe , ATMv2_cntrl.exe and ATMv2_cnfg_cntrl.exe\u2014and DDL file \u2032 to memory on central processor . Simultaneously, because central processor  is in backup mode, the application and DDL file are also copied to memory on central processor . The NMS also creates a software load record in SMS table , \u2032 indicating the upgrade. In this embodiment, when the SMS determines that the scope of the upgrade requires an upgrade to the configuration database, the master SMS instructs slave SMS on central processor  to perform the upgrade. Slave SMS works with slave SRM to cause backup processor  to change from backup mode to upgrade mode.","In upgrade mode, backup processor  stops replicating the active state of central processor . Any changes made to new configuration database  are copied to new NMS database \u2032. Slave SMS then directs slave SRM to execute the configuration control file which uses DDL file \u2032 to upgrade configuration database .","Once configuration database  is upgraded, a fail-over or switch-over from central processor  to backup central processor  is initiated. Central processor  then begins acting as the primary central processor and applications running on central processor  and other boards throughout computer system  begin using upgraded configuration database .","Central processor  may not become the backup central processor right away. Instead, central processor  with its older copy of configuration database  stays dormant in case an automatic downgrade is necessary (described below). If the upgrade goes smoothly and is committed (described below), then central processor  will begin operating in backup mode and replace old configuration database  with new configuration database .","Device Driver Upgrade:","Device driver software may also be upgraded and the implementation of device driver upgrades is similar to the implementation of application upgrades. The user informs the NMS of the device driver change and provides a copy of the new software (e.g., DD^.exe , ). The NMS downloads the new device driver to memory  on central processor , and the NMS writes a new record in SMS table  indicating the device driver upgrade. Configuration database  sends a notification to master SMS  including the name of the driver to be upgraded. To determine where the original device driver is currently running in computer system , the master SMS searches PMD file  for a match of the device driver name (existing device driver, not upgraded device driver) to learn with which module type and version number the device driver is associated. The device driver may be running on one or more boards in computer system . As described above, the PMD file corresponds the module type and version number of a board with the mission kernel image for that board as well as the device drivers for that board. The SMS then searches card table  for a match with the module type and version number found in the PMD file. Card table  includes records corresponding module type and version number with the physical identification (PID) and slot number of that board. The master SMS now knows the board or boards within computer system  on which to load the upgraded device driver. If the device driver is for a particular port, then the SMS must also search the port table to learn the PID for that port.","The master SMS notifies each slave SMS running on boards to be upgraded of the name of the device driver executable file to download and execute. In the example, master SMS  sends slave SMS the name of the upgraded device driver (DD^.exe ) to download. Slave SMS tells slave SRM to download and execute DD^.exe  in upgrade mode. Once downloaded, DD^.exe  (copy of DD^.exe ) gathers active state information from the currently running DD.exe  in a similar fashion as a redundant or backup device driver would gather active state. DD^.exe  then notifies slave SRM that active state has been gathered, and slave SRM stops the current DD.exe  process and transitions the upgraded DD^.exe  process to the primary role.","Automatic Downgrade:","Often, implementation of an upgrade, can cause unexpected errors in the upgraded software, in other applications or in hardware. As described above, a new configuration database \u2032 () is generated and changes to the new configuration database are made in new tables (e.g., ATM interface table \u2032 and ATM group table \u2032, ) and new executable files (e.g., ATMv2.exe , ATMv2_cntrl.exe  and ATMv2_cnfg_cntrl.exe ) are downloaded to memory . Importantly, the old configuration database records and the original application files are not deleted or altered. In the embodiment where changes are made directly to configuration database  on central processor , they are made only in non-persistent memory until committed (described below). In the embodiment where changes are made to backup configuration database  on backup central processor , original configuration database  remains unchanged.","Because the operating system provides a protected memory model that assigns different process blocks to different processes, including upgraded applications, the original applications will not share memory space with the upgraded applications and, therefore, cannot corrupt or change the memory used by the original application. Similarly, memory  is capable of simultaneously maintaining the original and upgraded versions of the configuration database records and executable files as well as the original and upgraded versions of the applications (e.g., ATM -). As a result, the SMS is capable of an automatic downgrade on the detection of an error. To allow for automatic downgrade, the SRMs pass error information to the SMS. The SMS may cause the system to revert to the old configuration and application (i.e., automatic downgrade) on any error or only for particular errors.","As mentioned, often upgrades to one application may cause unexpected faults or errors in other software. If the problem causes a system shut down and the configuration upgrade was stored in persistent storage, then the system, when powered back up, will experience the error again and shut down again. Since, the upgrade changes to the configuration database are not copied to persistent storage  until the upgrade is committed, if the computer system is shut down, when it is powered back up, it will use the original version of the configuration database and the original executable files, that is, the computer system will experience an automatic downgrade.","Additionally, a fault induced by an upgrade may cause the system to hang, that is, the computer system will not shut down but will also become inaccessible by the NMS and inoperable. To address this concern, in one embodiment, the NMS and the master SMS periodically send messages to each other indicating they are executing appropriately. If the SMS does not receive one of these messages in a predetermined period of time, then the SMS knows the system has hung. The master SMS may then tell the slave SMSs to revert to the old configuration (i.e., previously executing copies of ATM -) and if that does not work, the master SMS may re-start\/re-boot computer system . Again, because the configuration changes were not saved in persistent storage, when the computer system powers back up, the old configuration will be the one implemented.","Evaluation Mode:","Instead of implementing a change to a distributed application across the entire computer system, an evaluation mode allows the SMS to implement the change in only a portion of the computer system. If the evaluation mode is successful, then the SMS may fully implement the change system wide. If the evaluation mode is unsuccessful, then service interruption is limited to only that portion of the computer system on which the upgrade was deployed. In the above example, instead of executing the upgraded ATMv2  on each of the line cards, the ATMv2 configuration convert file  will create an ATMv2 group table \u2032 indicating an upgrade only to one line card, for example, line card . Moreover, if multiple instantiations of ATM are running on line card (e.g., one instantiation per port), the ATMv2 configuration convert file may indicate through ATMv2 interface table \u2032 that the upgrade is for only one instantiation (e.g., one port) on line card . Consequently, a failure is likely to only disrupt service on that one port, and again, the SMS can further minimize the disruption by automatically downgrading the configuration of that port on the detection of an error. If no error is detected during the evaluation mode, then the upgrade can be implemented over the entire computer system.","Upgrade Commitment:","Upgrades are made permanent by saving the new application software and new configuration database and DDL file in persistent storage and removing the old configuration data from memory  as well as persistent storage. As mentioned above, changes may be automatically saved in persistent storage as they are made in non-persistent memory (no automatic downgrade), or the user may choose to automatically commit an upgrade after a successful time interval lapses (evaluation mode). The time interval from upgrade to commitment may be significant. During this time, configuration changes may be made to the system. Since these changes are typically made in non-persistent memory, they will be lost if the system is rebooted prior to upgrade commitment. Instead, to maintain the changes, the user may request that certain configuration changes made prior to upgrade commitment be copied into the old configuration database in persistent memory. Alternatively, the user may choose to manually commit the upgrade at his or her leisure. In the manual mode, the user would ask the NMS to commit the upgrade and the NMS would inform the master SMS, for example, through a record in the SMS table.","Independent Process Failure and Restart:","Depending upon the fault policy managed by the slave SRMs on each board, the failure of an application or device driver may not immediately cause an automatic downgrade during an upgrade process. Similarly, the failure of an application or device driver during normal operation may not immediately cause the fail over to a backup or redundant board. Instead, the slave SRM running on the board may simply restart the failing process. After multiple failures by the same process, the fault policy may cause the SRM to take more aggressive measures such as automatic downgrade or fail-over.","Referring to , if an application, for example, ATM application  fails, the slave SRM on the same board as ATM  may simply restart it without having to reboot the entire system. As described above, under the protected memory model, a failing process cannot corrupt the memory blocks used by other processes. Typically, an application and its corresponding device drivers would be part of the same memory block or even part of the same software program, such that if the application failed, both the application and device drivers would need to be restarted. Under the modular software architecture, however, applications, for example ATM application , are independent of the device drivers, for example, ATM driver  and Device Drivers (DD) -. This separation of the data plane (device drivers) and control plane (applications) results in the device drivers being peers of the applications. Hence, while the ATM application is terminated and restarted, the device drivers continue to function.","For network devices, this separation of the control plane and data plane means that the connections previously established by the ATM application are not lost when ATM fails and hardware controlled by the device drivers continue to pass data through connections previously established by the ATM application. Until the ATM application is restarted and re-synchronized (e.g., through an audit process, described below) with the active state of the device drivers, no new network connections may be established but the device drivers continue to pass data through the previously established connections to allow the network device to minimize disruption and maintain high availability.","Local Backup:","If a device driver, for example, device driver , fails instead of an application, for example, ATM , then data cannot be passed. For a network device, it is critical to continue to pass data and not lose network connections. Hence, the failed device driver must be brought back up (i.e., recovered) as soon as possible. In addition, the failing device driver may have corrupted the hardware it controls, therefore, that hardware must be reset and reinitialized. The hardware may be reset as soon as the device driver terminates or the hardware may be reset later when the device driver is restarted.","Resetting the hardware stops data flow. In some instances, therefore, resetting the hardware will be delayed until the device driver is restarted to minimize the time period during which data is not flowing. Alternatively, the failing device driver may have corrupted the hardware, thus, resetting the hardware as soon as the device driver is terminated may be important to prevent data corruption. In either case, the device driver re-initializes the hardware during its recovery.","Again, because applications and device drivers are assigned independent memory blocks, a failed device driver can be restarted without having to restart associated applications and device drivers. Independent recovery may save significant time as described above for applications. In addition, restoring the data plane (i.e., device drivers) can be simpler and faster than restoring the control plane (i.e., applications). While it may be just as challenging in terms of raw data size, device driver recovery may simply require that critical state data be copied into place in a few large blocks, as opposed to application recovery which requires the successive application of individual configuration elements and considerable parsing, checking and analyzing. In addition, the application may require data stored in the configuration database on the central processor or data stored in the memory of other boards. The configuration database may be slow to access especially since many other applications also access this database. The application may also need time to access a management information base (MIB) interface.","To increase the speed with which a device driver is brought back up, the restarted device driver program accesses local backup . In one example, local backup is a simple storage\/retrieval process that maintains the data in simple lists in physical memory (e.g., random access memory, RAM) for quick access. Alternatively, local backup may be a database process, for example, a Polyhedra database, similar to the configuration database.","Local backup  stores the last snap shot of critical state information used by the original device driver before it failed. The data in local backup  is in the format required by the device driver. In the case of a network device, local back up data may include path information, for example, service endpoint, path width and path location. Local back up data may also include virtual interface information, for example, which virtual interfaces were configured on which paths and virtual circuit (VC) information, for example, whether each VC is switched or passed through segmentation and reassembly (SAR), whether each VC is a virtual channel or virtual path and whether each VC is multicast or merge. The data may also include traffic parameters for each VC, for example, service class, bandwidth and\/or delay requirements.","Using the data in the local backup allows the device driver to quickly recover. An Audit process resynchronizes the restarted device driver with associated applications and other device drivers such that the data plane can again transfer network data. Having the backup be local reduces recovery time. Alternatively, the backup could be stored remotely on another board but the recovery time would be increased by the amount of time required to download the information from the remote location.","Audit Process:","It is virtually impossible to ensure that a failed process is synchronized with other processes when it restarts, even when backup data is available. For example, an ATM application may have set up or tom down a connection with a device driver but the device driver failed before it updated corresponding backup data. When the device driver is restarted, it will have a different list of established connections than the corresponding ATM application (i.e., out of synchronization). The audit process allows processes like device drivers and ATM applications to compare information, for example, connection tables, and resolve differences. For instance, connections included in the driver's connection table and not in the ATM connection table were likely torn down by ATM prior to the device driver crash and are, therefore, deleted from the device driver connection table. Connections that exist in the ATM connection table and not in the device driver connection table were likely set up prior to the device driver failure and may be copied into the device driver connection table or deleted from the ATM connection table and re-set up later. If an ATM application fails and is restarted, it must execute an audit procedure with its corresponding device driver or drivers as well as with other ATM applications since this is a distributed application.","Vertical Fault Isolation:","Typically, a single instance of an application executes on a single card or in a system. Fault isolation, therefore, occurs at the card level or the system level, and if a fault occurs, an entire card\u2014and all the ports on that card\u2014or the entire system\u2014and all the ports in the system\u2014is affected. In a large communications platform, thousands of customers may experience service outages due to a single process failure.","For resiliency and fault isolation one or more instances of an application and\/or device driver may be started per port on each line card. Multiple instances of applications and device drivers are more difficult to manage and require more processor cycles than a single instance of each but if an application or device driver fails, only the port those processes are associated with is affected. Other applications and associated ports\u2014as well as the customers serviced by those ports\u2014will not experience service outages. Similarly, a hardware failure associated with only one port will only affect the processes associated with that port. This is referred to as vertical fault isolation.","Referring to , as one example, line card is shown to include four vertical stacks , , , and . Vertical stack  includes one instance of ATM  and one device driver and is associated with port . Similarly, vertical stacks ,  and  include one instance of ATM , ,  and one device driver , , , respectively and each vertical stack is associated with a separate port , , , respectively. If ATM  fails, then only vertical stack  and its associated port are affected. Service is not disrupted on the other ports (ports , , ) since vertical stacks , , and  are unaffected and the applications and drivers within those stacks continue to execute and transmit data. Similarly, if device driver fails, then only vertical stack  and its associated port are affected.","Vertical fault isolation allows processes to be deployed in a fashion supportive of the underlying hardware architecture and allows processes associated with particular hardware (e.g., a port) to be isolated from processes associated with other hardware (e.g., other ports) on the same or a different line card. Any single hardware or software failure will affect only those customers serviced by the same vertical stack. Vertical fault isolation provides a fine grain of fault isolation and containment. In addition, recovery time is reduced to only the time required to re-start a particular application or driver instead of the time required to re-start all the processes associated with a line card or the entire system.","Fault\/Event Detection:","Traditionally, fault detection and monitoring does not receive a great deal of attention from network equipment designers. Hardware components are subjected to a suite of diagnostic tests when the system powers up. After that, the only way to detect a hardware failure is to watch for a red light on a board or wait for a software component to fail when it attempts to use the faulty hardware. Software monitoring is also reactive. When a program fails, the operating system usually detects the failure and records minimal debug information.","Current methods provide only sporadic coverage for a narrow set of hard faults. Many subtler failures and events often go undetected. For example, hardware components sometimes suffer a minor deterioration in functionality, and changing network conditions stress the software in ways that were never expected by the designers. At times, the software may be equipped with the appropriate instrumentation to detect these problems before they become hard failures, but even then, network operators are responsible for manually detecting and repairing the conditions.","Systems with high availability goals must adopt a more proactive approach to fault and event monitoring. In order to provide comprehensive fault and event detection, different hierarchical levels of fault\/levent management software are provided that intelligently monitor hardware and software and proactively take action in accordance with a defined fault policy. A fault policy based on hierarchical scopes ensures that for each particular type of failure the most appropriate action is taken. This is important because over-reacting to a failure, for example, re-booting an entire computer system or re-starting an entire line card, may severely and unnecessarily impact service to customers not affected by the failure, and under-reacting to failures, for example, restarting only one process, may not completely resolve the fault and lead to additional, larger failures. Monitoring and proactively responding to events may also allow the computer system and network operators to address issues before they become failures. For example, additional memory may be assigned to programs or added to the computer system before a lack of memory causes a failure.","Hierarchical Scopes and Escalation:","Referring to , in one embodiment, master SRM  serves as the top hierarchical level fault\/event manager, each slave SRM -serves as the next hierarchical level fault\/event manager, and software applications resident on each board, for example, ATM - and device drivers -on line card include sub-processes that serve as the lowest hierarchical level fault\/event managers (i.e., local resiliency managers, LRM). Master SRM  downloads default fault policy (DFP) files (metadata) -from persistent storage to memory . Master SRM  reads a master default fault policy file (e.g., DFP ) to understand its fault policy, and each slave SRM -downloads a default fault policy file (e.g., DFP -) corresponding to the board on which the slave SRM is running. Each slave SRM then passes to each LRM a fault policy specific to each local process.","A master logging entity  also runs on central processor  and slave logging entities -run on each board. Notifications of failures and other events are sent by the master SRM, slave SRMs and LRMs to their local logging entity which then notifies the master logging entity. The master logging entity enters the event in a master event log file . Each local logging entity may also log local events in a local event log file -","In addition, a fault policy table  may be created in configuration database  by the NMS when the user wishes to over-ride some or all of the default fault policy (see configurable fault policy below), and the master and slave SRMs are notified of the fault policies through the active query process.","Referring to , as one example, ATM application  includes many sub-processes including, for example, an LRM program , a Private Network-to-Network Interface (PNNI) program , an Interim Link Management Interface (ILMI) program , a Service Specific Connection Oriented Protocol (SSCOP) program , and an ATM signaling (SIG) program . ATM application  may include many other sub-programs only a few have been shown for convenience. Each sub-process may also include sub-processes, for example, ILMI sub-processes -. In general, the upper level application (e.g., ATM ) is assigned a process memory block that is shared by all its sub-processes.","If, for example, SSCOP  detects a fault, it notifies LRM . LRM  passes the fault to local slave SRM , which catalogs the fault in the ATM application's fault history and sends a notice to local slave logging entity . The slave logging entity sends a notice to master logging entity , which may log the event in master log event file . The local logging entity may also log the failure in local event log . LRM  also determines, based on the type of failure, whether it can fully resolve the error and do so without affecting other processes outside its scope, for example, ATM -, device drivers -and their sub-processes and processes running on other boards. If yes, then the LRM takes corrective action in accordance with its fault policy. Corrective action may include restarting SSCOP  or resetting it to a known state.","Since all sub-processes within an application, including the LRM sub-process, share the same memory space, it may be insufficient to restart or reset a failing sub-process (e.g., SSCOP ). Hence, for most failures, the fault policy will cause the LRM to escalate the failure to the local slave SRM. In addition, many failures will not be presented to the LRM but will, instead, be presented directly to the local slave SRM. These failures are likely to have been detected by either processor exceptions, OS errors or low-level system service errors. Instead of failures, however, the sub-processes may notify the LRM of events that may require action. For example, the LRM may be notified that the PNNI message queue is growing quickly. The LRM's fault policy may direct it to request more memory from the operating system. The LRM will also pass the event to the local slave SRM as a non-fatal fault. The local slave SRM will catalog the event and log it with the local logging entity, which may also log it with the master logging entity. The local slave SRM may take more severe action to recover from an excessive number of these non-fatal faults that result in memory requests.","If the event or fault (or the actions required to handle either) will affect processes outside the LRM's scope, then the LRM notifies slave SRM of the event or failure. In addition, if the LRM detects and logs the same failure or event multiple times and in excess of a predetermined threshold set within the fault policy, the LRM may escalate the failure or event to the next hierarchical scope by notifying slave SRM . Alternatively or in addition, the slave SRM may use the fault history for the application instance to determine when a threshold is exceeded and automatically execute its fault policy.","When slave SRM detects or is notified of a failure or event, it notifies slave logging entity . The slave logging entity notifies master logging entity , which may log the failure or event in master event log , and the slave logging entity may also log the failure or event in local event log . Slave SRM also determines, based on the type of failure or event, whether it can handle the error without affecting other processes outside its scope, for example, processes running on other boards. If yes, then slave SRM takes corrective action in accordance with its fault policy and logs the fault. Corrective action may include re-starting one or more applications on line card ","If the fault or recovery actions will affect processes outside the slave SRM's scope, then the slave SRM notifies master SRM . In addition, if the slave SRM has detected and logged the same failure multiple times and in excess of a predetermined threshold, then the slave SRM may escalate the failure to the next hierarchical scope by notifying master SRM  of the failure. Alternatively, the master SRM may use its fault history for a particular line card to determine when a threshold is exceeded and automatically execute its fault policy.","When master SRM  detects or receives notice of a failure or event, it notifies slave logging entity , which notifies master logging entity . The master logging entity  may log the failure or event in master log file  and the slave logging entity may log the failure or event in local event log . Master SRM  also determines the appropriate corrective action based on the type of failure or event and its fault policy. Corrective action may require failing-over one or more line cards -or other boards, including central processor , to redundant backup boards or, where backup boards are not available, simply shutting particular boards down. Some failures may require the master SRM to re-boot the entire computer system.","An example of a common error is a memory access error. As described above, when the slave SRM starts a new instance of an application, it requests a protected memory block from the local operating system. The local operating systems assign each instance of an application one block of local memory and then program the local memory management unit (MMU) hardware with which processes have access (read and\/or write) to each block of memory. An MMU detects a memory access error when a process attempts to access a memory block not assigned to that process. This type of error may result when the process generates an invalid memory pointer. The MMU prevents the failing process from corrupting memory blocks used by other processes (i.e., protected memory model) and sends a hardware exception to the local processor. A local operating system fault handler detects the hardware exception and determines which process attempted the invalid memory access. The fault handler then notifies the local slave SRM of the hardware exception and the process that caused it. The slave SRM determines the application instance within which the fault occurred and then goes through the process described above to determine whether to take corrective action, such as restarting the application, or escalate the fault to the master SRM.","As another example, a device driver, for example, device driver may determine that the hardware associated with its port, for example, port , is in a bad state. Since the failure may require the hardware to be swapped out or failed-over to redundant hardware or the device driver itself to be re-started, the device driver notifies slave SRM . The slave SRM then goes through the process described above to determine whether to take corrective action or escalate the fault to the master SRM.","As a third example, if a particular application instance repeatedly experiences the same software error but other similar application instances running on different ports do not experience the same error, the slave SRM may determine that it is likely a hardware error. The slave SRM would then notify the master SRM which may initiate a fail-over to a backup board or, if no backup board exists, simply shut down that board or only the failing port on that board. Similarly, if the master SRM receives failure reports from multiple boards indicating Ethernet failures, the master SRM may determine that the Ethernet hardware is the problem and initiate a fail-over to backup Ethernet hardware.","Consequently, the failure type and the failure policy determine at what scope recovery action will be taken. The higher the scope of the recovery action, the larger the temporary loss of services. Speed of recovery is one of the primary considerations when establishing a fault policy. Restarting a single software process is much faster than switching over an entire board to a redundant board or re-booting the entire computer system. When a single process is restarted, only a fraction of a card's services are affected. Allowing failures to be handled at appropriate hierarchical levels avoids unnecessary recovery actions while ensuring that sufficient recovery actions are taken, both of which minimize service disruption to customers.","Hierarchical Descriptors:","Hierarchical descriptors may be used to provide information specific to each failure or event. The hierarchical descriptors provide granularity with which to report faults, take action based on fault history and apply fault recovery policies. The descriptors can be stored in master event log file  or local event log files -through which faults and events may be tracked and displayed to the user and allow for fault detection at a fine granular level and proactive response to events. In addition, the descriptors can be matched with descriptors in the fault policy to determine the recovery action to be taken.","Referring to , in one embodiment, a descriptor  includes a top hierarchical class field , a next hierarchical level sub-class field , a lower hierarchical level type field  and a lowest level instance field . The class field indicates whether the failure or event is related (or suspected to relate) to hardware or software. The subclass field categorizes events and failures into particular hardware or software groups. For example, under the hardware class, subclass indications may include whether the fault or event is related to memory, Ethernet, switch fabric or network data transfer hardware. Under the software class, subclass indications may include whether the fault or event is a system fault, an exception or related to a specific application, for example, ATM.","The type field more specifically defines the subclass failure or event. For example, if a hardware class, Ethernet subclass failure has occurred, the type field may indicate a more specific type of Ethernet failure, for instance, a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) error or a runt packet error. Similarly, if a software class, ATM failure or event has occurred, the type field may indicate a more specific type of ATM failure or event, for instance, a private network-to-network interface (PNNI) error or a growing message queue event. The instance field identifies the actual hardware or software that failed or generated the event. For example, with regard to a hardware class, Ethernet subclass, CRC type failure, the instance indicates the actual Ethernet port that experienced the failure. Similarly, with regard to a software class, ATM subclass, PNNI type, the instance indicates the actual PNNI sub-program that experienced the failure or generated the event.","When a fault or event occurs, the hierarchical scope that first detects the failure or event creates a descriptor by filling in the fields described above. In some cases, however, the Instance field is not applicable. The descriptor is sent to the local logging entity, which may log it in the local event log file before notifying the master logging entity, which may log it in the master event log file . The descriptor may also be sent to the local slave SRM, which tracks fault history based on the descriptor contents per application instance. If the fault or event is escalated, then the descriptor is passed to the next higher hierarchical scope.","When slave SRM receives the fault\/event notification and the descriptor, it compares it to descriptors in the fault policy for the particular scope in which the fault occurred looking for a match or a best case match which will indicate the recovery procedure to follow. Fault descriptors within the fault policy can either be complete descriptors or have wildcards in one or more fields. Since the descriptors are hierarchical from left to right, wildcards in descriptor fields only make sense from right to left. The fewer the fields with wildcards, the more specific the descriptor. For example, a particular fault policy may apply to all software faults and would, therefore, include a fault descriptor having the class field set to \u201csoftware\u201d and the remaining fields\u2014subclass, type, and instance\u2014set to wildcard or \u201cmatch all.\u201d The slave SRM searches the fault policy for the best match (i.e., the most fields matched) with the descriptor to determine the recovery action to be taken.","Configurable Fault Policy:","In actual use, a computer system is likely to encounter scenarios that differ from those in which the system was designed and tested. Consequently, it is nearly impossible to determine all the ways in which a computer system might fail, and in the face of an unexpected error, the default fault policy that was shipped with the computer system may cause the hierarchical scope (master SRM, slave SRM or LRM) to under-react or over-react. Even for expected errors, after a computer system ships, certain recovery actions in the default fault policy may be determined to be over aggressive or too lenient. Similar issues may arise as new software and hardware is released and\/or upgraded.","A configurable fault policy allows the default fault policy to be modified to address behavior specific to a particular upgrade or release or to address behavior that was learned after the implementation was released. In addition, a configurable fault policy allows users to perform manual overrides to suit their specific requirements and to tailor their policies based on the individual failure scenarios that they are experiencing.","The modification may cause the hierarchical scope to react more or less aggressively to particular known faults or events, and the modification may add recovery actions to handle newly learned faults or events. The modification may also provide a temporary patch while a software or hardware upgrade is developed to fix a particular error.","If an application runs out of memory space, it notifies the operating system and asks for more memory. For certain applications, this is standard operating procedure. As an example, an ATM application may have set up a large number of virtual circuits and to continue setting up more, additional memory is needed. For other applications, a request for more memory indicates a memory leak error. The fault policy may require that the application be re-started causing some service disruption. It may be that re-starting the application eventually leads to the same error due to a bug in the software. In this instance, while a software upgrade to fix the bug is developed, a temporary patch to the fault policy may be necessary to allow the memory leak to continue and prevent repeated application re-starts that may escalate to line card re-start or fail-over and eventually to a re-boot of the entire computer system. A temporary patch to the default fault policy may simply allow the hierarchical scope, for example, the local resiliency manager or the slave SRM, to assign additional memory to the application. Of course, an eventual re-start of the application is likely to be required if the application's leak consumes too much memory.","A temporary patch may also be needed while a hardware upgrade or fix is developed for a particular hardware fault. For instance, under the default fault policy, when a particular hardware fault occurs, the recovery policy may be to fail-over to a backup board. If the backup board includes the same hardware with the same hardware bug, for example, a particular semiconductor chip, then the same error will occur on the backup board. To prevent a repetitive fail-over while a hardware fix is developed, the temporary patch to the default fault policy may be to restart the device driver associated with the particular hardware instead of failing-over to the backup board.","In addition to the above needs, a configurable fault policy also allows purchasers of computer system  (e.g., network service providers) to define their own policies. For example, a network service provider may have a high priority customer on a particular port and may want all errors and events (even minor ones) to be reported to the NMS and displayed to the network manager. Watching all errors and events might give the network manager early notice of growing resource consumption and the need to plan to dedicate additional resources to this customer.","As another example, a user of computer system  may want to be notified when any process requests more memory. This may give the user early notice of the need to add more memory to their system or to move some customers to different line cards.","Referring again to , to change the default fault policy as defined by default fault policy (DFP) files -, a configuration fault policy file  is created by the NMS in the configuration database. An active query notification is sent by the configuration database to the master SRM indicating the changes to the default fault policy. The master SRM notifies any slave SRMs of any changes to the default fault policies specific to the boards on which they are executing, and the slave SRMs notify any LRMs of any changes to the default fault policies specific to their process. Going forward, the default fault policies\u2014as modified by the configuration fault policy\u2014are used to detect, track and respond to events or failures.","Alternatively, active queries may be established with the configuration database for configuration fault policies specific to each board type such that the slave SRMs are notified directly of changes to their default fault policies.","A fault policy (whether default or configured) is specific to a particular scope and descriptor and indicates a particular recovery action to take. As one example, a temporary patch may be required to handle hardware faults specific to a known bug in an integrated circuit chip. The configured fault policy, therefore, may indicate a scope of all line cards, if the component is on all line cards, or only a specific type of line card that includes that component. The configured fault policy may also indicate that it is to be applied to all hardware faults with that scope, for example, the class will indicate hardware (HW) and all other fields will include wildcards (e.g., HW.*.*.*). Instead, the configured fault policy may only indicate a particular type of hardware failure, for example, CRC errors on transmitted Ethernet packets (e.g., HW.Ethernet.TxCRC.*).","Redundancy:","As previously mentioned, a major concern for service providers is network downtime. In pursuit of \u201cfive 9's availability\u201d or 99.999% network up time, service providers must minimize network outages due to equipment (i.e., hardware) and all too common software failures. Developers of computer systems often use redundancy measures to minimize downtime and enhance system resiliency. Redundant designs rely on alternate or backup resources to overcome hardware and\/or software faults. Ideally, the redundancy architecture allows the computer system to continue operating in the face of a fault with minimal service disruption, for example, in a manner transparent to the service provider's customer.","Generally, redundancy designs come in two forms: 1:1 and 1:N. In a so-called \u201c1:1 redundancy\u201d design, a backup element exists for every active or primary element (i.e., hardware backup). In the event that a fault affects a primary element, a corresponding backup element is substituted for the primary element. If the backup element has not been in a \u201chot\u201d state (i.e., software backup), then the backup element must be booted, configured to operate as a substitute for the failing element, and also provided with the \u201cactive state\u201d of the failing element to allow the backup element to take over where the failed primary element left off. The time required to bring the software on the backup element to an \u201cactive state\u201d is referred to as synchronization time. A long synchronization time can significantly disrupt system service, and in the case of a computer network device, if synchronization is not done quickly enough, then hundreds or thousands of network connections may be lost which directly impacts the service provider's availability statistics and angers network customers.","To minimize synchronization time, many 1:1 redundancy schemes support hot backup of software, which means that the software on the backup elements mirror the software on the primary elements at some level. The \u201chotter\u201d the backup element\u2014that is, the closer the backup mirrors the primary\u2014the faster a failed primary can be switched over or failed over to the backup. The \u201chottest\u201d backup element is one that runs hardware and software simultaneously with a primary element conducting all operations in parallel with the primary element. This is referred to as a \u201c1+1 redundancy\u201d design and provides the fastest synchronization.","Significant costs are associated with 1:1 and 1+1 redundancy. For example, additional hardware costs may include duplicate memory components and printed circuit boards including all the components on those boards. The additional hardware may also require a larger supporting chassis. Space is often limited, especially in the case of network service providers who may maintain hundreds of network devices. Although 1:1 redundancy improves system reliability, it decreases service density and decreases the mean time between failures. Service density refers to the proportionality between the net output of a particular device and its gross hardware capability. Net output, in the case of a network device (e.g., switch or router), might include, for example, the number of calls handled per second. Redundancy adds to gross hardware capability but not to the net output and, thus, decreases service density. Adding hardware increases the likelihood of a failure and, thus, decreases the mean time between failures. Likewise, hot backup comes at the expense of system power. Each active element consumes some amount of the limited power available to the system. In general, the 1+1 or 1:1 redundancy designs provide the highest reliability but at a relatively high cost. Due to the importance of network availability, most network service providers prefer the 1+1 redundancy design to minimize network downtime.","In a 1:N redundancy design, instead of having one backup element per primary element, a single backup element or spare is used to backup multiple (N) primary elements. As a result, the 1:N design is generally less expensive to manufacture, offers greater service density and better mean time between failures than the 1:1 design and requires a smaller chassis\/less space than a 1:1 design. One disadvantage of such a system, however, is that once a primary element fails over to the backup element, the system is no longer redundant (i.e., no available backup element for any primary element). Another disadvantage relates to hot state backup. Because one backup element must support multiple primary elements, the typical 1:N design provides no hot state on the backup element leading to long synchronization times and, for network devices, the likelihood that connections will be dropped and availability reduced.","Even where the backup element provides some level of hot state backup it generally lacks the processing power and memory to provide a full hot state backup (i.e., 1+N) for all primary elements. To enable some level of hot state backup for each primary element, the backup element is generally a \u201cmega spare\u201d equipped with a more powerful processor and additional memory. This requires customers to stock more hardware than in a design with identical backup and primary elements. For instance, users typically maintain extra hardware in the case of a failure. If a primary fails over to the backup, the failed primary may be replaced with a new primary. If the primary and backup elements are identical, then users need only stock that one type of board, that is, a failed backup is also replaced with the same hardware used to replace the failed primary. If they are different, then the user must stock each type of board, thereby increasing the user's cost.","Distributed Redundancy:","A distributed redundancy architecture spreads software backup (hot state) across multiple elements. Each element may provide software backup for one or more other elements. For software backup alone, therefore, the distributed redundancy architecture eliminates the need for hardware backup elements (i.e., spare hardware). Where hardware backup is also provided, spreading resource demands across multiple elements makes it possible to have significant (perhaps full) hot state backup without the need for a mega spare. Identical backup (spare) and primary hardware provides manufacturing advantages and customer inventory advantages. A distributed redundancy design is less expensive than many 1:1 designs and a distributed redundancy architecture also permits the location of the hardware backup element to float, that is, if a primary element fails over to the backup element, when the failed primary element is replaced, that new hardware may serve as the hardware backup.","Software Redundancy:","In its simplest form, a distributed redundancy system provides software redundancy (i.e., backup) with or without redundant (i.e., backup) hardware, for example, with or without using backup line card as discussed earlier with reference to the logical to physical card table (). Referring to , computer system  includes primary line cards , and . Computer system  will likely include additional primary line cards; only three are discussed herein (and shown in ) for convenience. As described above, to load instances of software applications, the NMS creates software load records (SLR) -in configuration database . The SLR includes the name of a control shim executable file and a logical identification (LID) associated with a primary line card on which the application is to be spawned. In the current example, there either are no hardware backup line cards or, if there are, the slave SRM executing on that line card does not download and execute backup applications.","As one example, NMS  creates SLR including the executable name atm_cntrl.exe and card LID  (line card ), SLR including atm_cntrl.exe and LID  (line card ) and SLR including atm_cntrl.exe and LID  (line card ). The configuration database detects LID ,  and  in SLRs , and , respectively, and sends slave SRMs , and (line cards , , and ) notifications including the name of the executable file (e.g., atm_cntrl.exe) to be loaded. The slave SRMs then download and execute a copy of atm_cntrl.exe  from memory  to spawn ATM controllers , and ","Through the active query feature, the ATM controllers are sent records from group table (GT) \u2032 () indicating how many instances of ATM each must start on their associated line cards. Group table \u2032 includes a primary line card LID field  and a backup line card LID field  such that, in addition to starting primary instances of ATM, each primary line card also executes backup instances of ATM. For example, ATM controller receives records - and - from group table \u2032 including LID  (line card ). Records - indicate that ATM controller is to start four primary instantiations of ATM - (), and records - indicate that ATM controller is to start four backup instantiations of ATM - as backup for four primary instantiations on LID  (line card ). Similarly, ATM controller receives records - from group table \u2032 including LID  (line card ). Records - indicate that ATM controller is to start four primary instantiations of ATM -, and records - indicate that ATM controller is to start four backup instantiations of ATM - as backup for four primary instantiations on LID  (line card ). ATM controller receives records - from group table \u2032 including LID  (line card ). Records - indicate that ATM controller is to start four primary instantiations of ATM -, and records - indicate that ATM controller is to start four backup instantiations of ATM - as backup for four primary instantiations on LID  (line card ). ATM controllers , and then download atm.exe  and generate the appropriate number of ATM instantiations and also indicate to each instantiation whether it is a primary or backup instantiation. Alternatively, the ATM controllers may download atm.exe and generate the appropriate number of primary ATM instantiations and download a separate backup_atm.exe and generate the appropriate number of backup ATM instantiations.","Each primary instantiation registers with its local name server -, as described above, and each backup instantiation subscribes to its local name server -for information about its corresponding primary instantiation. The name server passes each backup instantiation at least the process identification number assigned to its corresponding primary instantiation, and with this, the backup instantiation sends a message to the primary instantiation to set up a dynamic state check-pointing procedure. Periodically or asynchronously as state changes, the primary instantiation passes dynamic state information to the backup instantiation (i.e., check-pointing). In one embodiment, a Redundancy Manager Service available from Harris and Jefferies of Dedham, Massachusetts may be used to allow backup and primary instantiations to pass dynamic state information. If the primary instantiation fails, it can be re-started, retrieve its last known dynamic state from the backup instantiation and then initiate an audit procedure (as described above) to resynchronize with other processes. The retrieval and audit process will normally be completed very quickly, resulting in no discernable service disruption.","Although each line card in the example above is instructed by the group table to start four instantiations of ATM, this is by way of example only. The user could instruct the NMS to set up the group table to have each line card start one or more instantiations and to have each line card start a different number of instantiations.","Referring to -, if one or more of the primary processes on element (ATM -) experiences a software fault (), the processor on line card may terminate and restart the failing process or processes. Once the process or processes are restarted (ATM \u2032-\u2032, ), they retrieve a copy of the last known dynamic state (i.e., backup state) from corresponding backup processes (ATM -) executing on line card and initiate an audit process to synchronize retrieved state with the dynamic state of associated other processes. The backup state represents the last known active or dynamic state of the process or processes prior to termination, and retrieving this state from line card allows the restarted processes on line card to quickly resynchronize and continue operating. The retrieval and audit process will normally be completed very quickly, and in the case of a network device, quick resynchronization may avoid losing network connections, resulting in no discernable service disruption.","If, instead of restarting a particular application, the software fault experienced by line card requires the entire element to be shut down and rebooted, then all of the processes executing on line card will be terminated including backup processes ATM -. When the primary processes are restarted, backup state information is retrieved from backup processes executing on line card as explained above. Simultaneously, the restarted backup processes on line card again initiate the check-pointing procedure with primary ATM processes - executing on line card to again serve as backup processes for these primary processes. Referring to -, the primary processes executing on one line card may be backed-up by backup processes running on one or more other line cards. In addition, each primary process may be backed-up by one or more backup processes executing on one or more of the other line cards.","Since the operating system assigns each process its own memory block, each primary process may be backed-up by a backup process running on the same line card. This would minimize the time required to retrieve backup state and resynchronize if a primary process fails and is restarted. In a computer system that includes a spare or backup line card (described below), the backup state is best saved on another line card such that in the event of a hardware fault, the backup state is not lost and can be copied from the other line card. If memory and processor limitations permit, backup processes may run simultaneously on the same line card as the primary process and on another line card such that software faults are recovered from using local backup state and hardware faults are recovered from using remote backup state.","Where limitations on processing power or memory make full hot state backup impossible or impractical, only certain hot state data will be stored as backup. The level of hot state backup is inversely proportional to the resynchronization time, that is, as the level of hot state backup increases, resynchronization time decreases. For a network device, backup state may include critical information that allows the primary process to quickly re-synchronize.","Critical information for a network device may include connection data relevant to established network connections (e.g., call set up information and virtual circuit information). For example, after primary ATM applications -, executing on line card , establish network connections, those applications send critical state information relevant to those connections to backup ATM applications - executing on line card . Retrieving connection data allows the hardware (i.e., line card ) to send and receive network data over the previously established network connections preventing these connections from being terminated\/dropped.","Although ATM applications were used in the examples above, this is by way of example only. Any application (e.g., IP or MPLS), process (e.g., MCD or NS) or device driver (e.g., port driver) may have a backup process started on another line card to store backup state through a check-pointing procedure.","Hardware and Software Backup:","By adding one or more hardware backup elements (e.g., line card ) to the computer system, the distributed redundancy architecture provides both hardware and software backup. Software backup may be spread across all of the line cards or only some of the line cards. For example, software backup may be spread only across the primary line cards, only on one or more backup line cards or on a combination of both primary and backup line cards.","Referring to , in the continuing example, line cards , and are primary hardware elements and line card is a spare or backup hardware element. In this example, software backup is spread across only the primary line cards. Alternatively, backup line card may also execute backup processes to provide software backup. Backup line card may execute all backup processes such that the primary elements need not execute any backup processes or line card may execute only some of the backup processes. Regardless of whether backup line card executes any backup processes, it is preferred that line card be at least partially operational and ready to use the backup processes to quickly begin performing as if it was a failed primary line card.","There are many levels at which a backup line card may be partially operational. For example, the backup line card's hardware may be configured and device driver processes  loaded and ready to execute. In addition, the active state of the device drivers , , and  on each of the primary line cards may be stored as backup device driver state (DDS) , ,  on backup line card such that after a primary line card fails, the backup device driver state corresponding to that primary element is used by device driver processes  to quickly synchronize the hardware on backup line card . In addition, data reflecting the network connections established by each primary process may be stored within each of the backup processes or independently on backup line card , for example, connection data (CD) , , . Having a copy of the connection data on the backup line card allows the hardware to quickly begin transmitting network data over previously established connections to avoid the loss of these connections and minimize service disruption. The more operational (i.e., hotter) backup line card is the faster it will be able to transfer data over network connections previously established by the failed primary line card and resynchronize with the rest of the system.","In the case of a primary line card hardware fault, the backup or spare line card takes the place of the failed primary line card. The backup line card starts new primary processes that register with the name server on the backup line card and begin retrieving active state from backup processes associated with the original primary processes. As described above, the same may also be true for software faults. Referring to , if, for example, line card in computer system  is affected by a fault, the slave SRM executing on backup line card may start new primary processes \u2032-\u2032 corresponding to the original primary processes -. The new primary processes register with the name server process executing on line card and begin retrieving active state from backup processes - on line card . This is referred to as a \u201cfail-over\u201d from failed primary line card to backup line card ","As discussed above, preferably, backup line card is partially operational. While active state is being retrieved from backup processes on line card , device driver processes  use device driver state  and connection data  corresponding to failed primary line card to quickly continue passing network data over previously established connections. Once the active state is retrieved then the ATM applications resynchronize and may begin establishing new connections and tearing down old connections.","Floating Backup Element:","Referring to , when the fault is detected on line card , diagnostic tests may be run to determine if the error was caused by software or hardware. If the fault is a software error, then line card may again be used as a primary line card. If the fault is a hardware error, then line card is replaced with a new line card \u2032 that is booted and configured and again ready to be used as a primary element. In one embodiment, once line card or \u2032 is ready to serve as a primary element, a fail-over is initiated from line card to line card or \u2032 as described above, including starting new primary processes \u2033-\u2033 and retrieving active state from primary processes \u2032-\u2032 on line card (or backup processes - on line card ). Backup processes \u2033-\u2033 are also started, and those backup processes initiate a check-pointing procedure with primary processes - on line card . This fail-over may cause the same level of service interruption as an actual failure.","Instead of failing-over from line card back to line card or \u2032 and risking further service disruption, line card or \u2032 may serve as the new backup line card with line card serving as the primary line card. If line cards , or experience a fault, a fail-over to line card is initiated as discussed above and the primary line card that failed (or a replacement of that line card) serves as the new backup line card. This is referred to as a \u201cfloating\u201d backup element. Referring to , if, for example, line card experiences a fault, primary processes \u2032-\u2032 are started on backup line card and active state is retrieved from backup processes \u2032-\u2032 on line card . After line card is rebooted or replaced and rebooted, it serves as the new backup line card for primary line cards , and .","Alternatively, computer system  may be physically configured to only allow a line card in a particular chassis slot, for example, line card , to serve as the backup line card. This may be the case where physically, the slot line card is inserted within is wired to provide the necessary connections to allow line card to communicate with each of the other line cards but no other slot provides these connections. In addition, even where the computer system is capable of allowing line cards in other chassis slots to act as the backup line card, the person acting as network manager, may prefer to have the backup line card in each of his computer systems in the same slot. In either case, where only line card serves as the backup line card, once line card (or any other failed primary line card) is ready to act as a primary line card again, a fail-over, as described above, is initiated from line card to the primary line card to allow line card to again serve as a backup line card to each of the primary line cards.","Balancing Resources:","Typically, multiple processes or applications are executed on each primary line card. Referring to , in one embodiment, each primary line card , , executes four applications. Due to physical limitations (e.g., memory space, processor power), each primary line card may not be capable of fully backing up four applications executing on another primary line card. The distributed redundancy architecture allows backup processes to be spread across multiple line cards, including any backup line cards, to more efficiently use all system resources.","For instance, primary line card executes backup processes  and  corresponding to primary processes  and  executing on primary line card . Primary line card executes backup processes  and  corresponding to primary processes  and  executing on primary line card , and primary line card executes backup processes  and  corresponding to primary processes  and  executing on primary line card . Backup line card executes backup processes , , , ,  and  corresponding to primary processes , , , ,  and  executing on each of the primary line cards. Having each primary line card execute backup processes for only two primary processes executing on another primary line card reduces the primary line card resources required for backup. Since backup line card is not executing primary processes, more resources are available for backup. Hence, backup line card executes six backup processes corresponding to six primary processes executing on primary line cards. In addition, backup line card is partially operational and is executing device driver processes  and storing device driver backup state ,  and  corresponding to the device drivers on each of the primary elements and network connection data ,  and  corresponding to the network connections established by each of the primary line cards.","Alternatively, each primary line card could execute more or less than two backup processes. Similarly, each primary line card could execute no backup processes and backup line card could execute all backup processes. Many alternatives are possible and backup processes need not be spread evenly across all primary line cards or all primary line cards and the backup line card.","Referring to , if primary line card experiences a failure, device drivers  on backup line card begins using the device driver state, for example, DDS , corresponding to the device drivers on primary line card and the network connection data, for example, CD , corresponding to the connections established by primary line card to continue transferring network data. Simultaneously, backup line card starts substitute primary processes \u2032 and \u2032 corresponding to the primary processes  and  on failed primary line card . Substitute primary processes \u2032 and \u2032 retrieve active state from backup processes  and  executing on primary line card . In addition, the slave SRM on backup line card informs backup processes  and  corresponding to primary processes  and  on failed primary line card that they are now primary processes. The new primary applications then synchronize with the rest of the system such that new network connections may be established and old network connections tom down. That is, backup line card begins operating as if it were primary line card ","Multiple Backup Elements:","In the examples given above, one backup line card is shown. Alternatively, multiple backup line cards may be provided in a computer system. In one embodiment, a computer system includes multiple different primary line cards. For example, some primary line cards may support the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) protocol while others support the Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) protocol, and one backup line card may be provided for the ATM primary line cards and another backup line card may be provided for the MPLS primary line cards. As another example, some primary line cards may support four ports while others support eight ports and one backup line card may be provided for the four port primaries and another backup line card may be provided for the eight port primaries. One or more backup line cards may be provided for each different type of primary line card.","Data Plane:","Referring to , a network device  includes a central processor , a redundant central processor  and a Fast Ethernet control bus  similar to central processors  and  and Ethernet  discussed above with respect to computer system . In addition, network device  includes forwarding cards (FC) -, -, -and -that are similar to line cards -discussed above with respect to computer system . Network device  also includes (and computer system  may also include) universal port (UP) cards -, -, -, and -, cross-connection (XC) cards -, -, -, and -, and switch fabric (SF) cards -. In one embodiment, network device  includes four quadrants where each quadrant includes five forwarding cards (e.g., -), two cross connection cards (e.g., -) and eight universal port cards (e.g., -). Network device  is a distributed processing system. Each of the cards includes a processor and is connected to the Ethernet control bus. In addition, each of the cards are configured as described above with respect to line cards.","In one embodiment, the forwarding cards have a 1:4 hardware redundancy structure and distributed software redundancy as described above. For example, forwarding card is the hardware backup for primary forwarding cards -and each of the forwarding cards provide software backup. The cross-connection cards are 1:1 redundant. For example, cross-connection card provides both hardware and software backup for cross-connection card . Each port on the universal port cards may be 1:1, 1+1, 1:N redundant or not redundant at all depending upon the quality of service paid for by the customer associated with that port. For example, port cards -may be the hardware and software backup cards for port cards -in which case the port cards are 1:1 or 1+1 redundant. As another example, one or more ports on port card may be backed-up by separate ports on one or more port cards (e.g., port cards and ) such that each port is 1:1 or 1+1 redundant, one or more ports on port card may not be backed-up at all (i.e., not redundant) and two or more ports on may be backed-up by one port on another port card (e.g., port card ) such that those ports are 1:N redundant. Many redundancy structures are possible using the LID to PID Card table (LPCT)  () and LID to PID Port table (LPPT) as described above.","Each port card includes one or more ports for connecting to external network connections. One type of network connection is an optical fiber carrying an OC-48 SONET stream, and as described above, an OC-48 SONET stream may include connections to one or more end points using one or more paths. A SONET fiber carries a time division multiplexed (TDM) byte stream of aggregated time slots (TS). A time slot has a bandwidth of 51 Mbps and is the fundamental unit of bandwidth for SONET. An STS-1 path has one time slot within the byte stream dedicated to it, while an STS-3c path (i.e., three concatenated STS-1) has three time slots within the byte stream dedicated to it. The same or different protocols may be carried over different paths within the same TDM byte stream. In other words, ATM over SONET may be carried on an STS-1 path within a TDM byte stream that also includes IP over SONET on another STS-1 path or on an STS-3c path.","Through network management system  on workstation , after a user connects an external network connection to a port, the user may enable that port and one or more paths within that port (described below). Data received on a port card path is passed to the cross-connection card in the same quadrant as the port card, and the cross-connection card passes the path data to one of the five forwarding cards or eight port cards also within the same quadrant. The forwarding card determines whether the payload (e.g., packets, frames or cells) it is receiving includes user payload data or network control information. The forwarding card itself processes certain network control information and sends certain other network control information to the central processor over the Fast Ethernet control bus. The forwarding card also generates network control payloads and receives network control payloads from the central processor. The forwarding card sends any user data payloads from the cross-connection card or control information from itself or the central processor as path data to the switch fabric card. The switch fabric card then passes the path data to one of the forwarding cards in any quadrant, including the forwarding card that just sent the data to the switch fabric card. That forwarding card then sends the path data to the cross-connection card within its quadrant, which passes the path data to one of the port cards within its quadrant.","Referring to , in one embodiment, a universal port card includes one or more ports -connected to one or more transceivers -. The user may connect an external network connection to each port. As one example, port is connected to an ingress optical fiber carrying an OC-48 SONET stream and an egress optical fiber carrying an OC-48 SONET stream. Port passes optical data from the SONET stream on fiber to transceiver . Transceiver converts the optical data into electrical signals that it sends to a SONET framer . The SONET framer organizes the data it receives from the transceiver into SONET frames. SONET framer sends data over a telecommunications bus to a serializer-deserializer (SERDES) that serializes the data into four serial lines with twelve STS-1 time slots each and transmits the four serial lines to cross-connect card ","Each cross-connection card is a switch that provides connections between port cards and forwarding cards within its quadrant. Each cross-connection card is programmed to transfer each serial line on each port card within its quadrant to a forwarding card within its quadrant or to serial line on a port card, including the port card that transmitted the data to the cross-connection card. The programming of the cross-connect card is discussed in more detail below under Policy Based Provisioning.","Each forwarding card (e.g., forwarding card ) receives SONET frames over serial lines from the cross-connection card in its quadrant through a payload extractor chip (e.g., payload extractor ). In one embodiment, each forwarding card includes four payload extractor chips where each payload extractor chip represents a \u201cslice\u201d and each serial line input represents a forwarding card \u201cport\u201d. Each payload extractor chip receives four serial line inputs, and since each serial line includes twelve STS-1 time slots, the payload extractor chips combine and separate time slots where necessary to output data paths with the appropriate number of time slots. Each STS-1 time slot may represent a separate data path, or multiple STS-1 time slots may need to be combined to form a data path. For example, an STS-3c path requires the combination of three STS-1 time slots to form a data path while an STS-48c path requires the combination of all forty-eight STS-1 time slots. Each path represents a separate network connection, for example, an ATM cell stream.","The payload extractor chip also strips off all vestigial SONET frame information and transfers the data path to an ingress interface chip. The ingress interface chip will be specific to the protocol of the data within the path. As one example, the data may be formatted in accordance with the ATM protocol and the ingress interface chip is an ATM interface chip (e.g., ATM IF ). Other protocols can also be implemented including, for example, Internet Protocol (IP), Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) protocol or Frame Relay.","The ingress ATM IF chip performs many functions including determining connection information (e.g., virtual circuit or virtual path information) from the ATM header in the payload. The ATM IF chip uses the connection information as well as a forwarding table to perform an address translation from the external address to an internal address. The ATM IF chip passes ATM cells to an ingress bridge chip (e.g., BG -) which serves as an interface to an ingress traffic management chip or chip set (e.g., TM -).","The traffic management chips ensure that high priority traffic, for example, voice data, is passed to switch fabric card faster than lower priority traffic, for example, e-mail data. The traffic management chips may buffer lower priority traffic while higher priority traffic is transmitted, and in times of traffic congestion, the traffic management chips will ensure that low priority traffic is dropped prior to any high priority traffic. The traffic management chips also perform an address translation to add the address of the traffic management chip to which the data is going to be sent by the switch fabric card. The address corresponds to internal virtual circuits set up between forwarding cards by the software and available to the traffic management chips in tables.","The traffic management chips send the modified ATM cells to switch fabric interface chips (SFIF) -that then transfer the ATM cells to switch fabric card . The switch fabric card uses the address provided by the ingress traffic management chips to pass ATM cells to the appropriate egress traffic management chips (e.g., TM -) on the various forwarding cards. In one embodiment, the switch fabric card is a 320 Gbps, non-blocking fabric. Since each forwarding card serves as both an ingress and egress, the switching fabric card provides a high degree of flexibility in directing the data between any of the forwarding cards, including the forwarding card that sent the data to the switch fabric card.","When a forwarding card (e.g., forwarding card ) receives ATM cells from switch fabric card , the egress traffic management chips re-translate the address of each cell and pass the cells to egress bridge chips (e.g., BG -). The bridge chips pass the cells to egress ATM interface chips (e.g., ATM IF -), and the ATM interface chips add a re-translated address to the payload representing an ATM virtual circuit. The ATM interface chips then send the data to the payload extractor chips (e.g., payload extractor -) that separate, where necessary, the path data into STS-1 time slots and combine twelve STS-1 time slots into four serial lines and send the serial lines back through the cross-connection card to the appropriate port card.","The port card SERDES chips receive the serial lines from the cross-connection card and de-serialize the data and send it to SONET framer chips -. The Framers properly format the SONET overhead and send the data back through the transceivers that change the data from electrical to optical before sending it to the appropriate port and SONET fiber.","Although the port card ports above were described as connected to a SONET fiber carrying an OC-48 stream, other SONET fibers carrying other streams (e.g., OC-12) and other types of fibers and cables, for example, Ethernet, may be used instead. The transceivers are standard parts available from many companies, including Hewlett Packard Company and Sumitomo Corporation. The SONET framer may be a Spectra chip available from PMC-Sierra, Inc. in British Columbia. A Spectra 2488 has a maximum bandwidth of 2488 Mbps and may be coupled with a 1\u00d7OC48 transceiver coupled with a port connected to a SONET optical fiber carrying an OC-48 stream also having a maximum bandwidth of 2488 Mbps. Instead, four SONET optical fibers carrying OC-12 streams each having a maximum bandwidth of 622 Mbps may be connected to four 1\u00d7OC12 transceivers and coupled with one Spectra 2488. Alternatively, a Spectra 4\u00d7155 may be coupled with four OC-3 transceivers that are coupled with ports connected to four SONET fibers carrying OC-3 streams each having a maximum bandwidth of 155 Mbps. Many variables are possible.","The SERDES chip may be a Telecommunications Bus Serializer (TBS) chip from PMC-Sierra, and each cross-connection card may include a Time Switch Element (TSE) from PMC-Sierra, Inc. Similarly, the payload extractor chips may be MACH 48 chips and the ATM interface chips may be ATLAS chips both of which are available from PMC-Sierra. Several chips are available from Extreme Packet Devices (EPD), a subsidiary of PMC-Sierra, including PP3 bridge chips and Data Path Element (DPE) traffic management chips. The switch fabric interface chips may include a Switch Fabric Interface (SIF) chip also from EPD. Other switch fabric interface chips are available from Abrizio, also a subsidiary of PMC-Sierra, including a data slice chip and an enhanced port processor (EPP) chip. The switch fabric card may also include chips from Abrizio, including a cross-bar chip and a scheduler chip.","Although the port cards, cross-connection cards and forwarding cards have been shown as separate cards, this is by way of example only and they may be combined into one or more different cards.","Multiple Redundancy Schemes:","Coupling universal port cards to forwarding cards through a cross-connection card provides flexibility in data transmission by allowing data to be transmitted from any path on any port to any port on any forwarding card. In addition, decoupling the universal port cards and the forwarding cards enables redundancy schemes (e.g., 1:1, 1+1, 1:N, no redundancy) to be set up separately for the forwarding cards and universal port cards. The same redundancy scheme may be set up for both or they may be different. As described above, the LID to PID card and port tables are used to setup the various redundancy schemes for the line cards (forwarding or universal port cards) and ports. Network devices often implement industry standard redundancy schemes, such as those defined by the Automatic Protection Switching (APS) standard. In network device  (), an APS standard redundancy scheme may be implemented for the universal port cards while another redundancy scheme is implemented for the forwarding cards.","Referring again to , further data transmission flexibility may be provided by connecting (i.e., connections ) each cross-connection card -, -, -and -to each of the other cross-connection cards. Through connections , a cross-connection card (e.g., cross-connection card ) may transmit data between any port or any path on any port on a universal port card (e.g., universal port cards -) in its quadrant to a cross-connection card (e.g., cross-connection card ) in any other quadrant, and that cross-connection card (e.g., cross-connection card ) may transmit the data to any forwarding card (e.g., forwarding cards -) or universal port card (e.g., universal port cards -) in its quadrant. Similarly, any cross-connection card may transmit data received from any forwarding card in its quadrant to any other cross-connection card and that cross-connection card may transmit the data to any universal port card port in its quadrant.","Alternatively, the cross-connection cards in each quadrant may be coupled only with cross-connection cards in one other quadrant. For example, cross-connection cards in quadrants  and  may be connected and cross-connection cards in quadrants  and  may be connected. Similarly, the cross-connection cards in each quadrant may be coupled with cross-connection cards in only two other quadrants, or only the cross-connection cards in one quadrant (e.g., quadrant ) may be connected to cross-connection cards in another quadrant (e.g., quadrant ) while the cross-connection cards in the other quadrants (e.g., quadrants  and ) are not connected to other cross-connection cards or are connected only to cross-connection cards in one quadrant (e.g., quadrant ). Many variations are possible. Although these connections do not provide the flexibility of having all cross-connection cards inter-connected, these connections require less routing resources and still provide some increase in the data transmission flexibility of the network device.","The additional flexibility provided by inter-connecting one or more cross-connection cards may be used to optimize the efficiency of network device . For instance, a redundant forwarding card in one quadrant may be used as a backup for primary forwarding cards in other quadrants thereby reducing the number of backup modules and increasing the network device's service density. Similarly, a redundant universal port card or a redundant port on a universal port card in one quadrant may be used as a backup for primary universal port cards or ports in other quadrants. As previously mentioned, each primary forwarding card may support a different protocol (e.g., ATM, MPLS, IP, Frame Relay). Similarly, each universal port card may support a different protocol (e.g., SONET, Ethernet). A backup or spare forwarding card or universal port card must support the same protocol as the primary card or cards. If forwarding or universal port cards in one quadrant support multiple protocols and the cross-connection cards are not interconnected, then each quadrant may need multiple backup forwarding and universal port cards (i.e., one for each protocol supported). If each of the quadrants includes forwarding and universal port cards that support different protocols then each quadrant may include multiple backup forwarding and universal port cards further decreasing the network device's service density.","By inter-connecting the cross-connection cards, a forwarding card in one quadrant may serve as a backup for primary forwarding cards in its own quadrant and in other quadrants. Similarly, a universal port card or port in one quadrant may serve as a backup for a primary universal port card or port in its own quadrant and in other quadrants. For example, forwarding card in quadrant  that supports a particular protocol (e.g., the ATM protocol) may serve as the backup forwarding card for primary forwarding cards supporting ATM in its own quadrant (e.g., forwarding cards -) as well as for primary forwarding cards supporting ATM in quadrant  (e.g., forwarding cards -) or all quadrants (e.g., forwarding card in quadrant  and forwarding cards -in quadrant ). Similarly, forwarding card in quadrant  that supports a different protocol (e.g., the MPLS protocol) may serve as the backup forwarding card for primary forwarding cards supporting MPLS in its own quadrant (e.g., forwarding cards and ) as well as for primary forwarding cards supporting MPLS in quadrant  (e.g., forwarding card ) or all quadrants (e.g., forwarding card in quadrant  and forwarding card in quadrant ). Even with this flexibility, to provide sufficient redundancy, multiple backup modules supporting the same protocol may be used, especially where a large number of primary modules support one protocol.","As previously discussed, each port on a universal port card may be connected to an external network connection, for example, an optical fiber transmitting data according to the SONET protocol. Each external network connection may provide multiple streams or paths and each stream or path may include data being transmitted according to a different protocol over SONET. For example, one path may include data being transmitted according to ATM over SONET while another path may include data being transmitted according to MPLS over SONET. The cross-connection cards may be programmed (as described below) to transmit protocol specific data (e.g., ATM, MPLS, IP, Frame Relay) from ports on universal port cards within their quadrants to forwarding cards within any quadrant that support the specific protocol. Because the traffic management chips on the forwarding cards provide protocol-independent addresses to be used by switch fabric cards -, the switch fabric cards may transmit data between any of the forwarding cards regardless of the underlying protocol.","Alternatively, the network manager may dedicate each quadrant to a specific protocol by putting forwarding cards in each quadrant according to the protocol they support. Within each quadrant then, one forwarding card may be a backup card for each of the other forwarding cards (1:N, for network device , 1:4). Protocol specific data received from ports or paths on ports on universal port cards within any quadrant may then be forwarded by one or more cross-connection cards to forwarding cards within the protocol specific quadrant. For instance, quadrant  may include forwarding cards for processing data transmissions using the ATM protocol, quadrant  may include forwarding cards for processing data transmissions using the IP protocol, quadrant  may include forwarding cards for processing data transmissions using the MPLS protocol and quadrant  may be used for processing data transmissions using the Frame Relay protocol. ATM data received on a port path is then transmitted by one or more cross-connection cards to a forwarding card in quadrant , while MPLS data received on another path on that same port or on a path in another port is transmitted by one or more cross-connection cards to a forwarding card in quadrant .","Policy Based Provisioning:","Unlike the switch fabric card, the cross-connection card does not examine header information in a payload to determine where to send the data. Instead, the cross-connection card is programmed to transmit payloads, for example, SONET frames, between a particular serial line on a universal port card port and a particular serial line on a forwarding card port regardless of the information in the payload. As a result, one port card serial line and one forwarding card serial line will transmit data to each other through the cross-connection card until that programmed connection is changed.","In one embodiment, connections established through a path table and service endpoint table (SET) in a configuration database are passed to path managers on port cards and service endpoint managers (SEMs) on forwarding cards, respectively. The path managers and service endpoint managers then communicate with a cross-connect manager (CCM) on the cross-connection card in their quadrant to provide connection information. The CCM uses the connection information to generate a connection program table that is used by one or more components (e.g., a TSE chip ) to program internal connection paths through the cross-connection card.","Typically, connections are fixed or are generated according to a predetermined map with a fixed set of rules. Unfortunately, a fixed set of rules may not provide flexibility for future network device changes or the different needs of different users\/customers. Instead, within network device , each time a user wishes to enable\/configure a path on a port on a universal port card, a Policy Provisioning Manager (PPM)  () executing on central processor  selects the forwarding card port to which the port card port will be connected based on a configurable provisioning policy (PP)  in configuration database . The configurable provisioning policy may take into consideration many factors such as available system resources, balancing those resources and quality of service. Similar to other programs and files stored within the configuration database of computer system  described above, the provisioning policy may be modified while network device  is running to allow to policy to be changed according to a user's changing needs or changing network device system requirements.","When a user connects an external network connection to a particular port on a universal port card, the user notifies the NMS as to which port on which universal port card should be enabled, which path or paths should be enabled, and the number of time slots in each path. The user may also notify the NMS as to a new path and its number of time slots on an already enabled port that was not fully utilized or the user may notify the NMS of a modification to one or more paths on already enabled ports and the number of time slots required for that path or paths. With this information, the NMS fills in a Path table  () and partially fills in a Service Endpoint Table (SET) \u2032 ().","When a record in the path table is filled in, the configuration database sends an active query notification to a path manager (e.g., path manager ) executing on a universal port card (e.g., port card ) corresponding to the universal port card port LID (e.g., port , ) in the path table record (e.g., record ).","Leaving some fields in the SET blank or assigning a particular value (e.g., zero), causes the configuration database to send an active query notification to Policy Provisioning Manager (PPM) . The PPM then determines\u2014using provisioning policy \u2014which forwarding card (FC) port or ports to assign to the new path or paths. For example, the PPM may first compare the new path's requirements, including its protocol (e.g., ATM over SONET), the number of time slots, the number of virtual circuits and virtual circuit scheduling restrictions, to the available forwarding card resources in the quadrant containing the universal port card port and path. The PPM also takes other factors into consideration including quality of service, for example, redundancy requirements or dedicated resource requirements, and balancing resource usage (i.e., load balancing) evenly within a quadrant.","As an example, a user connects SONET optical fiber () to port on universal port card and wants to enable a path with three time slots (i.e., STS-3). The NMS assigns a path LID number (e.g., path LID ) and fills in a record (e.g., row ) in Path Table  to include path LID , a universal port card port LID (e.g., UP port LID ) previously assigned by the NMS and retrieved from the Logical to Physical Port Table, the first time slot (e.g., time slot ) in the SONET stream corresponding with the path and the total number of time slots\u2014in this example, 3\u2014in the path. Other information may also be filled into Path Table .","The NMS also partially fills in a record (e.g., row ) in SET \u2032 by filling in the quadrant number\u2014in this example, 1\u2014and the assigned path LID  and by assigning a service endpoint number . The SET table also includes other fields, for example, a forwarding card LID field , a forwarding card slice  (i.e., port) and a forwarding card serial line . In one embodiment, the NMS fills in these fields with a particular value (e.g., zero), and in another embodiment, the NMS leaves these fields blank.","In either case, the particular value or a blank field causes the configuration database to send an active query notice to the PPM indicating a new path LID, quadrant number and service endpoint number. It is up to the PPM to decide which forwarding card, slice (i.e., payload extractor chip) and time slot (i.e., port) to assign to the new universal port card path. Once decided, the PPM fills in the SET Table fields. Since the user and NMS do not completely fill in the SET record, this may be referred to as a \u201cself-completing configuration record.\u201d Self-completing configuration records reduce the administrative workload of provisioning a network.","The SET and path table records may be automatically copied to persistent storage  to insure that if network device  is re-booted these configuration records are maintained. If the network device shuts down prior to the PPM filling in the SET record fields and having those fields saved in persistent storage, when the network device is rebooted, the SET will still include blank fields or fields with particular values which will cause the configuration database to again send an active query to the PPM.","When the forwarding card LID (e.g., ) corresponding, for example, to forwarding card , is filled into the SET table, the configuration database sends an active query notification to an SEM (e.g., SEM ) executing on that forwarding card and corresponding to the assigned slice and\/or time slots. The active query notifies the SEM of the newly assigned service endpoint number (e.g., SE ) and the forwarding card slice (e.g., payload extractor ) and time slots (i.e., 3 time slots from one of the serial line inputs to payload extractor ) dedicated to the new path.","Path manager  and SEM both send connection information to a cross-connection manager  executing on cross-connection card \u2014the cross-connection card within their quadrant. The CCM uses the connection information to generate a connection program table  and uses this table to program internal connections through one or more components (e.g., a TSE chip ) on the cross-connection card. Once programmed, cross-connection card transmits data between new path LID  on SONET fiber connected to port on universal port card and the serial line input to payload extractor on forwarding card ","An active query notification is also sent to NMS database , and the NMS then displays the new system configuration to the user.","Alternatively, the user may choose which forwarding card to assign to the new path and notify the NMS. The NMS would then fill in the forwarding card LID in the SET, and the PPM would only determine which time slots and slice within the forwarding card to assign.","In the description above, when the PPM is notified of a new path, it compares the requirements of the new path to the available\/unused forwarding card resources. If the necessary resources are not available, the PPM may signal an error. Alternatively, the PPM could move existing forwarding card resources to make the necessary forwarding card resources available for the new path. For example, if no payload extractor chip is completely available in the entire quadrant, one path requiring only one time slot is assigned to payload extractor chip and a new path requires forty-eight time slots, the one path assigned to payload extractor chip may be moved to another payload extractor chip, for example, payload extractor chip that has at least one time slot available and the new path may be assigned all of the time slots on payload extractor chip . Moving the existing path is accomplished by having the PPM modify an existing SET record. The new path is configured as described above.","Moving existing paths may result in some service disruption. To avoid this, the provisioning policy may include certain guidelines to hypothesize about future growth. For example, the policy may require small paths\u2014for example, three or less time slots\u2014to be assigned to payload extractor chips that already have some paths assigned instead of to completely unassigned payload extractor chips to provide a higher likelihood that forwarding card resources will be available for large paths\u2014for example, sixteen or more time slots\u2014added in the future.","Multi-Layer Network Device in One Telco Rack:","Referring again to , in one embodiment, each universal port card includes four ports, each of which is capable of being connected to an OC-48 SONET fiber. Since an OC-48 SONET fiber is capable of transferring data at 2.5 Giga bits per second (Gbps), each universal port card is capable of transferring data at 10 Gbps (4\u00d72.5=10).","With eight port cards per quadrant, the cross-connection card must be capable of transferring data at 80 Gbps. Typically, however, the eight port cards will be 1:1 redundant and only transfer 40 Gbps. In one embodiment, each forwarding card is capable of transferring 10 Gbps, and with five forwarding cards per quadrant, the switch fabric cards must be capable of transferring data at 200 Gbps. Typically, however, the five forwarding cards will be 1:N redundant and only transfer data at 40 Gbps. With four quadrants and full redundancy (1:1 for port cards and 1:N for forwarding cards), network device  is capable of transferring data at 160 Gbps.","In other embodiments, each port card includes one port capable of being connected to an OC-192 SONET fiber. Since OC-192 SONET fibers are capable of transferring data at 10 Gbps, a fully redundant network device  is again capable of transferring 160 Gbps. In the embodiment employing one OC-192 connection per port card, each port card may include one hundred and ninety-two logical DS3 connections using sub-rate data multiplexing (SDRM). In addition, each port card may differ in its number and type of ports to provide more or less data through put. As previously mentioned, ports other than SONET ports may be provided, for example, Ethernet ports, Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy ports (i.e., DS0, DS1, DS3, E0, E1, E3, J0, J1, J3) and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) ports (i.e., STM1, STM4, STM16, STM64).","The universal port cards and cross-connect cards in each quadrant are in effect a physical layer switch, and the forwarding cards and switch fabric cards are effectively an upper layer switch. Prior systems have packaged these two switches into separate network devices. One reason for this is the large number of signals that need to be routed. Taken separately, each cross-connect card -, -, -and -is essentially a switch fabric or mesh allowing switching between any path on any universal port card to any serial input line on any forwarding card in its quadrant and each switch fabric card -allows switching between any paths on any forwarding cards. Approximately six thousand, seven hundred and twenty etches are required to support a 200 Gbps switch fabric, and about eight hundred and thirty-two etches are required to support an 80 Gbps cross-connect. Combining such high capacity multi-layer switches into one network device in a single telco rack (seven feet by nineteen inches by 24 inches) has not been thought possible by those skilled in the art of telecommunications network devices.","To fit network device  into a single telco rack, dual mid-planes are used. All of the functional printed circuit boards connect to at least one of the mid-planes, and the switch fabric cards and certain control cards connect to both mid-planes thereby providing connections between the two mid-planes. In addition, to efficiently utilize routing resources, instead of providing a single cross-connection card, the cross-connection functionality is separated into four cross-connection cards\u2014one for each quadrant\u2014(as shown in ). Further, routing through the lower mid-plane is improved by flipping the forwarding cards and cross-connection cards in the bottom half of the front of the chassis upside down to be the mirror image of the forwarding cards and cross-connection cards in the top of the front half of the chassis.","Referring to , a network device  is packaged in a box  conforming to the telco standard rack of seven feet in height, nineteen inches in width and  inches in depth. Referring also to -, a chassis  within box  provides support for forwarding cards -, -, -and -, universal port cards -, -, -and -, and cross-connection cards -, -, -and -. As is typical of telco network devices, the forwarding cards (FC) are located in the front portion of the chassis where network administrators may easily add and remove these cards from the box, and the universal port cards (UP) are located in the back portion of the chassis where external network attachments\/cables may be easily connected.","The chassis also supports switch fabric cards and . As shown, each switch fabric card may include multiple switch fabric (SF) cards and a switch scheduler (SS) card. In addition, the chassis supports multiple central processor cards ( and , ). Instead of having a single central processor card, the external control functions and the internal control functions may be separated onto different cards as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/574,343, filed May 20, 2000 and entitled \u201cFunctional Separation of Internal and External Controls in Network Devices\u201d, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. As shown, the chassis may support internal control (IC) processor cards and and external control (EC) processor cards and . Auxiliary processor (AP) cards and are provided for future expansion to allow more external control cards to be added, for example, to handle new upper layer protocols. In addition, a management interface (MI) card  for connecting to an external network management system (, ) is also provided.","The chassis also support two mid-plane printed circuit boards and () located toward the middle of chassis . Mid-plane is located in the top portion of chassis  and is connected to quadrant  and  forwarding cards -and -, universal port cards -and -, and cross-connection cards -and -. Similarly, mid-plane is located in the bottom portion of chassis  and is connected to quadrant  and  forwarding cards -and -, universal port cards -and -, and cross-connection cards -and -. Through each mid-plane, the cross-connection card in each quadrant may transfer network packets between any of the universal port cards in its quadrant and any of the forwarding cards in its quadrant. In addition, through mid-plane the cross-connection cards in quadrants  and  may be connected to allow for transfer of network packets between any forwarding cards and port cards in quadrants  and , and through mid-plane the cross-connection cards in quadrants  and  may be connected to allow for transfer of network packets between any forwarding cards and port cards in quadrants  and .","Mid-plane is also connected to external control processor cards and and management interface card . Mid-plane is also connected to auxiliary processor cards and ","Switch fabric cards and are located in the back portion of chassis , approximately mid-way between the top and bottom of the chassis. The switch fabric cards are connected to both mid-planes and to allow the switch fabric cards to transfer signals between any of the forwarding cards in any quadrant. In addition, the cross-connection cards in quadrants  and  may be connected through the mid-planes and switch fabric cards to the cross-connection cards in quadrants  and  to enable network packets to be transferred between any universal port card and any forwarding card.","To provide for better routing efficiency through mid-plane , forwarding cards -and -and cross-connection cards -and -in quadrants  and , located in the bottom portion of the chassis, are flipped over when plugged into mid-plane . This permits the switch fabric interface -on each of the lower forwarding cards to be oriented nearest the switch fabric cards and the cross-connection interface -on each of the lower forwarding cards to be oriented nearest the cross-connection cards in quadrants  and . This orientation avoids having to cross switch fabric and cross-connection etches in mid-plane ","Typically, airflow for cooling a network device is brought in at the bottom of the device and released at the top of the device. For example, in the back portion of chassis , a fan tray (FT)  pulls air into the device from the bottom portion of the device and a fan tray  blows air out of the top portion of the device. When the lower forwarding cards are flipped over, the airflow\/cooling pattern is reversed. To accommodate this reversal, fan trays  and  pull air into the middle portion of the device and then fan trays  and  pull the air upwards and downwards, respectively, and blow the heated air out the top and bottom of the device, respectively.","The quadrant  and  universal port cards -and -may also be flipped over to orient the port card's cross-connection interface nearest the cross-connection cards and more efficiently use the routing resources. It is preferred, however, not to flip the universal port cards for serviceability reasons and airflow issues. The network managers at the telco site expect network attachments\/cables to be in a certain pattern. Reversing this pattern could cause confusion in a large telco site with many different types of network devices. Also, flipping the port cards will change the airflow and cooling pattern and require a similar airflow pattern and fan tray configuration as implemented in the front of the chassis. However, with the switch fabric and internal control processor cards in the middle of the back portion of the chassis, it may be impossible to implement this fan tray configuration.","Referring to , mid-plane includes connectors  mounted on the back side of the mid-plane (\u201cback mounted\u201d) for the management interface card, connectors -mounted on the front side of the mid-plane (\u201cfront mounted\u201d) for the quadrant  and  cross-connection cards, and front mounted connectors -for the external control processor cards. Multiple connectors may be used for each card. Mid-plane also includes back mounted connectors -for the quadrant  and  universal port cards and front mounted connectors -for the quadrant  and  forwarding cards.","Both mid-planes and include back mounted connectors -for the switch fabric cards and back mounted connectors -for the internal control cards. Mid-plane further includes front, reverse mounted connectors -for the quadrant  and  forwarding cards and back mounted connectors -for the quadrant  and  universal port cards. In addition, mid-plane also includes front, reverse mounted connectors -for the quadrant  and  cross-connection cards and front mounted connectors -for the auxiliary processor cards.","Combining both physical layer switch\/router subsystems and upper layer switch\/router subsystems in one network device allows for intelligent layer  switching. For example, the network device may be used to establish dynamic network connections on the layer  network to better utilize resources as service subscriptions change. In addition, network management is greatly simplified since the layer  and multiple upper layer networks may be managed by the same network management system and grooming fees are eliminated. Combining the physical layer switch\/router and upper layer switch\/routers into a network device that fits into one telco rack provides a less expensive network device and saves valuable telco site space.","Splitting the cross-connection function into four separate cards\/quadrants enables the cross-connection routing requirements to be spread between the two mid-planes and alleviates the need to route cross-connection signals through the center of the device where the switch fabric is routed. In addition, segmenting the cross-connection function into multiple, independent subsystems allows customers\/network managers to add functionality to network device  in pieces and in accordance with network service subscriptions. When a network device is first installed, a network manager may need only a few port cards and forwarding cards to service network customers. The modularity of network device  allows the network manager to purchase and install only one cross-connection card and the required number of port and forwarding cards. As the network becomes more subscribed, the network manager may add forwarding cards and port cards and eventually additional cross-connection cards. Since network devices are often very expensive, this modularity allows network managers to spread the cost of the system out in accordance with new service requests. The fees paid by customers to the network manager for the new services can then be applied to the cost of the new cards.","Although the embodiment describes the use of two mid-planes, it should be understood that more than two mid-planes may be used. Similarly, although the embodiment described flipped\/reversed the forwarding cards and cross-connection cards in the lower half of the chassis, alternatively, the forwarding cards and cross-connection cards in the upper half of the chassis could be flipped.","Distributed Switch Fabric:","A network device having a distributed switch fabric locates a portion of the switch fabric functionality on cards separate from the remaining\/central switch fabric functionality. For example, a portion of the switch fabric may be distributed on each forwarding card. There are a number of difficulties associated with distributing a portion of the switch fabric. For instance, distributing the switch fabric makes mid-plane\/back-plane routing more difficult which further increases the difficulty of fitting the network device into one telco rack, switch fabric redundancy and timing are also made more difficult, valuable forwarding card space must be allocated for switch fabric components and the cost of each forwarding card is increased. However, since the entire switch fabric need not be included in a minimally configured network device, the cost of the minimal configuration is reduced allowing network service providers to more quickly recover the initial cost of the device. As new services are requested, additional functionality, including both forwarding cards (with additional switch fabric functionality) and universal port cards may be added to the network device to handle the new requests, and the fees for the new services may be applied to the cost of the additional functionality. Consequently, the cost of the network device more closely tracks the service fees received by network providers.","Referring again to , as described above, each forwarding card (e.g., ) includes traffic management chips (e.g., -and -) that ensure high priority network data\/traffic (e.g., voice) is transferred faster than lower priority traffic (e.g., e-mail). Each forwarding card also includes switch fabric interface (SFIF) chips (e.g., -) that transfer network data between the traffic management chips and the switch fabric cards -","Referring also to , forwarding card includes traffic management (TM) chips and and SFIF chips , and forwarding card includes traffic management chips and and SFIF chips . ( includes only two forwarding cards for convenience but it is to be understood that many forwarding cards may be included in a network device as shown in .) SFIF chips  and  on both boards include a switch fabric interface (SIF) chip , data slice chips -, an enhanced port processor (EPP) chip  and a local timing subsystem (LTS) . The SFIF chips receive data from ingress TM chips and and forward it to the switch fabric cards -(). Similarly, the SFIF chips receive data from the switch fabric cards and forward it to the egress TM chips and ","Due to the size and complexity of the switch fabric, each switch fabric card -may include multiple separate cards. In one embodiment, each switch fabric card -includes a control card  and four data cards -. A scheduler chip  on control card  works with the EPP chips on each of the forwarding cards to transfer network data between the data slice chips on the forwarding cards through cross-bar chips -(only chips -are shown) on data cards -. Each of the data slice chips on each of the forwarding cards is connected to two of the cross-bar chips on the data cards. Switch fabric control card  and each of the switch fabric data cards -also include a switch fabric local timing subsystem (LTS) , and a switch fabric central timing subsystem (CTS)  on control card  provides a start of segment (SOS) reference signal to each LTS  on each of the forwarding cards and switch fabric cards.","The traffic management chips perform upper level network traffic management within the network device while scheduler chip  on control card  performs the lower level data transfer between forwarding cards. The traffic management chips determine the priority of received network data and then forward the highest priority data to SIF chips . The traffic management chips include large buffers to store lower priority data until higher priority data has been transferred. The traffic management chips also store data in these buffers when the local EPP chip indicates that data transfers are to be stopped (i.e., back pressure). The scheduler chip works with the EPP chips to stop or hold-off data transfers when necessary, for example, when buffers on one forwarding card are close to full, the local EPP chip sends notice to each of the other EPP chips and the scheduler to hold off sending more data. Back pressure may be applied to all forwarding cards when a new switch fabric control card is added to the network device, as described below.","The traffic management chips forward network data in predefined segments to the SIF chips. In the case of ATM data, each ATM cell is a segment. In the case of IP and MPLS, where the amount of network data in each packet may vary, the data is first arranged into appropriately sized segments before being sent to the SIF chips. This may be accomplished through segmentation and reassembly (SAR) chips (not shown).","When the SIF chip receives a segment of network data, it organizes the data into a segment consistent with that expected by the switch fabric components, including any required header information. The SIF chip may be a PMC9324-TC chip available from Extreme Packet Devices (EPD), a subsidiary of PMC-Sierra, and the data slice chips may be PM9313-HC chips and the EPP chip may be a PM9315-HC chip available from Abrizio, also a subsidiary of PMC-Sierra. In this case, the SIF chip organizes each segment of data\u2014including header information\u2014in accordance with a line-card-to-switch two (LCS-2) protocol. The SIF chip then divides each data segment into twelve slices and sends two slices to each data slice chip -. Two slices are sent because each data slice chip includes the functionality of two data slices.","When the data slice chips receive the LCS segments, the data slice chips strip off the header information, including both a destination address and quality of service (QoS) information, and send the header information to the local EPP chip. Alternatively, the SIF chip may send the header information directly to the EPP chip and send only data to the data slice chips. However, the manufacturer teaches that the SIF chip should be on the forwarding card and the EPP and data slice chips should be on a separate switch fabric card within the network device or in a separate box connected to the network device. Minimizing connections between cards is important, and where the EPP and data slice chips are not on the same card as the SIF chips, the header information is sent with the data by the SIF chip to reduce the required inter-card connections, and the data slice chips then strip off this information and send it to the EPP chip.","The EPP chips on all of the forwarding cards communicate and synchronize through cross-bar chips -on control card . For each time interval (e.g., every 40 nanoseconds, \u201cns\u201d), the EPP chips inform the scheduler chip as to which data segment they would like to send and the data slice chips send a segment of data previously set up by the scheduler and EPP chips. The EPP chips and the scheduler use the destination addresses to determine if there are any conflicts, for example, to determine if two or more forwarding cards are trying to send data to the same forwarding card. If a conflict is found, then the quality of service information is used to determine which forwarding card is trying to send the higher priority data. The highest priority data will likely be sent first. However, the scheduler chips include an algorithm that takes into account both the quality of service and a need to keep the switch fabric data cards -full (maximum data through put). Where a conflict exists, the scheduler chip may inform the EPP chip to send a different, for example, lower priority, data segment from the data slice chip buffers or to send an empty data segment during the time interval.","Scheduler chip  informs each of the EPP chips which data segment is to be sent and received in each time interval. The EPP chips then inform their local data slice chips as to which data segments are to be sent in each interval and which data segments will be received in each interval. As previously mentioned, the forwarding cards each send and receive data. The data slice chips include small buffers to hold certain data (e.g., lower priority) while other data (e.g., higher priority) data is sent and small buffers to store received data. The data slice chips also include header information with each segment of data sent to the switch fabric cards. The header information is used by cross-bar chips -(only cross-bar chips -are shown) to switch the data to the correct forwarding card. The cross-bar chips may be PM9312-UC chips and the scheduler chip may be a PM9311-UC chip both of which are available from Abrizio.","Specifications for the EPD, Abrizio and PMC-Sierra chips may be found at www.pmc-sierra.com and are hereby incorporated herein by reference.","Distributed Switch Fabric Timing:","As previously mentioned, a segment of data (e.g., an ATM cell) is transferred between the data slice chips through the cross-bar chips every predetermined time interval. In one embodiment, this time interval is 40 ns and is established by a 25 MHz start of segment (SOS) signal. A higher frequency clock (e.g., 200 MHz, having a 5 ns time interval) is used by the data slice and cross-bar chips to transfer the bits of data within each segment such that all the bits of data in a segment are transferred within one 40 ns interval. More specifically, in one embodiment, each switch fabric component multiplies the 200 MHz clock signal by four to provide an 800 MHz internal clock signal allowing data to be transferred through the data slice and cross-bar components at 320 Gbps. As a result, every 40 ns one segment of data (e.g., an ATM cell) is transferred. It is crucial that the EPP, scheduler, data slice and cross-bar chips transfer data according to the same\/synchronized timing signals (e.g., clock and SOS), including both frequency and phase. Transferring data at different times, even slightly different times, may lead to data corruption, the wrong data being sent and\/or a network device crash.","When distributed signals (e.g., reference SOS or clock signals) are used to synchronize actions across multiple components (e.g., the transmission of data through a switch fabric), any time-difference in events (e.g., clock pulse) on the distributed signals is generally termed \u201cskew\u201d. Skew between distributed signals may result in the actions not occurring at the same time, and in the case of transmission of data through a switch fabric, skew can cause data corruption and other errors. Many variables can introduce skew into these signals. For example, components used to distribute the clock signal introduce skew, and etches on the mid-plane(s) introduce skew in proportion to the differences in their length (e.g., about 180 picoseconds per inch of etch in FR 4 printed circuit board material).","To minimize skew, one manufacturer teaches that all switch fabric components (i.e., scheduler, EPP, data slice and cross-bar chips) should be located on centralized switch fabric cards. That manufacturer also suggests distributing a central clock reference signal (e.g., 200 MHz) and a separate SOS signal (e.g., 25 MHz) to the switch fabric components on the switch fabric cards. Such a timing distribution scheme is difficult but possible where all the components are on one switch fabric card or on a limited number of switch fabric cards that are located near each other within the network device or in a separate box connected to the network device. Locating the boards near each other within the network device or in a separate box allows etch lengths on the mid-plane for the reference timing signals to be more easily matched and, thus, introduce less skew.","When the switch fabric components are distributed, maintaining a very tight skew becomes difficult due to the long lengths of etches required to reach some of the distributed cards and the routing difficulties that arise in trying to match the lengths of all the etches across the mid-plane(s). Because the clock signal needs to be distributed not only to the five switch fabric cards but also the forwarding cards (e.g., twenty), it becomes a significant routing problem to distribute all clocks to all loads with a fixed etch length.","Since timing is so critical to network device operation, typical network devices include redundant central timing subsystems. Certainly, the additional reference timing signals from a redundant central timing subsystem to each of the forwarding cards and switch fabric cards create further routing difficulties. In addition, if the two central timing subsystems (i.e., sources) are not synchronous with matched distribution etches, then all of the loads (i.e., LTSs) must use the same reference clock source to avoid introducing clock skew\u2014that is, unless both sources are synchronous and have matched distribution networks, the reference timing signals from both sources are likely to be skewed with respect to each other and, thus, all loads must use the same source\/reference timing signal or be skewed with respect to each other.","A redundant, distributed switch fabric greatly increases the number of reference timing signals that must be routed over the mid-planes and yet remain accurately synchronized. In addition, since the timing signals must be sent to each card having a distributed switch fabric, the distance between the cards may vary greatly and, thus, make matching the lengths of timing signal etches on the mid-planes difficult. Further, the lengths of the etches for the reference timing signals from both the primary and redundant central timing subsystems must be matched. Compounding this with a fast clock signal and low skew component requirements makes distributing the timing very difficult.","The network device of the present invention, though difficult, includes two synchronized central timing subsystems (CTS)  (one is shown in ). The etch lengths of reference timing signals from both central timing subsystems are matched to within, for example, +\/\u221250 mils, and both central timing subsystems distribute only reference start of segment (SOS) signals to a local timing subsystem (LTS)  on each forwarding card and switch fabric card. The LTSs use the SOS reference signals to generate both an SOS signal and a higher frequency clock signal. This adds components and complexity to the LTSs, however, distributing only the SOS reference signals and not both the SOS and clock reference signals significantly reduces the number of reference timing signals that must be routed across the mid-plane on matched etch lengths.","Both electromagnetic radiation and electro-physical limitations prevent the 200 MHz reference clock signal from being widely distributed as required in a network device implementing distributed switch fabric subsystems. Such a fast reference clock increases the overall noise level generated by the network device and wide distribution may cause the network device to exceed Electro-Magnetic Interference (EMI) limitations. Clock errors are often measured as a percentage of the clock period, the smaller the clock period (5 ns for a 200 MHz clock), the larger the percentage of error a small skew can cause. For example, a skew of 3 ns represents a 60% error for a 5 ns clock period but only a 7.5% error for a 40 ns clock period. Higher frequency clock signals (e.g., 200 MHz) are susceptible to noise error and clock skew. The SOS signal has a larger clock period than the reference clock signal (40 ns versus 5 ns ) and, thus, is less susceptible to noise error and reduces the percentage of error resulting from clock skew.","As previously mentioned, the network device may include redundant switch fabric cards and () and as described above with reference to , each switch fabric card and may include a control card and four or more data cards. Referring to , network device  may include switch fabric control card  (part of central switch fabric ) and redundant switch fabric control card  (part of redundant switch fabric ). Each control card  and  includes a central timing subsystem (CTS) . One CTS behaves as the master and the other CTS behaves as a slave and locks its output SOS signal to the master's output SOS signal. In one embodiment, upon power-up or system re-boot the CTS on the primary switch fabric control card  begins as the master and if a problem occurs with the CTS on the primary control card, then the CTS on redundant control card  takes over as master without requiring a switch over of the primary switch fabric control card.","Still referring to , each CTS sends a reference SOS signal to the LTSs on each forwarding card, switch fabric data cards -and redundant switch fabric data cards -. In addition, each CTS sends a reference SOS signal to the LTS on its own switch fabric control card and the LTS on the other switch fabric control card. As described in more detail below, each LTS then selects which reference SOS signal to use. Each CTS  also sends a reference SOS signal to the CTS on the other control card. The master CTS ignores the reference SOS signal from the slave CTS but the slave CTS locks its reference SOS signal to the reference SOS signal from the master, as described below. Locking the slave SOS signal to the master SOS signal synchronizes the slave signal to the master signal such that in the event that the master CTS fails and the LTSs switchover to the slave CTS reference SOS signal and the slave CTS becomes the master CTS, minimal phase change and no signal disruption is encountered between the master and slave reference SOS signals received by the LTSs.","Each of the CTS reference SOS signals sent to the LTSs and the other CTS over mid-plane etches are the same length (i.e., matched) to avoid introducing skew. The CTS may be on its own independent card or any other card in the system. Even when it is located on a switch fabric card, such as the control card, that has an LTS, the reference SOS signal is routed through the mid-plane with the same length etch as the other reference SOS signals to avoid adding skew.","Central Timing Subsystem (CTS):","Referring to , central timing subsystem (CTS)  includes a voltage controlled crystal oscillator (VCXO)  that generates a 25 MHz reference SOS signal . The SOS signal must be distributed to each of the local timing subsystems (LTSs) and is, thus, sent to a first level clock driver  and then to second level clock drivers -that output reference SOS signals SFC_BENCH_FB and SFC_REF1-SFC_REFn. SFC_BENCH_FB is a local feedback signal returned to the input of the CTS. One of SFC_REF1-SFC_REFn is sent to each LTS, the other CTS, which receives it on SFC_SYNC, and one is routed over a mid-plane and returned as a feedback signal SFC_FB to the input of the CTS that generated it. Additional levels of clock drivers may be added as the number of necessary reference SOS signals increases.","VCXO  may be a VF596ES50 25 MHz LVPECL available from Conner-Winfield. Positive Emitter Coupled Logic (PECL) is preferred over Transistor-Transistor Logic (TTL) for its lower skew properties. In addition, though it requires two etches to transfer a single clock reference\u2014significantly increasing routing resources\u2014, differential PECL is preferred over PECL for its lower skew properties and high noise immunity. The clock drivers are also differential PECL and may be one to ten (1:10) MC100 LVEP111 clock drivers available from On Semiconductor. A test header  may be connected to clock driver  to allow a test clock to be input into the system.","Hardware control logic  determines (as described below) whether the CTS is the master or slave, and hardware control logic  is connected to a multiplexor (MUX)  to select between a predetermined voltage input (i.e., master voltage input) and a slave VCXO voltage input . When the CTS is the master, hardware control logic  selects predetermined voltage input from discrete bias circuit  and slave VCXO voltage input is ignored. The predetermined voltage input causes VCXO  to generate a constant 25 MHz SOS signal; that is, the VCXO operates as a simple oscillator.","Hardware control logic may be implemented in a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or a programmable logic device (PLD). MUX  may be a 74CBTLV3257 FET 2:1 MUX available from Texas Instruments.","When the CTS is the slave, hardware control logic  selects slave VCXO voltage signal . This provides a variable voltage level to the VCXO that causes the output of the VCXO to track or follow the SOS reference signal from the master CTS. Referring still to , the CTS receives the SOS reference signal from the other CTS on SFC_SYNC. Since this is a differential PECL signal, it is first passed through a differential PECL to TTL translator  before being sent to MUX within dual MUX . In addition, two feedback signals from the CTS itself are supplied as inputs to the CTS. The first feedback signal SFC_FB is an output signal (e.g., one of SFC_REF1-SFC_REFn) from the CTS itself which has been sent out to the mid-plane and routed back to the switch fabric control card. This is done so that the feedback signal used by the CTS experiences identical conditions as the reference SOS signal delivered to the LTSs and skew is minimized. The second feedback signal SFC_BENCH_FB is a local signal from the output of the CTS, for example, clock driver . SFC_BENCH_FB may be used as the feedback signal in a test mode, for example, when the control card is not plugged into the network device chassis and SFC_SB is unavailable. SFC_BENCH_FB and SFC_FB are also differential PECL signals and must be sent through translators  and , respectively, prior to being sent to MUX within dual MUX . Hardware control logic  selects which inputs are used by MUX  by asserting signals on REF_SEL(1:0) and FB_SEL(1:0). In regular use, inputs and from translator  are selected. In test modes, grounded inputs , test headers or local feedback signal  from translator  may be selected. Also in regular use (and in test modes where a clock signal is not inserted through the test headers), copies of the selected input signals are provided on the test headers.","The reference output and the feedback output are then sent from the MUX to phase detector circuit . The phase detector compares the rising edge of the two input signals to determine the magnitude of any phase shift between the two. The phase detector then generates variable voltage pulses on outputs and representing the magnitude of the phase shift. The phase detector outputs are used by discrete logic circuit  to generate a voltage on a slave VCXO voltage signal representing the magnitude of the phase shift. The voltage is used to speed up or slow down (i.e., change the phase of) the VCXO's output SOS signal to allow the output SOS signal to track any phase change in the reference SOS signal from the other CTS (i.e., SFC_SYNC). The discrete logic components implement filters that determine how quickly or slowly the VCXO's output will track the change in phase detected on the reference signal. The combination of the dual MUX, phase detector, discrete logic, VCXO, clock drivers and feedback signal forms a phase locked loop (PLL) circuit allowing the slave CTS to synchronize its reference SOS signal to the master CTS reference SOS signal. MUX  and discrete bias circuit  are not found in phase locked loop circuits.","The phase detector circuit may be implemented in a programmable logic device (PLD), for example a MACH4LV-32 available from Lattice\/Vantis Semiconductor. Dual MUX  may be implemented in the same PLD. Preferably, however, dual MUX  is an SN74CBTLV3253 available from Texas Instruments, which has better skew properties than the PLD. The differential PECL to TTL translators may be MC100EPT23 dual differential PECL\/TTL translators available from On Semiconductor.","Since quick, large phase shifts in the reference signal are likely to be the results of failures, the discrete logic implements a filter, and for any detected phase shift, only small incremental changes over time are made to the voltage provided on slave VCXO control signal . As one example, if the reference signal from the master CTS dies, the slave VCXO control signal only changes phase slowly over time meaning that the VCXO will continue to provide a reference SOS signal. If the reference signal from the master CTS is suddenly returned, the slave VCXO control signal again only changes phase slowly over time to cause the VCXO signal to re-synchronize with the reference signal from the master CTS. This is a significant improvement over distributing a clock signal directly to components that use the signal because, in the case of direct clock distribution, if one clock signal dies (e.g., broken wire), then the components connected to that signal stop functioning causing the entire switch fabric to fail.","Slow phase changes on the reference SOS signals from both the master and slave CTSs are also important when LTSs switch over from using the master CTS reference signal to using the slave CTS reference signal. For example, if the reference SOS signal from the master CTS dies or other problems are detected (e.g., a clock driver dies), then the slave CTS switches over to become the master CTS and each of the LTSs begin using the slave CTS\u2032 reference SOS signal. For these reasons, it is important that the slave CTS reference SOS signal be synchronized to the master reference signal but not quickly follow large phase shifts in the master reference signal.","It is not necessary for every LTS to use the reference SOS signals from the same CTS. In fact, some LTSs may use reference SOS signals from the master CTS while one or more are using the reference SOS signals from the slave CTS. In general, this is a transitional state prior to or during switch over. For example, one or more LTSs may start using the slave CTS's reference SOS signal prior to the slave CTS switching over to become the master CTS.","It is important for both the CTSs and the LTSs to monitor the activity of the reference SOS signals from both CTSs such that if there is a problem with one, the LTSs can begin using the other SOS signal immediately and\/or the slave CTS can quickly become master. Reference output signal \u2014the translated reference SOS signal sent from the other CTS and received on SFC_SYNC\u2014is sent to an activity detector circuit . The activity detector circuit determines whether the signal is active\u2014that is, whether the signal is \u201cstuck at\u201d logic 1 or logic 0. If the signal is not active (i.e., stuck at logic 1 or 0), the activity detector sends a signal to hardware control logic  indicating that the signal died. The hardware control logic may immediately select input to MUX  to change the CTS from slave to master. The hardware control logic also sends an interrupt to a local processor  and software being executed by the processor detects the interrupt. Hardware control allows the CTS switch over to happen very quickly before a bad clock signal can disrupt the system.","Similarly, an activity detector  monitors the output of the first level clock driver  regardless of whether the CTS is master or slave. Instead, the output of one the second level clock drivers could be monitored, however, a failure of a different second level clock will not be detected. SFC_REF_ACTIVITY is sent from the first level clock driver to differential PECL to TTL translator  and then as FABRIC_REF_ACTIVITY to activity detector . If activity detector  determines that the signal is not active, which may indicate that the clock driver, oscillator or other component(s) within the CTS have failed, then it sends a signal to the hardware control logic. The hardware control logic asserts KILL_CLKTREE to stop the clock drivers from sending any signals and notifies a processor chip  on the switch fabric control card through an interrupt. Software being executed by the processor chip detects the interrupt. The slave CTS activity detector  detects a dead signal from the master CTS either before or after the hardware control logic sends KILL_CLKTREE and asserts error signal to cause the hardware control logic to change the input selection on MUX  from to to become the master CTS. As described below, the LTSs also detect a dead signal from the master CTS either before or after the hardware control logic sends KILL_CLKTREE and switch over to the reference SOS signal from the slave CTS either before or after the slave CTS switches over to become the master.","As previously mentioned, in the past, a separate, common clock selection signal or etch was sent to each card in the network device to indicate whether to use the master or slave clock reference signal. This approach required significant routing resources, was under software control and resulted in every load selecting the same source at any given time. Hence, if a clock signal problem was detected, components had to wait for the software to change the separate clock selection signal before beginning to use the standby clock signal and all components (i.e., loads) were always locked to the same source. This delay can cause data corruption errors, switch fabric failure and a network device crash.","Forcing a constant logic one or zero (i.e., \u201ckilling\u201d) clock signals from a failed source and having hardware in each LTS and CTS detect inactive (i.e., \u201cdead\u201d or stuck at logic one or zero) signals allows the hardware to quickly begin using the standby clock without the need for software intervention. In addition, if only one clock driver (e.g., ) dies in the master CTS, LTSs receiving output signals from that clock driver may immediately begin using signals from the slave CTS clock driver while the other LTSs continue to use the master CTS. Interrupts to the processor from each of the LTSs connected to the failed master CTS clock driver allow software, specifically the SRM, to detect the failure and initiate a switch over of the slave CTS to the master CTS. The software may also override the hardware control and force the LTSs to use the slave or master reference SOS signal.","When the slave CTS switches over to become the master CTS, the remaining switch fabric control card functionality (e.g., scheduler and cross-bar components) continue operating. The SRM (described above) decides\u2014based on a failure policy\u2014whether to switch over from the primary switch fabric control card to the secondary switch fabric control card. There may be instances where the CTS on the secondary switch fabric control card operates as the master CTS for a period of time before the network device switches over from the primary to the secondary switch fabric control card, or instead, there may be instances where the CTS on the secondary switch fabric control card operates as the master CTS for a period of time and then the software directs the hardware control logic on both switch fabric control cards to switch back such that the CTS on the primary switch fabric control card is again master. Many variations are possible since the CTS is independent of the remaining functionality on the switch fabric control card.","Phase detector  also includes an out of lock detector that determines whether the magnitude of change between the reference signal and the feedback signal is larger than a predetermined threshold. When the CTS is the slave, this circuit detects errors that may not be detected by activity detector  such as where the reference SOS signal from the master CTS is failing but is not dead. If the magnitude of the phase change exceeds the predetermined threshold, then the phase detector asserts an OOL signal to the hardware control logic. The hardware control logic may immediately change the input to MUX  to cause the slave CTS to switch over to Master CTS and send an interrupt to the processor, or the hardware control logic may only send the interrupt and wait for software (e.g., the SRM) to determine whether the slave CTS should switch over to master.","Master\/Slave CTS Control:","In order to determine which CTS is the master and which is the slave, hardware control logic  implements a state machine. Each hardware control logic  sends an IM_THE_MASTER signal to the other hardware control logic  which is received as a YOU_THE_MASTER signal. If the IM_THE_MASTER signal\u2014and, hence, the received YOU_THE_MASTER signal\u2014is asserted then the CTS sending the signal is the master (and selects input to MUX , ) and the CTS receiving the signal is the slave (and selects input to MUX ). Each IM_THE_MASTER\/YOU_THE_MASTER etch is pulled down to ground on the mid-planes such that if one of the CTSs is missing, the YOU_THE_MASTER signal received by the other CTS will be a logic 0 causing the receiving CTS to become the master. This situation may arise, for example, if a redundant control card including the CTS is not inserted within the network device. In addition, each of the hardware control logics receive SLOT_ID signals from pull-down\/pull-up resistors on the chassis mid-plane indicating the slot in which the switch fabric control card is inserted.","Referring to , on power-up or after a system or card or CTS re-boot, the hardware control logic state machine begins in INIT\/RESET state  and does not assert IM_THE_MASTER. If the SLOT_ID signals indicate that the control card is inserted in a preferred slot (e.g., slot one), and the received YOU_THE_MASTER is not asserted (i.e., ), then the state machine transitions to the ONLINE state  and the hardware control logic asserts IM_THE_MASTER indicating its master status to the other CTS and selects input to MUX . While in the ONLINE state , if a failure is detected or the software tells the hardware logic to switch over, the state machine enters the OFFLINE state  and the hardware control logic stops asserting IM_THE_MASTER and asserts KILL_CLKTREE. While in the OFFLINE state , the software may reset or re-boot the control card or just the CTS and force the state machine to enter the STANDBY state  as the slave CTS and the hardware control logic stops asserting KILL_CLKTREE and selects input to MUX .","While in INIT\/RESET state , if the SLOT_ID signals indicate that the control card is inserted in a non-preferred slot, (e.g., slot ), then the state machine will enter STANDBY state  as the slave CTS and the hardware control logic will not assert IM_THE_MASTER and will select input to MUX . While in INIT\/RESET state , even if the SLOT_ID signals indicate that the control card is inserted in the preferred slot, if YOU_THE_MASTER is asserted, indicating that the other CTS is master, then the state machine transfers to STANDBY state . This situation may arise after a failure and recovery of the CTS in the preferred slot (e.g., reboot, reset or new control card).","While in the STANDBY state , if the YOU_THE_MASTER signal becomes zero (i.e., not asserted), indicating that the master CTS is no longer master, the state machine will transition to ONLINE state  and the hardware control logic will assert IM_THE_MASTER and select input to MUX  to become master. While in ONLINE state , if the YOU_THE_MASTER signal is asserted and SLOT_ID indicating slot  the state machine enters STANDBY state  and the hardware control logic stops asserting IM_THE_MASTER and selects input to MUX . This is the situation where the original master CTS is back up and running. The software may reset the state machine at any time or set the state machine to a particular state at any time.","Local Timing Subsystem:","Referring to , each local timing subsystem (LTS)  receives a reference SOS signal from each CTS on SFC_REFA and SFC_REFB. Since these are differential PECL signals, each is passed through a differential PECL to TTL translator or , respectively. A feedback signal SFC_FB is also passed from the LTS output to both translators and . The reference signal outputs and are fed into a first MUX  within dual MUX , and the feedback signal outputs and are fed into a second MUX  within dual MUX . LTS hardware control logic  controls selector inputs REF_SEL (1:0) and FB_SEL (1:0) to dual MUX . With regard to the feedback signals, the LTS hardware control logic selects the feedback signal that went through the same translator as the reference signal that is selected to minimize the effects of any skew introduced by the two translators.","A phase detector  receives the feedback (FB) and reference (REF) signals from the dual MUX and, as explained above, generates an output in accordance with the magnitude of any phase shift detected between the two signals. Discrete logic circuit  is used to filter the output of the phase detector, in a manner similar to discrete logic  in the CTS, and provide a signal to VCXO  representing a smaller change in phase than that output from the phase detector. Within the LTSs, the VCXO is a 200 MHz oscillator as opposed to the 25 MHz oscillator used in the CTS. The output of the VCXO is the reference switch fabric clock. It is sent to clock driver , which fans the signal out to each of the local switch fabric components. For example, on the forwarding cards, the LTSs supply the 200 MHz reference clock signal to the EPP and data slice chips, and on the switch fabric data cards, the LTSs supply the 200 MHz reference clock signal to the cross-bar chips. On the switch fabric control card, the LTSs supply the 200 MHz clock signal to the scheduler and cross-bar components.","The 200 MHz reference clock signal from the VCXO is also sent to a divider circuit or component  that divides the clock by eight to produce a 25 MHz reference SOS signal . This signal is sent to clock driver , which fans the signal out to each of the same local switch fabric components that the 200 MHz reference clock signal was sent to. In addition, reference SOS signal  is provided as feedback signal SFC_FB to translator . The combination of the dual MUX, phase detector, discrete logic, VCXO, clock drivers and feedback signal forms a phase locked loop circuit allowing the 200 MHz and 25 MHz signals generated by the LTS to be synchronized to either of the reference SOS signals sent from the CTSs.","The divider component may be a SY100EL34divider by Synergy Semiconductor Corporation.","Reference signals and from translator are also sent to activity detectors and , respectively. These activity detectors perform the same function as the activity detectors in the CTSs and assert error signals ref_a_los or ref_b_los to the LTS hardware control logic if reference signal or , respectively, die. On power-up, reset or reboot, a state machine () within the LTS hardware control logic starts in INIT\/RESET state . Arbitrarily, reference signal is the first signal considered. If activity detector is not sending an error signal (i.e., ref_a_los is 0), indicating that that reference signal is active, then the state machine changes to REF_A state  and sends signals over REF_SEL(1:0) to MUX  to select reference input and sends signals over FB_SEL(1:0) to MUX  to select feedback input . While in INIT\/RESET state , if ref_a_los is asserted, indicating no signal on reference , and if ref_b_los is not asserted, indicating there is a signal on reference , then the state machine changes to REF_B state  and changes REF_SEL(1:0) and FB_SEL(1:0) to select reference input and feedback signal ","While in REF_A state , if activity detector detects a loss of reference signal and asserts ref_a_los, the state machine will change to REF_B state  and change REF_SEL(1:0) and FB_SEL(1:0) to select inputs and . Similarly, while in REF_B state , if activity detector detects a loss of signal and asserts ref_b_los, the state machine will change to REF_A state  and change REF_SEL(1:0) and FB_SEL(1:0) to select inputs and . While in either REF_A state  or REF_B state , if both ref_a_los and ref_b_los are asserted, indicating that both reference SOS signals have died, the state machine changes back to INIT\/RESET state  and change REF_SEL(1:0) and FB_SEL(1:0) to select no inputs or test inputs and or ground . For a period of time, the LTS will continue to supply a clock and SOS signal to the switch fabric components even though it is receiving no input reference signal.","When ref_a_los and\/or ref_b_los are asserted, the LTS hardware control logic notifies its local processor  through an interrupt. The SRM will decide, based on a failure policy, what actions to take, including whether to switch over from the master to slave CTS. Just as the phase detector in the CTS sends an out of lock signal to the CTS hardware control logic, the phase detector  also sends an out of lock signal OOL to the LTS hardware control logic if the magnitude of the phase difference between the reference and feedback signals exceeds a predetermined threshold. If the LTS hardware receives an asserted OOL signal, it notifies its local processor (e.g., ) through an interrupt. The SRM will decide based on a failure policy what actions to take.","Shared LTS Hardware:","In the embodiment described above, the switch fabric data cards are four independent cards. More data cards may also be used. Alternatively, all of the cross-bar components may be located on one card. As another alternative, half of the cross-bar components may be located on two separate cards and yet attached to the same network device faceplate and share certain components. A network device faceplate is something the network manager can unlatch and pull on to remove cards from the network device. Attaching two switch fabric data cards to the same faceplate effectively makes them one board since they are added to and removed from the network device together. Since they are effectively one board, they may share certain hardware as if all components were on one physical card. In one embodiment, they may share a processor, hardware control logic and activity detectors. This means that these components will be on one of the physical cards but not on the other and signals connected to the two cards allow activity detectors on the one card to monitor the reference and feedback signals on the other card and allow the hardware control logic on the one card to select the inputs for dual MUX  on the other card.","Scheduler:","Another difficulty with distributing a portion of the switch fabric functionality involves the scheduler component on the switch fabric control cards. In current systems, the entire switch fabric, including all EPP chips, are always present in a network device. Registers in the scheduler component are configured on power-up or re-boot to indicate how many EPP chips are present in the current network device, and in one embodiment, the scheduler component detects an error and switches over to the redundant switch fabric control card when one of those EPP chips is no longer active. When the EPP chips are distributed to different cards (e.g., forwarding cards) within the network device, an EPP chip may be removed from a running network device when the printed circuit board on which it is located is removed (\u201chot swap\u201d, \u201chot removal\u201d) from the network device. To prevent the scheduler chip from detecting the missing EPP chip as an error (e.g., a CRC error) and switching over to the redundant switch fabric control card, prior to the board being removed from the network device, software running on the switch fabric control card re-configures the scheduler chip to disable the scheduler chip's links to the EPP chip that is being removed.","To accomplish this, a latch  () on the faceplate of each of the printed circuit boards on which a distributed switch fabric is located is connected to a circuit  () also on the printed circuit board that detects when the latch is released. When the latch is released, indicating that the board is going to be removed from the network device, circuit  sends a signal to a circuit  on both switch fabric control cards indicating that the forwarding card is about to be removed. Circuit  sends an interrupt to the local processor (e.g., , ) on the switch fabric control card. Software (e.g., slave SRM) being executed by the local processor detects the interrupt and sends a notice to software (e.g., master SRM) being executed by the processor (e.g., , ) on the network device centralized processor card (e.g., , ,  or , ). The master SRM sends a notice to the slave SRMs being executed by the processors on the switch fabric data cards and forwarding cards to indicate the removal of the forwarding card. The redundant forwarding card switches over to become a replacement for the failed primary forwarding card. The master SRM also sends a notice to the slave SRM on the cross-connection card (e.g., -, -, -, -, ) to re-configure the connections between the port cards (e.g., -, -, -, -, ) and the redundant forwarding card. The slave SRM on the switch fabric control card re-configures the registers in the scheduler component to disable the scheduler's links to the EPP chip on the forwarding card that's being removed from the network device. As a result, when the forwarding card is removed, the scheduler will not detect an error due to a missing EPP chip.","Similarly, when a forwarding card is added to the network device, circuit  detects the closing of the latch and sends an interrupt to the processor. The slave SRM running on the local processor sends a notice to the Master SRM which then sends a notice to the slave SRMs being executed by the processors on the switch fabric control cards, data cards and forwarding cards indicating the presence of the new forwarding card. The slave SRM on the cross-connection cards may be reconfigured, and the slave SRM on the switch fabric control card may re-configure the scheduler chip to establish links with the new EPP chip to allow data to be transferred to the newly added forwarding card.","Switch Fabric Control Card Switch-Over:","Typically, the primary and secondary scheduler components receive the same inputs, maintain the same state and generate the same outputs. The EPP chips are connected to both scheduler chips but only respond to the master\/primary scheduler chip. If the primary scheduler or control card experiences a failure a switch over is initiated to allow the secondary scheduler to become the primary. When the failed switch fabric control card is re-booted, re-initialized or replaced, it and its scheduler component serve as the secondary switch fabric control card and scheduler component.","In currently available systems, a complex sequence of steps is required to \u201crefresh\u201d or synchronize the state of the newly added scheduler component to the primary scheduler component and for many of these steps, network data transfer through the switch fabric is temporarily stopped (i.e., back pressure). Stopping network data transfer may affect the availability of the network device. When the switch fabric is centralized and all on one board or only a few boards or in its own box, the refresh steps are quickly completed by one or only a few processors limiting the amount of time that network data is not transferred. When the switch fabric includes distributed switch fabric subsystems, the processors that are local to each of the distributed switch fabric subsystems must take part in the series of steps. This may increase the amount of time that data transfer is stopped further affecting network device availability.","To limit the amount of time that data transfer is stopped in a network device including distributed switch fabric subsystems, the local processors each set up for a refresh while data is still being transferred. Communications between the processors take place over the Ethernet bus (e.g., , , , ) to avoid interrupting network data transfer. When all processors have indicated (over the Ethernet bus) that they are ready for the refresh, the processor on the master switch fabric control card stops data transfer and sends a refresh command to each of the processors on the forwarding cards and switch fabric cards. Since all processors are waiting to complete the refresh, it is quickly completed. Each processor notifies the processor on the master switch fabric control card that the refresh is complete, and when all processors have completed the refresh, the master switch fabric control card re-starts the data transfer.","During the time in which the data transfer is stopped, the buffers in the traffic management chips are used to store data coming from external network devices. It is important that the data transfer be complete quickly to avoid overrunning the traffic management chip buffers.","Since the switch over of the switch fabric control cards is very complex and requires that data transfer be stopped, even if briefly, it is important that the CTSs on each switch fabric control card be independent of the switch fabric functionality. This independence allows the master CTS to switch over to the slave CTS quickly and without interrupting the switch fabric functionality or data transmission.","As described above, locating the EPP chips and data slice chips of the switch fabric subsystem on the forwarding cards is difficult and against the teachings of a manufacturer of these components. However, locating these components on the forwarding cards allows the base network device\u2014that is, the minimal configuration\u2014to include only a necessary portion of the switching fabric reducing the cost of a minimally configured network device. As additional forwarding cards are added to the minimal configuration\u2014to track an increase in customer demand\u2014additional portions of the switch fabric are simultaneously added since a portion of the switch fabric is located on each forwarding card. Consequently, switch fabric growth tracks the growth in customer demands and fees. Also, typical network devices include 1:1 redundant switch fabric subsystems. However, as previously mentioned, the forwarding cards may be 1:N redundant and, thus, the distributed switch fabric on each forwarding card is also 1:N redundant further reducing the cost of a minimally configured network device.","External Network Data Transfer Timing:","In addition to internal switch fabric timing, a network device must also include external network data transfer timing to allow the network device to transfer network data synchronously with other network devices. Generally, multiple network devices in the same service provider site synchronize themselves to Building Integrated Timing Supply (BITS) lines provided by a network service provider. BITS lines are typically from highly accurate stratum two clock sources. In the United States, standard T1 BITS lines (2.048 MHz) are provided, and in Europe, standard E1 BITS lines (1.544 MHz) are provided. Typically, a network service provider provides two T1 lines or two E1 lines from different sources for redundancy. Alternatively, if there are no BITS lines or when network devices in different sites want to synchronously transfer data, one network device may extract a timing signal received on a port connected to the other network device and use that timing signal to synchronize its data transfers with the other network device.","Referring to , controller card and redundant controller card each include an external central timing subsystem (EX CTS) . Each EX CTS receives BITS lines  and provide BITS lines . In addition, each EX CTS receives a port timing signal  from each port card (-, -, -, -, ), and each EX CTS also receives an external timing reference signal  from itself and an external timing reference signal  from the other EX CTS.","One of the EX CTSs behaves as a master and the other EX CTS behaves as a slave. The master EX CTS may synchronize its output external reference timing signals to one of BITS lines  or one of the port timing signals , while the slave EX CTS synchronizes its output external reference timing signals to the received master external reference timing signal . Upon a master EX CTS failure, the slave EX CTS may automatically switch over to become the master EX CTS or software may upon an error or at any time force the slave EX CTS to switch over to become the master EX CTS.","An external reference timing signal from each EX CTS is sent to each external local timing subsystem (EX LTS)  on cards throughout the network device, and each EX LTS generates local external timing signals synchronized to one of the received external reference timing signals. Generally, external reference timing signals are sent only to cards including external data transfer functionality, for example, cross connection cards -, -, -and -() and universal port cards -, -, -, -","In network devices having multiple processor components, an additional central processor timing subsystem is needed to generate processor timing reference signals to allow the multiple processors to synchronize certain processes and functions. The addition of both external reference timing signals (primary and secondary) and processor timing reference signals (primary and secondary) require significant routing resources. In one embodiment of the invention, the EX CTSs embed a processor timing reference signal within each external timing reference signal to reduce the number of timing reference signals needed to be routed across the mid-plane(s). The external reference timing signals are then sent to EX LTSs on each card in the network device having a processor component, for example, cross connection cards -, -, -, -, universal port cards -, -, -, -, forwarding cards -, -, -, -, switch fabric cards , , -, -() and both the internal controller cards , () and external controller cards and ","All of the EX LTSs extract out the embedded processor reference timing signal and send it to their local processor component. Only the cross-connection cards and port cards use the external reference timing signal to synchronize external network data transfers. As a result, the EX LTSs include extra circuitry not necessary to the function of cards not including external data transfer functionality, for example, forwarding cards, switch fabric cards and internal controller cards. The benefit of reducing the necessary routing resources, however, out weighs any disadvantage related to the excess circuitry. In addition, for the cards including external data transfer functionality, having one EX LTS that provides both local signals actually saves resources on those cards, and separate processor central timing subsystems are not necessary. Moreover, embedding the processor timing reference signal within the highly accurate, redundant external timing reference signal provides a highly accurate and redundant processor timing reference signal. Furthermore having a common EX LTS on each card allows access to the external timing signal for future modifications and having a common EX LTS, as opposed to different LTSs for each reference timing signal, results in less design time, less debug time, less risk, design re-use and simulation re-use.","Although the EX CTSs are described as being located on the external controllers and , similar to the switch fabric CTSs described above, the EX CTSs may be located on their own independent cards or on any other cards in the network device, for example, internal controllers and . In fact, one EX CTS could be located on an internal controller while the other is located on an external controller. Many variations are possible. In addition, just as the switch fabric CTSs may switch over from master to slave without affecting or requiring any other functionality on the local printed circuit board, the EX CTSs may also switch over from master to slave without affecting or requiring any other functionality on the local printed circuit board.","External Central Timing Subsystem (EX CTS):","Referring to , EX CTS  includes a T1\/E1 framer\/LIU  for receiving and terminating BITS signals  and for generating and sending BITS signals . Although T1\/E1 framer is shown in two separate boxes in , it is for convenience only and may be the same circuit or component. In one embodiment, two  T1\/E1 Framer Line Interface Units (LIU) available from PMC-Sierra are used. The T1\/E1 framer supplies 8 KHz BITS_REF0 and BITS_REF1 signals and receives 8 KHz BITS1_TXREF and BITS2_TXREF signals. A network administrator notifies NMS  () as to whether the BITS signals are T1 or E1, and the NMS notifies software running on the network device. Through signals  from a local processor, hardware control logic  within the EX CTS is configured for T1 or E1 and sends an T1\/E1 _MODE signal to the T1\/E1 framer indicating T1 or E1 mode. The T1\/E1 framer then forwards BITS_REF0 and BITS-REF1 to dual MUXs and ","Port timing signals  are also sent to dual MUXs and . The network administrator also notifies the NMS as to which timing reference signals should be used, the BITS lines or the port timing signals. The NMS again notifies software running on the network device and through signals , the local processor configures the hardware control logic. The hardware control logic then uses select signals and to select the appropriate output signals from the dual MUXs.","Activity detectors and provide status signals and to the hardware control logic indicating whether the PRI_REF signal and the SEC_REF signal are active or inactive (i.e., stuck at 1 or 0). The PRI_REF and SEC_REF signals are sent to a stratum 3 or stratum 3e timing module . Timing module  includes an internal MUX for selecting between the PRI_REF and SEC_REF signals, and the timing module receives control and status signals  from the hardware control logic indicating whether PRI_REF or SEC_REF should be used. If one of the activity detectors or indicates an inactive status to the hardware control logic, then the hardware control logic sends appropriate information over control and status signals  to cause the timing module to select the active one of PRI_REF or SEC_REF.","The timing module also includes an internal phase locked loop (PLL) circuit and an internal stratum 3 or 3E oscillator. The timing module synchronizes its output signal  to the selected input signal (PRI_REF or SEC_REF). The timing module may be an MSTM-S3 available from Conner-Winfield or an ATIMe-s or ATIMe-3E available from TF systems. The hardware control logic, activity detectors and dual-MUXs may be implemented in an FPGA. The timing module also includes a Free-run mode and a Hold-Over mode. When there is no input signal to synchronize to, the timing module enter a free-run mode and uses the internal oscillator to generate a clock output signal. If the signal being synchronized to is lost, then the timing module enters a hold-over mode and maintains the frequency of the last known clock output signal for a period of time.","The EX CTS  also receives an external timing reference signal from the other EX CTS on STRAT_SYNC  (one of STRAT_REF1-STRAT_REFN from the other EX CTS). STRAT_SYNC and output  from the timing module are sent to a MUX . REF_SEL(1:0) selection signals are sent from the hardware control logic to MUX to select STRAT_SYNC when the EX CTS is the slave and output  when the EX CTS is the master. When in a test mode, the hardware control logic may also select a test input from a test header ","An activity detector monitors the status of output  from the timing module and provides a status signal to the hardware control logic. Similarly, an activity detector monitors the status of STRAT_SYNC and provides a status signal to the hardware control logic. When the EX CTS is master, if the hardware control logic receives an inactive status from activity detector , then the hardware control logic automatically changes the REF_SEL signals to select STRAT_SYNC forcing the EX CTS to switch over and become the slave. When the EX CTS is slave, if the hardware control logic receives an inactive status from activity detector , then the hardware control logic may automatically change the REF_SEL signals to select output  from the timing module forcing the EX CTS to switch over and become master.","A MUX receives feedback signals from the EX CTS itself. BENCH_FB is an external timing reference signal from the EX CTS that is routed back to the MUX on the local printed circuit board. STRAT_FB  is an external timing reference signal from the EX CTS (one of STRAT_REF1-STRAT_REFN) that is routed onto the mid-plane(s) and back onto the local printed circuit board such that is most closely resembles the external timing reference signals sent to the EX LTSs and the other EX CTS in order to minimize skew. The hardware control logic sends FB_SEL(1:0) signals to MUX to select STRAT_FB in regular use or BENCH_FB or an input from a test header in test mode.","The outputs of both MUX and are provided to a phase detector . The phase detector compares the rising edge of the two input signals to determine the magnitude of any phase shift between the two. The phase detector then generates variable voltage pulses on outputs and representing the magnitude of the phase shift. The phase detector outputs are used by discrete logic circuit  to generate a voltage on signal  representing the magnitude of the phase shift. The voltage is used to speed up or slow down (i.e., change the phase of) a VCXO  to allow the output signal  to track any phase change in the external timing reference signal received from the other EX CTS (i.e., STRAT_SYNC) or to allow the output signal  to track any phase change in the output signal  from the timing module. The discrete logic components implement a filter that determines how quickly or slowly the VCXO's output tracks the change in phase detected on the reference signal.","The phase detector circuit may be implemented in a programmable logic device (PLD).","The output  of the VCXO is sent to an External Reference Clock (ERC) circuit  which may also be implemented in a PLD. ERC_STRAT_SYNC is also sent to ERC  from the output of MUX . When the EX CTS is the master, the ERC circuit generates the external timing reference signal  with an embedded processor timing reference signal, as described below, based on the output signal  and synchronous with ERC_STRAT_SYNC (corresponding to timing module output ). When the EX CTS is the slave, the ERC generates the external timing reference signal  based on the output signal  and synchronous with ERC_STRAT_SYNC (corresponding to STRAT_SYNC  from the other EX CTS).","External reference signal  is then sent to a first level clock driver  and from there to second level clock drivers -which provide external timing reference signals (STRAT_REF1-STRAT_REFN) that are distributed across the mid-plane(s) to EX LTSs on the other network device cards and the EX LTS on the same network device card, the other EX CTS and the EX CTS itself. The ERC circuit also generates BITS1_TXREF and BITS2_TXREF signals that are provided to BITS T1\/E1 framer .","The hardware control logic also includes an activity detector  that receives STRAT_REF_ACTIVITY from clock driver . Activity detector  sends a status signal to the hardware control logic, and if the status indicates that STRAT_REF_ACTIVITY is inactive, then the hardware control logic asserts KILL_CLKTREE. Whenever KILL_CLKTREE is asserted, the activity detector in the other EX CTS detects inactivity on STRAT_SYNC and may become the master by selecting the output of the timing module as the input to MUX ","Similar to hardware control logic  () within the switch fabric CTS, hardware control logic  within the EX CTS implements a state machine (similar to the state machine shown in ) based on IM_THE_MASTER and YOU_THE_MASTER signals sent between the two EX CTSs and also on slot identification signals (not shown).","In one embodiment, ports (e.g., -, ) on network device  are connected to external optical fibers carrying signals in accordance with the synchronous optical network (SONET) protocol and the external timing reference signal is a 19.44 MHz signal that may be used as the SONET transmit reference clock. This signal may also be divided down to provide an 8 KHz SONET framing pulse (i.e., JOFP) or multiplied up to provide higher frequency signals. For example, four times 19.44 MHz is 77.76 MHz which is the base frequency for a SONET OC1 stream, two times 77.76 MHz provides the base frequency for an OC3 stream and eight times 77.76 MHz provides the base frequency for an OC12 stream.","In one embodiment, the embedded processor timing reference signal within the 19.44 MHz external timing reference signal is 8 KHz. Since the processor timing reference signal and the SONET framing pulse are both 8 KHz, the embedded processor timing reference signal may used to supply both. In addition, the embedded processor timing reference signal may also be used to supply BITS1_TXREF and BITS2_TXREF signals to BITS T1\/E1 framer .","Referring to , the 19.44 MHz external reference timing signal with embedded 8 KHz processor timing reference signal from ERC  (i.e., output signal ) includes a duty-cycle distortion  every 125 microseconds (us) representing the embedded 8 KHz signal. In this embodiment, VCXO  is a 77.76 MHz VCXO providing a 77.76 MHz clock output signal . The ERC uses VCXO output signal  to generate output signal  as described in more detail below. Basically, every 125 us, the ERC holds the output signal  high for one extra 77.76 MHz clock cycle to create a 75%\/25% duty cycle in output signal . This duty cycle distortion is used by the EX LTSs and EX CTSs to extract the 8 KHz signal from output signal , and since the EX LTS's use only the rising edge of the 19.44 MHz signal to synchronize local external timing signals, the duty cycle distortion does not affect that synchronization.","External Reference Clock (ERC) Circuit:","Referring to , an embeddor circuit  within the ERC receives VCXO output signal  (77.76 MHz) at four embedding registers -, a 9720-1 rollover counter  and three 8 KHz output registers -. Each embedding register passes its value (logic 1 or 0) to the next embedding register, and embedding register provides ERC output signal  (19.44 MHz external timing reference signal with embedded 8 KHz processor timing reference signal). The output of embedding register is also inverted and provided as an input to embedding register . When running, therefore, the embedding registers maintain a repetitive output  of a high for two 77.76 MHz clock pulses and then low for two 77.76 MHz which provides a 19.44 MHz signal. Rollover counter  and a load circuit  are used to embed the 8 KHz signal.","The rollover counter increments on each 77.76 MHz clock tick and at 9720-1 (9720-1 times 77.76 MHz=8 KHz), the counter rolls over to zero. Load circuit  detects when the counter value is zero and loads a logic 1 into embedding registers , and and a logic zero into embedding register . As a result, the output of embedding register is held high for three 77.76 MHz clock pulses (since logic ones are loaded into three embedding registers) which forces the duty cycle distortion into the 19.44 MHz output signal .","BITS circuits and also monitor the value of the rollover counter. While the value is less than or equal to 4860-1 (half of 8 KHz), the BITS circuits provide a logic one to 8 KHz output registers and , respectively. When the value changes to 4860, the BITS circuits toggle from a logic one to a logic zero and continue to send a logic zero to 8 KHz output registers and , respectively, until the rollover counter rolls over. As a result, 8 KHz output registers and provide 8 KHz signals with a 50% duty cycle on BITS1_TXREF and BITS2_TXREF to the BITS T1\/E1 framer.","As long as a clock signal is received over signal  (77.76 MHz), rollover counter  continues to count causing BITS circuits and to continue toggling 8 KHz registers and and causing load circuit  to continue to load logic 1110 into the embedding registers every 8 KHz. As a result, the embedding registers will continue to provide a 19 MHz clock signal with an embedded 8 KHz signal on line . This is often referred to as \u201cfly wheeling.\u201d","Referring to , an extractor circuit  within the ERC is used to extract the embedded 8 KHz signal from ERC_STRAT_SYNC. When the EX CTS is the master, ERC_STRAT_SYNC corresponds to the output signal  from the timing module  (pure 19.44 MHz), and thus, no embedded 8 KHz signal is extracted. When the EX CTS is the slave, ERC_STRAT_SYNC corresponds to the external timing reference signal provided by the other EX CTS (i.e., STRAT_SYNC ; 19.44 MHz with embedded 8 KHz) and the embedded 8 KHz signal is extracted. The extractor circuit includes three extractor registers -. Each extractor register is connected to the 77.76 MHz VCXO output signal , and on each clock pulse, extractor register receives a logic one input and passes its value to extractor register which passes its value to extractor register which provides an 8 KHz pulse . The extractor registers are also connected to ERC_SRAT_SYNC which provides an asynchronous reset to the extractor registers\u2014that is, when ERC_STRAT_SYNC is logic zero, the registers are reset to zero. Every two 77.76 MHz clock pulses, therefore, the extractor registers are reset and for most cycles, extractor register passes a logic zero to output signal . However, when the EX CTS is the slave, every 8 KHz ERC_STRAT_SYNC remains a logic one for three 77.76 MHz clock pulses allowing a logic one to be passed through each register and onto output signal  to provide an 8 KHz pulse.","8 KHz output signal  is passed to extractor circuit  and used to reset the rollover counter to synchronize the rollover counter to the embedded 8 KHz signal within ERC_STRAT_SYNC when the EX CTS is the slave. As a result, the 8 KHz embedded signal generated by both EX CTSs are synchronized.","External Local Timing Subsystem (EX LTS):","Referring to , EX LTS  receives STRAT_REF_B from one EX CTS and STRAT_REF_A from the other EX CTS. STRAT_REF_B and STRAT_REF_A correspond to one of STRAT_REF1-STRAT_REFN () output from each EX CTS. STRAT_REF_B and STRAT_REF_A are provided as inputs to a MUX and a hardware control logic  within the EX LTS selects the input to MUX using REF_SEL (1:0) signals. An activity detector monitors the activity of STRAT_REF_A and sends a signal to hardware control logic  if it detects an inactive signal (i.e., stuck at logic one or zero). Similarly, an activity detector monitors the activity of STRAT_REF_B and sends a signal to hardware control logic  if it detects an inactive signal (i.e., stuck at logic one or zero). If the hardware control logic receives a signal from either activity detector indicating that the monitored signal is inactive, the hardware control logic automatically changes the REF_SEL (1:0) signals to cause MUX to select the other input signal and send an interrupt to the local processor.","A second MUX receives a feed back signal  from the EX LTS itself. Hardware control logic  uses FB_SEL(1:0) to select either a feedback signal input to MUX or a test header input to MUX . The test header input is only used in a test mode. In regular use, feedback signal  is selected. Similarly, in a test mode, the hardware control logic may use REF_SEL(1:0) to select a test header input to MUX ","Output signals and from MUXs and , respectively, are provided to phase detector . The phase detector compares the rising edge of the two input signals to determine the magnitude of any phase shift between the two. The phase detector then generates variable voltage pulses on outputs and representing the magnitude of the phase shift. The phase detector outputs are used by discrete logic circuit  to generate a voltage on signal  representing the magnitude of the phase shift. The voltage is used to speed up or slow down (i.e., change the phase of) of an output  of a VCXO  to track any phase change in STRAT_REF_A or STRAT_REF_B. The discrete logic components implement filters that determine how quickly or slowly the VCXO's output will track the change in phase detected on the reference signal.","In one embodiment, the VCXO is a 155.51 MHz or a 622 MHz VCXO. This value is dependent upon the clock speeds required by components, outside the EX LTS but on the local card, that are responsible for transferring network data over the optical fibers in accordance with the SONET protocol. On at least the universal port card, the VCXO output  signal is sent to a clock driver  for providing local data transfer components with a 622 MHz or 155.52 MHz clock signal .","The VCXO output  is also sent to a divider chip  for dividing the signal down and outputting a 77.76 MHz output signal  to a clock driver chip . Clock driver chip  provides 77.76 MHz output signals for use by components on the local printed circuit board and provides 77.76 MHz output signal to ERC circuit . The ERC circuit also receives input signal  corresponding to the EX LTS selected input signal either STRAT_REF_B or STRAT_REF_A. As shown, the same ERC circuit that is used in the EX CTS may be used in the EX LTS to extract an 8 KHz J0FP pulse for use by data transfer components on the local printed circuit board. Alternatively, the ERC circuit could include only a portion of the logic in ERC circuit  on the EX CTS.","Similar to hardware control logic  () within the switch fabric LTS, hardware control logic  within the EX LTS implements a state machine (similar to the state machine shown in ) based on signals from activity detectors and ","External Reference Clock (ERC) Circuit:","Referring again to , when the ERC circuit is within an EX LTS circuit, the inputs to extractor circuit  are input signal  corresponding to the LTS selected input signal either STRAT_REF_B or STRAT_REF_A and 77.76 MHz clock input signal . The extracted 8 KHz pulse  is again provided to embeddor circuit  and used to reset rollover counter  in order to synchronize the counter with the embedded 8 KHz signal with STRAT_REF_A or STRAT_REF_B. Because the EX CTSs that provide STRAT_REF_A and STRAT_REF_B are synchronous, the embedded 8 KHz signals within both signals are also synchronous. Within the EX LTS, the embedding registers -and BITS registers and are not used. Instead, a circuit  monitors the value of the rollover counter and when the rollover counter rolls over to a value of zero, circuit  sends a logic one to 8 KHz register which provides an 8 KHz pulse signal  that may be sent by the LTS to local data transfer components (i.e., J0FP) and processor components as a local processor timing signal.","Again, as long as a clock signal is received over signal (77.76 MHz), rollover counter  continues to count causing circuit  to continue pulsing 8 KHz register ","External Central Timing Subsystem (EX CTS) Alternate Embodiment:","Referring to , instead of using one of the STRAT_REF1-STRAT_REFN signals from the other EX CTS as an input to MUX , the output  (marked \u201cAlt. Output to other EX CTS\u201d) of timing module  may be provided to the other EX CTS and received as input  (marked \u201cAlt. Input from other EX CTS\u201d). The PLL circuit, including MUXs and , phase detector , discrete logic circuit  and VCXO , is necessary to synchronize the output of the VCXO with either output  of the timing module or a signal from the other EX CTS. However, PLL circuits may introduce jitter into their output signals (e.g., output ), and passing the PLL output signal  via one of the STRAT_REF1-STRAT_REFN signals from one EX CTS into the PLL of the other EX CTS\u2014that is, PLL to PLL\u2014may introduce additional jitter into output signal . Since accurate timing signals are critical for proper data transfer with other network devices and SONET standards specifically set maximum allowable jitter transmission at interfaces (Bellcore GR-253-CORE and SONET Transport Systems Common Carrier Criteria), jitter should be minimized. Passing the output  of the timing module within the EX CTS to the input  of the other EX CTS avoids passing the output of one PLL to the input of the second PLL and thereby reduces the potential introduction of jitter.","It is still necessary to send one of the STRAT_REF1-STRAT_REFN signals to the other EX CTS (received as STRAT_SYNC ) in order to provide ERC  with a 19.44 MHz signal with an embedded 8 KHz clock for use when the EX CTS is a slave. The ERC circuit only uses ERC_STRAT_SYNC in this instance when the EX CTS is the slave.","Layer One Test Port:","The present invention provides programmable physical layer (i.e., layer one) test ports within an upper layer network device (e.g., network device , ). The test ports may be connected to external test equipment (e.g., an analyzer) to passively monitor data being received by and transmitted from the network device or to actively drive data to the network device. Importantly, data provided at a test port accurately reflects data received by or transmitted by the network device with minimal modification and no upper layer translation or processing. Moreover, data is supplied to the test ports without disrupting or slowing the service provided by the network device.","Referring to , network device  includes at least one cross-connection card -, -, -, -, at least one universal port card -, -, -, -, and at least one forwarding card -, -, -, -. Each port card includes at least one port -for connecting to external physical network attachments -, and each port card transfers data to a cross-connection card. The cross-connection card transfers data between port cards and forwarding cards and between port cards. In one embodiment, each forwarding card includes at least one port\/payload extractor -for receiving data from the cross-connection cards.","Referring to , a port on a port card within network device  may be connected to another network device (not shown) through physical external network attachments and . As described above, components  on the port card transfer data between port and cross-connection card , and components  on the cross-connection card transfer data on particular paths between the port cards and the forwarding cards or between port cards. For convenience, only one port card, forwarding card and cross-connection card are shown.","For many reasons, including error diagnosis, a service administrator may wish to monitor the data received on a particular path or paths at a particular port, for example, port , and\/or the data transmitted on a particular path or paths from port . To accomplish this, the network administrator may connect test equipment, for example, an analyzer  (e.g., an Omniber analyzer available from Hewlett Packard Company), to the transmit connection of port to monitor data received at port and\/or to the transmit connection of port to monitor data transmitted from port . The network administrator then notifies the NMS (e.g., NMS  running on PC , ) as to which port or ports on which port card or port cards should be enabled and whether the transmitter and\/or receiver for each port should be enabled. The network administrator also notifies the NMS as to which path or paths are to be sent to each test port, and the time slot for each path. With this information, the NMS fills in test path table  () in configuration database .","Similar to the process of enabling a working port through path table  (), when a record in the test path table is filled in, the configuration database sends an active query notification to the path manager (e.g., path manager ) executing on the universal port card (e.g., port card ) corresponding to the universal port card port LID in the path table record. For example, port may have a port LID of  (record , ) and port may have a port LID of  (record ). An active query notification is also sent to NMS database , and once the NMS database is updated, the NMS displays the new system configuration, including the test ports, to the user.","Through the test path table, the path manager learns that the transmitters of ports and need to be enabled and which path or paths are to be transferred to each port. As shown in path table  (), path LID  corresponds to working port LID  (port ), and as shown in test path table  (), path LID  is also assigned to test port LIDs  and  (ports and , respectively). Record  indicates that the receive portion of path  (i.e., \u201cingress\u201d in Monitor column ) is to be sent to port LID  (i.e., port ) and then transmitted (i.e., \u201cno\u201d in Enable Port Receiver column ) from port LID , and similarly, record  indicates that the transmit portion of path  (i.e., \u201cegress\u201d in Monitor column ) is to be sent to port LID  (i.e., port ) and then transmitted (i.e., \u201cno\u201d in Enable Port Receiver column ) from port LID .","The path manager passes the path connection information to cross-connection manager  executing on the cross-connection card . The CCM uses the connection information to generate a new connection program table  and uses this table to program internal connections through one or more components (e.g., a TSE chip ) on the cross-connection card. After re-programming, cross-connection card continues to transmit data corresponding to path LID  between port on universal port card and the serial line input to payload extractor on forwarding card . However, after reprogramming, cross-connection card also multicasts the data corresponding to path LID  and received on port to port and data corresponding to path LID  and transmitted to port by forwarding card to port ","Analyzer  may then be used to monitor both the network data received on port and the network data being transmitted from port . Alternatively, analyzer  may only be connected to one test port to monitor either the data received on port or the data transmitted from port . The data received on port may be altered by the components on the port card(s) and the cross-connection cards before the data reaches the test port but any modification is minimal. For example, where the external network attachment is a SONET optical fiber, the port card components may convert the optical signals into electrical signals that are passed to the cross-connection card and then back to the test ports, which reconvert the electrical signals into optical signals before the signals are passed to analyzer . Since the data received at port has not been processed or translated by the upper layer processing components on the forwarding card, the data accurately reflects the data received at the port. For example, the physical layer (e.g., SONET) information and format is accurately reflected in the data received.","To passively monitor both the data received and transmitted by a particular port, two transmitters are necessary and, thus, two ports are consumed for testing and cannot be used for normal data transfer. Because the test ports are programmable through the cross-connection card, however, the test ports may be re-programmed at any time to be used for normal data transfer. In addition, redundant ports may be used as test ports to avoid consuming ports needed for normal data transfer. Current network devices often have a dedicated test port that can provide both the data received and transmitted by a working port. The dedicated test port, however, contains specialized hardware that is different from the working ports and, thus, cannot be used as a working port. Hence, although two ports may be consumed for monitoring the input and output of one working port, they are only temporarily consumed and may be re-programmed at any time. Similarly, if the port card on which a test port is located fails, the test port(s) may be quickly and easily reprogrammed to another port on another port card that has not failed.","Instead of passively monitoring the data received at port , test equipment  may be connected to the receiver of a test port and used to drive data to network device . For example, the network administrator may connect test equipment  to the receiver of test port and then notify the NMS to enable the receiver on port to receive path . With this information, the NMS modifies test path table . For example, record  () indicates that the receive portion of path  (i.e., \u201cingress\u201d in Monitor column ) is to be driven (i.e., \u201cyes\u201d in Enable Port Receiver column ) externally with data from port LID  (i.e., port ). Again, an active query notification is sent to path manager . Path manager  then disables the receiver corresponding to port LID  (i.e., port ) and enables the receiver corresponding to port LID  (i.e., port ) and passes the path connection information to cross-connection manager  indicating that port LID  will supply the receive portion of path . The cross-connection manager uses the connection information to generate a new connection program table  to re-program the internal connections through the cross-connection card. In addition, the network administrator may also indicate that the transmitter of port should be disabled, and path manager  would disable the transmitter of port and pass the connection information to the cross connection manager.","After re-programming, cross-connection card data is sent from test equipment  to test port and then through the cross-connection card to forwarding card . The cross-connection card may multicast the data from forwarding card to both working port and to test port , or just to test port or just working port ","Instead of having test equipment  drive data to the network device over a test port, internal components on a port card, cross-connection card or forwarding card within the network device may drive data to the other cards and to other network devices over external physical attachments connected to working ports and\/or test ports. For example, the internal components may be capable of generating a pseudo-random bit sequence (PRBS). Test equipment  connected to one or more test ports may then be used to passively monitor the data sent from and\/or received by the working port, and the internal components may be capable of detecting a PRBS over the working port and\/or test port(s).","Although the test ports have been shown on the same port card as the working port being tested, it should be understood, that the test ports may be on any port card in the same quadrant as the working port. Where cross-connection cards are interconnected, the test ports may be on any port card in a different quadrant so long as the cross-connection card in the different quadrant is connected to the cross-connection card in same quadrant as the working port. Similarly, the test ports may be located on different port cards with respect to each other. A different working port may be tested by re-programming the cross-connection card to multicast data corresponding to the different working port to the test port(s). In addition, multiple working ports may be tested simultaneously by re-programming the cross-connection card to multicast data from different paths on different working ports to the same test port(s) or to multiple different test ports. A network administrator may choose to dedicate certain ports as test ports prior to any testing needing to be done or the network administrator may choose certain ports as test ports when problems arise.","The programmable physical layer test port or ports allow a network administrator to test data received at or transmitted from any working port or ports and also to drive data to any upper layer card (i.e., forwarding card) within the network device. Only the port card(s) and cross-connection card need be working properly to passively monitor data received at and sent from a working port. Testing and re-programming test ports may take place during normal operation without disrupting data transfer through the network device to allow for diagnosis without network device disruption.","NMS Server Scalability","As described above, a network device (e.g., , , ) may include a large number (e.g., millions) of configurable\/manageable objects. Manageable objects are typically considered physical or logical. Physical managed objects correspond to the physical components of the network device such as the network device itself, one or more chassis within the network device, shelves in each chassis, slots in each shelf, cards inserted in each slot, physical ports on particular cards (e.g., universal port cards), etc. Logical managed objects correspond to configured elements of the network device such as SONET paths, internal logical ports (e.g., forwarding card ports), ATM interfaces, virtual ATM interfaces, virtual connections, paths\/interfaces related to other network protocols (e.g., MPLS, IP, Frame Relay, Ethernet), etc.","If multiple NMS clients request access to multiple different network devices and the NMS server is required to retrieve and store data for all managed objects corresponding to each network device, then the NMS server's local memory will likely be quickly filled and repeated retrievals of data from each network device will likely be necessary. Retrieval of a large amount of data from each network device limits the scalability of the NMS server and reduces the NMS server's response time to NMS client requests.","To improve the scalability of the NMS server and improve data request response times, only physical managed objects are initially retrieved from a selected network device and logical managed objects are retrieved only when necessary. To further increase NMS server scalability and response time, proxies for managed objects (preferably physical managed objects and only a limited number of global logical managed objects) are stored in memory local to each NMS client. Moreover, to increase NMS server scalability and response time, unique identification numbers corresponding to each managed object are also stored in memory local to the NMS client (for example, in proxies or GUI tables) and used by the NMS server to quickly retrieve data requested by the NMS client. Each NMS client, therefore, maintains its user context of interest, eliminating the need for client-specific device context management by the NMS server.","Referring to , an NMS client runs on a personal computer or workstation  and uses data in graphical user interface (GUI) tables  stored in local memory  to display a GUI to a user (e.g., network administrator, provisioner, customer) after the user has logged in. In one embodiment, the GUI is GUI  described above with reference to -, -, -, -, -, -, -and -. When GUI  is initially displayed (see ), only navigation tree  is displayed and under Device branch a list of IP addresses and\/or domain name server (DNS) names may be displayed corresponding to network devices that may be managed by the user in accordance with the user's profile.","If the user selects one of the IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.9.202, ) in list , then the client checks local memory  () for proxies (described below) corresponding to the selected network device and if such proxies are not in local memory , the NMS client sends a network device access request including the IP address of the selected network device to an NMS server, for example, NMS server . The NMS server may be executed on the same computer or workstation as the client or, more likely, on a separate computer . The NMS server checks local memory for managed objects corresponding to the network device to be accessed and if the managed objects are not in local memory , the NMS server sends database access commands to the configuration database  within the network device corresponding to the IP address sent by the NMS client. The database access commands retrieve only data corresponding to physical components of the network device.","In one embodiment, data is stored within configuration database  as a series of containers. Since the configuration database is a relational database, data is stored in tables and containment is accomplished using pointers from lower level tables (children) to upper level tables (parents). As previously discussed with reference to -, after the network device is powered-up, the Master MCD (Master Control Driver)  takes a physical inventory of the network device (e.g., computer system , , network device , , ) and assigns a unique physical identification number (PID) to each physical component within the system, including the network device itself, each chassis in the network device, each shelf in each chassis, each slot in each shelf, each card inserted in each slot, and each port on each card having a physical port (e.g., universal port cards). As previously stated, the PID is a unique logical number unrelated to any physical aspect of the component.","The MCD then fills in tables for each type of physical component, such tables being provided by a default configuration within the configuration database. Alternatively, the MCD could create and fill in each table. In one embodiment, the configuration database includes a managed device table  (), a chassis table  (FIG. ), a shelf table  (), a slot table  (), a card table \u2032 (), and a port table \u2032 (). The MCD enters the assigned unique PID for each physical component in a row (i.e., record) in one of the tables. Consequently, each unique PID serves as a primary key within the configuration database for the row\/data corresponding to each physical component. Where available, the MCD also enters data representing attributes (e.g., card type, port type, relative location, version number, etc.) for the component in each table row. In addition, with the exception of the managed device table, each row includes a unique PID corresponding to a parent table. The unique PID corresponding to a parent table is a pointer and provides data \u201ccontainment\u201d by linking each child table to its parent table (i.e., provides a table hierarchy). The unique PID corresponding to the parent table may also be referred to as a foreign key for association.","Referring to , since the managed device is the top physical level, managed device table  includes one row representing the one managed device (e.g., , ) including a unique managed device PID (e.g., ; i.e., primary key) and attributes A-An corresponding to the managed device but the managed device table does not include a parent PID (i.e., foreign key for association). In the current embodiment, chassis table  includes one row representing the one chassis (e.g., , -) in the managed device. Other network devices may have multiple chassis and a row would be added to the chassis table for each chassis and each row would include the same managed device PID (e.g., ). Each row in the chassis table includes a unique chassis PID (e.g., ; i.e., primary key) and attributes A-An corresponding to the chassis and a managed device PID (i.e., parent PID\/foreign key for association). Referring to , shelf table  includes one row for each shelf in the chassis and each row includes a unique shelf PID (e.g., -; i.e., primary key) and attributes A-An corresponding to each shelf and a chassis PID (i.e., foreign key for association). Since all the shelves are in the same chassis in this embodiment, they each list the same chassis PID (e.g., ). Referring to , slot table  includes one row for each slot in the chassis and each row includes a unique slot PID (e.g., -; i.e., primary key) and attributes A-An corresponding to each slot and a shelf PID (i.e., foreign key for association). Since there may be many shelves in the chassis, the shelf PID in each row corresponds to the shelf in which the slot is located. For example, a row includes slot PID  corresponding to a shelf PID of 3, and a row includes slot PID  corresponding to a different shelf PID of 18.","Referring to , card table \u2032 includes one row for each card inserted within a slot in the chassis and each row includes a unique card PID (i.e., primary key), attributes (e.g., CWD Type, Version No., etc.) corresponding to each card and a slot PID (i.e., foreign key for association) corresponding to the slot in which the card is inserted. Referring to , port table \u2032 includes one row for each physical port located on a universal port card in the chassis and each row includes a unique port PID (i.e., primary key), attributes (e.g., port type, version no., etc.) corresponding to each port and a card PID (i.e., foreign key for association) corresponding to the card on which the port is located.","Even after initial power-up, master MCD  continues to take physical inventories of the network device to determine if physical components have been added or removed. For example, cards may be added to empty slots or removed from slots. When changes are detected, master MCD  updates the tables (e.g., card table \u2032 and port table \u2032) accordingly, and through the active query feature, the configuration database updates an external NMS database (e.g., , ) and notifies the NMS server. In one embodiment, each time a physical component is changed, the NMS server sends the NMS client a full set of updated proxies to ensure that the NMS client is fully synchronized with the network device. Alternatively, only those proxies that are affected may be updated. As described below, however, proxies may include pointers to both a parent proxy and children proxies, and if so, even a change to only one physical component requires changes to the proxy for that component and any related parent and\/or children proxies.","In this embodiment, therefore, when the server sends database access commands to the configuration database within the network device to retrieve all data corresponding to physical components of the network device, the database access commands request data from each row in each of the physical tables (e.g., managed device table , chassis table , shelf table , slot table , card table \u2032 and port table \u2032). The data from these tables is then sent to the NMS server, and the server creates physical managed objects (PMO-PMOn, ) for each row in each table and stores them in local memory ","Referring to , each physical managed object  created by the NMS server includes the unique PID and the attribute data associated with the particular row\/record in the configuration database table and function calls . With the exception of the managed device physical managed object, the attribute data includes a pointer (i.e., PID) for the corresponding parent physical component, and with the exception of the port physical managed objects, each managed object's attribute data also includes one or more pointers (i.e., PIDs) corresponding to any children physical components. In this embodiment, the port managed objects are the lowest level physical component and, therefore, do not include pointers to children physical components.","In one embodiment, all physical managed objects include a \u201cGet Parent\u201d function call to cause the NMS server to retrieve data corresponding to the parent physical component. A Get Parent function call to the managed device managed object receives a null message since the managed device does not have a parent component. The Get Parent function call may be used for constraint checking. For example, prior to configuring a particular card as a backup for another card, the Get Parent function call may be placed twice by the NMS server to ensure that both cards are within the same shelf\u2014that is, the network device may have a constraint that redundant boards must be within the same shelf. The first Get Parent function call determines which slot each card is in and the second Get Parent function call determines which shelf each slot is in. If the shelves match, then the constraint is met.","In one embodiment, all physical managed objects include a \u201cGet Children\u201d function call to cause the NMS server to retrieve data from the configuration database for children physical components related to the physical managed object. A Get Children function call to a port managed object receives a null message since the port does not have any physical children components. The data retrieved with the Get Children function call is used to fill in the tables in the physical tabs (e.g., system tab  (), module tab  (), ports tab  () and SONET Interfaces tab  ()) within configuration\/status window  (). Some or all of the data from each row in the configuration database tables may be used to fill in these tables.","In addition to Get Children and Get Parent function calls, each physical managed object includes a \u201cGet Config\u201d and a \u201cSet Config\u201d function call. The Get Config function call is used to retrieve data for dialog boxes when a user double clicks the left mouse button on an entry in one of the tabs in status window . The Set Config function call is used to implement changes to managed objects received from a user through a dialog box.","Instead of a \u201cGet Children\u201d function call, the port managed object includes a \u201cGet SONET Path Table\u201d function call to cause the server to retrieve all SONET paths (logical managed objects) configured for that particular port for display in SONET Paths tab  (). Since SONET paths are children to a port, the \u201cGet SONET Path Table\u201d corresponds to the \u201cGet Children\u201d function call in the other physical managed objects. However, the pointers (i.e., logical identification numbers (LIDs)) to the children are not stored in the port managed object attribute data. This is because the number of SONET paths that the SONET port would need to point may be large and would have to be regularly updated as SONET Paths are created and deleted. The port managed object also includes a \u201cCreate SONET Path\u201d function call and a \u201cDelete SONET Path\u201d function call to cause the server to create or delete, respectively, a SONET path for that particular port. As described below, the port managed object may also include other function calls related to logical components.","Each managed object  also includes a \u201cGet Proxy\u201d function call , and after creating each managed object, the NMS server places a get proxy function call to the managed object. Placing the get proxy call causes the NMS server to create a proxy (PX) for the managed object and send the proxy (e.g., PX-PXn) to memory  local to the NMS client that requested the network device access. Referring to , each proxy includes the PID and some or all of the attribute data from the corresponding managed object. The decision to include some or all of the attribute data within the proxy may depend upon the size of the memory  local to the NMS client. This may be a static design decision based on the expected size of the memory local to the typical NMS client, or this may be a dynamic decision based on the actual size of the memory local to the NMS client that requested access to the network device. If sufficiently large, the proxy may include all the attribute data. If not sufficiently large, then perhaps only attribute data regularly accessed by users may be included in the proxy. For example, for a port managed object perhaps only the port name, connection type and relative position within the network device is included in the proxy.","In addition, each proxy may include function calls similar to one or more function calls in the corresponding managed object, with the exception of the \u201cGet Proxy\u201d function call. Unlike the managed object function calls, however, the proxy function calls cause the NMS client to send messages to the NMS server in, for example, JAVA RMI. For instance, the SONET Port proxy like the SONET Port managed object includes the \u201cGet SONET Path Table\u201d, \u201cCreate SONET Paths\u201d and \u201cDelete SONET Paths\u201d function calls. However, proxy function calls cause the NMS client to send JAVA RMI messages to the NMS server to cause the server to place similar function calls to the managed object. The managed object function calls cause the server to generate database access commands to the configuration database in the network device.","Initially, the NMS client uses data from the received proxies (PX-PXn, ) to update GUI tables  which causes the GUI to display device mimic () in graphic window and system tab  () in configuration\/service status window . Limiting the initial data retrieval from the configuration database to only data corresponding to physical components of the network device\u2014as opposed to both physical and logical components\u2014reduces the amount of time required to transfer the data from the configuration database to the NMS server and on to the NMS client. Thus, the NMS client is able to display the device mimic and system tab more quickly than if data corresponding to both the physical and logical components were retrieved. To further increase the speed with which the device mimic and system tab are displayed, the NMS server may first transfer the proxies necessary for the device mimic and the system tab and then transfer the proxies corresponding to other physical tabs, including module (i.e., card) tab  (), port tab  () and SONET Interfaces tab  ().","If a user selects a different network device from navigation tree  () using NMS client , NMS client searches local memory  for proxies associated with the selected network device and if not found, the NMS client sends JAVA RMI messages to the NMS server to cause the NMS server to retrieve all physical data from the selected network device, create physical managed objects, store them in local memory , create proxies for each physical managed object and send the proxies to the NMS client. If memory  local to the NMS client is sufficiently large, then the proxies for the first selected network device may remain in memory along with the proxies for the second selected network device. Consequently, if the user re-selects the first selected network device, the proxies are located in local memory by the NMS client, and the NMS client does not have to access the NMS server.","In addition to reducing the time required to display physical information through GUI , limiting the initial data retrieval to only physical data reduces the amount of memory local to the NMS server required to store the managed objects. Moreover, once the data from the proxies are added to the GUI tables, the GUI can respond to a user request for any of the device views within the mimic (as shown in -) and to a user request for any physical tab without having to send data requests to the NMS server. Consequently, the GUI response time is increased, traffic between the NMS client and server is reduced and the burden on the server to respond to client requests is reduced.","If the proxies include all of the attribute data from the managed objects, then once the proxies are transferred to the NMS client, it is not necessary for the NMS server to continue storing the corresponding physical managed objects. If, however, a proxy includes only some of the attribute data from its corresponding managed object, then continuing to store the managed object at the NMS server saves time if the user requests access to data not included in the proxy. For example, a proxy may only include data for attributes displayed in a tab in status window . If a user desires more data, the user may double click the left mouse button on an entry in the tab to cause a dialog box to be displayed including additional attribute data. This causes the NMS client to place a Get Config function call to the corresponding proxy which causes the NMS client to send JAVA RMI messages to the NMS server. If the managed object is still in local memory , then the response time to the client is faster than if the server needs to access the configuration database again to retrieve the data.","Maintaining the managed objects for a particular network device in local memory is also advantageous if another NMS client requests access to the same network device. As previously mentioned, when the NMS server receives a network device access request, it first checks local memory . If the managed objects are already present, then the NMS server may respond more quickly than if the server again needs to retrieve the data from the network device.","Due to the advantages described above, in one embodiment, the NMS server does not automatically delete managed objects from its local memory after proxies are sent to the NMS client. However, because the NMS server's local memory is a limited resource, as clients request access to more and more different network devices, it may become necessary for the NMS server to overwrite managed objects within local memory such that they are no longer available. As previously mentioned, sending proxies to the NMS clients allows the clients to display physical data through GUI  without accessing the NMS server. Thus, even when the NMS server is forced to overwrite corresponding managed objects in local memory , the client is able to continue displaying physical data through GUI .","Importantly, through the unique PID and the function calls, the proxies also provide an improved mechanism for accessing logical data and physical data not included within the proxies. As mentioned above, if the user requests access to physical data not in the proxy, then the NMS client places a Get Config function call to the NMS server. The function call is made more efficient by including the unique PID stored in the proxy. The NMS server uses the PID to first search local memory \u2014perhaps the NMS server searches a hash table in cache. If the PID is found, then the NMS quickly sends the data from the corresponding managed object to the NMS client. If the PID is not found in local memory , then the NMS server uses the PID as a primary key to retrieve the physical data from the configuration database within the network device and again builds the corresponding physical managed object. The NMS server then sends the data from the managed object to the NMS client.","Without the PID, the NMS server would be forced to walk through the hierarchical physical tables until the correct physical component was found. For example, if the NMS server needs data relevant to a particular port, the NMS server would begin by locating the managed device, the chassis, then the correct shelf within the chassis, then the correct slot within the chassis, then the module within the slot and then finally the correct port on the module. This will likely take several database accesses and will certainly take more time than directly accessing the port data using a primary key that provides absolute context.","The process is similar if the data requested is logical. For example, if a user selects a particular port (e.g., port , ) and then selects SONET Paths tab  (), the logical data associated with the SONET paths configured for the selected port (e.g., SONET paths and ) is needed. To do this, the NMS client places a \u201cGet SONET Path Table\u201d function call to the port proxy which causes the NMS client to issue JAVA RMI messages to the NMS server including a request for the SONET paths configured for the physical port associated with the unique port PID stored in the proxy. The NMS server first searches local memory for the PID. If a managed object including the PID is found in local memory, then the NMS server places a similar \u201cGet SONET Path Table\u201d function call through the port managed object. If the PID is not found in local memory, then the NMS server uses the port PID as a primary key to quickly retrieve the data from the configuration database stored in the table row corresponding to the selected port. The NMS server again builds the managed object for the port and then places the \u201cGet SONET Path Table\u201d function call through the managed object. The Get SONET Path Table function call within the managed object causes the NMS server to generate database access commands to the configuration database within the network device to retrieve data corresponding to each SONET path configured for the selected port. Only some of the data in each row may be necessary to fill in the fields in the tab (e.g., SONET Paths tab , ).","Similar to the physical data, logical data is stored in tables within configuration database  (). The tables may be provided as part of a default configuration within the configuration database, or the tables may be created within the configuration database as each different type of table is needed. In one embodiment, configuration database  includes a SONET Path Table (e.g., \u2032, ), a Service End Point Table (e.g., \u2033, ), an ATM Interface Table (e.g., \u2033, ), a Virtual ATM Interface Table (e.g., , ), a Virtual Connection Table (e.g., , ), a Virtual Link Table (e.g., , ) and a Cross-Connect Table (e.g., , ). Tables corresponding to other physical layer or upper layer network protocols may also be included within configuration database .","The database access commands corresponding to the Get SONET Path Table function call include the port PID (from the proxy\/JAVA RMI messages) associated with the selected port. When the database access commands corresponding to the Get SONET Path Table function call are received by the configuration database, the configuration database locates each row in SONET Path Table \u2032 () including the selected port PID and returns to the NMS server the data from each row necessary for the SONET Paths tab. Thus, the retrieved data is limited to those rows\/records corresponding to the selected port and the data necessary for the tab. This allows the NMS server and NMS client to quickly respond to the user's request for logical data. If all SONET paths configured for all SONET ports within the network device (or worse, all logical data) were retrieved, then the response time would likely be much slower.","For each row of data the NMS server formats the data according to the SONET Paths tab display and sends it to the NMS client. The NMS client adds the data to the GUI tables which causes the GUI tables to display the SONET paths (e.g., and , ) configured for the selected port. Along with the data necessary for the SONET Paths tab, the NMS server also sends the LID for each logical managed object (i.e., each SONET path) and the NMS client saves the LID within the GUI tables, in one embodiment, within a column hidden from the user.","As previously discussed, to retrieve additional attribute data or change attribute data for a managed object, the user may simply double click the left mouse button on an entry in a tab in configuration\/status window  () to cause a dialog box to appear. When the user double clicks the left mouse button on the entry, the NMS client places a \u201cGet Config\u201d function call to the corresponding proxy and simultaneously opens a GUI dialog  () in local memory . If the selected entry is for a physical component of the network device, then the function call causes the NMS client to populate GUI dialog  with attribute data from the proxy. If the selected entry is for a logical component of the network device, for example, a SONET path, then the NMS client needs data from the configuration database within the network device to populate GUI dialog .","For example, if a user selects SONET path () from SONET Paths tab  and double clicks the left mouse button, the NMS client displays a SONET Path dialog box  (). To do this, when the user double clicks the left mouse button on the entry, the NMS client places a \u201cGet Config\u201d function call to the corresponding port proxy and simultaneously opens a GUI dialog  () in local memory . The function call causes the NMS client to send JAVA RMI messages to the NMS server including both the port PID from the proxy and the SONET path LID from the GUI table. The NMS server first searches local memory for the port PID. If a managed object including the port PID is found, then the NMS server issues a \u201cGet Config\u201d function call to the managed object including the SONET Path LID. If the port PID is not found, then the NMS server uses the port PID as a primary key into the configuration database to retrieve data from the row\/record corresponding to the port. The NMS server then creates the port managed object, stores it in local memory and issues the \u201cGet Config\u201d function call. The function call causes the NMS server to generate database access commands and send them to the configuration database within the selected network device.","The database access commands cause the configuration database to retrieve all the attribute data in the row in SONET Path Table \u2032 () corresponding to the SONET path LID. The server uses the retrieved data to build a configuration object and sends the configuration object to the NMS client. The NMS client then uses the configuration object to populate GUI dialog  with the data which causes the dialog box  () to display the data to the user.","If the user then selects a Cancel button or OK button , then the NMS client closes the dialog box. If the user selects Cancel button , then the NMS client closes and deletes GUI dialog  and takes no further action. If the user selects OK button , then it is assumed that the user made changes to one or more SONET path attributes and now wants those changes implemented. To implement any changes made to the SONET path attributes, when the NMS client detects the selection of the OK button, the NMS client places a \u201cSet Config\u201d function call to the corresponding port proxy. The function call causes the NMS client to send JAVA RMI messages to the NMS server including both the port PID from the proxy and the SONET path LID from the GUI table and the attributes for the SONET path. The NMS server first searches local memory for the port PID. If a managed object including the port PID is found, then the NMS server issues a \u201cSet Config\u201d function call to the managed object including the SONET Path LID. If the port PID is not found, then the NMS server uses the port PID as a primary key into the configuration database to retrieve data from the row\/record corresponding to the port. The NMS server then creates the port managed object, stores it in local memory and issues the \u201cSet Config\u201d function call. The function call causes the NMS server to generate database access commands and send them to the configuration database within the selected network device.","The database access commands cause the configuration database to locate the row in SONET Path Table \u2032 () corresponding to the SONET path LID and replace the attributes in that row with the attributes included in the database access commands. As discussed in detail above, when tables in the configuration database are updated an active query feature is used to notify other processes of the changes. For example, NMS database  () is automatically updated with any changes. NMS database  may be located within computer\/workstation  or  or within a separate computer\/workstation . In addition, the changes are sent to the NMS server which uses the data to re-build the configuration object. The NMS server then sends the configuration object to the NMS client. The NMS client uses the configuration object as an indication that the Set Config function call was successful. The NMS client then closes and deletes GUI dialog  and uses the received data to update the GUI tables .","Alternatively, proxies may be created for each logical managed object and sent to the NMS client. In a typical network device, however, there may be millions of logical managed objects making storage of all logical proxies in memory local to an NMS client difficult if not impossible. Moreover, since logical managed objects change frequently (as opposed to physical managed objects which do not change as frequently), the stored logical proxies would need to be updated frequently leading to an increased burden on both the NMS server and NMS client. Thus, in the preferred embodiment, only physical proxies are created and stored local to the NMS client.","Using the unique PIDs as primary keys allows for faster response times by the NMS server. First the PIDs are used to quickly check local memory \u2014perhaps hash tables in a cache. If the data is not in local memory, the PIDS are used as primary keys to perform a fast data retrieval from configuration database . If the PIDs were not used, the NMS server would need to navigate through the hierarchy of tables\u2014possibly performing multiple database accesses\u2014to locate the data of interest and, thus, response time would be much slower. As primary keys, the PIDs allow the NMS server to directly retrieve required data (i.e., table rows\/records) without having to navigate through upper level tables.","Since logical data corresponds to configured objects, rows are added to the tables when logical objects are configured. In addition, the NMS server assigns a unique logical identification number (LID) for each configured object and inserts this within each corresponding row. The LID, like the PID, is used as a primary key within the configuration database for the row\/data corresponding to each logical component. The NMS server and MCD use the same numbering space for LIDs, PIDs and other assigned numbers to ensure that the numbers are different (no collisions). In each row, the NMS server also inserts a unique PID or LID corresponding to a parent table (i.e., a foreign key for association) to provide data \u201ccontainment\u201d.","As described above with reference to -, a user may select a port or a SONET interface and then access a SONET path configuration wizard to configure SONET paths on the selected port\/interface. When the user selects OK button , the NMS client places a \u201cCreate SONET Path\u201d function call to the proxy corresponding to the selected port\/interface including the port PID in the proxy and the parameters provided by the user through the SONET path configuration wizard. The function call causes the NMS client to send JAVA\/RMI messages to the NMS server. The NMS server first searches local memory for the port PID. If a managed object including the port PID is found, then the NMS server issues a \u201cCreate SONET Path\u201d function call to the managed object including the port PID and the parameters sent by the NMS client. If the port PID is not found, then the NMS server uses the port PID as a primary key into the configuration database to retrieve data corresponding to the port. The NMS server then creates the port managed object, stores it in local memory and then issues the \u201cCreate SONET Path\u201d function call. The function call causes the NMS server to generate database access commands and send them to the configuration database within the selected network device.","The database access commands cause the configuration database to add a row in SONET Path Table \u2032 () for each SONET path created by the user. The NMS server assigns a unique path LID (i.e., primary key) to each SONET path and inserts this within the corresponding row. The NMS server also enters data representing attributes for each SONET path (e.g., time slot, number of time slots, etc.) and the unique port PID (i.e., foreign key for association) corresponding to the selected port.","As previously discussed, each SONET path corresponds to a port (e.g., , ) on a universal port card (e.g., ) and is connected through a cross-connection card (e.g., ) to a service end point corresponding to a port (i.e., slice) on a forwarding card (e.g., ). In one embodiment, after filling in one or more rows in SONET Path Table \u2032, the NMS server also fills in one or more corresponding rows in Service EndPoint Table (SET) \u2033 (). The NMS server assigns a unique service endpoint LID (i.e., primary key) to each service endpoint and inserts the service endpoint LID within a corresponding row. The NMS server also inserts the corresponding path LID (i.e., foreign key for association) within each row and may also insert attributes associated with each service endpoint. For example, the NMS server may insert the quadrant number corresponding to the selected port and may also insert other attributes (if provided by the user) such as the forwarding card slice PID () corresponding to the service end point, the forwarding card PID () on which the port\/slice is located and the forwarding card time slot (). Alternatively, the NMS server only provides the quadrant number attribute and a policy provisioning manager (PPM)  () decides which forwarding card, slice (i.e., payload extractor chip) and time slot (i.e., port) to assign to the new universal port card path, and once decided, the PPM fills in SET Table \u2033 attribute fields (i.e., self-completing configuration record).","For each service endpoint created, the database access commands also cause the configuration database to add a row in an interface table. For example, for each service endpoint corresponding to a SONET path configured for ATM service\u2014that is, service field () indicates ATM service\u2014a row is added to ATM Interface Table \u2033 (). Alternatively, if service field is configured for another service, for example, IP, MPLS or Frame Relay, then a row would be added to an interface table corresponding to that upper layer network protocol. The NMS server assigns a unique ATM interface (IF) LID (i.e., primary key) and within each row inserts both the assigned ATM IF LID and the service endpoint LID (i.e., foreign key for association) corresponding to each ATM interface. The NMS server also inserts in each row data representing attributes (e.g., ATM group number) for each ATM interface. The attribute data may be default values and\/or data received within the database access commands.","Again, when tables in the configuration database are updated an active query feature is used to notify other processes including NMS database  () and any NMS server currently connected to the network device, for example, NMS server . Each NMS server builds a configuration object for each changed logical managed object and sends the configuration object to any NMS clients that currently have access to the network device corresponding to the changed logical managed objects, for example, NMS client . The NMS clients use the received configured object to update GUI tables  and display the configuration changes to a user. Thus, the user that created the SONET path(s) would then be able to see the new paths displayed in SONET path tab  () and new ATM interfaces displayed in ATM interface tab  ().","Similarly, a user may select Virtual ATM Interfaces tab  () and then select Add button to add a virtual ATM interface to an ATM interface selected in navigation tree . When the user selects OK button () in virtual ATM interfaces dialog box , the NMS client places an \u201cAdd Virtual ATM Interface\u201d function call to the proxy corresponding to the port associated with the selected ATM interface. The function call includes the ATM interface LID (stored in the GUI table), the corresponding port PID and the parameters provided by the user through the ATM interfaces dialog box. The function call causes the NMS client to send JAVA RMI messages to the NMS server. The NMS server first searches local memory for the port PID. If a managed object including the port PID is found, then the NMS server issues an \u201cAdd Virtual ATM Interface\u201d function call to the managed object including the ATM interfaces LID and the parameters sent by the NMS client. If the port PID is not found, then the NMS server uses the port PID as a primary key into the configuration database to retrieve data corresponding to the port. The NMS server then creates the port managed object, stores it in local memory and issues the \u201cAdd Virtual ATM Interface\u201d function call.

The NMS server also enters data representing attributes (e.g., A-An) for the virtual ATM interface and the unique ATM interface LID (i.e., foreign key for association) corresponding to the selected ATM interface in navigation tree (). Again, through the active query feature, the NMS database and NMS server are notified of the changes made to the configuration database. The NMS server builds a configuration object and sends it to the NMS client which updates the GUI tables to display the added virtual ATM interface (e.g., , ) to Virtual ATM Interfaces tab . The configuration object may be temporarily stored in local memory . However, once the GUI tables are updated, the NMS client deletes the configured object from local memory .","Because there may be many upper layer network protocol interfaces in network device , the port managed object and port proxy may become very large as more and more function calls (e.g., Add Virtual ATM Interface, Add Virtual MPLS Interface, etc.) are added for each type of interface. To limit the size of the port managed object and port proxy, all interface function calls may be added to logical proxies corresponding to logical upper layer protocol nodes. For example, an ATM node table  () may be included in configuration database , and when ATM service is first configured by a user on network device , the NMS server assigns an ATM node LID (e.g., ) and inserts the ATM node LID and the managed device PID (e.g., ) in one row in the ATM node table. The NMS server may also insert any attributes (A-An). The NMS server then retrieves the data in the row and creates an ATM logical managed object (ATM LMO). Like the physical managed objects, the ATM logical managed object includes the assigned LID (e.g., ), attribute data and function calls. The function calls include Get Proxy and interface related function calls like Add Virtual ATM Interface. The NMS server stores the ATM LMO in local memory and issues a Get Proxy function call. After creating the ATM proxy (ATM PX), the NMS server sends the ATM proxy to memory  local to NMS client . The NMS client uses the ATM proxy to update GUI tables , and then uses it to later make function calls to get ATM interface related data from configuration database .","Thus, after the user selects OK button () in virtual ATM interfaces dialog box , the NMS client places an \u201cAdd Virtual ATM Interface\u201d function call to the ATM node proxy.

One or more rows are necessary, however, to represent a point-to-multipoint connection. In each of the other rows, Virtual Link  LID representing the source endpoint remains the same but in each row a different Virtual Link  LID is added representing the various destination endpoints.

As described above, memory local to each NMS client is utilized to store proxies corresponding to managed objects associated with physical components within a network device selected by a user. Proxies for logical managed objects corresponding to upper layer network protocol nodes (e.g., ATM node, IP node, MPLS node, Frame Relay node, etc.) may also be stored in memory local to each NMS client to limit the size of physical port proxies. The proxies reduce the load on the network\/NMS server by allowing the NMS client to respond to user requests for physical network device data and views without having to access the NMS server. Storing data local to the NMS client improves the scalability of the NMS server by not requiring the NMS server to maintain the managed objects in memory local to the server. Thus, as multiple NMS clients request access to different network devices, the NMS server may, if necessary, overwrite managed objects within its local memory without disrupting the NMS client's ability to display physical network device information to the user and issue function calls to the NMS server. Response time to a user's request for access to a network device is also improved by initially only retrieving physical data as opposed to retrieving both physical and logical data.","In addition, unique identification numbers\u2014both PIDs and LIDs\u2014may also be stored in memory local to the NMS client (e.g., within proxies or GUI tables) to provide improved data request response times. Instead of navigating through the hierarchy of tables within the relational configuration database internal to the network device, the NMS server is able to use the unique identification numbers as primary keys to directly retrieve the specific data needed. Providing the unique identification numbers from the NMS client to the NMS server insures that even if the NMS server needed to overwrite managed objects within memory local to the NMS server, the NMS server will be able to quickly re-generate the managed objects and quickly retrieve the necessary data.","The unique identification numbers\u2014both PIDs and LIDs\u2014may be used in a variety of ways. For example, as previously mentioned, the device mimic () is linked with status window , such that selecting a module in device mimic causes the Module tab to highlight a line in the inventory corresponding to that card. The unique PIDs and LIDs are utilized to make this link between the status window and the device mimic.","It will be understood that variations and modifications of the above described methods and apparatuses will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art and may be made without departing from the inventive concepts described herein. Accordingly, the embodiments described herein are to be viewed merely as illustrative, and not limiting, and the inventions are to be limited solely by the scope and spirit of the appended
