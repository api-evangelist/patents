Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a metal nanowire-containing composition excellent in thermal stability, and a transparent conductor using the metal nanowire-containing composition.","2. Description of the Related Art","A variety of studies have been made on conductive materials using metal nanowires. For instance, there has been proposed in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2007\/0074316 a transparent conductor using metal nanowires. Also, there has been proposed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) No. 2005-317395 a conductor paste containing metal nanowires.","In these proposals, however, forming of nano-structured metals causes the metals to be thermally unstable, and it is desired to improve the thermal stability of nano-structured metals.","An object of the present invention is to provide a metal nanowire-containing composition which is improved in thermal stability, without impairing its excellent transparency, conductivity and durability, and to provide a transparent conductor using the metal nanowire-containing composition.","The following are means for solving the aforesaid problems:","<1> A metal nanowire-containing composition containing at least a metal nanowire, and a heterocyclic compound having an interaction potential of less than \u22121 mV.","<2> The metal nanowire-containing composition according to <1>, wherein the metal nanowire has a diameter of 50 nm or less and a length of 5 \u03bcm or longer, and the metal nanowire is contained in an amount, as metal, of 50% by mass or more in the total amount of metal particles.\n\n<3> The metal nanowire-containing composition according to one of <1> and <2>, wherein the metal nanowire contains silver.\n\n<4> The metal nanowire-containing composition according to any one of <1> to <3>, further containing an aqueous solvent, and being in the form of an aqueous dispersion.\n\n<5> A transparent conductor having a transparent conductive layer which contains a metal nanowire-containing composition, wherein the metal nanowire-containing composition contains at least a metal nanowire, and a heterocyclic compound having an interaction potential of less than \u22121 mV.\n\n<6> The transparent conductor according to <5>, used in one of a touch panel and a solar cell panel.\n","According to the present invention, it is possible to solve the problems pertinent in the related art and to provide a metal nanowire-containing composition which is improved in thermal stability, without impairing its excellent transparency, conductivity and durability, and to provide a transparent conductor using the metal nanowire-containing composition.","A metal nanowire-containing composition according to the present invention contains at least a metal nanowire and a heterocyclic compound, and further contains other components in accordance with the necessity.","<Metal Nanowire>","The metal nanowire has a diameter of 50 nm or smaller and a length of 5 \u03bcm or longer, and the metal nanowire having such a diameter and such a length is contained in an amount of metal of 50% by mass or more in the total amount of metal particles.","In the present invention, the term \u201cmetal nanowire(s)\u201d means a metal nanowire or metal nanowire particles having an aspect ratio (length\/diameter) of 30 or more.","The diameter (minor axis length) of the metal nanowire is preferably 50 nm or smaller, more preferably 35 nm or smaller, still more preferably 20 nm or smaller. When the diameter is excessively small, the resistance to oxidation and the durability of the metal nanowire may degrade. Thus the diameter is preferably 5 nm or larger. When the diameter is larger than 50 nm, it may be impossible to obtain sufficient transparency due to scattering which is presumed to be attributable to the metal nanowire. The length (major axis length) of the metal nanowire is preferably 5 \u03bcm or longer, more preferably 10 \u03bcm or longer, still more preferably 30 \u03bcm or longer. When the major axis length of the metal nanowire is excessively long, the metal nanowire particles may entangle to each other, and aggregates may occur in the course of production. Thus, the major axis length of the metal nanowire is preferably 1 mm or shorter. When the major axis length is shorter than 5 \u03bcm, it may be difficult to form a dense network, and so that it may be impossible to obtain sufficient conductivity.","The diameter and the major axis length of the metal nanowire can be determined, for example, by observing TEM images and optical microscopic images of the metal nanowire, which are taken by a transmission electron microscope (TEM) and an optical microscope. In the present invention, 300 particles of metal nanowire were observed through a transmission electron microscope (TEM) to determine each average value of diameters and major axis lengths, and from these average values, the diameter and the major axis length of the metal nanowire were determined.","In the present invention, it is preferable that a metal nanowire whose diameter (minor axis length) is 50 nm or smaller and whose length (major axis length) of 5 \u03bcm or longer be contained in an amount of metal of 50% by mass or more in the total amount of metal particles, more preferably contained in an amount of 60% by mass or more, still more preferably contained in an amount of 75% by mass or more.","When the rate of the amount of a metal nanowire whose diameter is 50 nm or smaller and whose length of 5 \u03bcm or longer (hereinafter, otherwise referred to as \u201cappropriate wiring rate\u201d) is less than 50% by mass, the conductivity may degrade, which is presumed because the amount of metal contributing to the conductivity is reduced, and simultaneously, voltage concentration occurs due to impossibility of forming a dense network, thereby possibly leading to reduction in durability. Also, when particles other than nanowire particles have spherical shape or the like and strong plasmon absorption, the transparency of the metal nanowire may degrade.","Here, the appropriate wiring rate can be determined in the following manner. For instance, in the case where the metal nanowire is a silver nanowire, an aqueous dispersion liquid of the silver nanowire is filtered to separate silver nanowire particles from particles other then the silver nanowire particles, and the amount of Ag remaining on the paper filter and the amount of Ag passed through the paper filter are respectively measured by means of ICP (inductively coupled plasma) spectrometer, and thereby the appropriate wiring rate can be determined. The metal nanowire particles remaining on the paper filter are then observed by a transmission electron microscope (TEM), and diameters of 300 particles of metal nanowire are observed, and its particle size distribution is examined, thereby confirming that the metal nanowire is a metal nanowire having a diameter of 50 nm or smaller and a length of 5 \u03bcm or longer. As for the filter paper, firstly, the maximum major axis of particles other than particles of metal nanowire having a diameter of 50 nm or smaller and a length of 5 \u03bcm or longer is measured from the TEM image, and it is preferable to use a filter paper having a pore size about five times the maximum major axis length or larger and one-half the minimum minor axis length of the wire major axis or smaller.","The coefficient of variation in diameter of the metal nanowire of the present invention is preferably 40% or less, more preferably 35% or less, still more preferably 30% or less.","When the coefficient of variation in diameter is more than 40%, the voltage is liable to concentrate on wire particles of small diameter, possibly leading to degradation of durability.","As for the coefficient of variation in diameter of the metal nanowire, for instance, diameters of 300 particles of the metal nanowire are measured from transmission electron microscope (TEM) images, and the standard deviation and average value are calculated to thereby determine the coefficient of variation.","The metal nanowire of the present invention can be formed so as to take an arbitrary shape, for example, a cylindrical shape, and a columnar shape with a polygonal cross-section. In application where high transparency is required, preferably, the metal nanowire takes a cylindrical shape or has a polygonal cross-section whose angles (polygonal cross-section angles) being rounded off.","Specifically, an aqueous dispersion liquid of metal nanowire is applied onto a base material, and the cross-section of the metal nanowire can be identified by observation using a transmission electron microscope (TEM).","The wording \u201ccross-section angles of metal nanowire\u201d means outer circumferential portions of a polygonal cross-section, at individual points each intersecting with a line which is dropped off perpendicularly from adjacent two sides of the polygonal cross-section when individual sides of the cross-section are two-dimensionally extended. The wording \u201cindividual sides of the cross-section\u201d is defined by straight lines each drawn from adjacent angles to each intersection. In this case, the rate of a length of \u201cthe outer circumferential portions of the cross-section\u201d relative to a total length of \u201cthe individual sides of a polygonal cross-section\u201d is defined as a degree of sharpness. The degree of sharpness can be represented, for example, in a cross-section of metal nanowire as illustrated in , by a ratio of the circumferential length of the cross-section indicated by a solid line to the circumferential length of the pentagon. A cross-sectional shape having a degree of sharpness of 75% or less is defined as a \u201ccross-sectional shape having rounded angles\u201d. The degree of sharpness is preferably 60% or less, more preferably 50% or less. When the degree of sharpness is more than 75%, electrons locally exist at these angles to cause an increase in plasmon absorption, possibly leading to degradation in transparency of the metal nanowire, due to yellow-tinged residue or the like.","The metal used for the metal nanowire is not particularly limited and any metal may be used. For example, besides a single use of metal, a combination of two or more metals may be used, and may be used in the form of metal alloy. A metal nanowire formed of metal or a metal compound is preferable, and a metal nanowire formed of metal is more preferable.","The metal is preferably at least one selected from the group consisting of metal elements of the Period Group 4, Period Group 5 and Period Group 6 in the long-form periodic table (IUPAC 1991); more preferably at least one selected from the group consisting of metal elements of the Group 2 through Group 14, and still more preferably at least one selected from the group consisting of metal elements of the Group 2, and Groups 8 through 14. Particularly preferably, the metal nanowire contains these metals as the main component.","Specific examples of the metal include copper, silver, gold, platinum, palladium, nickel, tin, cobalt, rhodium, iridium, iron, ruthenium, osmium, manganese, molybdenum, tungsten, niobium, tantalum, titanium, bismuth, antimony, lead, and alloys thereof. Among these, preferred are copper, silver, gold, platinum, palladium, nickel, tin, cobalt, rhodium, iridium, and alloys thereof, more preferred are palladium, copper, silver, gold, platinum, tin and alloys thereof, and particularly preferred are silver and alloys containing silver.","<Method for Producing Metal Nanowire>","The method for producing a metal nanowire includes adding a metal complex solution into an aqueous solution containing at least a halogen compound and a reducing agent, and heating the resulting mixture at a temperature of 150\u00b0 C. or lower, and further includes a desalination process.","The metal complex is not particularly limited and may be suitably selected in accordance with the intended use, however, a silver complex is particularly preferable. As ligands of the silver complex, for example, CN\u2014, SCN\u2014, SO, thiourea, and ammonia are exemplified. These silver complexes can be referred to the description in \u201cThe Theory of the Photographic Process 4Edition\u201d Macmillan Publishing, written by T. H. James. Among these silver complexes, a silver ammonia complex is particularly preferable. The metal complex is preferably added to the aqueous solution to which a dispersant and a halogen compound have been added. By doing so, the ratio of amount of metal nanowire particles having appropriate diameters and appropriate lengths can be effectively increased because of its high-probability of formation of wire nuclei.","The solvent is preferably a hydrophilic solvent. Examples of the hydrophilic solvent include alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, and butanol; ethers such as dioxane, and tetrahydrofuran; ketones such as acetone: and cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, and dioxane.","The heating temperature is preferably 150\u00b0 C. or lower, more preferably 20\u00b0 C. to 130\u00b0 C., still more preferably 30\u00b0 C. to 100\u00b0 C., and particularly preferably 40\u00b0 C. to 90\u00b0 C. If necessary, the heating temperature may be varied in the course of forming particles. Varying the heating temperature in midstream may sometimes be effective in control of nuclei formation, prevention of occurrence of reproduced nuclei, and improvement of the monodispersibility attributable to acceleration of selective growth.","When the heating temperature is higher than 150\u00b0 C., angles constituting the nanowire cross-section become acute, possibly leasing to a decrease in the transmittance in evaluation of the resulting coating film. Also, the lower the heating temperature is, the lower the probability of nuclei formation and the longer the metal nanowire is, and so that the metal nanowire particles easily entangle to each other, possibly leading to degradation in the dispersion stability. This tendency becomes conspicuous at a temperature of 20\u00b0 C. or lower.","In the heating treatment, it is preferable to use a reducing agent. The reducing agent is not particularly limited, and may be suitably selected from among commonly used reducing agents. Examples thereof include metal salts of boron hydrides such as sodium boron hydride, and potassium boron hydride; aluminum hydride salts such as lithium aluminum hydride, potassium aluminum hydride, cesium aluminum hydride, beryllium aluminum hydride, magnesium aluminum hydride, and calcium aluminum hydride; sodium sulfites, hydrazine compounds, dextrin, hydroquinone, hydroxylamine, citric acids or salts thereof, succinic acids or salts thereof, and ascorbic acids or salts thereof, alkanol amines such as diethylaminoethanol, ethanolamine, propanolamine, triethanolamine, and dimethylamino-propanol; aliphatic amines such as propyl amine, butyl amine, dipropylene amine, ethylene diamine, and triethylene pentamine; heterocyclic amines such as piperidine, pyrrolidine, N-methylpyrrolidine, and morpholine; aromatic amines such as aniline, N-methyl aniline, toluidine, anisidine, and phenetidine; aralkyl amines such as benzylamine, xylenediamine, and N-methyl benzylamine; alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, and 2-propanol; ethylene glycol, glutathione, organic acids (e.g. citric acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, etc.); reducing sugars (e.g. glucose, galactose, mannose, fructose, sucrose, maltose, raffinose, stachyose, etc.), and sugar alcohols (sorbitol, etc.). Among these, reducing sugars, and sugar alcohols as derivatives thereof are particularly preferable.","Note that in some cases reducing agents can function as dispersants depending on the type thereof, and such reducing agents can be preferably used.","The addition of the reducing agent may be before or after the addition of a dispersant, and may be before or after the addition of a halogen compound.","In production of the metal nanowire, a halogen compound is preferably added to the metal nanowire-containing composition. The halogen compound is not particularly limited as long as it is a compound containing bromine, chlorine, and iodine, and may be suitably selected in accordance with the intended use. For example, alkali halides such as sodium bromide, sodium chloride, sodium iodide, potassium iodide, potassium bromide, potassium chloride, and potassium iodide; and substances to be used in combination with the following dispersants are preferred. The addition of the halogen compound may be before or after the addition of the dispersant, and may be before or after the addition of the reducing agent.","Note that in some cases halogen compounds can function as dispersants depending on the type thereof, and such halogen compounds can be preferably used.","Instead of the halogen compound, halogenated silver fine particles may be used, or halogenated silver fine particles may be used along with the halogen compound.","A combination of a dispersant in combination with a halogen compound or halogenated silver fine particles may be used as one compound. Examples of a compound composed of a dispersant in combination with a halogen compound include HTAB (hexadecyl-trimethyl ammonium bromide) which contains amino groups and bromide ions, and HTAC (hexadecyl-trimethyl ammonium chloride) which contains amino groups and bromide ions.","In production of the metal nanowire, it is preferable to add a dispersant to the metal nanowire-containing composition.","The dispersant is added before preparation of particles and may be added in the presence of a dispersion polymer, or may be added to control the dispersed condition after particles have been prepared. The addition process of the dispersant is divided into two or more steps, it is necessary to vary the addition amount of the dispersant depending on the required length of wire. This is considered to be attributable to a length of wire obtained by controlling the amount of metal particles to be nuclei.","As the dispersant, there may be exemplified amino group-containing compounds, thiol group-containing compounds, sulfide group-containing compounds, amino acids or derivatives thereof, peptide compounds, polysaccharides, and polymers such as natural polymers and synthetic polymers derived from polysaccharides, and gels derived therefrom.","The polymers are, for example, polymers having colloid-protection property. Examples of such polymers are gelatin, polyvinyl alcohol, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, polyalkylene amine, partial alkyl esters of polyacrylic acids, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, and polyvinyl pyrrolidone copolymers.","Structures usable for the dispersant can be referred, for example, to the description in \u201c(Pigment Dictionary)\u201d, Asakura Publishing Co., Ltd., edited by Seijiro Ito, 2000. The shape of the resulting metal nanowire can be changed depending on the type of dispersant used.","The desalination process can be performed by ultrafiltration, dialysis, gel filtration, decantation, centrifugal separation or the like, after metal nanowire have been formed.","<Heterocyclic Compound>","The heterocyclic compound preferably has an interaction potential of less than \u22121 mV, more preferably has an interaction potential of less than \u221270 mV. When the interaction potential is \u22121 mV or more, the thermal stability, which is an effect of the present invention, may not be obtained, and precipitation, etc. of the heterocyclic compound may be caused.","Here, the interaction potential can be determined by the following method.","Firstly, 50 mL of a solution having a heterocyclic compound concentration of 0.00100 M, a potassium bicarbonate concentration of 0.0200 M and a potassium carbonate concentration of 0.0267 M is prepared, and the pH of the solution is adjusted to 10.0 using 1 M of nitric acid or sodium hydrate. Then, 1 mL of 0.00500 M silver nitrate is added to the solution at a temperature of 20\u00b0 C. to 25\u00b0 C. while magnetically stirring. Subsequently, a potential after 15 minutes of the addition of the silver nitrate is measured by an electrochemical method using a calomel electrode. A value of potential represented by a unit of mV, which is determined at this point in time, is an interaction potential.","The interaction potential is a scale of an interaction between the metal nanowire and the heterocyclic compound, i.e. a scale indicating the adsorption force of the heterocyclic compound onto the metal nanowire particles. When the interaction potential is small, it indicates that the adsorption force of the heterocyclic compound onto the metal nanowire particles is strong. In contrast, when the interaction potential is large, it indicates that the adsorption force of the heterocyclic compound onto the metal nanowire particles is weak.","Note that an interaction potential measured using silver ions is used to represent the interaction potential, however, other metal ions tend to have a similar result to that of silver ions.","Here, the \u201cheterocyclic compound\u201d is a compound having a heterocycle containing at least one hetero atom. The \u201chetero atom\u201d means an atom other than a carbon atom and a hydrogen atom. The heterocycle means a ring compound having at least one hetero atom. The heterocyclic compound may have any number of hetero atoms. It should be noted that the hetero atom means only an atom that constitutes a constituent portion of a ring system of the heterocycle but not an atom located outside of the ring system, nor an atom separated from the ring system via at least one non-conjugate single bond, and nor an atom that is a part of a further substituent of the ring system.","Preferred examples of the hetero atoms include a nitrogen atom, a sulfur atom, an oxygen atom, a selenium atom, a tellurium atom, a phosphorus atom, a silicon atom and a boron atom. More preferred examples thereof include a nitrogen atom, a sulfur atom, an oxygen atom and a selenium atom. Particularly preferred examples thereof include a nitrogen atom, a sulfur atom and an oxygen atom. Most preferred examples thereof include a nitrogen atom and a sulfur atom.","The heterocyclic compound which may be employed by the present invention is not particularly limited in the number of members of its heterocyclic rings, however, the heterocyclic compound preferably has three to eight heterocyclic ring members, more preferably five to seven heterocyclic ring members, and still more preferably five or six heterocyclic ring members.","The heterocyclic ring may be saturated or unsaturated, but the heterocyclic ring preferably has at least one unsaturated site, and more preferably has at least two unsaturated sites. In other words, the heterocyclic ring may be any one of an aromatic heterocyclic ring, a pseudoaromatic heterocyclic ring and a non-aromatic heterocyclic ring, but preferred are an aromatic heterocyclic ring and a pseudoaromatic heterocyclic ring, and more preferred is an aromatic heterocyclic ring.","Specific examples of the heterocyclic rings include a pyrrole ring, a thiophene ring, a furan ring, an imidazole ring, a pyrazole ring, thiazole ring, an isothiazole ring, an oxazole ring, an isooxazole ring, 1,2,4-triazole ring, 1,2,3-triazole ring, a tetrazole ring, 1,2,5-thiazole ring, 1,3,4-thiazole ring, 1,2,3,4-thiatriazole ring, a pyridine ring, a pyrazine ring, a pyrimidine ring, a pyridazine ring, and indolizine ring.","Further, the following benzo-condensed rings of the above rings are also exemplified: an indole ring, a benzofuran ring, a benzothiophene ring, an isobenzofuran ring, a benzimidazole ring, a benzotriazole ring, a benzothiadiazole ring, a benzooxadiazole ring, a quinolidine ring, a quinoline ring, a phtharazine ring, a quinoxaline ring, an isoquinoline ring, a carbazole ring, a phenanthridine ring, a phenanthroline ring, an acridine ring, a purine ring, 4,4\u2032-bipyridine ring, 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane ring, and 4,4\u2032-trimethylenedipyridine ring.","Further, a pyrrolidine ring, a pyrroline ring and an imidazoline ring, etc. each formed by partial saturation or total saturation of the rings described above are also exemplified.","The following are examples of typical heterocyclic rings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"chemistry":[{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"232.83mm","wi":"51.65mm","file":"US08883045-20141111-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"235.80mm","wi":"51.82mm","file":"US08883045-20141111-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"15.66mm","wi":"52.07mm","file":"US08883045-20141111-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}]},"The following are examples of heterocyclic rings formed by condensation of benzene ring.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"chemistry":[{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"209.38mm","wi":"54.44mm","file":"US08883045-20141111-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00005","num":"00005"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00005","he":"240.20mm","wi":"56.56mm","file":"US08883045-20141111-C00005.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00006","num":"00006"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00006","he":"229.95mm","wi":"56.56mm","file":"US08883045-20141111-C00006.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00007","num":"00007"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00007","he":"106.68mm","wi":"51.56mm","file":"US08883045-20141111-C00007.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}]},"The following are examples of partially or fully saturated heterocyclic rings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"chemistry":[{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00008","num":"00008"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00008","he":"234.70mm","wi":"47.07mm","file":"US08883045-20141111-C00008.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00009","num":"00009"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00009","he":"196.93mm","wi":"56.47mm","file":"US08883045-20141111-C00009.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}]},"Besides the above, the following heterocyclic rings may be used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00010","num":"00010"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00010","he":"139.78mm","wi":"54.44mm","file":"US08883045-20141111-C00010.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"The ring structures may be substituted or condensed with any kind of substituent, and as the substituent, the after-mentioned Ws are exemplified.
