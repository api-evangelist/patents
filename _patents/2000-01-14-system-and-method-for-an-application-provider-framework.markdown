{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DISCLOSURE OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention relates to application service providers (ASPs) and more particularly to improving existing application infrastructures of ASPs.","An important use of computers is the transfer of information over a network. Currently, the largest computer network in existence is the Internet. The Internet is a worldwide interconnection of computer networks that communicate using a common protocol. Millions of computers, from low end personal computers to high-end super computers are coupled to the Internet.","The Internet grew out of work funded in the 1960s by the U.S. Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency. For a long time, Internet was used by researchers in universities and national laboratories to share information. As the existence of the Internet became more widely known, many users outside of the academic\/research community (e.g., employees of large corporations) started to use Internet to carry electronic mail.","In 1989, a new type of information system known as the World-Wide-Web (\u201cthe Web\u201d) was introduced to the Internet. Early development of the Web took place at CERN, the European Particle Physics Laboratory. The Web is a wide-area hypermedia information retrieval system aimed to give wide access to a large universe of documents. At that time, the Web was known to and used by the academic\/research community only. There was no easily available tool which allows a technically untrained person to access the Web.","In 1993, researchers at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) released a Web browser called \u201cMosaic\u201d that implemented a graphical user interface (GUI). Mosaic's graphical user interface was simple to learn yet powerful. The Mosaic browser allows a user to retrieve documents from the World-Wide-Web using simple point-and-click commands. Because the user does not have to be technically trained and the browser is pleasant to use, it has the potential of opening up the Internet to the masses.","The architecture of the Web follows a conventional client-server model. The terms \u201cclient\u201d and \u201cserver\u201d are used to refer to a computer's general role as a requester of data (the client) or provider of data (the server). Under the Web environment, Web browsers reside in clients and Web documents reside in servers. Web clients and Web servers communicate using a protocol called \u201cHyperText Transfer Protocol\u201d (HTTP). A browser opens a connection to a server and initiates a request for a document. The server delivers the requested document, typically in the form of a text document coded in a standard Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) format, and when the connection is closed in the above interaction, the server serves a passive role, i.e., it accepts commands from the client and cannot request the client to perform any action.","The communication model under the conventional Web environment provides a very limited level of interaction between clients and servers. In many systems, increasing the level of interaction between components in the systems often makes the systems more robust, but increasing the interaction increases the complexity of the interaction and typically slows the rate of the interaction. Thus, the conventional Web environment provides less complex, faster interactions because of the Web's level of interaction between clients and servers.","A system, method and article of manufacture are provided for improving an existing application infrastructure of an application service provider. First, a user is prompted to identify at least one aspect of an existing application infrastructure of an application service provider utilizing a network. Next, the identification of the aspect of the existing application infrastructure is received utilizing the network, and the aspect is translated into a common structure such that the structure is stored in a knowledge base. Such common structure is subsequently analyzed using a spreadsheet stored in a database, and the spreadsheet includes predefined rules that are used to identify upgrades to the existing application infrastructure. Further, upgrades to the existing application infrastructure are suggested and displayed based on the analysis utilizing the network.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the aspect of the existing application infrastructure includes an ability of the application service provider to deliver applications over the network. As an option, results of the analysis may be assessed after which the assessment may be provided the user with the assessment.","In another embodiment of the present invention, the user may be prompted to identify the aspect of the existing application infrastructure by querying the user. Further, the upgrades may include adding components of the existing application infrastructure that are currently missing.","A preferred embodiment of a system in accordance with the present invention is preferably practiced in the context of a personal computer such as an IBM compatible personal computer, Apple Macintosh computer or UNIX based workstation. A representative hardware environment is depicted in , which illustrates a typical hardware configuration of a workstation in accordance with a preferred embodiment having a central processing unit , such as a microprocessor, and a number of other units interconnected via a system bus . The workstation shown in  includes a Random Access Memory (RAM) , Read Only Memory (ROM) , an I\/O adapter  for connecting peripheral devices such as disk storage units  to the bus , a user interface adapter  for connecting a keyboard , a mouse , a speaker , a microphone , and\/or other user interface devices such as a touch screen (not shown) to the bus , communication adapter  for connecting the workstation to a communication network (e.g., a data processing network) and a display adapter  for connecting the bus  to a display device . The workstation typically has resident thereon an operating system such as the Microsoft Windows NT or Windows\/95 Operating System (OS), the IBM OS\/2 operating system, the MAC OS, or UNIX operating system. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention may also be implemented on platforms and operating systems other than those mentioned.","A preferred embodiment is written using JAVA, C, and the C++ language and utilizes object oriented programming methodology. Object oriented programming (OOP) has become increasingly used to develop complex applications. As OOP moves toward the mainstream of software design and development, various software solutions require adaptation to make use of the benefits of OOP. A need exists for these principles of OOP to be applied to a messaging interface of an electronic messaging system such that a set of OOP classes and objects for the messaging interface can be provided. OOP is a process of developing computer software using objects, including the steps of analyzing the problem, designing the system, and constructing the program. An object is a software package that contains both data and a collection of related structures and procedures. Since it contains both data and a collection of structures and procedures, it can be visualized as a self-sufficient component that does not require other additional structures, procedures or data to perform its specific task. OOP, therefore, views a computer program as a collection of largely autonomous components, called objects, each of which is responsible for a specific task. This concept of packaging data, structures, and procedures together in one component or module is called encapsulation.","In general, OOP components are reusable software modules which present an interface that conforms to an object model and which are accessed at run-time through a component integration architecture. A component integration architecture is a set of architecture mechanisms which allow software modules in different process spaces to utilize each others capabilities or functions. This is generally done by assuming a common component object model on which to build the architecture. It is worthwhile to differentiate between an object and a class of objects at this point. An object is a single instance of the class of objects, which is often just called a class. A class of objects can be viewed as a blueprint, from which many objects can be formed.","OOP allows the programmer to create an object that is a part of another object. For example, the object representing a piston engine is said to have a composition-relationship with the object representing a piston. In reality, a piston engine comprises a piston, valves and many other components; the fact that a piston is an element of a piston engine can be logically and semantically represented in OOP by two objects.","OOP also allows creation of an object that \u201cdepends from\u201d another object. If there are two objects, one representing a piston engine and the other representing a piston engine wherein the piston is made of ceramic, then the relationship between the two objects is not that of composition. A ceramic piston engine does not make up a piston engine. Rather it is merely one kind of piston engine that has one more limitation than the piston engine; its piston is made of ceramic. In this case, the object representing the ceramic piston engine is called a derived object, and it inherits all of the aspects of the object representing the piston engine and adds further limitation or detail to it. The object representing the ceramic piston engine \u201cdepends from\u201d the object representing the piston engine. The relationship between these objects is called inheritance.","When the object or class representing the ceramic piston engine inherits all of the aspects of the objects representing the piston engine, it inherits the thermal characteristics of a standard piston defined in the piston engine class. However, the ceramic piston engine object overrides these ceramic specific thermal characteristics, which are typically different from those associated with a metal piston. It skips over the original and uses new functions related to ceramic pistons. Different kinds of piston engines have different characteristics, but may have the same underlying functions associated with it (e.g., how many pistons in the engine, ignition sequences, lubrication, etc.). To access each of these functions in any piston engine object, a programmer would call the same functions with the same names, but each type of piston engine may have different\/overriding implementations of functions behind the same name. This ability to hide different implementations of a function behind the same name is called polymorphism and it greatly simplifies communication among objects.","With the concepts of composition-relationship, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism, an object can represent just about anything in the real world. In fact, logical perception of the reality is the only limit on determining the kinds of things that can become objects in object-oriented software. Some typical categories are as follows:\n\n","With this enormous capability of an object to represent just about any logically separable matters, OOP allows the software developer to design and implement a computer program that is a model of some aspects of reality, whether that reality is a physical entity, a process, a system, or a composition of matter. Since the object can represent anything, the software developer can create an object which can be used as a component in a larger software project in the future.","If 90% of a new OOP software program consists of proven, existing components made from preexisting reusable objects, then only the remaining 10% of the new software project has to be written and tested from scratch. Since 90% already came from an inventory of extensively tested reusable objects, the potential domain from which an error could originate is 10% of the program. As a result, OOP enables software developers to build objects out of other, previously built objects.","This process closely resembles complex machinery being built out of assemblies and sub-assemblies. OOP technology, therefore, makes software engineering more like hardware engineering in that software is built from existing components, which are available to the developer as objects. All this adds up to an improved quality of the software as well as an increased speed of its development.","Programming languages are beginning to fully support the OOP principles, such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and composition-relationship. With the advent of the C++ language, many commercial software developers have embraced OOP. C++ is an OOP language that offers a fast, machine-executable code. Furthermore, C++ is suitable for both commercial-application and systems-programming projects. For now, C++ appears to be the most popular choice among many OOP programmers, but there is a host of other OOP languages, such as Smalltalk, Common Lisp Object System (CLOS), and Eiffel. Additionally, OOP capabilities are being added to more traditional popular computer programming languages such as Pascal.","The benefits of object classes can be summarized, as follows:\n\n","Class libraries are very flexible. As programs grow more complex, more programmers are forced to reinvent basic solutions to basic problems over and over again. A relatively new extension of the class library concept is to have a framework of class libraries. This framework is more complex and consists of significant collections of collaborating classes that capture both the small scale patterns and major mechanisms that implement the common requirements and design in a specific application domain. They were first developed to free application programmers from the chores involved in displaying menus, windows, dialog boxes, and other standard user interface elements for personal computers.","Frameworks also represent a change in the way programmers think about the interaction between the code they write and code written by others. In the early days of procedural programming, the programmer called libraries provided by the operating system to perform certain tasks, but basically the program executed down the page from start to finish, and the programmer was solely responsible for the flow of control. This was appropriate for printing out paychecks, calculating a mathematical table, or solving other problems with a program that executed in just one way.","The development of graphical user interfaces began to turn this procedural programming arrangement inside out. These interfaces allow the user, rather than program logic, to drive the program and decide when certain actions should be performed. Today, most personal computer software accomplishes this by means of an event loop which monitors the mouse, keyboard, and other sources of external events and calls the appropriate parts of the programmer's code according to actions that the user performs. The programmer no longer determines the order in which events occur. Instead, a program is divided into separate pieces that are called at unpredictable times and in an unpredictable order. By relinquishing control in this way to users, the developer creates a program that is much easier to use. Nevertheless, individual pieces of the program written by the developer still call libraries provided by the operating system to accomplish certain tasks, and the programmer must still determine the flow of control within each piece after it's called by the event loop. Application code still \u201csits on top of\u201d the system.","Even event loop programs require programmers to write a lot of code that should not need to be written separately for every application. The concept of an application framework carries the event loop concept further. Instead of dealing with all the nuts and bolts of constructing basic menus, windows, and dialog boxes and then making these things all work together, programmers using application frameworks start with working application code and basic user interface elements in place. Subsequently, they build from there by replacing some of the generic capabilities of the framework with the specific capabilities of the intended application.","Application frameworks reduce the total amount of code that a programmer has to write from scratch. However, because the framework is really a generic application that displays windows, supports copy and paste, and so on, the programmer can also relinquish control to a greater degree than event loop programs permit. The framework code takes care of almost all event handling and flow of control, and the programmer's code is called only when the framework needs it (e.g., to create or manipulate a proprietary data structure).","A programmer writing a framework program not only relinquishes control to the user (as is also true for event loop programs), but also relinquishes the detailed flow of control within the program to the framework. This approach allows the creation of more complex systems that work together in interesting ways, as opposed to isolated programs, having custom code, being created over and over again for similar problems.","Thus, as is explained above, a framework basically is a collection of cooperating classes that make up a reusable design solution for a given problem domain. It typically includes objects that provide default behavior (e.g., for menus and windows), and programmers use it by inheriting some of that default behavior and overriding other behavior so that the framework calls application code at the appropriate times.","There are three main differences between frameworks and class libraries:\n\n","Thus, through the development of frameworks for solutions to various problems and programming tasks, significant reductions in the design and development effort for software can be achieved. A preferred embodiment of the invention utilizes HyperText Markup Language (HTML) to implement documents on the Internet together with a general-purpose secure communication protocol for a transport medium between the client and the Newco. HTTP or other protocols could be readily substituted for HTML without undue experimentation. HTML is a simple data format used to create hypertext documents that are portable from one platform to another. HTML documents are SGML documents with generic semantics that are appropriate for representing information from a wide range of domains. HTML has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information initiative since 1990. HTML is an application of ISO Standard 8879; 1986 Information Processing Text and Office Systems; Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML).","To date, Web development tools have been limited in their ability to create dynamic Web applications which span from client to server and interoperate with existing computing resources. Until recently, HTML has been the dominant technology used in development of Web-based solutions. However, HTML has proven to be inadequate in the following areas:\n\n","Sun Microsystem's\u00ae Java language solves many of the client-side problems by:\n\n","With Java, developers can create robust User Interface (UI) components. Custom \u201cwidgets\u201d (e.g., real-time stock tickers, animated icons, etc.) can be created, and client-side performance is improved. Unlike HTML, Java supports the notion of client-side validation, offloading appropriate processing onto the client for improved performance. Dynamic, real-time Web pages can be created. Using the above-mentioned custom UI components, dynamic Web pages can also be created.","Sun's Java language has emerged as an industry-recognized language for \u201cprogramming the Internet.\u201d Sun defines Java as: \u201ca simple, object-oriented, distributed, interpreted, robust, secure, architecture-neutral, portable, high-performance, multithreaded, dynamic, buzzword-compliant, general-purpose programming language. Java supports programming for the Internet in the form of platform-independent Java applets.\u201d Java applets are small, specialized applications that comply with Sun's Java Application Programming Interface (API) allowing developers to add \u201cinteractive content\u201d to Web documents (e.g., simple animations, page adornments, basic games, etc.). Applets execute within a Java-compatible browser (e.g., Netscape Navigator\u00ae) by copying code from the server to client. From a language standpoint, Java's core feature set is based on C++. Sun's Java literature states that Java is basically, \u201cC++ with extensions from Objective C for more dynamic method resolution.\u201d","Another technology that provides similar function to JAVA is provided by Microsoft and ActiveX Technologies, to give developers and Web designers wherewithal to build dynamic content for the Internet and personal computers. ActiveX includes tools for developing animation, 3-D virtual reality, video and other multimedia content. The tools use Internet standards, work on multiple platforms, and are being supported by over 100 companies. The group's building blocks are called ActiveX Controls, small, fast components that enable developers to embed parts of software in hypertext markup language (HTML) pages. ActiveX Controls work with a variety of programming languages including Microsoft Visual C++, Borland Delphi\u00ae, Microsoft\u00ae Visual Basic programming system and, in the future, Microsoft's development tool for Java, code named \u201cJakarta.\u201d ActiveX Technologies also includes ActiveX Server Framework, allowing developers to create server applications. One of ordinary skill in the art readily recognizes that ActiveX could be substituted for JAVA without undue experimentation to practice the invention.","Overview","The present invention addresses the potential impacts of the emerging Application Service Provider (ASP) industry on the operations of traditional packaged application software providers. This industry will have a significant impact on the majority of new and existing software providers, raising new opportunites while simultaneously bringing additional challenges.","The research associated with the present invention is a part of a broader effort to develop a market offering for players in the ASP value chain (Network Services, Managed Services, Hardware and Software Infrastructure, and Applications) and is incorporated into the offering initial diagnostic. The discussion of business capabilities software companies need to develop to compete in this space is also applicable to other participants in the ASP value chain that are working or aligning with software providers.","Potential impacts will be examined across three primary business capability areas:\n\n","The Build Applications area concentrates on the characteristics application software needs to have to be successfully used and delivered through the ASP channel. It addresses the primary question: What software capabilities are required for an application to be successfully delivered through the ASP channel? Architectural characteristics are addressed at a high level, but coverage of specific technical details is covered in the Infrastructure portion of the diagnostic.","The Sell Applications and Serve Customer areas address the question: \u201cWhat is the impact of the emerging ASP channel on traditional software providers?\u201d","Build Application","While many of todays packages can be already be delivered through an ASP channel, they are not optimized for netsourced operations. As ASP's become larger customers, software vendors increasingly need to consider architectural and functional changes that ease operation of their products in the ASP's environments.","The Build Application capability is subdivided into three main areas:\n\n","The technical architecture-related sections include Execution and Operations. The Development architecture will be set forth hereinafter during reference to .","Business logic\/functionality considerations are covered yet another area, Business Process Functionality.","Running business software and content over the Internet can require a change in software architecture to enable efficient delivery. Most major categories of business applications and supporting products were not designed to be utilized over the Internet. While newer products are starting to address this, and the use of thin client technologies like Citrix can provide a workaround for existing products, many of today's packages are still not optimized for use in this environment.","Ensuring applications have a thin client option is the first step. Most applications delivered through ASP's should not require proprietary code to be manually installed on client machines. Client logic or other supporting applications should be delivered at point of need on a machine independent basis.","This needs to be accomplished while still providing personalization and configuration options users have grown accustomed to. Examples include customized entry screens or transaction flows and saved queries or reports.","While most users will operate with a thin client, offerings also need to account for users that require standalone operations (sales representatives on client calls) or tight integration with desktop applications (power users or financial analysts). These situations are likely to require installation of software on client machines for the users to function effectively.","From an internal standpoint, cost effective delivery of these options implies use of a toolset that can generate multiple styles of client interfaces from a single set of business specifications.","In summary, when considering the client-side architecture, a single customer can have different usage needs depending on the portion of the workforce utilizing the software. Thus, the key message is actually a \u201cflexible client architecture\u201d rather than \u201cthin or no client architecture\u201d.","In order to allow an ASP to effectively charge for the use of the software, applications need to be able to track software usage in order to enable usage-based pricing. While the most popular method of ASP pricing is based on named or concurrent users, as the market matures, different pricing combinations will be sought by both the ASP and the end customer. This implies the software must be able to capture data needed to support multiple billing options.","The software needs to have a metering engine that captures key usage metrics. Potential items include:\n\n","The metering engine captures the information with logging and\/or counting functions, support billable event reporting, and produce usage files that can be interfaced into the ASPs billing application. Given the variety of emerging pricing models that are being experimented with in the marketplace, flexibility is essential.","In this context, security has two primary dimensions\u2014ensuring only valid users have access to the application itself, then ensuring that once they get there, they can only perform authorized functions.","The connection from the customer site to the ASP needs to be tightly secured. Security may also need to be managed across several complementary applications (i.e. ERP, CRM, and HR.) As ASP's begin to offer application software bundles, software packages must provide hooks into third party security\/authentication packages to allow the ASPs to manage application access at a \u201csolution\u201d level rather than a software level. An additional layer of complexity is added if the infrastructure is shared (i.e., there is a many to one ratio of customers to applications\/servers). Running applications in a multi-company environment leads to two additional security concerns.","In many applications security is a \u201cglobal\u201d function, used to manage users and assign access rights throughout the system. In a multi-company environment, security functions also need to be segmented at the customer level. Direct user access to the application's database for reporting, custom functions must be restricted. Secured APIs or \u201cdata marts\u201d allowing access to only a single customer's data must be provided by software or ASP extensions.","A key differentiation point for ASP's is the ability to offer solution \u201cbundles\u201d and to tie these bundles into clients existing applications. Current ASP's tend to offer only single vendor solutions, with limited options for interfacing external systems. Bundled offerings from ASPs need to leverage existing application APIs and middleware applications to provide integration to other packages or systems. In addition to connecting to additional applications, with the rise of trading communities, back office software applications will also need to interface easily into web-based marketplaces such as AribaNetwork and Commerce One's MarketSite.","Multi-company processing is the ability to run multiple companies' on a single installation of an application (and by default, on a single server). ASP's can configure the infrastructure for their customers in one of two ways:","Dedicated Infrastructure\u2014Companies with significant security and availability concerns or those will high transaction processing volumes or large numbers of users may require own server and instance of the application. These companies are likely to absorb a higher monthly fee for ASP service to have their own dedicated service.","Shared Infrastructure\u2014Other companies may be willing to accept shared application service due to less complex business organization (not necessarily less complex business processes) or the desire of a lower priced service.","In the first situation, multi-company support is less important, because each company's instance of an application service resides on dedicated infrastructure. However, in the second situation, the ability to support multi-company processing delivers economies of scale from a system administration and infrastructure set-up and maintenance perspective. Leveraging economies of scale at this level is critical for ASP's that target the mid to small-sized business market.","Running multiple companies on a single installation of a software application raises significant additional software requirements. To enable a shared application service model, the software must have several enabling capabilities: Every data entity\/object in the application must have a foreign key identifying the customer's organizational entity. This includes configuration tables and other tables controlling application processing and parameters.","Application logic must:\n\n","Utilizing existing company or business unit fields already provided in the application provides a workaround for some of these items. However, existing business functionality that is driven across these fields is then likely to be impacted. As an example, for the accounting function, many systems automate the generation of intercompany transactions using the software's company or business unit field. If these existing fields are used to separate and secure physical customers, this business logic is not accessible to those customers who actually have the need to operate","\u201cScalability is an attribute of a software system that characterizes the degree to which an application can support an increase in processing volume or in number of users.\u201d In the ASP market space, software must be scalable to both the items mentioned in the statement above: transaction volume and number of users. In a shared infrastructure, the system must also be scalable for several companies to use at once.","Scalability, for the most, part resides within the infrastructure. There are two main perspectives of how to address scalabilities from a hardware perspective: one big box vs. many smaller boxes. The \u201cone big box\u201d model provides better economies of scale in regards to the cost and simpler sharing of resources. The \u201cmany smaller boxes\u201d model is more expensive, but it allows more flexibility to serve the customer. For example, if a problem occurs in the second model, then only a sub-set of the end user population is affected instead of multiple customer. In addition, having several servers available allow system administrators to be prepared with \u201chot swappable\u201d servers that can be brought up when another goes down.","While the infrastructure is at the forefront for scalability, it does affect how the software is designed. This is especially true within a shared application services or \u201cone big box\u201d model. The underlying architecture of the application must be able to be tuned for efficient processing with multiple business organizations running on it, and batch processes must be able to execute concurrently for multiple companies.","The ASPs may be managing several applications for one end customer, brining together several applications. However, integration with other business applications is only one part of the \u201cintegration\u201d necessary to deliver a solution. It is also critical that the application has standard hooks into systems administration software and tools covering areas such as:\n\n","ASPs sell fast and functional implementations of leading software products. In order to assist in delivering on that promise, the configuration of the software itself needs to be accelerated. Toolsets that ease the process of identifying and making configuration decisions and in establishing baseline processes are critical to achieving this goal.","An additional step in this direction is the creation of industry or process templates. In order to deliver these templates, the software vendor must have deep understanding of industry based business processes. While this may not be an issue for larger, more established vendors, attracting the needed business expertise could be a challenge for smaller companies.","An example of the latter innovation is SAP's mySAP.com business scenarios. These business scenarios provide preconfigured process templates for various industries and relationships, each of which can be customized to meet the needs of the organization. The functionality needed to execute tasks for each business scenario resides in discrete SAP and non-SAP software and service components, all of which are available through the mySAP.com Workplace.","Most major software vendors have incorporated international functionality into their products, such as multi-currency, different payment methods, and language set-up. However, regulations and business practices unique to individual countries or regions are often not included in the \u201cglobal\u201d release of the software, forcing the end customer to purchase a separate license of the country or region specific release software. This creates the need to have several instances of the software, which in turn makes it more difficult and complex to maintain and to consolidate information at an enterprise-wide level.","As the ASP channel grows and attracts companies with multi-national or global operations, software applications must be able to handle the processing for these companies out of a single installation of the software, and avoid the need for the ASP to license country-specific releases of the software in addition to the global release. Without this consideration, the cost of the ASP services to these customers will be higher, and the sales through this channel may be effected.","Sell Applications","The ability to market and sell the application is equally as important as the building of the application. Software vendors must have a clear understanding of the evolving business models in this market space. Absorbing these business models into their organization, targeting the appropriate channels, pricing effectively, and implementing the channel plans is essential to exploiting the ASP channel.","The ASP market causes a paradigm shift in how software is sold and distributed. The emergence of ASPs introduces another sales channel for software vendors and could eventually turn the use of application software into a commodity-like business, with the ASP as the prime distributor of the product.","Today, most software vendors see ASPs as an incremental sales channel, as in their current form, most ASP sales are not cannibalizing sales from vendor's other channels. In addition, the software vendor still retains firm control over the customer, with the broad market still seeing choice of software provider as a key element of the IT and business strategy.","However, if the ASP market expands as predicted, the ASPs that emerge from the initial wave of entrants could vie for control of the customer channel. Just as RDBMS vendors took control from the hardware vendors in the 80's, and software vendor's took control from the RDBMS vendors in the 90's, ASP's may enter in the 00's.","While some software vendors may welcome the opportunity to focus on the core competency of software development, others will certainly resist loss of control.","Three possible strategies for working with ASPs can be considered:\n\n","Leverage the ASP channel to provide majority of the sales, service and support function; allowing software providers to concentrate on software development. A key differentiator in the post-Y2K world will be the add-on functionality on top of the core product. For emerging or resource constrained providers, this strategy focuses the organization on product development and process expertise. However, this strategy also assumes a robust ASP sales channel, which does not exist today.\n\n","Utilize the ASP channel to extend reach into untapped markets or to provide existing customers additional options. In this model, the ASP channel is simply an additional channel for the vendors products, but not one that is necessarily more important than the other channels. Currently this is the predominant strategy. A key challenge for software companies adopting this strategy is managing inevitable channel conflict as the ASP market grows.\n\n","Continue to build the software and provide the hosting and operations capabilities. These companies will attempt to control the channel, from software to customer to hosting. Note that this does not imply that the software providers provide all the required services themselves, only that they arrange and consolidate provision of those services, and market directly to the end customer. Today, most software providers have adopted the dedicated channel strategy.","Like any manufacturer facing a new distribution channel, software providers will need to decide how to embrace the ASP and its role in the value chain.","Software vendors need to revise pricing models to better meet the needs of ASPs and their customers. Traditional software pricing models are designed around a one-time payment for licenses with an additional maintenance fee each year. However customers purchasing from ASPs look for a more even spread out, stable payment flow based on predictable measures of usage.","During the recent first wave of activity, ASPs were (some continue to) paying software vendors in \u201cbulk\u201d, buying licenses up front at a discount, and then renting or leasing those licenses on a per use basis (i.e., monthly rate, access time, transaction based, automated processes) to the end customer. This model is advantageous to the software vendor, but is very capital intensive for the ASP, who is at financial and operating risk by not being able to match expenses with revenues.","However, as the market continues to evolve, ASPs need to be able to adjust their revenue\/expense flow and match the payments to the software vendor with their customer receipts. If the ASP channel grows as expected, it is likely that the market will begin to force the new model, and the software vendors will then need to continue adapting their business and pricing approach to reflect this demand.","In addition, the software vendor must prepare for this model to spread to their traditional customer base. When the uptake for the new pricing model occurs in the ASP market space, the customers who buy licenses via the traditional channel will begin to demand alternative pricing models as well. Software vendors must be ready for this shift.","Out of the large software vendors, SAP has recently made some interesting moves in this direction, proposing a mixed pricing model for mySAP.com based on a blend of user-types, transactions processed and access to SAP by external systems. They have also recently introduced a rental pricing option, where customers can rent the software over a contract period of 12-36 months. SAP indicated this move was driven mainly by demand from public sector clients and SAP's outsourcing\/ASP partners.","While in the long term shifts to these types of pricing models increases the visibility of the revenue flow, in the short term analysts have said the transition period may make it harder to make forecasts.","Closely related to selecting a strategy for utilizing the ASP channel is the need determine how to implement this strategy. Activities involved around this strategy could include: creating an ASP channel-specific marketing plan, dedicating portions of the sales force to address this channel, forming strategic alliances with certain ASPs to help gain control the market space, and communicate ASP strategy and actions clearly to the market. The largest potential issue revolves around the sales force. While today it is believed competition between the traditional sales and ASP channels is minimal, if ASPs begin to appeal to a broader range of customers, vendors need to manage the inevitable conflict between their ASP channel partners and their internal sales forces.","Serve Customer","The ASP channel also impacts how software vendors support their customers. Adding to the already complex process of managing a customer base, the ASPs not only add additional customers for the software vendor to manage and serve, but they are also intertwined with the end customers creating complex customer relationships.","Software vendors often have a consulting or professional services unit to assist in delivering value to their customers. Software vendors need to address the ASP marketplace like any other type of customer.","One of the key pillars that this channel stands on is the reduced time of implementation compared to \u201ctraditional\u201d installations. To be an effective consultant for the ASP, the software vendor must have a deeply skilled consulting force in their product line to enable fast implementations of the product. Alternatively, vendors need to plan for capability enablement programs to effectively train ASP staff.","The addition of another customer set for the software vendor does add complexity and burden to their services workforce. However, if the vendor can deliver excellent consulting service, the result can be twice as valuable: success for the ASP means success for the end customer.","The software vendor now has an additional set of customers that it must be able to serve from a Help Desk. In addition, they must have a technical capability to understand the configuration and challenges of an ASP's infrastructure. The additional layer of help desk customers also complicates the SLA agreements. Questions arise as to who should support the software: the vendor or the ASP?","Vendors must develop a clear strategy for structuring service agreements in this environment.","One object of the present invention is to provide an overview of the ASP Diagnostic, the organization and focus of the Diagnostic, insight into the unique capabilities required by ASPs, and reference to AC assets that can be leveraged for more detailed information.","This may be accomplished via an ASP Diagnostic including a Process Component, Infrastructure Component, Organization Component, and an ASP Diagnostic Checklist Overview.","The purpose of the ASP Diagnostic is to assist an ASP in understanding the breadth and depth of the capabilities needed to successfully compete in the ASP marketplace identify the gaps that exist relative to the ASP's current capabilities.

C.","Architecture Basics","Architecture Overview","What is architecture?","Architecture\u2014whether the word is applied to work with a city skyline or an information system\u2014is both about designing something and about making, building, or constructing something. An architect is literally a \u201cmaster builder\u201d\u2014from the Greek words archi (primary or master) and tekton (builder or carpenter). In good Greek fashion, however, it would be unthinkable for something to be built without a sound theoretical basis. So architecture involves theory, but there is nothing merely theoretical about it. Conversely, architecture is also eminently practical, but there is nothing merely practical about it. Ideas about form and structure lie behind architecture. Ultimately one must let go of a mindset that tries to separate the designing from the making; they exist together as a whole, and to extract one without the other is to kill the whole.","Architecture also is an engineering discipline. It creates and also depends on a structured manner to analyze and design whatever is to be built. Like all living disciplines, architecture continues to grow and evolve. Engineering discoveries move the field forward. Certain design and engineering principles clearly show themselves to be successful in practice, and these then become repeatable components of additional work. The ability to continue to master each component, as well as the interrelations among components, is a distinguishing characteristic of architecture.","So architecture is about designing and building something from a set of basic components, and also about the interrelations among the components. And it is a discipline whereby all these things come together\u2014materials, space, people\u2014to bring something into being that was not there before.","Although building architects have not always been pleased about it, architectural concepts have influenced other kinds of \u201cbuilding\u201d projects for some time. Over the past twenty years, developers of information systems, for example, have used concepts from the field of architecture not only to describe their work but to execute it, as well.","The use of architectural thinking implies that the work is about creating certain kinds of structures that can be engineered or at least influenced, and that the work can be organized and performed in a structured, systematic manner. Moreover, use of architectural concepts implies that there is something repeatable about the work: architects can create a structure, then use components of that structure again in the future when they come across a similar situation.","An architectural paradigm should not be lightly used. It makes demands. To use architectural concepts implies that one is ready to do so\u2014that is, that the field is sufficiently mature in its work to see patterns and to organize future work according to those patterns.","Finally, architecture must be understood as a process , not just a thing. This process can be described at a very high level using FIG. .\n\n","Also, when architects design a building, they have in their heads a primary conceptual framework for all the components that go into that building: the plumbing, the electric, the sewers, stairs\/elevators, framing structure, and so forth. The tacit step for an architect is, \u201cBased on my knowledge of the generic components that go into a building, how will these components fit together in this particular building? Which of these components will require special attention because of the functional demands of the building?\u201d\n\n","The manner or structure in which hardware or software is constructed defines how a system or program is structured, how various components and parts interact, as well as what protocols and interfaces are used for communication and cooperation between modules and components which make up the system. Seven general characteristics of successful architectures are set forth:\n\n","Several possible types of architectures contemplated by the present invention are discussed below.","Development Architecture Framework (DAF)  provides access to one's thought leadership and architecture frameworks for Execution, Development and Operations environments ,,. For a more detailed discussion on these architectures, please see Standard Architecture Summaries (below).  shows the dependencies of the three architecture frameworks and is described in more detail in the Delivery Vehicle Overview (below).","The following lists are starting points for considering the range of components and activities that must be covered by each architectural view of the system. They are not a definitions of the environments.","Standard Architecture Summaries","Execution Architecture ","The execution architecture is a unified collection of run-time technology services, control structures, and supporting infrastructure upon which application software runs.","It includes components such as:\n\n","The development architecture is a unified collection of technology services, tools, techniques, and standards for constructing and maintaining application software.","It includes components such as:\n\n","A unified collection of technology services, tools, standards and controls required to keep a business application production or development environment operating at the designed service level. It differs from an execution architecture in that its primary users are system administrators and production support personnel.","It includes components such as:\n\n","Questions to ensure that you are asking the right questions about the technology architecture include:","For all technology components, have the following characteristics been addressed:\n\n","Have the versions of system software been live at another site for at least six to twelve months?","This time frame varies by product. Have reference sites been verified?","What is a framework?","It is a major challenge to design the complex infrastructure that is needed to satisfy the requirements of today's distributed, mission-critical applications. As such, it is helpful to have an inventory of the components that may be required for the design, build, installation and operation of systems. It is also helpful to have an understanding of how the components fit together conceptually.","A Framework should be thought of as a conceptual structure used to frame the work about to be done. It should be used as a thought trigger or as a completeness check. A framework cannot be built directly but instead should use it as a starting point for understanding and designing.","Frameworks are used to help practitioners understand what components may be required and how the components fit together. Based on the inventory of components and the description of their relationships, practitioners will select the necessary components for their design. An architect extracts components from one or more Frameworks to meet a specific set of user or application requirements. Once an architecture has been implemented it is often referred to as an architecture or an infrastructure.","The scope of what a framework addresses can vary widely. One framework, for instance, may outline the components for a technical infrastructure in its entirety whereas another framework may focus explicitly on the network. A thorough understanding of a framework's scope is crucial to its use during the design phase of a project.","It is also important to understand whether the framework is vendor specific in nature (proprietary) or whether it is available for use by a large number of vendors (open).","The Importance of Architecture","Experience has demonstrated the benefits of an architectural approach to information systems development: better productivity and less reinvention of the wheel. An architecture provides a completeness check, ensuring that all relevant components of a possible solution have been considered. It ensures consistent, reliable, high-quality applications. It gives everyone\u2014the developers and their clients\u2014a common framework and common language with which to talk about the work.","Perhaps most important, it allows professional developers to leverage successful solutions when performing additional work. Architecture involves repeatable concepts, and so it reduces the time and cost by which a solution is delivered.","Some of the specific technical benefits of a good architecture are:","Simplified Application Development",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0252","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0098","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0098-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0099","list-style":"none"},"li":["Good architecture provides common set of application services. It removes application programmers from the complexities of the underlying technology and development tools, allowing less experienced developers to be more productive.\n\nQuality\n","Usually more experienced developers implement the often complex technical components in an architecture. These components are then reused, avoiding duplicated complex logic in the applications. Iterations during design, implementation and testing often result in refinement and improvement of the architecture components. All users of these components benefit from such improvements, reducing the risk of failure and ensuring better overall quality in the final application.\n\nIntegration\n","An architecture often ties together disparate software, platforms and protocols into one comprehensive framework.\n\nExtensibility\n","The architecture is established by experienced personnel who can predict with some confidence whether a given architecture will fulfill current and future requirements. Code extensions are easily integrated. A well-balanced architecture consists of the \u201cright\u201d components, where the components are tied together by simple interrelationships, since complex relationships increase the architecture's complexity faster than modularization can reduce it.\n\nLocation Transparency\n","Generally, the application of good architecture divorces application from the details of resource location. This is however not always true or required. For performance reasons designers and developers still often need to be aware of process and data locations.\n\nHorizontal Scaling\n","Architecture assists in optimal utilization of existing infrastructure resulting in increased application performance and stability\n\nIsolation\n","An architecture can be used to isolate the applications from particular products. This ensures that products can more easily be replaced later. This characteristic can be important if there is risk associated with a product's or product vendor's future, or the rate of change in a particular technology area is particularly high. An evident example is provided by looking back at changes in user interface standards over the last 10 years. Applications that did not separate user interface logic from business logic, had to be completely rewritten to take advantage of new user interfaces, such as MS Windows and more recently Web browsers.\n\nPortability\n","The use of architecture increases portability and reusability within and across different platforms or protocols."]}}}},"The use of architecture frameworks during analysis and design can reduce the risks of an IT solution. It should improve development productivity through reuse, as well as the IT solution's reliability and maintainability.","One key challenge for today's IT managers is the need for change. Architectures provide a basic framework for major change initiatives. Many businesses are performed by strategic applications that will most likely require frequent and rapid development to handle changes in technology capability and business requirements. A properly defined and intelligently developed architecture delivers an infrastructure on which a business can build and enhance applications that support their current and future business needs. This is how a business can manage change.","A key benefit of an architecture is that it divides and conquers complexity. Simple applications benefit less from architecture than complex ones do; fewer decisions are needed in these cases, and fewer people need to know about them. During maintenance, a poorly architected small application is tolerable because it is still relatively easy to locate a fault and to anticipate the side effects of correcting it. Conversely, complex applications are more difficult to understand and to modify. Complexity is reduced by subdividing the application in layers and components, each layer having a specific functionality. The layers are strongly cohesive and de-coupled: A given layer does not need to know the internals of any other layer.","Study of Large Complex Systems (LCS) reinforces the importance of a stable architectures in large systems. By way of example:\n\n","The benefits derived from a technology architecture can allow one to be in the forefront of the development of many leading edge business solutions. The investment in a reliable and flexible architecture can result in one or more of the following:\n\n","Architects must have deep understanding of a project, business and\/or technical environment. Architects are involved across business integration projects, managing their complexities and intricacies.","It is easy to go overboard when designing and implementing a technology architecture. Ideally the architecture should be a thin, well-defined layer that ensures development productivity, maintenance flexibility, performance and stability.","A key issue is maintainability and operability. Keep in mind that others may have to understand the rationale behind the architecture design in order to correctly maintain it.","Architecture logic can quickly become very abstract and hard to maintain by others than those who built it. A carefully designed architectures can quickly be destroyed by maintenance personnel that do not understand how it was designed and developed.","The architecture should be made as light-weight as possible only addressing the requirements that drive it. Avoid \u201cnice to have\u201d flexibility and additional levels of abstractions that are intellectually interesting but not strictly required.","Delivery Vehicle Overview","A Delivery Vehicle is an integrated collection of technology services that supports an application style, implemented on a distinct architecture generation.","Application Style","An application style defines a unique class of processing type, which is used by applications, and thus end-users. Current Delivery Vehicle Reference set of Application Styles include batch, on-line transaction processing, collaboration, data warehouse, knowledge management and integration.","The Application Style is the primary dimension of a Delivery Vehicle, and most people use the terms Application Style and Delivery Vehicle to mean the same thing.","A key goal with a delivery vehicle is that it can be reused across many applications. It is still part of the Technology Architecture, not involving application specific logic. An Application Architecture on the other hand, will be specific for a particular application.","Architecture Generation","An architecture generation is a broad classification scheme for placing technology components within a technology era. Delivery Vehicles are physically implemented on a distinct architecture generation.","Note: Defining a clear line between what falls under the client\/server and a Netcentric technology generation is difficult; typically different people tend to have different opinions. Generally, the present invention is an advance in client\/server generation. In the context of the Delivery Vehicles, the technology generation discussion is intended to be a logical discussion that aims to highlight the new business capabilities enabled by new technologies. So for example, there could be a PowerBuilder application executing from a Web Browser using a plug-in.","Delivery Vehicle Matrix",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0269","num":"0579"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","402","404"]},"Delivery Vehicle Cube","The Delivery Vehicle Cube , illustrated in , represents the \u201cfill\u201d picture of what a Delivery Vehicle is. In addition to the Application Styles and the Technology generations it introduces a distinction between Execution, Development and Operations Environments ,,.","The cube has the following dimensions, or cube \u201cfaces:\n\n","These core services will be implemented using one, or more likely several, of the Technology Generations; currently Host, Client\/Server or Netcentric. Most major enterprises have legacy systems that include both host based and distributed client\/server applications. The present invention extends the mix of system technologies.\n\n","These components extend the technology architecture with services that are specific for each distinct delivery vehicle. Some of the components may extend some of the core services, while others are completely new types of components.\n\n","Both the core services and the delivery vehicle extensions require support in all three environments. The cube illustrates that different delivery vehicles may require different extensions to a core development or operations environment, not just the execution architecture. A mission-critical high-volume transaction delivery vehicle may require special performance tuning tools in the development architecture, as well as real-time monitoring tools in the operations architecture.","Also different technology generations may require special services in all three environments. When working in a multi-platform environment, there may be duplicated services across platforms. This usually complicates development, operations and execution architectures and may require special focus on providing an integration architecture.","Typically the focus on engagements is on the execution environment. The main dependency between these three environments is that the execution architecture to a large degree drives the requirements for the development and operations architectures. For example if a heterogeneous, distributed execution architecture is selected, both the development and operations environments must reflect this.","Delivery Framework","Promotes focus toward business solutions and away from technology issues.","Assists linkage of architecture planning deliverables to delivering.","Create an enterprise-wide view of the business capabilities enabled by technologies.","Provide new architecture frameworks needed today to meet specific needs.","Provide guidance to define what architecture best meets those needs.","Provide development architecture frameworks and best practices to build these architectures.","During a high-level architecture design, one can identify architecture services to be addressed, by providing a logical level discussion to assess types of base services and products needed for a specific situation.","When Delivery Vehicles are implemented, they reduce time to implement business solutions by providing \u201cStarter Kits\u201d architectures.","When Delivery Vehicles are implemented, they leverages technology across the business by:\n\n","Note: The Delivery Vehicle Framework presents a way to organize technology architecture information. When presenting this type of content to clients, one will need to tailor the information one presents based on the client's background and the terminology they are familiar with.","Technology Generation Selection","Introduction","This section should assist an architect in understanding the characteristics of, and the implications from selecting, a specific technology generation. The strengths and weaknesses of each technology generation should be understood when planning and designing a system. When identifying the core technologies to be used in an architecture, a view of the client's existing IT architecture , guiding principles  and business imperatives  should be taken into consideration, as depicted in FIG. .","It is important to realize that a distinct, static division does not exist between the different technology generations. It is possible that an architecture will consist of components from more than one generation.","The goal should be to understand the pros and cons of the different technology options available for each component and to select the most appropriate one based on the client's requirements.","It is becoming more important to leverage existing systems and integrate them with new applications. A typical scenario can involve mainframe legacy systems acting as servers in a client server architecture, application servers being accessed from both traditional GUI clients built in Powerbuilder and Visual Basic and from Web-based front ends accessing the application servers via a Web-server.","General Considerations","From a technology point of view a new custom-made application should generally use the most recent Architecture Generation to assure that the application will live longer by better being able to adapt to future changes.","This implies that all new applications should ideally be based on a Netcentric Architecture, rather than on a traditional client\/server or a host-based architecture.","However choosing a generation is not just a technical decision. Often key technology architecture decisions are made as a result of factors which are completely non-technical in nature, such as financial factors, internal and client politics, and implementation\/operational considerations.","When deciding whether to employ a Netcentric solution, i.e. incorporating Web-based user interfaces and Internet application styles, one must keep in mind that these technologies are not a panacea and should be used only when there is solid business reason. They require new investments in skills, tools, development and operations processes. Due to the relative immaturity of tools and products, they also represent additional risks both in technical terms, such as performance and reliability, and in strategic terms, such as vendor and product quality and stability.","Regardless, today each project should always consider the prospect of utilizing Netcentric technologies. It is important to evaluate whether the application can benefit from a Netcentric style implementation immediately or in the future.","Even if a traditional client\/server approach (e.g. using Visual Basic or PowerBuilder) is decided upon, the use of Netcentric concepts to produce significant reductions in software packaging and distribution costs should be considered. Such concepts include three- or multi-tier architectures with more business logic residing on server, flexible security architecture, and user interface concepts that can be ported to a Web Browser at a later stage.","A Netcentric architecture will usually still support development of client\/server applications. The opposite is not often true since traditional client\/server systems usually keep a substantial portion of the business logic on a fat client, while Netcentric architectures still favor keeping most business logic at the server side. Also Netcentric architectures tend to be more loosely coupled than (the still dominant two-tier) client\/server systems.","The following sections identify the main characteristics associated with a Netcentric, Client Server or Host based technology generation. This list should in no way be considered complete and exhaustive but is included as a starting point from which the identification process may begin.","Network centric architecture generation","If most of the statements in  are true, one should consider an application based upon the Netcentric technology generation.","The following details the importance of each of the statements in FIG.  and should assist in identifying the appropriate answer for specific client engagement.","Existing architecture and infrastructure \n\n","If, based upon the client's requirements, most of the statements of  are true, one should consider an application based upon the Client Server technology generation.","The following section details the importance of each of the statements found in FIG.  and should assist in identifying the appropriate answer for a specific client engagement.","Existing Architecture and Infrastructure ",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0305","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0114","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0114-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0115","list-style":"none"},"li":["E1.

Client\/server systems still represent a new technology to many IT departments.\n\nBusiness Imperatives \n","B1. The application will be used only by an internal user community.","Software distribution is a concern for traditional client server computing environments due to the fact that executable and data files need to reside on the client hard drive.

The application requires an advanced, dynamic, and integrated user interface for expert users.","State of the art 4GL and 3GL development languages will support advanced user interfaces which require a significant degree of context management between fields and windows. Web-based user interfaces do not support such interfaces well yet.","B3.

Very briefly, DAF covers:\n\n","The eCommerce market is rapidly emerging. This is evidenced by the growing numbers of new eCommerce transactional sites, the increasing number of \u2018exchange of value\u2019 transactions performed daily, the emergence of new entities and businesses focusing on the electronic marketplace, the convergence and partnering of existing businesses on the electronic marketplace, and the empowerment of the everyday user to satisfy their needs within the evolving electronic marketplace.","One definition of eCommerce is: \u2018A commercial exchange of value between an enterprise and an external entity\u2014either an upstream supplier, a partner, or a down-stream customer\u2014over a universal, ubiquitous electronic medium.\u2019","The eCommerce Application Framework  in DAF is illustrated in FIG. .","The eCommerce Application Framework (eCaf) identifies and describes the application capabilities useful or necessary to implementing eCommerce business solutions. It provides a framework to tie business process, application, and technology aspects of eCommerce together, and a basis for mapping and assessing the capabilities of the eCommerce packaged solutions. This framework should be used as a vehicle for communicating, and designing eCommerce business solutions.","The eCommerce Application Framework has been created to provide an understanding of the types of services and applications needed to implement an eCommerce solution.  illustrates the relationship between the eCommerce Application Framework , the possible eCommerce Selling Models , enabling technology , and enabling eCommerce Software Packages .","The eCaf defines a supporting middle layer between basic Internet or Netcentric enabled products (eCommerce Package Software) and the technical infrastructure (Enabling Technology) needed to develop eCommerce-enabled web sites based on a business-specific selling model (eCommerce Selling Models). Note that eCaf just covers the middle layer.","Each solution or site may have a different selling approach, architecture, utilization of technology, or applications. The eCaf includes the concepts, applications, and services common across the different solutions and has organized them into application capabilities.","Technologically eCommerce business capability requires a logical grouping of services enabling a specific eCommerce functionality. The functionality may be a single technical service within the underlying architecture or an entire application. The capabilities have been derived from surveying multiple eCommerce software packages and eCommerce implementations. As eCommerce evolves, the categories and capabilities are apt to change.","eCommerce Application Framework in DAF","In DAF the capabilities are presented as framework components and subcomponents. The eCommerce capabilities illustrate the highest level categories of eCommerce capabilities: External Agents, Electronic Merchandising, Relationship Management, Maintenance & Administration, Order Processing, Customer Services, Security, Decision Support, Integration.","The capabilities within a given category may cover the full range of potential selling models. Some components may be specific only to a business-to-business buyer-centric implementation. Additional components may emerge as this technology matures.","It should be borne in mind that the eCaf documentation in DAF focuses on the eCaf capabilities. The enabling technology is discussed elsewhere in DAF (see below). The selling models and eCommerce Package Software are discussed only briefly.","eCommerce Enabling Technology","The enabling technology for an eCommerce implementation is the same underlying technology used to enable most Netcentric (and in some cases client server) implementations. In general, most implementations will utilize the Netcentric technologies. An understanding of the Netcentric framework will act as a building block for understanding the technology aspects of an eCommerce solution.","eCommerce Selling Models","A wide variety of eCommerce solutions fall under the broad umbrella term of \u201ceCommerce.\u201d The vague definition of eCommerce lends itself to a range of implementations and possibilities. A survey of the sites within the current electronic marketplace reveals the majority of the transactional \u2018exchange of value\u2019 solutions concentrate on selling \u2018products.\u2019 Products can be further divided into physical and electronic.\n\n","Across the many \u2018exchange of value\u2019 sites, there are three prevalent selling models: seller-centric, buyer-centric, and auction.","Seller-Centric Selling Model","The seller-centric model is the most common. In its simplest form, a company typically provides information about their products and gives the customer the ability to place orders. More advanced implementations use electronic means for supporting the entire sales and support process including: marketing, product display, merchandising, customer needs assessment, order processing, and many other activities. In most seller-centric solutions, the infrastructure is created and maintained by the merchant. The customer needs nothing more than a browser and\/or access to the site.","Buyer-Centric Selling Model","In a buyer-centric solution, the main focus is on customer or buyer trying to fulfill a need for a product. In contrast to Seller-Centric sites which offer products, a buyer-centric site displays items the buyer would like to purchase\u2014in effect trying to lure sellers. Many of the same capabilities as seller-centric sites are needed such as order management and payment capabilities. In this case, the customer joins or creates an infrastructure focused on fulfilling his needs. The infrastructure typically provides an environment between the trading partners which promotes browsing and comparing products, ordering products, fulfillment, payment, and any needed customer support services. A concentration should be placed on the ease of transactions and information flow. For this reason, sellers may customize their product line to the buyers' specific needs.","In most buyer-centric cases, the buyer or often a consortium of buyers, provides the bulk of the eCommerce infrastructure. Additional integration and setup may or may not be required for each of the trading partners who wishes to participate. Implementations requiring sellers to specially configure or integrate their own systems in order to participate are usually only successful where the buyer has substantial market power in the relationship, as in GM\u00ae or Ford\u00ae buying parts from their suppliers. In such cases, agreements must be made as to what information is to be shared, how to model the information, the standards for messaging and communication, and what technologies will be used. Besides the technical hurdle of integrating multiple systems and the somewhat immature state of the software products to date, convincing trading partners to adopt an Internet commerce approach can also be very difficult. If one is not a particularly big or powerful buyer, it can be difficult to attract potential sellers to come to one's site and spend the time necessary to learn about one's needs. This requires sellers to engage in a very different activity than they have traditionally performed and many are not eager to change their way of doing business for a relatively small customer.","This section of the market has been slower to emerge. As mentioned above, trading partner maintenance is a key issue. Companies at the end of the hub must buy into the hub's practices and vision. Future vision and direction are also important. As changes are implemented, all trading partners have to move together. Getting buy in from all partners has the potential to slow down the adoption of new technologies and process innovations which over time can lead to a lack luster lowest common denominator approach.","Broker Selling Model","Broker or auction type solutions are also emerging, albeit more slowly. Broker implementations don't typically sell their own goods, but rather provide an eCommerce environment to facilitate bringing multiple buyers and sellers together. Both buyers and sellers can utilize the broker's site and infrastructure rather than developing and maintaining their own eCommerce capabilities. In this case, a broker has set up the infrastructure needed to buy and sell goods. The infrastructure will be very similar to a seller-centric solution with the addition of components needed to register goods to be sold (or in a buyer-centric twist\u2014register RFQ's \u2018request for quote\u2019), price negotiation and bidding, and reconciliation services.","A Trading Network (TN) is an excellent business example of a broker site. Users of the TN can issue Request For Quote's (RFQ'S) on the trading network. The request could be for raw materials, components, or finished items. Suppliers are free to answer an RFQ providing they meet some basic guidelines and requirements. The network provides a true win-win relationship. Since the network can be global, suppliers the purchaser may never have known about are free to participate.","Another example on the consumer side is a sales website. Such a site offers a variety of computer, electronic and fitness goods as well as a general merchandise auction. Customers can browse items in order to view product information and their current bid prices. Interested buyers can place a bid online and see how their bid price compares with others. The auctions are time based and follow a detailed bidding process. As customers are out bid, they are notified via email and have the option to reply with a counter bid.","Packaged eCommerce Software","In relation to packaged eCommerce Software, the eCaf framework provides a basis for understanding and assessing the capabilities of the eCommerce packages.","If a package is used to implement part of the eCommerce solution, an analysis of its underlying technology and business requirements with respect to the Netcentric Framework and the selling models should be conducted. It is important to understand the underlying architecture and any inherent application limitations due to the package's choice of technology used to implement its architecture. In short, it is important to understand what comes \u2018out of the box.\u2019 Be sure to understand each of the main components described by the Netcentric Framework (e.g. Web Browser, Web Server), how the components communicate, and any limitations of the package and architecture of the component.","A multitude of different packages are emerging usually with the name sounding something similar to \u2018eCommerce Server.\u2019 Each package may boast to be different in the problem it is addressing, the architecture, or the underlying processes and technology. In addition, it may claim to provide an \u2018end-to-end solution\u2019 for businesses wishing to transact on the Internet. It is currently very difficult to differentiate between the products. The eCAF provides a basis for understanding and assessing the capabilities of existing eCommerce packages as well as those emerging.","The current eCommerce software packages can be classified in the following categories:\n\n","A complex eCommerce solution potentially may utilize software from all three of these categories in addition to any custom code needed to integrate them.","External Agents ",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0338","num":"0716"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["1200","1202","1204","1206","1208"]},"The service may include making suggestions based on a user's profile and history. The service requested may also include retrieval of data. Thirdly, the service requested may include a product comparison. As an option, the data may further include detailed product attributes. As another option, the services of other agents may also be used to perform the service.","On the Internet, an agent  (also called an intelligent agent) is a program that gathers information or performs some other service without the immediate of a user. See . Typically, an agent, using parameters provided by the user, searches all or some part of the Internet, gathers the requested information, and presents it back to the requesting user. Intelligent external agent technology will continue to grow as the eCommerce market develops. As the market saturates with products and information, the need for techniques or agents to filter this information will grow.","Business Drivers","Despite the vast amount of information and tools available on the Internet, it is still passive, requiring the user to browse through tremendous amounts of information in order to obtain what they need. The introduction of advanced intelligent agent technology will potentially transform the Internet into an active network through which users can delegate tasks to computer programs to complete on their behalf. An agent in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention has the ability to transport itself from one place in the network to another, filtering through relevant information in order to perform its task. The software can be designed to make suggestions based on the user's profile and history, and change its behavior as it learns from experience and interactions with other agents.","Intelligent Agents may have the following characteristics:\n\n","An exemplary agent is a Bargain Finder. The Bargain Finder agent is an intelligent agent used for comparative shopping for music CDs. A user can request the agent to search based on a specific artist and album. The agent would search its known sources, gather the needed information, and return a comparison list with prices and specifications to the requester. If this concept is applied to the business world, the potential value increases dramatically.","A business may utilize a similar concept but on a much grander scale, allowing the user to take advantage of the lowest available price. Providing there are ample suppliers, a business may create an agent to search for the best prices on construction materials or assembly components. In this case, the agent could provide substantial savings in material costs and personnel.","Inbound vs. Outbound Agents","From a site's perspective, there are inbound and outbound agents. An outbound agent would be an agent a site sends out to gather information. For example, a site selling digital goods may embed a specific digital watermark within its digital goods. It could then create an agent to search the Web for this digital watermark to determine if unauthorized uses exist. Another example would be competitive analysis. A site may create an agent for polling competing sites for current prices and product list in order to price the site's own items competitively.","On the other hand, the site may deal with inbound agents. The emergence of the comprehensive intelligent shopping assistant is a prime example of inbound agents. Agents may enter a site in an attempt to gather information about products, availability and prices. For example, an Internet shopper may use a \u2018shopping agent\u2019 to submit a request for a particular product. The shopping agent determines which sites may contain relevant information, interacts with the site in order to gather any needed information, and prepares a report for the user including detailed product information, product comparisons, and pricing lists. From the site selling goods, the agent may be viewed as in inbound customer.","In essence, an agent is both inbound and outbound, depending on the perspective of the site. If the site is the initiator of the agent, the agent is viewed as outbound. This same agent is viewed as inbound to the sites it interacts with to gather information.","Agent Technology","The technology behind agents is continually evolving. Agents generally require more distributed processing and communication capabilities than are currently offered by networking and computing standards such as TCP\/IP and CORBA. These standards cannot accommodate the flexibility and variety of interaction needed among agents, users, and other agents and systems. As it is available now, middleware support to inter-process communication is quite primitive. TCP\/IP fulfills the necessary transport function; Remote Procedure Call (RPC) and socket libraries allow for the basic exchange of information and invocation of procedures on top of TCP\/IP; and CORBA adds routing, names services and data type translation.","Flexible, tailorable interactions among agents, users, and other agents and systems require a language and protocols for specifying or customizing the behavior of agents, regardless of their mobility. Some statements of the language will allow flexible interactions with a specific component of the agent-interface to services. These service mediators will allow incoming agents to query for the nature of provided services and conditions of their usage. Research is underway on such languages, their semantics, their syntax and how they should be integrated with agent systems.","Peer-to-peer computing allows work stations to concurrently send and host multiple requests for services. Security, reliability and integrity issues need to be explored, especially because the market has high expectations for these areas in client\/server environments. Asynchronous distributed computing is best handled with mobile agents. Rather than coding a long-lasting, complex exchange of messages between a client and possibly multiple servers, a mobile agent carries a compact program with all the required procedures for the interaction to be executed remotely.","Electronic Merchandising ",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0351","num":"0732"},"figref":"FIG. 14","b":["1400","1402","1404","1406","1408"]},"As an option, a downloadable sample of the product may also be provided. As another option, user-created customization of the product may also be allowed. Also, compatibility and\/or equivalence of the product may be evaluated with regards to the items similar to the product.","Optionally, a price of the product or the items similar to the product may be generated based on a customer profile, a customer type, and\/or a geographic location. Additionally, one or more of a special offering and a sale of the product or the items similar to the product may be generated for a customer based on a customer profile, a customer type, and\/or a geographic location.","Electronic merchandising introduces a new medium, the Internet, for merchants to sell their products. As shown in , the merchandising component consists of services needed to deliver product, pricing, and inventory information. These services may directly interact with the personalization services in order to deliver the information in a customized format. A traditional example of this would be window-shopping, merchandise browsing, or any informative interaction with the sales clerk.","There are tremendous benefits in adapting electronic (or dynamic) merchandising. Listed below are some of the benefits.\n\n","There are many different styles and metaphors for electronic merchandising. The basic underlying concept is providing product information to the end user. Product information may include product specifications, graphics or video images, digital samples, or even inventory availability. The approach for displaying this information may differ based on a Business-to-Consumer or Business-to-Business implementation. The most common implementation is to use the catalog approach.","Information Storage (Data Model) ","The actual storage of the content is important. Product information stored using static HTML aside, the most common method is in an object or relational database. Many vendors even provide data models for a product database. Vendor-provided data models often will need to be modified in order to meet the specific product detail the system requires. It is important to understand the robustness of the data model as well as the impacts to the system if changes need to be introduced. The system may involve storage and access to many non-discrete data types.","Information Delivery ","In more complex merchandising implementations, the content may consist of non-discrete data types such as audio and video. The delivery mechanism will need to be able to deliver the data to different access devices. Systems will encounter the need to manage non-discrete data types such as audio and video data and alternative content in case the access type cannot handle the data types.","Information Staging ","The ability to deliver new products and information may be critical to stay ahead or match the competition. The speed at which the information can be updated and migrated to production is critical. Be sure to understand the relationship between the content changes and the correct procedures to migrate the changes to the production system. The ability to maintain and grow the site may prove to be key factors in the site's success.","In most cases, a content staging process should be put in place. In the simplest format, the procedures for modifying and adding content, testing, validation of content and subject matter, authorization and migration to production should be documented.","Equivalent Item Identification and Product Comparison ","Buyer-Centric solutions may need to implement a method of evaluating compatibility and equivalence of products. If the buy site deals with multiple trading partners, these functions may provide additional cost savings. Getting buy-in from all the trading partners to agree upon a common model for product information is key for this to be successful.","Dynamic Pricing ","Dynamic pricing is the ability to display a different product price based on a customer profile, customer type, or any other logical possibility. Ties to personalization may be needed to handle pricing schemes based on relationships, terms, volumes, or other potential customer profile items. It is a good practice to base the information on database technologies that allow for quick retrieval and calculation (Note: This is definitely a performance-conscious area).","In addition, the pricing mechanism should be tied to any sort of discounting or promotional incentives. For Business-to-Business implementations, contracts and agreements may be in place to drive the specific pricing. Discounts may be applied on an incremental or time-oriented basis. A common concept used are electronic coupons or other types of discounts. The customers may have earned or acquired a coupon or other form of discount earlier in the interaction with the site. The coupon, usually stored on the user's machine, may be applied to the purchased products.","Product Search ","In addition to catalog navigation, the ability to search for specific products is crucial. Assuming the site is a seller-centric site, there are numerous methods of implementing a product search","Product Sampling ","Product Sampling\u2014Products able to be sampled over the Internet will sell well there. Music is one example. A shopper can listen to pieces of songs on a CD before deciding to order it.","Custom Product Configuration ","Some applications may require the ability for custom part creation or the combination of individual components the user can combine to fulfill a specific, hard-to-manage, need. Part compatibility and pricing can become very complex and unmanageable.","Implementation Consideration","International Considerations","It is important to keep in mind international considerations when designing the merchandising component. The obvious considerations are related to converting currency and linguistics. In addition to these, there are hidden pitfalls of specific customs that may unknowingly be violated. Sales of some goods may also be banned in certain countries.","Site Design Considerations","As with designing any site, the layout, design, and navigation aspects are extremely important. The home page or entrance to the site is crucial. There is often a debate as to what level of clutter and organization is desirable. It is a good practice to research a potential user's current standard practices for site design and layout.","Relationship Management ",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0369","num":"0757"},"figref":"FIG. 16","b":["1600","1602","1604","1606","1608","1610","1612","1614","1616","1618"]},"The analysis of the profile may occur in real time.

As another option, the user may also be allowed to rate the contents.","Further, a potential customer may be selected from a plurality of users and an act may be performed to entice the potential customer to become a real customer. Also, an activity may further be conducted to retain a current customer and a demand generating application may be provided.","Enterprises must respond by capitalizing on the new potential the interactive mediums offer, to reach, communicate, and interact with customers. The way enterprises interact with their customers continues to change due to demand for increased convenience, better access, higher levels of interactivity, and faster fulfillment As a result, more customer interactions are done through electronic means (e.g., home PCs, automated teller machines, automated voice response, 800-numbers, and the Internet). Regardless of the particular medium the customer chooses, it is clear future communications will be increasingly technology-enabled and information-intensive and will provide the foundation for a continuous, two-way dialogue with customers.","The benefits of new media and communications technologies to interact are numerous, enabling enterprises to provide better customer service, to capture valuable information about customer behavior and product use, and to allow greater differentiation at the point of contact. However, most next-generation customer interfaces continue to be designed to be high tech rather than high touch.","The Relationship Management section of the Ecaf, shown in , covers applications and architecture components geared toward capitalizing on the interaction with the customer. Within relationship management, there are two main driving forces: Interactive Marketing  and Personalization .","Personalization ","Personalization is the continuous process of collecting, analyzing, and using information about the end-user in order to improve the productivity and value of their interaction with the organization.","The purpose of personalization is to interact with the customer\/user with the hopes of establishing and building a relationship, increasing sales by catering to the individual customer's needs, cross selling or up selling, and enticing users to return to the site. Unlike any other broadcast medium, the Internet was designed for two-way interaction, hence providing the ability to narrow-cast or customize the interaction to the individual user.","Generating demand for a site's products or services and building customer relationships are crucial for any eCommerce implementation. This is even more evident in seller-centric implementations and hype or marketing driven implementations. The customization can occur in many forms. The services and infrastructure can vary drastically depending on the extent of personalization desired. Each eCommerce package may approach personalization using different services and infrastructure.","The enterprise complexity of the personalization approach will drive the architecture components and application required to implement and deliver this strategy. It is critical for the enterprise success to understand how the personalization strategy will affect the entire enterprise.","Conceptual Personalization Architecture","The conceptual personalization architecture is independent of enterprise or industry.","Implementing a personalization strategy into an existing system or a new one requires the design and development of personalization architecture components. These components are essential to the success of the personalization strategy. They include an Identification component  to identify the user, Information Capture component  to capture information about the user, Content Catalog component  to manage the different contents in the system, Matching component  to match the user's profile attributes with the correct content, Merge & Deliver component  to deliver the content to the user and an Optimization & Administration component  to continuously optimize the personalization interaction and administrate the rules and content as they change or added. See FIG. . By way of example, the conceptual personalization architecture components illustrated in  will be discussed in detail in the subcomponents of this component.","Personalization Techniques","There is currently a lot of hype and press attention centered on the idea of \u201cpersonalization\u201d. Given the wide variety of products and ideas being labeled \u201cpersonalization\u201d, it is apparent that a variety of different personalization delivery techniques and technologies are evolving. As with most emerging concepts, the initial techniques cover a wide range of complexity in both infrastructure and approach. Most personalized sites use a combination of techniques. Samplings of personalization techniques are presented below:","User Acknowledgement",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0382","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0130","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0130-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0131","list-style":"none"},"li":["This is acknowledging the user or greeting them with a personalized statement The statement may be a simple \u2018Welcome back <user name>!\u2019 message or it may be more complex, drawing on information from the last interaction.\n\nPersonalized Interface\n","In this approach, the application or web site's user interface is customized for the individual. The actual page layout or page design is altered based on the individual interacting with the system. This category can be sub-divided based on who (the site or the user) controls how the interface is altered.\n        \n        "]}}}},"This technique filters the information or content displayed to the user based on what is entered by, or known about the user. Many personalized sites use some form of content filtering. A variety of different filtering techniques have emerged. Some are adaptations of traditional client\/server techniques adapted to the Web. In the first grouping of techniques presented here, the user controls how the information is filtered.\n\n","This technique simplifies a complex process or repetitive task by storing the user's preferences and inputs required to complete the process. In most cases a series of pre-defined questions and preferences have to be set up in order to use this functionality. 1-Click purchasing can be offered which allows a user to select an item with a single click and purchase the item\u2014by-passing the order selection, order form, shipping and payment pages. A Fastpath approach can be used where the user has performed the function before and allowed the application or web site to retain more static information like shipping address.","Pre-filled Forms and Information","In situations where user data is required to complete an action, the site can use information that it currently has about the user to pre-fill the form. For example, the site may fill out the order form with the user's last address and order information or the site may fill out the list of items ordered last. This approach differs from Fastpathing in that the user still sees the pre-filled form and has the opportunity to change the data.","Personal Assistant","The site provides an interactive assistant to deliver \u2018personalized help and assistance\u2019. Its purpose is to help the user with difficult actions and site functionality. Based on observing and recording how often (if ever) the user has used a give function within the site, tips, suggestions, and other forms of assistance can be fine tuned to the user's level of experience.","Non-interactive Delivery Techniques","Most of the personalization techniques described above are interactive personalization techniques. Content and information is personalized for the user in real time\u2014while the user interacts with the application or site. Some forms of personalization can also be used in a non-interactive, or \u201cpush\u201d mode","\u201cPush\u201d (or \u201cserver-push\u201d) is where the delivery of information to a user on the Web is triggered and initiated by the information server rather than by the user.","In fact, the information pushed from a server to a user actually comes as the result of a subscription-like standing request created by the user and either stored on the server or on their local machine. This program captures and stores the user's profile locally and then periodically initiates requests for information on the user's behalf from the server.","Push technologies enable an enterprise to reach and provide value to their customer outside of the traditional interactions. Of the personalization techniques described above, content filtering doesn't require that it be delivered though an interactive session. Keep in mind that push does not necessarily mean personalized. A site may simple push the same information to all users or subscribers. Personalized push refers to information that is filtered based on a specific user's request or profile or where the delivery is scheduled for a specific user. There are a variety of different legitimate business reasons to push a users information. The following are some examples of personalized push:\n\n","Don't be a junk e-mailer. The push medium is powerful and potentially less costly than conventional mail. This doesn't justify its use as junk mail. It does not work because everyone receives junk mail, and junk mail that ends up in the trash is failed target marketing efforts. Personalize it. Deliver valuable information that the customer is interested in. Allow them to select the topics, how to filter the content and the frequency.","Personalization Process","Personalization is actually a catchall for several underlying technology capabilities needed to create a personalized interaction between an organization and a user. By breaking the underlying technology and logic into simpler components, one can build an understanding of the processes and technology needed to deliver personalized applications.","Personalization is the continuous process of collecting, analyzing, and using end-user information in order to improve the productivity and value of their interaction with the organization. Implicit in this definition is the need to do a number of basic things. Simply put, there needs to be some method for identifying the user, collecting (or detecting) and storing user information, analyzing it, assessing what content or functionality is appropriate, and present it to the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0394","num":"0798"},"figref":"FIG. 19","b":"1900","ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0141","list-style":"none"},"li":["Identification \u2014The first step is to identify the user. This enables the rest of the personalization process components. One must know whom one is talking to, in order to personalize \u201cpersonalize\u201d the experience.","Information Capture \u2014The next step is to collect information about the user. This may be done with implicit or explicit techniques at the direction of the user, or controlled by the system. The goal is to capture information that will assist in determining and delivering a valuable interaction.","Analysis and Refinement\u2014Once the data is captured, it may need to be refined before it is usable. The system needs the ability to analyze the data and draw insight or conclusions about the information and interaction. The refinement may transform the data from questionnaires or implicit observation to be usable with the matching rules and content indexing strategy.","Match\u2014When the personalization strategy is developed, a base of \u2018Personalization Matching Factor\u2019 and rules (based on who, what, where, when, why . . . ) are created. These matching factors and rules are necessary to determine the content, navigation, and layout appropriate for the user.","Merge and Delivery \u2014Upon determining the appropriate information and format, the information needs to be merged and deliverer to the user. This may be through an interactive interface or through a push mechanism.","Personalization Optimization \u2014Personalization is a complex and evolutionary process. The ability to gather metrics and measurements on the personalization process in order to perform rule or data translations, model tuning and reporting is essential to maximizing the concept's potential.\n\nPersonalization Strategy\n"]}},"Personalization will continue to be adopted by the market place. Numerous sites have incorporated personalization techniques into their sites and the marketplace is full of independent software vendors creating personalization related software.","Each enterprise must assess their personalization opportunities from their own perspective and develop their own personalization strategy. The personalization strategy must be integrated with the enterprise's existing customer relationship, technology and eCommerce strategies.","Developing a Personalization Strategy","Using the Opportunity matrix given below, the opportunities where personalization typically delivers the most value in within the Interact domain.

The value of the personalized interaction will be dependent on many factors such as the type of products and services (can they be personalized?) or the type of relationship with the customer or consumer and the ability to capture user information.","A formal personalization strategy should be established that included the near term goals and future vision. Many companies jump right in without any guidance or realization on how they are growing or enhancing the enterprise. The strategy should begin with the big picture. Perform an examination of the critical forces affecting the enterprise and how these forces affect the business process. What are the drivers? Society, marketing, technology, business\/industry? With the personalization market emerging, there are still with many unproven business cases and unproven technology. Firms should not engage in personalization simple because they can, nor should they fall prey to the unproven expectations generated by vendors or marketing hype. Firms considering personalization must frame personalization in the context of true enterprise goals (increasing customer retention or increase customer extension), then determine how personalization will help accomplish these goals.","The personalization strategy should evaluate the complexity of the personalization, the cost and time to implement and the potential business impact. In many cases, a true one-to-one personalized site may not make sense. Creating millions of varieties of a product will only complicate the interaction to the point that the user is overwhelmed. In some cases engaging in simple personalized dialogues may be the best near and midterm solutions.","Since different users may wish to interact differently, there may be many right answers to the personalization strategy. Some users are self serving and want to have the tools to explore or make choices on their own, others want immediacy, others may want intimacy such that their feed back and options register with the company. See  for a graphical depiction of personalization from no customization at  to one-on-one personalization at .","The type of dialog that the site engages with the user may vary based on the user. In some cases no personalization or customization should be performed. As more information is captured on the user, the correct type of dialog should be assessed. Determining the correct touch points and level of complexity of the personalization techniques is an important part of the enterprise's personalization strategy.","Common Impediments to Personalization","Listed below are some of the common impediments to personalization.\n\n","The architecture components and processes will differ depending on the type of personalization technique implemented. For each technique, there are important considerations and differences that should be understood. Each technique will vary in approach, information required, and delivery. The following items should be considered:\n\n","These questions can be answered in many ways. The impact the answers have is dependent on the enterprise and its personalization strategy.","A few specific techniques to consider are detailed here:\n\n","The first task of the personalization engine is to identify the user. Unlike the everyday person to person interactions where a person relies on recognizing the another's face, voice or other attributes to identify the other person, identifying a user on-line can be a difficult process. The simple task of identifying users does not prove to be a simple task at all. A system may personalize an interaction based on the information captured during a single session or information gathered over the entire duration of the relationship. Regardless, the information that is captured needs to be associated with the user. In order to track a user, an identification or tracking mechanism needs to be created.","Identification Techniques","A variety of techniques can be used to identify the user. The technique may depend on the site's security requirement and privacy concerns. Today, the most common approaches are to either create a cookie on the client machine or to have an identification system on the server, such as a user login. In the future, digital certificates will be more prevalent, and should become the dominant identification method.","Client Side Storage\u2014Cookie","A Cookie is a small text file placed on the client machine's hard drive by a Web server. It is essentially a user's identification card, and cannot execute code or deliver viruses. It is unique to the user and can only be used by the server that issued it. Although this is a common method for identifying a user, there are many risks associated with it.\n\n","This technique requires the user to log-in or sign on to the site. This requires the creation of a user ID and password to utilize the system and the resources needed to validate and store the ID and password. With this technique, the user must remember their log-in name and password. Additional services to lookup log-in names or request new passwords should also be provided.","Certificates and Digital ID's","In every day life people carry different forms of identification; a person's on-line identity may be no different. Modern cryptographic technology offers certificates or digital IDs that will serve as electronic forms of identification. Digital certificates are still evolving and the key players and details on how the pieces tie together are still falling into place.","One example of an effective use of a certificate is Firefly Passport. There the certificate is tied to a list of user profile information. (Microsoft purchased Firefly for this technology. The name is apt to change over time.) The Firefly Passport gives users an application with which to control their personal information and payment details. The information can be dispensed selectively to third parties to use.","A combination of techniques may also be used. The cookie may be used for the initial identification or the default ID for the Log-in process, while the server side log-in process would then be used to verify the identity of the user. It is important to make this process seamless and unobtrusive. The identification process should fade in the background. It should be present yet invisible and unobtrusive.","Relating Multiple ID's","Creating a log-in or sign-in process introduces the traditional problem of multiple log-ins, (or ID's) from a site or enterprise perspective. If a user forgets their login, they may simply create a new one. This may result in multiple logins for the user, and any information related to the previous login is not associated to the user's new one. To prevent this, a facility to look up existing login names or request a new password should be provided.","As in the client\/server world, a single or universal log-in is advised, especially for systems that wish to personalize their site's interaction. If the enterprise already has an existing user base, pushing out IDs to users or allowing the ability to re-use the existing ID should be encouraged. For example, United Airlines created a PIN (Personal Identification Number) for each of their Mileage Plus members that provided access to the Mileage Plus section of their Web site and pushed (physically mailed) this out to the respective user. The PIN was their mileage plus number with a password associated with it. By doing this, they were able to reuse their existing identification process and login IDs.","Information Capture ","The personalization process is data intensive and is driven by the information collected about the system's users. The more information the site collects and retains about a user, the more likely it can add value and interact on a personalized level. With out this crucial data, there is no basis to shape the interaction or drive the personalization techniques.","Personalization Profile","The information collected about a user is considered the user's profile. Logically, this is everything the enterprise (site) knows about the user. Attributes from the user's profile will be the input to the personalization process and the driving data for the different personalization techniques. A profiling strategy should be developed by the enterprise that addresses what information to capture, the sources of this information, the methods to capture it, and how this information will be stored. If the customer is to be treated the same at all points of interaction, a common profile should be developed that is shared by all departments and applications.","Determining what information to capture or what attributes make up the user's profile can be a difficult process. In most cases, the profile will be based on the enterprise's personalization strategy, the personalization techniques to be implemented, the data required to implement them and a mix of any user information deemed usable that can be captured. In general, the site needs to capture the information required to perform the analysis aspect of the personalization process for each of the personalization technique to be implemented. This information might include:\n\n","Each personalization technique may require a different set of attributes from the user's profile. The information needed to deliver a \u2018Site Controlled Contextual Inferences\u2019 will be very different than the information needed for \u2018pre-filled forms.\u2019 Site Controlled Contextual Inferences Content Filtering requires the creation of rules and the necessary user information that satisfy the rules or \u2018Contextual Inferences\u2019. (The information required to satisfy a rule is referred to as Personalization Matching Factors (PMFs) and will be discussed in more detail in the Matching Logic component.) For instance, the rule may be based on gender, age, purchase history or customer demographics. On the other hand, the information that is used to Pre-Fill forms may be a different set of user profile attributes. For example, this might be name, address, shipping information and payment information. Another personalization technique may use the same set of user information or may require another subset of user data.","Physically, this data may come from many sources within the enterprise. Information may be gathered directly from the user's interaction with the personalized site through implicit or explicit information gathering techniques. Information may be used from other data sources such as existing application's transactional data, the enterprises' data warehouse, or from other internal or external data sources.","The situation should be analyzed to determine if the \u2018profile data\u2019 should be replicated and stored in additional profile tables or if it should remain within the existing data source. Some personalization techniques will require additional tables to store the user's profile attributes needed to deliver the personalization technique. This will be discussed in more detail within the Matching section of the paper.","Profiling Standards","The industry has recognized the importance of personalization and the requirement of a user profile information to deliver personalization. To date, a profiling standard or definition of a common \u2018User Profile\u2019 does not exist. This means that each site will be required to capture and retain its own set of profile information. From a user's perspective, this introduces additional annoyance since they will be prompted by personalized sites for the same basic information. The Open Profiling Standard has been proposed to address this issue.","Platform for Privacy Preferences and Open Profiling Standards","The Internet Privacy Working Group (IPWG) began to develop the Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P). P3P extends the Platform for Internet Content Selection (PICS) standard with notice and consent capabilities to enable automatic negotiation of preferences, policies, and information exchange. If P3P settings are accurate, Web surfers should be able to surf at will and only see P3P notices when they stray out of bounds of what is already approved in the profile.","Netscape, FireFly Network Inc. and VeriSign have introduced Open Profiling Standard (OPS), a proposed standard that helps to address the issues of multiple profiles. This proposed standard would provide Internet site developers with a uniform way of getting users' Personal Profile information in order to personalize interaction. The OPS is a standard being worked on as part of the World Wide Web Consortium's Platform for Privacy Preferences (http:\/\/www.w3c.org). It is compatible with the existing vCard and X.509 digital certificate technology standards, which allow for user identification and authentication over the Web.","Individuals will have a Personal Profile that contains their personal information, including their names, e-mail address, mailing address, and any other information they wish to provide. This profile will be stored on their personal computer (or securely stored in a corporate-wide or global directory). The first time that an individual visits a Web site that supports OPS, the Web site will request information from the Personal Profile. To protect their privacy, users can decide whether they want all or part of the information to be given to publishers, and which ones can see it. In addition, if the Web site collects additional information about the individual's preferences, it can (with the individual's permission) store that information in the Personal Profile for future use.","Some of the benefits to the user are as follows:\n\n","Users have the ability to selectively release or withhold information in their Personal Profiles, rather than the \u201call or nothing\u201d process of accepting or rejecting cookies that the user cannot examine. OPS gives individuals both more flexibility and more control over personal information than cookies can.","P3P and OPS have common goals and have unified their projects. The governing term is now P3P.","Information Capture Techniques","Once the profile strategy has been defined and the sources have been identified, the next step is capturing the information. In many cases, the information comes from existing data sources. In these cases the data may require refinement or replication. The remaining information can be captured directly from the user's interaction with the site.","In most cases, the user will control the personalization process or technique. In these cases the user is aware of the personalization technique and chooses to use the interface that will deliver it. For example, a configured interface such as My Yahoo! requires the user to select the layout and topics they wish to display on the personalized page. The configuration (or setup) interface captures the needed information and adds this to the user's logical profile.","On the other end of the spectrum are information capture techniques that the site controls. The site collects information about the interaction. The interactive information capture techniques can be categorized as explicit or implicit.","Explicit Information Capture","Explicit information capture usually provides an interface to collect profile information. The site explicitly asks the user to provide the information. Examples of explicit information capture techniques are:\n\n","Implicit Techniques gather information about the interaction without directly asking the user. In essence, the site is recording the interaction in search of useful information. The user may be unaware that the site is capturing information. The most common implicit technique is clickstream analysis. The site records the user's actions, what they clicked on or where they navigated to, the content displayed, time spent or the duration a graphic was displayed. The information gathered is then analyzed for patterns and trends.","Information Capture Concerns","The goal of a personalized site is to increase the value of the interaction of the user with the organization. Unfortunately, the site has the potential to do the opposite. The personalization aspects of the site could actually offend or deter customers. The approach the site uses for information capture will play a large part in the personalized site's success. The following are some items to be aware of when capturing user profile information:\n\n","Today, the Web content of most sites is unmanaged. The enterprise does not utilize a method of tracking the content or the attributes of the content. Instead, the enterprise has a pool of content that may span multiple directories, departments and web servers. When content is created it is added to this pool of content by simply adding it to the Web server's directory and adding the necessary link required to display it. The content within this pool may be duplicated, outdated or unused. In short, the enterprise has no idea of the extent of the content or information about the attributes of the content.","Unmanaged content may be an obstacle for personalization. In order to deliver personalized content or filtered content the system must know what content exists and the attributes of this content. A content catalog  or content management system should be used to manage the enterprise's content. A simple definition of a content catalog is given below.","What is deemed as content can take many forms. As illustrated in , content may be Web pages (HTML pages) , graphics (images) , audio, video, or even information  and messages. How this content is stored may also take many forms; it may be stored in table, files or directories. The content catalog needs to be aware of what content exists and where it is stored. This can be achieved by retaining attributes of the content and providing indexing to the content. Content attributes might be physical properties such as what type of content it is (HTML page, graphic, audio file, video file or textual message) or the size of the content. The difficulty is attempting to store the heuristic or analytical attributes and making these attributes available for personalization techniques. The indexing strategy should include full text and attribute indexing which provides efficient access for the enterprise's users and potentially any integrated members of the enterprise's value chain.","Matching Logic ","This personalization component needs to provide the intelligence to match the user's profile attributes with the correct content and deliver this content to the user. Bridging the profile information to the content is truly the heart of the personalization architecture. A variety of different approaches can be implemented to accomplish this task. The complexity of this matching logic is directly proportional to how flexible, robust and dynamic the personalization aspects of the site are.","The Match concept is the process of analyzing the information that is known about the user and determining the correct content to display to them. Once the user profile attributes have been identified, they must be applied against the rules or matching logic defined within the site in order to determine the appropriate content to display. Three inputs are required in order to complete the Match process:\n\n","A simple example of this matching logic is a defined query. The site may provide the logic for a user to view their account information. In this case the profile information is their user ID or account number, the rule is the defined query (SELECT account_info FROM Account where Acct_Id=:User_Acct_Id) and the content is the user's account information stored in Account table. If the content is stored in a relational or object database, SQL queries are an effective method of accessing this data. In this case the \u2018defined rule\u2019 takes the form of a SQL statement. Unfortunately, most of the content is not stored in relational databases or is not directly related to something as simple as a user's account ID. Instead the content is web pages or massive amounts of news feeds and textual information. These situations require a different and possibly more complex approach and infrastructure to perform the matching logic. In this environment, the rules are usually composed of Personalization Matching Factors (PMFs).","Personalization Matching Factor (PMFs)","A Personalization Matching Factor (PMF) is the building block for a rule. It is the information required to perform the matching aspect of the personalization process. This is the demographic\/psychographic\/sociographic or any other information that will be needed to drive the personalization process. A PMF might be as simple as the user's gender or a complex attribute such as driver type that is derived from a group of data. Included in the definition of the PMF should be the definition necessary to create it.","Developing PMFs will require involvement of the Marketing department and other business entities that understand the customer strategy and the enterprise's customers. It is important to understand the customer needs, what the customer expects, and what makes a difference to them when determining and creating PMFs.","PMFs should be restricted to information that can be realistically captured by the site as well as information that is reliable and accurate. Conceptually, a PMF can be any piece of derived or any conceived information. For example, a PMF could be the user's gender, age, marital status, number of children, the number of years they have been a customer, their profession, driving record, interests such as sports, travel or other leisure activities, favorite color, a personality trait such as if they are detail oriented or pessimistic in nature, or any otherdemographic\/psychographic\/sociographic piece of information. How would this information be captured? What are the attributes that would be used to derive this? What is the accuracy of this information? Why is this PMF used to personalize? These are the types of questions that need to be asked when determining possible PMFs.","A PMF needs to have a clear definition and a finite list of possibilities. For example, a site may create a PMF called \u2018Age Classification\u2019. The site would need to define what it means by the PMF \u2018Age Classification\u2019. For this example, age classification is simple a logical group of users based on their age. The values would be:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0446","num":"0901"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00005","num":"00005"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"112pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Age","Age Classification "]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["\u20020-12","Child"]},{"entry":["13-19","Teenager"]},{"entry":["20-40","Young Adult"]},{"entry":["41-64","Middle Aged"]},{"entry":["\u200265-125","Senior Citizen"]},{"entry":["125-200","Ancient"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"A PMF may also be a combination of low level data. If a PMF of \u2018Insurance Risk\u2019 were created, the required data would be far more than age. It would need to include age, driving history, vehicle, region and potentially other data.","Rules and Matching Logic","The PMFs are the building blocks for rules and matching logic.

Instead, the infrastructure should be created that can define rules, evaluate rules, assign a rule to a dynamic content area or page, and assign content to specific rule results. Instead of hard coding this with in the application or script, the rule component or dynamic content area (DCA) is placed in the script.

This technique is a complex combination of rules and relationships using the user's interactions with the site to increase the knowledge of the enterprise about the customer. The best way to describe this is with a definition of neural networks. A neural network is a system of programs and data structures approximating the operation of the human brain. Typically, a neural network is initially \u201ctrained\u201d or fed large amounts of data and rules about data relationships (for example, A grandfather is older than a person's father is). A program can then instruct the network how to behave in response to an external stimulus, or it can initiate activity on its own based on the user's actions.","Inductive reasoning\/Collaborative Filtering\u2014Firefly defines collaborative filtering as a technology that emulate the social processes of people making recommendations based on an understanding of one another's preferences. Individual agents track and choose items based on individuals' tastes and preferences.","The core technology personalizes both the delivery of content and the knowledge of related people within a defined networked environment, or \u201ctaste space.\u201d Firefly tools correlate individual users' preferences for specific items based on either explicit or implicit ratings of comparable items in other situations. These ratings may be stored entirely within a single Web site or compiled on the fly from information assembled from individual clients and shared servers.","Collaborative Filtering assesses a single set of user preferences to identify an individual community of interest. Collaborative Filtering correlates the tastes on an individual user with the preferences of comparable users to develop a list of personalized recommendations. It is some times referred to as People-to-people matching, and is aimed at automating word-of-mouth kind of information.","Canned Queries\u2014A system of canned queries allows the user to choose only certain actions that have been pre-determined for the user. The queries only give the user the options listed, and do not change over time."]}}}},"The examples above are mainly site controlled. The site either has a pre-defined rule or matching logic that will execute. The site is responsible for determining what has been learned from the interaction, what is enabled based on the knowledge gained, what additional information will provide additional insight. Where possible, the users should be allowed to define the rules and matching logic or the content they wish to view. Provide the user the structure to create a rule or define a query.","Defining legitimate business rules and models is as important as the infrastructure to evaluate them. The rule may execute and content may be delivered but if the rule doesn't make good business sense the effort is wasted. Business and marketing personnel should be involved in defining the rules and verifying that they are correctly translated and technically implemented. This is another reason that the personalization team should include individuals from IT, the business and marking departments. The team needs to understand their existing and potential customer, the content available, and when and why to display it.","Merge and Deliver Content ","The rules for matching logic should be defined as stand alone entities so that they may be reused in multiple situations. Each situation may associate the same rule to a different interaction and a different set of content. The matching logic should be associated with a template or interaction and content should be associated with a rule result or condition of the matching logic.","One possible method of associating a rule and content to an interaction is by using a Dynamic Content Area (DCA). A DCA is embedded with a template and points to a specific rule, and a rule results set will be associated with specific content. For example a page maybe explaining a particular service to a current user. The site may wish to display on the page a graphic that the user can relate to along with a list of benefits that are personalized to the user and finally list discounts that the user might be qualified for.","A separate DCA would be used for each set of data.  illustrates an exemplary template  with three DCAs embedded within the template.\n\n","During the design of the site, a decision must be made to determine which areas of the site will provide personalized content to the user, the rules to use and matching logic associated with it, and what content should be displayed for each rule result. Since there is no face-to-face interaction with the user, identifying the content to use is very important. The web site must make the users feel as though they are being communicated directly. Once the page is requested or encountered by the user, the page is generated, and each DCA will request that a rule be executed and the content should be generated according to the user profile.","The normal delivery method of the content is through the use of HTTP. This method will be used to deliver the majority of the content. There are other methods of delivery that may be considered depending upon the content to be delivered. Other delivery methods includes e-mail, FTP, Push or Channels and streaming video. Since timing of the delivery is very important, consideration must be given to developing a method of delivery that provides the most impact to the user and does so in a timely manner.","Administration ","Personalization is difficult for a number of reasons, but the biggest \u201cgotcha\u201d is that, above all, it requires dedicated maintenance staff. While much of the process of personalization can be automated, the construction of the business rules used to match content to visitors and the creation of the metadata tags required to classify all content still require a tremendous amount of human oversight. The need for such oversight is only compounded by the fact that personalization becomes exponentially more complex as the number of visitors and amount of available content increases. The net result is that firms that decide to engage in personalization without ramping up staff adequately will fail.","Personalization is a continuous process. It is not an application that is delivered and then left unmonitored or forgotten about. Personalization techniques will need to be added, removed and modified. Rules, content, and messages will change. Most enterprises fail to measure their return on investments, or to directly attribute customer behavior to certain initiatives. As a result, the enterprise often invests in initiatives, promotions and campaigns without understanding how they will affect product or customer profitability. Procedures, measurement and reporting devices, and metrics need to be created to allow for the enterprise to evaluate and improve their personalized interactions and deliver their customer strategy. The site may provide the customer a chance to make a purchasing decision. If they decide not to make this purchase, what is the reason why? The enterprise should attempt to gather information on why this result occurs and seek to prevent it in the future. The following optimization and administration components should be considered for a personalized site:\n\n","With the emergence of interactive mediums and the inherent capability to gather real time information about the customer interacting with the medium, enterprise's marketing strategies and systems are becoming more customer-centric. With the move from mass (or targeted) marketing to a form of customer-centric marketing, enterprises must evaluate their customer relationship model.","Traditionally, marketing models tended to focus exclusively on customer acquisition (mass marketing) and then on customer selection (micromarketing and target marketing). However, several studies have shown it costs between four and 10 times as much to acquire a profitable customer as it does to retain one. This awareness has resulted in a heightened emphasis on customer retention and extension and has been the driving force of relationship marketing.","However, customer retention and extension are less dependent on traditional marketing and are more tied to the value perceived by the customer during every interaction with the enterprise. In addition, these strategies require a different marketing infrastructure that is information- and customer-driven, rather than product- and creative-driven. Thus, relationship marketing is somewhat of a misnomer, as adding value to the customer relationship is not simply a marketing challenge, but rather a challenge involving every function within the enterprise. This business model calls for enterprises to differentiate themselves by consistently providing superior service at every point of contact with the customer.","The ShARE Model","The ShARE (Selection , Acquisition , Retention , and Extension ) customer relationship model  is detailed in FIG. . See also FIG. . This model addresses the changes in the shift to interactive marketing. Due to the emergence of interactive mediums, today's systems now have the ability to address all areas of the ShARE model.","Selection ","The selection portion of the ShARE model deals with determining who within the general population will be a company's most profitable customers. Selection deals with determining who makes up a product's target audience, and allows a company to focus their attention more accurately. This is the area where demographic information, such as age, geography, and income are applied to produce a more finite list of likely customers. The selection process allows businesses to make strategic decisions such as NOT to market a snow shovel in Ecuador.","Acquisition ","Acquisition focuses on getting a potential customer to use one's service or buy one's product in the most efficient way. This area has traditionally focused on mass marketing and measuring a business' cost per thousands of consumers reached. The classic example of acquisition is Proctor & Gamble's use of daytime television dramas in the United States to sell soap, creating what is now called the soap opera. Other methods of acquisition include direct mailings, telephone solicitation, toll free order numbers, and, more recently, Internet advertising and online businesses.","Advertising","Capitalizing on the two-way interaction and an audience of the general public, advertising is often utilized on applications deployed on the Internet. In a browser-based implementation, the use of frames or banners creates the possibility to dedicate a section of the display to advertising. With most of marketing capabilities, the advertising model (services) can vary from simple static advertisements to a robust advertising integrated with the personalized system. The implementation methods may range from an advertisement Applet to advertising services integrated with the personalization system. Detailed below are possible services included in a complex advertising implementation.\n\n","As online advertising and its supporting technology matures, new advertising methods will emerge. For example, the use of \u2018intermercial\u2019 (sometimes referred to as interstitial\u2014meaning intertwined) ads that automatically pop up between pages may prove to be the next method of choice. It is important to ensure the advertising services remain flexible and are able to address the evolving technology used to implement advertising.","Retention ","Now that companies know it is cheaper to hang on to existing customers than to find new ones, more and more emphasis is being placed on customer retention. Retention focuses on keeping customers for as long as possible. The most effective way to do this, is to provide excellent customer service at each and every interaction with the customer. Since electronic business don't provide traditional customer service, it is important web-based businesses have sites with appropriate support functionality. The support should be easy to use, and meet the specific needs of that product's consumers.","Recommendation Services","Recommendation functions may take up multiple formats. The most common format are simple services to allow the site's users to provide direct feedback, positive or negative, and recommendations about the content or products on the site. By providing these services, the site may create a community where users can interact with each other, furthering the site's worth. For example, a sict could allow for users to submit book reviews. The information is then available for consumption by the general public. While the technology to implement this is rather simple, the process may prove to be a little more complex. The process includes receiving input, reviewing recommendations, filtering and approving content, and then posting the review or recommendations. The lack of a filtration or review process could be devastating to a site.","Another type of recommendation service makes suggestions to its user base. These services can range from simple to complex. A more complex recommendation service may utilize collaborative filtering. Collaborative filtering is the technique of using content or product ratings from the site's user base to predict the interest other potential users will have in the content or products. Correlation algorithms use the profile information, history, and\/or input preferences to construct a correlation group of users whose ratings are effective predictors for the new user. Prediction algorithms then use the ratings and profile information of the users to make predictions of the content they most likely will find interesting. (Note: The collaborative filtering technique could be implemented within the personalization system.)","Site Announcements and Event Reminders","Additional relationship building techniques are site announcements and reminders. The underlying services are again personalized. The site has created content which may range from new product announcements based on the customer's last visit or reminders of an upcoming event important to the specific customer. For example, an event reminder could point out an upcoming wedding, personal anniversary or holiday. The user, once reminded, may then utilize the site to act on the event. If the site implements complex event reminders, additional services may be needed to provide calendar and scheduling functionality. These services may also be incorporated with the off-site subscription services to provide reminders to users not logged into the site.","Loyalty and Return Customer Programs","Creating an environment that promotes customers to return to the site is critical for the longevity of the site. Many of the seller-centric implementations will utilize membership services and other incentive programs to try and promote customers to return. For example, site members would receive discounts and additional privileges, thus building a better relationship with the site. Incentives like frequent shopper points or access to member only information are other common methods. The loyalty programs may require additional logic for permissions and content filtering. Most of this may be implemented by gathering and using profiles and integration with a complex personalization system.","Return Programs are services geared toward enticing the customer to return to the site. The Internet eliminates two main factors affecting customer loyalty. The first is proximity. In the brick and mortar medium, customers tend to shop (or browse) close to where they live or work. The second factor is time or how long a store is open. With the Internet being 7 by 24 and geographically independent, these items are no longer relevant. For this reason, considerable effort may be geared toward creating return programs. The most common forms are electronic version of current methods, although they may be more effective due to personalization and real-time delivery.","Push and Off-Site Subscription Services","This section includes merchandising using email to push information to a user. (Note: Subscriptions to sites and information are covered in the Order Processing\u2014Fulfillment component.) Many of the common services for storage, filtering, formatting and approving content would be utilized. Additional services would be needed to push the content to the desired mailing list. Details and considerations for using push technology is included in application discussing the Netcentric Framework, referenced above. Below are some basic services.\n\n","Extension asks businesses to answer the question, \u201cHow can one increase the loyalty and profitability of this customer?\u201d","Cross Selling and Up Selling","Cross Selling and Up Selling are similar to recommendation services. Cross selling uses some knowledge of the consumer to suggest complimentary or similar products in which the consumer may be interested\u2014\u201cWould you like fries with that?\u201d Up selling is an effort to sell more of the same thing, or a better version of what the consumer may currently be considering\u2014\u201cWould you like that Super Sized?\u201d","Cross selling and up selling are considered an application or service enabled by complex personalization. Although very important from a marketing perspective, once the underlying services for complex personalization are in place, many of the demand generating applications are now possible. Cross selling or up selling could be implemented by product relationships in a database.","Maintenance and Administration ",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0481","num":"0962"},"figref":"FIG. 24","b":["2400","2402","2404","2406","2408","2410"]},"One of the items altered based on the profiles of the users may include price, which may be altered to reflect a discount assigned to the user. A search may also be performed for the internal data in the e-Commerce system prior to the synchronization of the external data.","As an option, load balancing services may also be performed that initiate and stop processes as utilization levels vary in the e-Commerce system. As another option, managing of the contact information may further include tracking responses to the users of the e-Commerce system.","As with any system, a support, administration, and maintenance facility and procedures need to be put in place to remain operational as well as efficient. In general, packaged implementations will only provide minimal maintenance and administration facilities leaving the bulk of the burden to the integrator. The underlying technology for the facilities may be basic batch download\/uploads, simple server processes and applications or even browser based. It is important to understand the system administration and maintenance needs, develop a plan, and stick with it. Some of the areas to consider are listed below.  illustrates high-level concepts of maintenance and administration of the framework.","System Monitoring Facilities ","The health of a system can be easily maintained by putting in place monitoring facilities and procedures for capturing the system's electronic vital signs. Far too often the users of a system are the first to know of system problems while the administrators are the last to know. This can be prevented by creating automated monitoring facilities for server processes, disk space, memory, CPU utilization, access time, number of connections, and other electronic vital signs. The complexity of these facilities is open for debate. In addition to online monitoring facilities, robust logging, audit trails, and archiving capabilities should be included. These will aid in analysis and forecasting of system needs.","System Administration","The term system administration is a vague term used to categorize the actions needed to support a system. This may include starting, stopping, or restarting servers or processes, scheduling backups and loads of databases or files, recovery procedures or anything else needed to maintain the system. Traditional system administration also includes updates to system software, packages, and operating systems. Listed below are additional system administration considerations an eCommerce system may encounter.","Merchandise Administration ","The merchandising aspect may introduce additional administration and maintenance. Procedures should be put in place to handle sold out merchandise and back order items. Updating merchandising content, currency, tax, and pricing may need to be performed on a regular basis. The merchandise administration facility should be able to handle pricing and discount items and have the ability to allow automatic updating and manual override capabilities for authorized administrators.","Personalization Maintenance Facility ","The biggest challenges in personalization are determining matching rules for the business's market plans, categorization of the profiles, gathering profile information, and then developing robust content with adequate content indexing. Once these have been established, they should be easily maintained. When designing the personalization services, maintenance of the rules and content should be considered. The people most likely driving this information will not be technology oriented, and may require simple interfaces for altering rules for marketing, advertising, or other personalized content.","Content Administration","As content is added, this information will need to be indexed and integrated with the search technology implemented at the site. Other items such as customer service chat discussions or review would also need to be purged on a regular basis.","Data Administration ","Many times, utilizing packages to implement an eCommerce solution will introduce a proprietary data model for customer and product information. In order to make this information accessible to the rest of the organization, the information will need to be synchronized with the enterprise data. Services may be required to determine changes and synchronize the data. This would be true for any information the site gathers not integrated into the enterprise data.","Load Balancing","In addition to the monitoring and maintenance facilities, services should be considered to stabilize performance. Providing the system is scalable, load balancing services would aid in initiating and stopping extra processes as utilization levels vary. Processes could be started to handle additional requests during peek periods providing the user with a consistent level of performance. This is extremely important in periods of peak usage. A good example is the fluctuation of the average response times of some of the current electronic trading systems during market surges. Times during a market surge were 2-3 minutes above their average 6-10 second response time.","Contact Maintenance ","Internet users are quick to point out mistakes and opinions for improvements. Sites will receive sporadic emails from users experiencing a variety of emotions about the site. Users may sour quickly if actions are not taken or noted to items pointed out. Responses to user feedback should be monitored to ensure that each message from a user is responded to in some manner.","Maintenance and Administration of the system is often wrongfully overlooked. It is a key component in improving customer satisfaction and building customer relationships. Having robust maintenance and administration facilities should increase the system's overall stability by reducing the time and cost to identify and fix issues, automating processes, and enabling system administers.","Implementation Considerations","Information Staging","The ability to deliver new products and information may be critical to stay ahead or match the competition. The speed at which the information can be updated and migrated to production is critical. Be sure to understand the relationship between the content changes and the correct procedures to migrate the changes to the production system. The ability to maintain and grow the site may prove to be key factors in the site's success.","In most cases, a content staging process should be put in place. In the simplest format, the procedures for modifying and adding content, testing, validation of content and subject matter, authorization and migration to production should be documented.","Order Processing ",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0496","num":"0977"},"figref":"FIG. 26","b":["1010","1000","2600","2602","2604","2606"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0497","num":"0978"},"figref":"FIG. 27","b":["2700","2702","2704","2706","2708","2710","2712","2714"]},"A medium for receiving the payment may be via credit based payment, debit based payment, and\/or electronic cash. Additionally, verification of export restrictions with respect to a selected product may also be allowed.","As an option, the ability to review, update, and cancel the order at any time may be allowed. As another option, electronic rights may also be managed. In even a further option, order tracking information about a status of the order may also be provided.","Allowing customers the ability to not just browse and interact but complete the purchased is crucial for a successful eCommerce solution. This section includes many of the capabilities needed to negotiate and perform the entire transaction. The transaction begins when the user takes action to purchase the item(s). From a seller-centric view, the transaction is initiated once the \u2018purchase\u2019 button is selected. The \u2018buy transaction\u2019 may include sub-transactions such as totaling, payment selection, inventory management and purchase authorization.","It is important to recognize some commerce packages specialize in the transaction processing portion of an eCommerce solution. For example, Open Market's OM-Transact, does not provide a catalog interface or any of the infrastructure for interaction with the potential customer. Instead, it will provide an interface for communicating with its transactional infrastructure.","Each implementation will require specific flow and business logic. The commerce packages available today provide generic order processing business capabilities that will need to be customized to achieve the specific needs of the business. Illustrated in  is an example flow of business capabilities needed for complete order processing on an eCommerce implementation. The process begins with operation  which allows browsing and interacting in order to permit selection of merchandise in operation . The process ends in operation  with settlement.","Merchandise Selection ","Some sort of merchandise collection facility is needed. All items of interest should be gathered and organized so they can be reviewed prior to purchase. The most common approaches are an order form or a metaphor such as a shopping cart or basket.","Shopping Cart Metaphor\u2014The user is enabled to select items and add them to his online shopping cart. The items selected will be tracked. The user has the ability to add or remove items, review item details, and check out and total the items. In addition, the shopping cart should allow the user to exit and reenter the store without losing the items he has selected.","Independent of the medium, the following capabilities should be considered:\n\n","The check out phase begins once the user has decided to purchase or order the items gathered. A variety of capabilities may be required or may affect this process. Listed below are some of the services to consider during the check out processing.","Price Verification","Given the geographically independent environment and multitude of potential customer relationships, many factors may affect the actual pricing. The first step in the transaction is determining the price. The price in most cases will be dynamically generated based on the actual price of the items, taxes, fulfillment or delivery costs, and any other item affecting the price. Ideally, product prices, shipping and handling charges and other charges should be maintained separately. This functionality should include the ability to handle tax-exempt customers and transactions. Sales tax and value added tax logging and auditing capabilities should also be included.","Discounting","In general, pricing is calculated dynamically. Discounts may be applied for many reasons either to specific items or to the entire order. Additional discounts may be given for using a preferred payment mechanism. Other implementations may provide discounts at the end of month based on total sales.","Taxes and Tariffs","The tax issues related to the buying and selling of tangible personal property or services through the Internet, are numerous and complex. Questions include what products and services are subject to tax, when and where to impose a tax on the retail transaction, and what tax (sales or use) the merchant is required to collect. Tax calculation functions with an integrated sales tax or value-added tax (VAT) engine, able to perform real-time calculations based on customer-specified product codes, order point of origin, shipper's address or recipient's address should be considered.","Due to these complexities, most solutions interface with a tax engine to reduce the risk and legalities involved with taxes. Most of the commerce packages available today interface with the leading tax engines.","Shipping Charges","Shipping charges may be applicable for items not fulfilled directly by the site. In some cases, the customer's shipping location may be used to determine their taxes and shipping charges. There are a variety of mechanisms for determining shipping charges. They include:\n\n","Other basic order information may be gathered during the check out processing. The most common method is an order form. The form should be easily customizable and may contain a variety of information.\n\n","After a total has been established, a payment method must be determined. A variety of mediums can handle the transfer of money. The methods, flow, technology, and potentially messaging, will vary by implementation. Issues concerning security, liability, and relationship to fulfillment need to be worked out.","Listed below are some considerations for determining the payment flow and mediums to be utilized.\n\n","There are a multitude of different vendors and technologies available for handling electronic payments. The infrastructure, process, and technology may vary dramatically from vendor to vendor. The actual mediums for the current payment options fall into these categories:\n\n","The fulfillment process can be complex and will vary depending on the type of goods being delivered. Integration to existing systems as well as communication of invoices and orders to distributors or trading partners will play an important role.","A tremendous amount of communication and back end processing will be needed. Often implementing an eCommerce environment opens the doors to review the underlying systems and processes. Potential areas include warehouse notifications and P.O. delivery. Print, fax, or sneaker net systems may be upgraded to EDI, email, or another electronic medium. Updating and improving these processes will be critical for providing customer support. Users will come to expect the ability to see the progress of their order as it moves from the site to warehouse to their desktop.","Electronic Distribution","Soft goods may take the form of information, software, graphics, music or any other digital content. Many traditional content providers have imported their content to the Internet. Although the revenue generation is less than what they achieve through their traditional channels of distribution, publishers and other entertainment providers have found the Internet offers a richer, more interactive environment to present their content. The Internet provides consumers the ability to search, evaluate, transact and personalize the content. The Internet will continue to be adopted as an effective distribution channel.","Site Subscription","A very simplistic form of soft goods fulfillment may be achieved by allowing the user access to the site. Functions to handle permissions and access would be required to prevent unauthorized users or actions.","A site subscription may be based on different metering technologies. Internet metering technologies can be divided into two categories: observational metering and usage metering. Observation metering measures site activity while usage metering measures the usage of items such as files, bytes or time.","Electronic Rights Management","Owners of digital content, including authors and publishers, have been searching for a method to protect against the unauthorized distribution of their works over the Internet. Most content available on the Internet today is freely distributed, often without consideration of the content owner's copyrights and appropriate royalties. Protecting Web content is a difficult task. Items such as copyrighted words, images and other \u2018digital\u2019 objects need to be protected from unauthorized (and endless) duplication. Currently, copyright notices can easily be stripped away. There are a few recent developments aimed at tracking rights violations.","Some rights management methods are geared toward identifying legal and illegal uses of a document or digital object. These concepts still require actively searching the Web for signs of abuse. In essence, the methods still allow the content to be extracted and used, basing the majority of the security on trust. Other approaches place a \u2018security wrapper\u2019 around the content so it can only be accessed by authorized users.\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0523","num":"1038"},"figref":"FIG. 29","b":["2900","2902","2904","2906","2908","2910"]},"The information capable of being searched may include product information and also a status of the order. Also, the customer may communicate with the customer service representative by way of a chat room.","As an option, the purchase history information may also be compiled and displayed. As another option, information including policy documentation may also be provided. As an additional option, an on-line bulletin board may be provided for allowing input from a plurality of customers.","This category includes any component of the solution meeting a user's need normally filled by a human customer service representative. These services fall across the marketing, merchandising, order processing, and other categories. The customer service aspect of eCommerce is as important as selling the actual products. Just as in the world of the paper bill, a lack of customer service, or poor customer service, can destroy any relationship the user has established with the electronic business.","The business drivers for customer service are:\n\n","Conducting commerce on the Internet means allowing direct access to the system and its data. New users may have a much lower tolerance for hard to understand interfaces and site layout and may require considerable help understanding what information exists on the site and how to find it. Customer service will continue to be a key component in maintaining customer relationships.","There are a variety of different services to enhance customer service. Which services should be implemented are dependent on the goals and characteristics of the site. Below are listed the key customer services, which are also found in FIG. .","Site Search ","Search engines have become a popular component of any information-intensive site. The ability to lead a user to the type of information he is looking for will not only make the interaction more efficient but enhance the customer relationships. \u201cSearch\u201d is a generic term and may be used for searching for a specific product or may be implemented to search for a specific customer's order or other information.","Order Tracking (Order Management) ","Providing customers the ability to track their orders can provide tremendous benefits in reduction of support personnel and building customer relationships. Applications of this nature can range from simple to complex depending on the level of detail. The order tracking system should be integrated within the order processing's innate workflow system. Purchase history functions may also be provided.","Return Merchandise\/Credit ","If the site sells goods, there is always the possibility of the customer returning the merchandise. As with most exception processing, this can create numerous problems, though the return should be allowed. Actually crediting a smartcard or replacing digital currency may be very difficult. The legalities and procedures should be thought out and documentation provided.","Help & Information  and Troubleshooting ","There is a tremendous amount of help and information features a site may provide. Listed below are some of the more common examples.\n\n","Behind security, one of the leading reasons a customer will not \u2018transact\u2019 online is the lack of human contact. Although unbelievable to most technologists, there is still an underlying fear of computers hidden in a large percentage of the potential consumer base. Currently, most seller-centric sites do not provide a truly two-way, interactive, or collaborative environment. The site may have a complex form of personalization which will filter and deliver content geared to the specific user, but in most cases will not provide real-time customer interaction.

The authentication information may also include a digital signature. In addition, the authentication information may further include a certification. Further, the certification may include a user identifier, a service identifier, a public key which is used to verify the digital signature, a name of an issuer of the certification, a period which the certification is valid, and an email address.","In the last few years, computer crimes have exploded\u2014hackers have defaced the web site of the CIA, stolen information and software from NASA and the Pentagon, and made unauthorized wire transfers causing banks to lose millions. According to WarRoom Research, financial losses from computer crime run at $10 billion a year. Historically, 80% of security problems have been internal ones\u2014either from employees exceeding their level of authorization or ones that are disgruntled. Netcentric computing and eCommerce are increasing the risks due to rapidly evolving technology infrastructures. As access to corporate systems is extended virtually and new security holes are discovered daily, security issues become complex.","eCommerce, while providing immense potential business advantages, may also expose businesses to significant risks. If their systems are broken into, they are at risk to financial loss, embarrassment, lost customers, and potential legal liability. Businesses often hesitate to take advantage of eCommerce because they fear security problems. Although security technologies are continually evolving to mitigate these eCommerce security risks, security breeches occur because businesses fail to implement an appropriate mixture of security solutions.","The problems associated with connecting the network to the vast Internet are widely published. Hackers abound, and new methods for compromising networks are published almost daily. However, what about connecting the network to a partner for project collaboration, or perhaps a supplier for automatic inventory control? One might trust their supplier, however, does one really know how well their network is secured? Contracts and Service Levels can and should deal with many of these issues, however, technology can also be used to enforce security policies.","Once the correct mixture of security solutions has been implemented, the company will experience many benefits besides peace of mind that their site is secure. Security also allows people to conduct business functions over the Internet which previously could only be done in person or with a more private connection. This allows expansion into new markets and new business capabilities, increases efficiency, and reduces the cost of doing business. For example, in the typical electronic storefront scenario, security is enabling an unknown buyer and seller to exchange goods with a reasonable assurance that the transaction will be honored on both ends. Security can also be a selling point for a company's eCommerce services. By demonstrating an increased level of trust and reduced exposure to fraud, a customer may choose one merchant's services over another's. Furthermore, eCommerce technologies rely on electronic automated security rather than imprecise procedural security. This can result in more reliable processing and fewer errors.","Unless customers and users feel the system is secure and there is little to no risk involved with using the system, the implementation will not be successful. Depending on the system, the amount of security in the different security areas will vary. By securing all aspects of the site, it will make it extremely difficult for an intruder to work their way into the system without being detected. There are a number of different approaches which can be employed to provide system security. Among the most common, are firewalling, encryption, and authentication. Each provides a particular type and degree of security, and in many instances it makes sense to use multiple technologies together to achieve the desired result. Security must be built into a system extremely carefully in order to be effective.","The details of security in eCommerce will be discussed in terms of five eCommerce cross-component application types. The five application types discussed are:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0545","num":"1076"},"figref":["FIGS. 33-42","FIGS. 33-34"],"b":["35","36","37","38","39","40","41","42"]},"Secure Communication ","Visa\u00ae and MasterCard\u00ae have jointly developed the Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) protocol to allow secure, cost-effective bank-card transactions over open networks. SET includes facilities for:\n\n","Consumers get their encryption keys using a specific program integrated into their browser. This program automatically converts a consumer's credit card number into a certificate given by Visa or MasterCard. This certificate contains a key and will be attached permanently to the browser of the consumer.","Then, for every transaction the consumer asks the merchant to send his certificate, and the merchant can ask the consumer's bank for authentication with the customer's certificate.","Full implementation of SET requires certificates be issued for each credit card a consumer wishes to use on the Internet. This raises enormous administrative challenges, as well as the problems involved in achieving this level of universal adoption.","Secure Environment ","There are different technical approaches for Internet security. The end goal of the security technologies is the same. It is important to pay attention to the approach and questions that they try to answer. For example Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Secure HTTP (SHTTP) have been viewed as competing technology. SSL uses the TCPI\/IP protocol to provide transaction security at the transport level. Security properties are linked to the channel of communication between the two parties. The issue they are addressing is channel privacy for a conversation or transaction. SHTTP provides transaction security at the document level. Each document is designated as private by the sender. This approach is addressing the question of authentication and authorization of web transactions.","Secure Data ","The first area to secure is data. It has to be ensured information is protected from unauthorized access. This is mostly important when sensitive data, such as credit card numbers or business figures, are transmitted. Data usually passes a long way before reaching its final destination and can easily be read by a third party. Data, therefore, has to be encrypted before transmission. Today several encryption techniques are used which ensure the data is unusable if intercepted.","In addition to encrypting the data, the parties involved in an electronic transaction need to know that the data received or sent is secure. Authentication techniques require the identities of the sender and receiver are known and the information sent arrives unaltered. Authentication can be accomplished with both the use of a message digest and a digital signature. Details on some of these techniques are discussed below.","Cryptography","Cryptography is an essential component in securing data. In the most basic sense, cryptography is encrypting and decrypting data using an algorithm(s) or key of some sort. Encrypted data is useless without the key to decrypt it. Today several encryption standards exist utilizing a wide variety of algorithms and keys. Details on some of the different methods can be found in the Security for Internet Electronic Commerce Security Technology Handbook.","Message Digest","A message digest is used to make sure no one has altered the message between transmission and reception. It is used to provide data-integrity. A digest is associated with a sent message. The recipient can re-compute the digest and compare the new one with the sent one. If they match, the message has not been tampered during transmission. The algorithm used to compute digest must be the same for the sender and the recipient. A message digest is a short, fixed-length digital code derived in a one-way fashion from a longer variable-length message. As a result, it is impossible to determine the original message on the basis of the digest or to find a different message with the same digest.","Digital Signature","Digital signatures ensure the message recipient only the sender of the message could have sent it. The sender signs a message by encrypting a digest of the message with their private key. No one but the particular sender could have generated the digest corresponding to the message. This provides authentication of the sender as well as non-repudiation of the origin. Encrypting a message digest also links the signature with the message content. The sender can't claim they did not send the message or the message is not the one they sent.","Certification","Some security techniques may require the use of a public key for encrypting data. When using a public keys, issues may arise with key management and verification. Often a trusted third party will be needed to issue a Certification Authority (CA) for keys and signatures. Certification Authority declares which public key and signatures belongs to which users and services. Because a user needs the CA public key to check validity of certificates, CA must provide a way to safely deliver its own public key.","A certificate typically contains:\n\n","The client environment should also be secured. Since systems may be open to public use, and accessible to a large audience, it could be subject to new types of attacks. An environment must have security mechanisms in place to control who can access it as well as controls on the actions these users may perform. This may be achieved using authorization models. Authorization models are used to determine which entities (for example, people or applications) can access specific applications, data, or resources.","With the onset on Netcentric computing, entire applications or other forms of executable content may be downloaded across a network. This style of computing introduces a variety of security concerns. Downloads may come in the form of applications, applets, ActiveX controls, scripts and a variety of other software. It is important to understand the different security concerns with the downloads.","Java Applets","Java is designed for developing programs to run on many different kinds of computers connected together in a network. A Java Applet is a special kind of Java program attached to a Web page. Applets are embedded into a Web page's HTML definition and interpreted by Java-enabled browser. It is possible to have users download the applet from the Web and run the program locally.","Running some unknown person's untrusted code is also inherently dangerous. For this reason, Java restricts the behavior of Applets to a set of safe actions (Safe applets are labeled as trusted applets). The Java security model restricts an Applet as follows:\n\n","Because of its built-in security model, Java addresses these risks head-on. Unfortunately, there are still holes in Java's security model which allow some risks. For example, applets could be created to perform various harmful acts:\n\n","ActiveX is a technology developed by the Microsoft Corporation for distributing software over the Internet. Like Java Applets, an ActiveX \u201ccontrol\u201d can be embedded in a Web page, where it typically appears as a smart interactive graphic. Unlike Java, which is a platform-independent programming language, ActiveX controls are distributed as executable binaries, and must be separately compiled for each target machine and operating system.","The ActiveX security model is considerably different from Java Applets. ActiveX places no restrictions on what a control can do. Instead, each ActiveX control can be digitally \u201csigned\u201d by its author in such a way that the signature cannot be altered or repudiated. The digital signatures can then be certified by a trusted \u201ccertifying authority\u201d, such as VeriSign, to create the equivalent of a shrink-wrapped software package. If downloading a signed ActiveX control causes a machine to crash, the responsible party will be identifiable.","This security model places the responsibility for the computer system's security on the user. Before the browser downloads an ActiveX control that has not been signed at all, or has been signed but certified by an unknown certifying authority, the browser presents a dialog box warning the user this action may not be safe. The user can abort the transfer, or may continue the transfer and take his chances.","Scripting Languages","Internet scripting languages are programming languages embedded in HTML pages and are interpreted by the user's browser (for example, Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Explorer). Typically, they are dedicated to control the user's interaction with an HTML document, for example when:\n\n","As scripts are pieces of code from a foreign source executed on the user system, they raise security issues. Indeed, a user must be sure a downloaded script will not perform malicious actions against his system. Scripting languages designers have to manage the balance between security achieved through restriction, and language capabilities.","Secure Server Environment ","Securing the server environment will depend upon the technology and architecture of the implementation. Techniques and security models exist for the different methods of server-side computing. Included below is basic security information for some of the different technologies.","Internet Firewall","A firewall is used to protect a trusted network from an untrusted network. Typically, the two networks in question are an organization's internal network (trusted) and the Internet (untrusted). A firewall is a system or group of systems that enforces an access control policy between two networks. A firewall is a collection of components or a system placed between two networks and possesses the following properties:\n\n","Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts are a way of processing information submitted to the web server using a form. A CGI script can be written in any language able to use standard IN and OUT streams (usually Perl or C shell). To process a form, the client first submits the information content to the server. On the server, a CGI script reads the form contents, then uses it to write a new HTML page, which is sent back from the server to the client. Security problems with CGI scripts occur on both the client and the server sides.","CGI Client Side","Submitting a form to a CGI script, which is located on a server, implies the sending of the contents of this form over the Network. If the channel used is not safe, form content can easily be read and perverted. Any way of securing the channel, such as SSL, PCT, or S-HTTP, can be used to achieve confidentiality of submitted information. As these protocols must be implemented by both client and server, a user must check the server is able to secure the channel. Current popular browsers are able to warn the user if information is being submitted in an unsafe fashion.","CGI Server Side","Processing a form on the server, using server resources, such as system commands, can lead to security holes. Indeed, forms can be full of malicious content causing the server to perform confidential information delivery, server crashes, or unauthorized accesses.","The only way to protect a server from attacks through CGI script is to be very careful when writing, testing, and using CGI scripts. As far as possible, CGI scripts should avoid executing system commands. Each submitting entry should be checked and analyzed before being processed. Script sources must be hidden as analyzing the source of a script is the best way to find an efficient attack through it. On multiple user systems, the right to install CGI scripts should only be granted to the administrator or trustworthy users.","Common Object Request Broker (CORBA)","The Common Object Request Broker architecture is an open distributed object computing infrastructure standardized by the Object Management Group. CORBA specifies the interfaces, structures and policies used by distributed objects (components) to communicate independently of the language, operating systems, machine, or network.","The CORBA 2.0 specification presents a good set of security policies which provide authentication, data integrity, confidentiality and non-repudiation. The standard leaves to the applications the problem of handling the non-repudiation policies without conforming to the ISO specifications. The standard does not thoroughly solve the problem of interoperability between different security domains.","Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM)","The Microsoft Component Object Model (COM) provides a model based on Object Technology, to manage inter-process communication on a local computer. Microsoft's Distributed Component Object Model is an extension of COM, supporting the distribution of collaborative processes over a network.","Security issues in DCOM concern:\n\n","The Remote Method Invocation allows a programmer to create distributed Java-to-Java applications. This allows remote Java objects to be invoked from other Java virtual machines, even those on different hosts. A Java program can call a remote object only when it has obtained a reference to that remote object. This can be done by:\n\n","A client can call a remote object on a server, and that server can also act as a client when calling other remote objects. As RMI both implies execution of foreign code and communication over a network, deploying RMI requires a secured environment and secured communication.","The RMI specification does not define any security features for distributed transactions. In order to secure the transfer of information between hosts located in different address spaces, some security features need to be added to the specification.","Advertise Products Online","In the sample architecture shown in , a potential customer  will access a corporate web site for some sales information.
