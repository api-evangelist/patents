The VP invokes a Rule-Module from the RMN to access and process financial transactions via the UAR. During a financial transaction, the VP may be stored directly on or within a NAT, or the VP may be temporarily and removeably conjoined with a NAT. In an illustrative embodiment, the VP is online and stored apart from the NAT (\u201cOnline-VP\u201d), wherein the UUC is transmitted from the NAT to the Online-VP via communications means (or interconnecting communications means) external to the NAT. In an illustrative embodiment, the VP may also comprise any one of the following: being wholly integrated with a Rule-Module Nexus; being conjoined and co-located with a Rule-Module Nexus; being conjoined but not co-located with a Rule-Module Nexus. While a VP may be stored apart from, or external to, the NAT, the VP may be stored within a UIA or UIA\u2014Terminal temporarily and removeably conjoined with a NAT. The VP is, in an illustrative embodiment, not stored directly or permanently on a NAT. The VP, being online, requires communications means (or interconnecting communications means) external to the NAT for receiving the UUC from the NAT. Receives incoming bid verification data, compares said bid verification data to registered verification data, making a matching determination and, if successful, in an illustrative embodiment, outputs or invokes a VAC enabling access to a UAR.","It should be noted that as used herein, the article \u201ca\u201d, or \u201can\u201d, means \u201cone or more\u201d of anything to which it refers, such as a platform, component, feature, element, process, step, method, system or the like of the invention.

The computing units may be connected with each other via a data communication network. The network is a public network and assumed to be insecure and open to eavesdroppers. In illustrative embodiment, the network is embodied as the Internet. In this context, the computers may or may not be connected to the Internet at all times. For instance, the computer may employ a modem to occasionally connect to the Internet, whereas the rule-module nexus might maintain a permanent connection to the Internet. It is noted that the network may be implemented as other types of networks, such as an interactive television (ITV) network.","The merchant computer and the transaction Account Issuer or provider computing systems may be interconnected via a second network, referred to as a payment network. The payment network represents existing proprietary networks that presently accommodate transactions (or \u201cXact's\u201d) for credit, debit, loyalty\/rewards, and other types of financial\/banking transactions. The payment network is a closed network that is assumed to be secure from eavesdroppers. Examples of the payment network include the American Express\u2122, VisaNet\u2122 and the Verifone\u2122 network.","The User may interact via the rule-module nexus with a transaction system or a merchant using any transaction terminal such as a telephone, magnetic stripe card reader, radio frequency interrogator, keyboard, mouse, kiosk, personal digital assistant, touch screen, voice recognition device, transponder, handheld computer (e.g., Palm Pilot\u2122), cellular phone, web TV, web phone, blue tooth\/beaming device and\/or the like.

Accordingly, the present invention may take the form of an entirely software embodiment, an entirely hardware embodiment, or an embodiment combining aspects of both software and hardware. Furthermore, the present invention may take the form of a computer program product on a computer-readable storage medium having computer-readable program code means embodied in the storage medium. Any suitable computer-readable storage medium may be utilized, including hard disks, CD-ROM, optical storage devices, magnetic storage devices, flash card memory and\/or the like.","The transaction Account Issuer (Authorized Issuer) (or Account Provider) platform  includes any provider of products and\/or services that facilitates any type of transaction. As contemplated by an illustrative embodiment of the present invention, the Account Issuer platform  establishes and maintains account and\/or transaction information for the User. The Account Issuer platform  may issue products to the User and may also provide both the User and the Merchant platform  with the processes to facilitate the transaction system of the present invention. The Account Issuer platform  includes banks, credit unions, credit, debit or other transaction-related companies, telephone companies, or any other type of card or account issuing entities, such as card-sponsoring companies, incentive rewards companies, or third-party providers under contract with financial entities. Unless otherwise specifically set forth herein, although referred to as \u201cAccount Issuer,\u201d this term should be understood to mean any entity issuing any type of account to facilitate any transaction, exchange or service, and should not be limited to companies possessing or issuing physical cards. In an illustrative system, the Account Issuer platform  may be any transaction facilitating company such as a credit account providers like American Express\u2122, VISA\u2122, Mastercard\u2122, Discover\u2122, and the like. In another embodiment, the Account Issuer platform  could be any membership organization or union. In some instances, the Account Issuer platform  and the Merchant platform  may be the same, for example, where the credit account is issued by the same entity that provides the product or service. A phone card using a credit account issued by a telephone company, where the credit account is associated to the User's home telephone account is one such occasion.","Although the present system for facilitating transactions may exist within one transaction Account Issuer system, illustrative embodiments contemplate use with other third-party authorization and settlement systems and networks.","The authorization and settlement processes may occur as separate steps or as a single step. In one embodiment, referred to herein as an electronic data capture (EDC) system, the Merchant platform  sends an authorization request to an Account Issuer platform  and if the authorization request is approved, a receipt of charges is created and submitted for the Merchant platform . Separate sequences of file transmissions or messages are therefore not required. Various embodiments, hybrids, and modifications of these processes should be apparent to one skilled in this art.","It will be appreciated that the invention illustratively disclosed herein suitably may be practiced in the absence of any element which is not specifically disclosed herein, particularly in an illustrative embodiment.","The invention is a financial transaction system which uniquely enables a User to, in an illustrative embodiment, present a single \u201cthin-client\u201d token and benefit from centralized Financial Account access, Financial Account aggregation and Financial Account presentation by means of a secure, remotely located Rule-Module Nexus .","A financial transaction is any electronic transfer or exchange of Financial Data having a predetermined monetary or monetary-equivalent unit value which is legal tender or a legal tender-equivalent, and which is honored by an Account Issuer, such that a User's purchase, expenditure or usage of these units results in the User's purchase or sale of goods, services or currency involving an Account Issuer. Financial data can also include units of currency, minutes of telephone calling time, miles towards earning a free airplane flight, points towards a gallon of gas, and the like.","A \u201cFinancial Account number\u201d or \u201ctransaction number\u201d as used herein, may include Financial Account-ID, comprising any identifier for a Financial Account  (e.g., credit, charge debit, checking, savings, reward, loyalty, travel or the like) which may be maintained by a transaction Account Issuer (e.g., payment authorization center) and which may be used to complete a financial transaction. A typical account number (e.g., account data) may be correlated to a credit or debit account, loyalty account, travel or rewards account maintained and serviced by such entities as American Express, Visa and\/or MasterCard, such as reward points as currency wherein a User can use reward or scrip points (e.g., Star Alliance\u2122, eScrip\u2122) as currency to pay for purchases). For ease in understanding, the present invention may be described with respect to a credit card account. However, it should be noted that the invention may not be so limited and other accounts permitting an exchange of goods and services for an account data value may be contemplated to be within the scope of the present invention.","In an illustrative embodiment, RMN may refer to Master and\/or Subset platforms, e.g., RMN  and Subset RMN , unless otherwise specified. Similarly, a Payee may refer to an Account Issuer, unless otherwise specified.","An Account Issuer as defined herein is the named entity with primary fiduciary duty for administering a Financial Account  of a User, said fiduciary duty comprising any one of the following: managing the Financial Data within the Financial Account , and; reconciling the Financial Data within the Financial Account  upon settlement of a financial transaction. An Account Issuer comprises any of the following: a bank, a merchant, a scrips provider, credit account organization, a government agency, an insurance company, a brokerage firm, a reward incentives provider, a services barter provider, a product barter provider, an internet payment provider, and the rule-module nexus of this invention. A Financial Account , storing related Financial Data, resides with an Account Issuer if said Account Issuer has the primary responsibility to store, administer and reconcile the Financial Data within the User's Financial Account .","The Account Issuer may be within the RMN  or may be within a RMN-authorized Third-Party Platform .","In an illustrative embodiment, once the User makes an account selection from a plurality of proprietary accounts presented, the RMN  does not universally \u201cstand-in\u201d for Account Issuers, nor automatically invoke a default program or Global Execution Command (GEC) , to cause financial transactions of all RMN  Users to bypass, supersede, divert or switch an already-existing interchange fee, discount rate, or other settlement process which would otherwise apply to a Financial Account  selected by the User, or which would otherwise apply to the selected Financial Account's  associated Account Issuer (Authorized Issuer). Alternatively put, the RMN  is, in an illustrative embodiment, designed wherever possible to compliment, not contravene, the already-existing interchange fee, discount rate, or settlement process of the User's selected Financial Account  and its associated Account Issuer(s). In an illustrative embodiment, the RMN  maintains, wherever possible, a Financial Account's  already-associated transaction processors (issuing banks, credit associations, national automated clearinghouse association (\u201cNACHA\u00ae\u201d), merchant banks), their respective proprietary networks (VisaNet\u00ae, Pulse\u00ae, Nova\u00ae, Interlink\u00ae and the like), and their respective processing fees (interchange fees, discount rates), protocols, and procedures. Similarly, in an illustrative embodiment, the RMN  does not act to \u201cstand-in\u201d or \u201cmirror\u201d the transaction processing of an Account Issuer (Authorized Issuer) which has a pre-existing association with a Financial Account selected by a User.","In an illustrative embodiment, it is an objective of the present invention to compliment, not contravene, the already-existing interchange fee, discount rate, or settlement process of the User's selected Financial Account  and its associated Account Issuer(s). Alternatively put, the invention herein is, in an illustrative embodiment, designed not to universally \u201cstand-in\u201d for an existing Account Issuer, nor to cause all financial transactions of the invention herein to bypass, divert or switch an already-existing interchange fee, discount rate, or settlement process which would otherwise be applied by the Account Issuer(s) of the User's selected Financial Account  and its associated transaction processing.","It is will be appreciated that an illustrative embodiment of this invention maximizes security of the Rule-Module Nexus (RMN)  transactions and minimize the size and cost of the nexus access token, by employing a \u201cthin-client\u201d, passive RFID-based Nexus Access Token (NAT) . As used herein, \u201cthin-client\u201d, in an illustrative embodiment, means that to complete a financial transaction using the RMN , the NAT  transmits a \u201cthin-client\u201d packet which is not required to be transaction-enabled by containing any \u201clive\u201d financial account data or \u201cfunding\u201d account data which can directly identify or directly access a specific online Financial Account  of a user. Thus, during processing of a financial transaction, the NAT  does not require use of any stored data on a User's Nexus Access Token  which may directly identify or directly access an online Financial Account  of the User.","Further, the NAT  is designed, in an illustrative embodiment, to be of a sufficiently convenient size and weight as to be hand-holdable (e.g., hand-held) or smaller: small, light-weight and readily mobile for daily use, or having physical dimensions sufficiently small to be hand-held or at most, palm-sized. In an illustrative embodiment, the NAT  is compact enough also to be used and\/or operated while being held in the hand or hands.","Further, as a passive RFID-based token, the \u201cthin-client\u201d NAT, in an illustrative embodiment, does not require a battery power supply, nor does it require an integrated circuit chip. In one embodiment, a purely passive or \u201creflective\u201d NAT  may rely upon the electromagnetic energy radiated by a UIA  reader to power the RF integrated circuit that makes up the RFID tag within the NAT . As such, in this embodiment, the NAT  may be said to be \u201cbeam powered\u201d. This \u201cthin-client\u201d NAT may be low-cost, high-security, and miniaturized for conjoining with other conveniently portable tokens, such as a wearable finger ring or a house key. For high security, it is preferred that stored data on a User's NAT  comprises a User's Unique User Code (UUC) , which may also comprise a RMN-Routing Code (RMN-RC) . In one embodiment, the NAT  does not store the User's User Account Registry Code (UAR-Code) . The UAR-Code  identifies a User Account Registry  of the RMN  which comprises the Financial Accounts  of a User, even though, in an illustrative embodiment, said UAR-Code  does not itself directly identify any specific Financial Account  of the User, nor, in an illustrative embodiment, does the UAR-Code  depend upon the designation of any Financial Account  of the User as a primary account. In this embodiment, in an illustrative embodiment, no stored data on the NAT  can be read or copied off-line which could provide direct access to a specific Financial Account  of the User. As such, if a User's NAT  is stolen, lost or copied, the NAT  and its stored data would not provide an unauthorized User with direct access to a Financial Account  of an authorized User of the RMN .

The first five to seven digits are reserved for processing purposes and identify the issuing bank, card type, etc. In this example, the last (sixteenth) digit is used as a sum check for the sixteen-digit account number. The intermediary eight-to-ten digits are used to uniquely identify the consumer and the account. A merchant account number may be, for example, any number or alpha-numeric characters that identifies a particular merchant for purposes of card acceptance, account reconciliation, reporting, or the like.

The RMNs  then connect to the bank host as well as performing any protocol conversions, message concentration, and message translation. Alternatively, UIAs \u2014Terminals  communicate with a remote RMN  over a leased line, dial, or wireless IP Network , thus eliminating the need for the legacy non-IP Network .","The UIA \u2014Terminal  and RMNs  communicate with each other via QTP over UDP\/IP. This stack may be over any network interface (e.g. router based LAN, dial, wireless, etc.).","The QTP link connecting a UIA \u2014Terminal  and a RMN  consists of two primary types of QTP channels. The first QTP channel established is a supervisory QTP channel over which all management and control information between the UIA \u2014Terminal  and the RMN  flows. Other QTP channels are established for transaction data flow (i.e. data QTP channels) and for the download of new configurations and UIA -Terminal  software (i.e. the download QTP channel).","The supervisory QTP channel should exist for there to be any data communication between a UIA \u2014Terminal  and the RMN . Messages over the supervisory channel may be of the following basic types:\n\n","Data QTP channels are used for the transfer of transaction data. Each data QTP channel represents a single virtual circuit as seen by the UIA \u2014Terminal  (e.g. a poll code or station address in the case of multi-drop operation, a line in the case of a single channel point-to-point protocol, a virtual circuit in the case of X.25, etc.).","The download QTP channel is used for transferring new software downloads or configurations to the UIA \u2014Terminal . It exists only when a download is in progress. A maximum of one download channel and one download can be active at any time. Downloads are done using the TFTP protocol as per RFC 1350 over the download QTP channel.","Note that downloads may be treated like any other transaction data communications between the UIA \u2014Terminal  and the RMN . New software may be downloaded to a UIA \u2014Terminal  from a RMN , whereby downloaded file consists of a compressed software image for writing directly into the UIA \u2014Terminal 's flash memory. Each download consists of a complete software image, since it is not preferable to do partial updates of the software running on the UIA \u2014Terminal .","A supervisory QTP channel, optionally comprised within the RMN , is used for control of the UIA \u2014Terminal  and for transfer of informational, statistical, status, and alert information to the RMN . The RMN  may requests the UIA-VC , enabling the RMN  to verify the authenticity of the UIA \u2014Terminal . As such, software updates and downloads from the RMN  will not be sent to unauthorized, or trojan-horse, UIAs \u2014Terminals .","Registration","Parties that wish to either originate or receive financial transactions should, in an illustrative embodiment, first register with the Rule-Module Nexus , and its associated Verification Platform  and User Account Registry .

Registration may occur at a merchant's point-of-sale, over the Internet, or through a registration Transaction Terminal . Data-entry of registration verification data and Financial Account , along with associated data, can occur via: a keypad ; voice commands spoken into an audio receiver or microphone; swiping the magnetic stripe card; scanning a bar-code; reading a paper check with a magnetic ink character reader, and the like. The User's registration processes links any such data to the User's UUC  (and optionally PVC ) verification data, including the User's Rule-Modules , within the RMN . The User is assigned and issued a NAT , stored with the UUC  for that User.","Further data which registered to the User may include: a driver's license number, a passport number, a debit account, a credit account, a checking account, a money-market account, a stored-value account comprising pre-paid financial, and the like. Optionally, a stored value account with a participating Account Issuer may be pre-credited with funds, or financial, from the Account Issuer and for the use of which the User has pre-paid a premium to the Account Issuer.","For verification data, the User registers by being assigned a UUC  which is stored into a NAT  issued to the User. Optionally, the User may also submit, or be assigned, a registration PVC . The UIA  optionally confirms that the PVC  code is accurate, and in a preferable embodiment, scans the User's NAT  to determine that it and its stored UUC  are non-fraudulent. The UIA  then translates and compresses this UUC  (or optionally a UUC \u2014PVC ) encrypted packet into a format suitable for rapid electronic transmittal to the RMN .

Alternatively, the User may input the rewards account number manually via a UIA Keypad , which may be conjoined with either a cell phone NAT , or the User's personal computer.","In another embodiment of the invention, registration comprises a message being provided to a potential User of the RMN , said message may include, but not be limited to, any of the following: an electronic transmission (e.g., an email, an SMS text, an online advertisement, etc.); a printed mailer; an automated outbound voice message via telephone. Such a message may comprise: a response address for contacting the RMN  (physical mailing address; email address; phone number; etc.); a one-time, temporary Personal Verification Code , preferably unique to the message, wherein no other message has the same PVC ); optionally an offer number or code. The potential User may then respond to the RMN  via any UIA  (personal computer, cell phone or land line), for example, wherein the potential User may be identified via any of the following: ANI (automatic number identification); the one-time, temporary PVC , and\/or; the offer code or number. The potential User may then be identified by the RMN  based on an reverse-lookup of the potential User's phone number provided via ANI, wherein the RMN  can perform an automatic match of the potential User's name, address, and phone number, to determine the identity of the potential User, and automatically research public databases to pull data about the potential User for identity confirmation. The RMN  may then present options to the User via an automated IVR (interactive voice response) system, prompting the potential User for responses via voice and\/or dual-tone multi-frequency signaling keypad inputs. The RMN  may offer the potential User the option to accept an offer to register with the RMN . For example, upon acceptance of the offer, the IVR system may prompt the potential User for responses to security questions for confirming the identity of the potential User, based on the database research (\u201cWhat is your home address?\u201d; \u201cWhat was your previous home address?\u201d; \u201cWhen was your home purchased?\u201d; \u201cHow much did you purchase your home for?\u201d; \u201cWhat is your email address?\u201d; etc.), or the RMN  could ask the User to input their social security number, and then prompt the potential User for responses to security questions (e.g., \u201cHow much is your monthly mortgage?\u201d; \u201cHow much is your monthly car payment?\u201d; etc.). In these instances, the RMN  offers a plurality of answers to each questions, each with a corresponding number for selection (e.g., \u201cWhen your home purchased? For the year 1991, press or say \u201c1\u201d; For the year 1993, press or say \u201c2\u201d, etc.), wherein the potential User must input the correctly numbered answer to confirm their identity to the RMN . Once the potential User's has correctly answered the questions, and their identity is thereby confirmed by the RMN , the RMN  may prompt the potential User to consent to an automatic poll of their credit report, wherein a UAR  may be established and registered by the RMN  for the potential User and pre-populated with any or all of the potential User's active Financial Accounts , based on the open Financial Account(s)  on the potential User's credit report(s). The User, now registered, may be prompted to select, for example: consenting to using default Rule-Module(s)  provided by the RMN  and\/or a Third-Party Platform  (such as a merchant, an Account Issuer, etc.); consenting to having a NAT  mailed to them; consenting to keeping their previously assigned temporary PVC , or selecting a new PVC  of their own choosing; designating a Primary PVC  or selecting a Secondary PVC ;","The UIA  transmits the registration data to the RMN . In an illustrative embodiment, the Master RMN  then inserts the UUC  (and optionally a UUC \u2014PVC ) packet into the appropriate Verification Platform  and generates an User Verification Approval Code  that is unique to the User and is subsequently output by the Verification Platform  when issuing a positive matching determination from electronically comparing a User's bid UUC  (or optionally a UUC \u2014PVC ) with registered UUCs  (or optionally with registered UUCs \u2014PVCs ). From this point on, any time the User is verified by the Verification Platform  via submitted a UUC  (or optionally a UUC \u2014PVC ) packet, the User Verification Approval Code  is forwarded to the Master Rule-Module Nexus  where it invokes at least one Rule-Module  for that User.

This table must be secure, and the keys stored therein must be kept up to date. These processes and others relating to the actual process for validating digital certificates are well understood in the industry.","UIA Hardware Verification (or Identification) Subsystem (UHV or UHI)","In an illustrative embodiment of the Verification Platform , UIA-VC's  are translated into entity verification by the UHI subsystem. This subsystem maintains a list of all User Interface Apparatus  manufactured. In an illustrative embodiment, when a particular User uses a UIA , that User's geographic location is identified by their use of that particular UIA  during that electronic financial transaction session.","In another embodiment, the UIA-VC  does not serve to verify either the User or an entity. This is the case in User Interface Apparatus  installed in public venues such as airport Transaction Terminals , Automated Teller Machines in banks, or computers with User Interface Apparatus  for home use.","User Verification Approval Code","A User Verification Approval Code (VAC)  is an electronic message output by the Verification Platform  upon a positive matching determination of the User. In illustrative embodiments, the VAC  comprises any one of the following: a static code identifying the user account registry; a dynamic code comprising a unique code, such as a unique digital signature per transaction a for storage and retrieval of data relating to processing of the financial transaction, and; a static code and a dynamic code. The VAC  informs the Master Rule-Module Nexus  that a User has been successfully identified, and instructs the Master Rule-Module Nexus  to invoke the Rule-Modules  for that particular User. In an illustrative embodiment, any time the User is verified by the Verification Platform  via submitted a UUC  (or optionally a UUC \u2014PVC ) packet, the User Verification Approval Code  is forwarded to the Master Rule-Module Nexus  where it identifies a UAR-Code , invoking access to a User Account Registry  and invoking at least one Rule-Module  for that User. In the Master Rule-Module Nexus  platform, a Rule-Module  is created that is identified by the User Verification Approval Code . In an illustrative embodiment, the Verification Approval Code  is identical to the UAR-Code , but does not: identify a specific Financial Account , identify a specific Financial Account Number .","Rule-Module Nexus","Rule-Module Nexus (RMN)  serves to verify the Account Issuer and the User in a transaction, retrieve for verified parties a plurality of proprietary Financial Accounts , and optionally Account Transaction Data (or Transaction Data or Ancillary Transaction Data) , and perform the execution that will result in facilitating completing financial transactions, including settlement of transactions. The Rule-Module Nexus  is comprised of an electronic Verification Platform , a Master Rule-Module Nexus , an internal Execution Platform , a Firewall , a Decryption Platform , a Gateway Platform , and a Logging Platform .","As seen in , the Master RMN  is connected to a network, like the Internet  or intranet , using a Firewall Machine (FW or FM)  that filters out all messages that are not from legitimate UIA  devices.","In an illustrative embodiment, the messages are decrypted. For this, the transaction processor uses the Decryption Platform (DP) , which utilizes the UIA-VC  of the UIA  to verify the encryption codes that is required to decrypt the message from the UIA .","Once decrypted, the verification of parties to the transaction is determined using the electronic Verification Platform .","Optionally, the RMN  may be conjoined, co-located and\/or integrated with the VP  and\/or the UAR , in any combination thereof. Elements of the RMN  and\/or the VP  may be conjoined, co-located and\/or integrated with a NAT , a UIA , and\/or a Terminal .","In an illustrative embodiment, once the User is identified by the Verification Platform , the User Verification Approval Code  is forwarded to the Master Rule-Module Nexus . The Master Rule-Module Nexus  instructs the Execution Platform  to take the necessary steps for executing the Execution Commands  that are associated with the Pattern Data  of the User registered with the Master Rule-Module Nexus .","Upon the VP  having made a positive matching determination regarding a User's authorization to accessing the RMN , the User may view and edit Rule-Modules .","Rule-Modules","The Master Rule-Module Nexus  is comprised of at least one Rule-Module  which comprises Pattern Data or an Execution Command which is \u201cdistinct\u201d or \u201cunique\u201d to one registered User (hence, \u201cUser-Unique\u201d). In an illustrative embodiment, at least one Rule-Module  is unique and exclusive to an individual User. In the event that a Rule-Module comprises pattern data and an execution command that is indexed to one or more registered Users, said Rule-Module is deemed \u201ccustomized\u201d to a User but not unique to that User (hence, \u201cUser-Customized\u201d). As defined herein, User-customized does not necessarily mean that any Pattern Data  or the Execution Command  is unique to a User, but rather that they are indexed to or are assigned to a specific User. As such, the same Pattern Data  or Execution Command  may be assigned to several specific Users, and hence would not be unique to any one User.","The Master Rule-Module Nexus  functions as a central storage facility for registering, indexing, updating, and invoking various Rule-Modules , whereby the Rule-Modules  govern the deposit, the display, the deducting, and the dispensing of financial. In an illustrative embodiment, each of these Rule-Modules  is composed of at least two Pattern Data  which is associated with or electronically linked to at least one Execution Command. In an illustrative embodiment, said Pattern Data  minimally comprise any one of the following: a UUC  and a plurality of proprietary Financial Accounts . Optionally, said Pattern Data may also comprise a PVC .","The Master Rule-Module Nexus  optionally stores User-customized Pattern Data  that is unassociated with any User-customized Execution Commands  and optionally stores User-customized Execution Commands  that are not associated with any User-customized Pattern Data . Therefore, such unassociated Pattern Data  or Execution Commands  are optionally stored within the Master Rule-Module Nexus  until they are associated with a Pattern Data  or an Execution Command  together thereby forming an executable Rule-Module .","Once the Verification Platform  outputs a positive matching determination for a User, the User Verification Approval Code  is forwarded to the Master Rule-Module Nexus . The Master Rule-Module Nexus  takes the User Verification Approval Code , optionally along with the UIA-VC , the UIA  location data and the Financial Transaction Request Message (or Transaction Request or Transaction Request Message) , and searches among the User's customized Rule-Modules  to invoke Pattern Data  and associated Execution Commands  relevant to the financial transaction being undertaken.","Pattern Data (PD)","As previously noted, Pattern Data  may be provided by the User, by the Master Rule-Module Nexus , or by an authorized financial entity , while the User provides at least one associated Execution Command , to form a single Rule-Module .","Pattern Data  of a User is stored electronic data, which is customized to at least one User. For example, Pattern Data  may include any stored User-customized and User-unique electronic data, comprising any one of the following: a primary Personal Verification Code (PVC) , which is optionally alpha-numeric; demographic information; an email address; a plurality of proprietary Financial Accounts ; a stored-value account comprising pre-paid or pre-earned financial; the User's date of birth; a secondary PVC ; a telephone number; Account Transaction Data ; a mailing address; purchasing patterns; a UUC . The UUC  is unique to each User and is not shared between Users.","Any such Pattern Data  may be provided to the Master Rule-Module Nexus  by: a User; a Master Rule-Module Nexus ; or an authorized third-party  such as an Account Issuer.","Account Transaction Data  associated with a Financial Account  is any information pertaining to a User Account or an Account Issuer Account (respectively, User Account Data and Account Issuer Account Data). Such data includes any of the following: a number which uniquely locates or routes a transaction to a Financial Account ; a number which uniquely identifies the Financial Account ; User usage location; User usage frequency; User usage recency; User usage demographics, and; User usage volume of electronic financial transactions; a financial transaction processing preference of the Account Issuer associated with the Financial Account .","In an illustrative embodiment, within the Rule-Module Nexus , a User Account Registry (UAR) , which is identified by a User Account Registry Code (UAR-Code) , contains a plurality of proprietary Financial Accounts  of a User, including associated Account Transaction Data (or Transaction Data) , and associated Rule-Modules . For example, in the event that the Financial Account  is a incentives account for rewards or scrip (e.g., a rewards incentives account), the value for each unit of Financial Data could be a dollar amount, a number of minutes of telephone calling time, points towards the purchase of a product or service, a percentage discount on current or future purchases, and the like. For rewards transactions, the Account Issuer then designates the number of financial to be disbursed to Users based upon the occurrence of predetermined criteria. This criteria may include a credit or debit of financial in the User's Financial Account  based on the User's purchasing patterns as a function of any of the following: time; demographics; frequency; recency, and; amount of expenditure.","In another embodiment, within a User Account Registry , the Master Rule-Module Nexus  stores and manages Financial Accounts  for participating Account Issuers, Users, and counter-party entities. Further, The Master Rule-Module Nexus  may comprise Execution Commands  to display the Financial Account  status, calculations, and adjustments, and the like for participating Account Issuers, counter-party entities, and Users.","Execution Commands (ECs)","An Execution Command  may be invoked by Pattern Data  with which it is associated. Execution Commands  stored within the Rule-Module Nexus  and executed by the Execution Platform , may transmit electronic messages necessary for depositing, displaying, deducting, and\/or disbursing Financial Data associated with Financial Accounts  of a User and, optionally, an Account Issuer. For example, the Execution Commands  may also include instructions or commands pertaining to the preserving the preferences of an Account Issuer for processing and\/or completing of a financial transaction, comprising any one of the following: invoking criteria predetermined by the Account Issuer for declining the financial transaction; invoking criteria predetermined by the Account Issuer for approving the financial transaction; invoking criteria predetermined by the Account Issuer for settlement of the financial transaction; invoking a proprietary network; invoking a discount rate; invoking an interchange fee; invoking a settlement protocol; invoking a surcharge; invoking a processing partner, and; invoking a time period for settlement. A processing partner is a Third-Party Platform , in an illustrative embodiment, registered with the RMN , comprising any one of the following: an Account Issuer (e.g., Wells Fargo Bank\u2122); a merchant private label (e.g., Nordstrom's\u2122); an aquirer (e.g., First Third Bank\u2122); a credit association (Visa\u2122); an intermediary (e.g., First Data Corporation\u2122, GE Capital\u2122); a debit processor (e.g., Interlink\u2122), and; a credit company (e.g., American Express\u2122).","Another illustrative embodiment of the invention includes a Financial Account  being used under predetermined circumstances comprising any one of the following: the number of units of Financial Data to be debited from a Financial Account  under which circumstances and the number of units of financial to be credited to an Account Issuer Account under which circumstances. Such Execution Commands  may include: a pre-calculated formula for surcharging a User's Financial Account  during a financial transaction, such that said surcharge is automatically disbursed to a financial counter-party (e.g., a non-profit charity or a checking account of a subordinated User) or deposited into another Financial Account  of the User (e.g., a savings account or brokerage account); a pre-designation that Financial Accounts  are to be displayed to the User such that the User can select which Financial Account  to invoke for the financial transaction; a pre-designation that Audible or Visible Signatures  are presented to the User on a UIA Display  or Transaction Terminal Display  such that the User may select which entity will be the counter-party of the financial transaction disbursement; a pre-designation that purchases from certain participating Account Issuers will automatically invoke a financial disbursal to at least one certain financial counter-party; a pre-designation that upon accumulation of certain types of financial, such as frequent-flyer miles or free phone minutes, such types of financial will be automatically disbursed to a predetermined financial counter-party; a pre-designation that upon accumulation of certain amounts of financial, there will be a disbursal to at least one predetermined financial counter-party; a pre-designation that upon one financial counter-party having received a certain quantity of financial transactions from the User, perhaps even within a certain timeframe, the User will be notified or further financial disbursal will automatically transfer to a different counter-party.","In one embodiment of a scrip transaction, a Rule-Module  from the Master Rule-Module Nexus  comprises an Execution Command  which permits a merchant to contribute financial directly to a non-profit charity based upon a User's purchases.

As such, Logon begins when the user visits an Internet website \u201clogon page\u201d, which is a website with which the user has pre-registered (e.g., on www.facebook.com, www.twitter.com, www.google.com, www.nexuspayments.com, etc.), and therein logs on (or logs in) by entering access codes via the Keypad  or via the Display  (e.g., visual widgets of alpha-numeric-symbolic character for selecting via a computer mouse or via a touch screen, etc.), said access codes comprising at least one of the following: (i) a pre-registered name and\/or password; (ii) at least one pre-registered PVC . In addition, or alternatively, the user may logon via providing their UUC , optionally along with at least one PVC . Once the user is thereby verified by the website's server (e.g., Third-Party Platform  or RMN ), the server transmits a \u201ccookie\u201d, which is a text string which may be in binary code (e.g., ID=0100111001), thereby stored on Memory  or  of the user's NAT \u2014UIA . As such, the browser then returns the cookie to the server the next time either that same website is viewed, or the next time the user views a website which has an agreement to share or acknowledge the cookie which the user's NAT \u2014UIA  had received from the \u201clogon page\u201d. If the cookie was provided by the RMN  (e.g., www.nexuspayments.com), the cookie may function as the user's UUC  for Internet access, until such time as the cookie is deleted from the user's NAT \u2014UIA , or until such time as the RMN  has terminated the cookie's validity (e.g., the cookie passes an expiration date pre-set by RMN ). If the cookie was provided by a Third-Party Platform  with which the RMN  has agreed to share data via a secure connection, then the Third-Party Platform  (e.g., www.facebook.com), may transmit confirmation to the RMN  that the user has been verified. This acknowledgement may be in the form of a UUC  of the user, which the RMN  would recognize. Here again, this cookie the cookie may function as the user's UUC  for Internet access, until such time as the cookie is deleted from the user's NAT \u2014UIA , or until such time as the Third-Party Platform  has terminated the cookie's validity (e.g., the cookie passes an expiration date pre-set by Third-Party Platform ). Whether provided by the RMN  or the Third-Party Platform , once the cookie has been deleted or invalidated, the user is deemed to have logged off, and as such the logon session is terminated.

Once selected by the user, the widget provides an interactive experience for the user via launching a pop-up window which transmits secure socket layer data via HTTPS or S-HTTP to the user's browser, and provides a data-entry box for the user to input a PVC . Additionally, the secure socket layer data may comprise presenting the user's Private Code  via Display , which confirms that the user has a secure, authentic, real-time connection to the RMN  via communications Network .","In one embodiment of the invention, the secure socket layer data (\u201cSSL\u201d) uses two keys to encrypt data (e.g., DUKPT), a public key and a private key, wherein the uniform resources locator (\u201cURL\u201d) of the SSL connection starts with Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (\u201cHTTPS\u201d), over which any amount of data can be sent securely. In one embodiment of the invention, SSL creates a secure connection between the user's NAT \u2014UIA  and the RMN , wherein secure HTTP (\u201cS-HTTP\u201d) is designed to transmit individual messages securely.

Similarly, the RMN  may default at registration to limit the number or value of financial transactions that can be completed by a User without a PVC . When the threshold is hit, the User may either answer an e-mail or an automated phone validation. In one embodiment, the NAT  token may be registered by default to domestic United States use only, but could be changed by country code addition.","In one embodiment for Virtual POS, a User may enable their use of the RMN  and UAR  for financial transactions by: (i) shopping via a RMN  affiliated registration\/aggregation web portal of an Account Issuer Platform  using their proprietary identity control mechanism; (ii) notifying the RMN  via a website, or; (iii) notifying the RMN  via telephone with live or automated attendant. In the case of (ii) and (iii) the User may provide verification data comprising any one of the following: part or all of a Virtual POS UUC  from the back of the NAT ; the \u201crisk key\u201d (Risk Key ); their PVC , and; total dollar amount they want to be able to spend in the next chosen time period (e.g., number of hours or until a certain date).","The Risk Key  may comprise any one of the following: a unique DCVC3 (Dynamic card validation code); a unique Static CVC (card validation code); a unique DCVV (Dynamic card validation value), and\/or; a unique Static CVV (card validation value). In the embodiment where the Risk Code  is a CVV, this is a short data string which User of the NAT  provides during a Virtual POS financial transaction number to verify that the NAT  is their possession. The Risk Key  provides a cryptographic check of the Virtual POS UUC  associated with that NAT , and may not necessarily be part of the Virtual POS UUC  itself.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0943","num":"0956"},"figref":"FIG. 3E","b":["62","203","205","207"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0944","num":"0957"},"figref":"FIG. 3F","b":["62","200","200","14","50","200","16","70","202","50"]},"In another embodiment comprising shopping via Virtual POS, a User may be allowed to make a restricted number of financial transactions worth up to prescribed dollar value without the User invoking a PVC . This allows for \u201can impulse purchase\u201d. However, no additional transactions will be allowed until the User's invokes their PVC . An automated outreach from the RMN  may contact the User via a pre-registered User phone number or User e-mail address to require validation comprising Pattern Data  such as a PVC .","In another embodiment, for Virtual POS, the following may occur: At checkout via an internet web site, telephone order, or mail order, the User may be asked to provide the Virtual POS UUC  in full as located on the NAT , including the Risk Key . In this fashion the merchant's check out system has to do nothing different for processing a financial transaction via the RMN  than it does for every other standard payment device. A merchant may increase their security, if they desired, by: asking for a portion of the Physical POS UUC , or PVC . This would, in essence provide one more level of validation that the NAT  is in the hands of the authorized User.","In another embodiment, the RMN  may invert the current internet security approach of some major payment brands which currently invoke monetary penalties on merchants that fail to prove that they have secure systems. Instead, the RMN  may decide to only allow merchants with secure systems to even ask for a portion of the PVC .","In another embodiment, the merchant Third-Party Platform  or the RMN  may query for: a Secondary PVC  which is designated for Virtual POS shopping only, and\/or; an alternative data string designated for Virtual POS use only. Since the Virtual POS UUC  is never printed on a Physical POS receipt, the only way it could be collected is if the NAT  were stolen or duplicated, whereby any subsequent unauthorized financial transactions could be identified via several means, including by the User notifying the RMN , by a software security neural network of the RMN  or an Account Issuer Platform . In this embodiment, with only the Virtual POS UUC  being available for internet, telephone order, and mail order financial transactions, a break-in of a Virtual POS merchant or Account Issuer Platform  provides only data strings which the RMN  restricts for use in the Virtual POS environment and which cannot be used for Physical POS financial transactions via the RMN .","Processing Mobile Financial Transactions Via a RMN and a UAR","As used herein, electronic \u201cPositioning System\u201d may refer to and include electronic positioning communications and systems, electronic navigating communications and systems, electronic tracking communications and systems, electronic mapping communications and systems, and electronic guiding communications and systems.

The Primary PVC \u2014Secondary PVC  may be transmitted to the RMN  using SMS or other message transmitted via Network . When the VP  verifies the User's authority to access the RMN , the RMN  may then transmit a single-use, or limited-use, Secondary UUC  to the \u201cpublic\u201d mobile device via SMS, whereby the RMN  temporarily enables the \u201cpublic\u201d mobile device to function, in real-time, as the User's own private NAT  by presenting a barcode of the Secondary UUC  via the mobile device's Display , for scanning by a Terminal \u2014UIA .","In an alternative embodiment, for additional security, a request for a Secondary UUC  or a Secondary PVC  may also be generated from a kernel software program running on the mobile device NAT , whereby the mobile device NAT  generates a Financial Transaction Authorization Request  via SMS message transmitted over a Network  to the RMN . The RMN  generates a single-use, or time-limited use, Secondary UUC  or Secondary PVC  that is time-synchronized between the NAT  and the RMN , and is transmitted to the NAT  over a Network  via Financial Transaction Authorization Response . In one instance, the User's NAT  is scanned by the Terminal \u2014UIA  for a single-use Secondary UUC  which was just SMS-issued by the RMN , and presented via barcode image on the NAT's  Display . In an alternative instance, the User's NAT  displays a Secondary PVC  which was just SMS-issued by the RMN , and which the User then enters via the POS Terminal \u2014UIA  for that transaction only.","In another embodiment, where neither the User's NAT  nor the POS Terminal \u2014UIA  enables storage of, or direct Keypad  entry of, a the User's Audible or Visible (Audible\/Visible) Signature , the mobile device NAT  may transmit a Financial Transaction Authorization Request  to the RMN , comprising any one of the following: the PVC  inputted using audio commands or Keypad  entry on the NAT , and; the UUC  stored via the NAT's  Subscriber Identification Module (SIM Card), whereby the RMN  returns a Financial Transaction Authorization Response , comprising an Audible or Visible (Audible\/Visible) Signature  in a barcode image presented via the NAT's  dynamic Display , for scanning by the POS Terminal \u2014UIA .

The RMN  extracts relevant information from the user, the NAT  and the UAR  to construct the payment agreement between the parties involved, including the settlement type(s) for the payment transaction. The contract is defined by the charging WSDL interface as a complex data type, which may be extended to fit any kind of service and payment scenario. Once a charging session is no longer required, a charge and release operation is performed to charge any remaining amounts and followed by releasing the charging session. All session details are now obsolete and the session id will be invalid, therefore this information will be removed from the payment service persistent storage.","In , a mobile payment system is illustrated using a real GSM mobile Network  for communication. The overall system consists of three distributed systems: the mobile NAT  (or NAT \u2014UIA ) operated by the mobile User, the Payee or merchant server and, the RMN . Operator billing represents the payment mechanism used by mobile Network  operators to acquire payment from their customers for services provided. A Payee using this payment method with the Web Services framework would be requesting that the RMN , or the Network  operator such as a cell phone service provider, will bill the mobile NAT  User according when the service provided in being used. For example, the RMN  may provide aggregated billing services to the User, spanning across services and Networks  used by the NAT . The RMN  will then forward that payment on to the Payee after deducting a payment service charge. The amount to be billed may be deducted from a mobile NAT  user's pre-paid account or added to their next post-paid billing aggregation invoice from the RMN . Alternatively, if the Network  operator, such a cell phone company, provides the invoice, costs may be added to the User's phone bill. The RMN  in this case may be conjoined with the network operator or may be independent with access to the Network  operator's third-party Platform(s)  and payment infrastructure. This illustrative embodiment enables NAT  Users to use SMS text messaging to anonymously pay for access to digital entertainment and content. Reverse SMS billing via the RMN  means that the owner of the recipient NAT  phone rather than the message sender is charged for the cost of the SMS message received. This provides an alternative payment option not connected to mobile Network  operators' infrastructure, or Account Issuers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0958","num":"0971"},"figref":"FIG. 29C","b":["62","62","28","14"]},"In another embodiment, the RMN  provides aggregated billing services, avoiding the need to send a User an SMS each time a Payee bills a user. Instead, Users are billed when the UUC  from a NAT  and, optionally, their PVC , are verified by the RMN . The RMN  provides this verification to the Payee(s) pre-registered with the User's UAR , whether via a Payee's Internet  website or WAP site, or at a Payee physical point-of-sale (POS). Optionally the RMN  batches the User's billings for invoicing on a periodic basis.","In a POS merchant environment, the User's NAT  may be scanned by the UIA \u2014Terminal , which transmits the UUC  (or UUC \u2014PVC ) packet, a description of the goods and the payment amount to the RMN .

In one such embodiment, Over-the-Air (OTA) provisioning is used to provide Payee data, pre-registered with the RMN  or Subset RMN , directly from a Payee UIA  or Payee Terminal  to a NAT . In one embodiment, the User manually initiates the NAT  electronic detection, and optionally downloading and\/or storing, of Payee data directly from a Payee UIA  or Payee Terminal  to the NAT .

For example, such required Payee data may include a UPC , a Payee depository account (which may also be an acquirer, or acquiring bank, designated Payee depository account), a Payee bank routing code, a Payee's roster of goods and\/or services and associated pricing or costs. OTA is known in the art for the transmission and reception of application-related information in a wireless communications system, and is commonly used in conjunction with the Short Messaging Service (SMS), which allows the transfer of small text files even while using a mobile phone for more conventional purposes. In addition to short messages and small graphics, such files can contain instructions for subscription activation, banking transactions, ring tones, and Wireless Access Protocol (WAP) settings. OTA messages are, in an illustrative embodiment, encrypted to ensure User privacy and data security. Such OTA provisioning, in an illustrative embodiment, via the RMN  and using pre-registered Rule-Modules , enables a NAT  (or NAT \u2014UIA ) to select, download and install contents and applications on a NAT  mobile device.

Per the User\/Payee and User\/Payor preferences in the RMN , the RMN  determines which types of Financial Accounts  are accepted by the User\/Payee (e.g., Visa, M\/C, ACH, etc.), and which rewards apply to the transaction (e.g., discounts offered by User\/Payee, or reward points accumulated by User\/Payor), and then presents to User\/Payor their Account Signatures  with the accounts and associated benefits that can be used for this transaction. The Payor then selects the final account and accepts the transaction terms (e.g., $$ amount, designated Payee, financial account to use).\n\n","8. The RMN  then converts the Tender Suggestion (e.g., Account Signature  along with Request Message or Transaction Request ) from the RMN  proprietary electronic message format into a Payment Transaction in an ISO-formatted message packet and transmits it to a Merchant Acquirer Third-Party Platform . Here are two illustrative embodiments for submission of the payment transaction to the Acquirer:\n\n","10. The Merchant Acquirer Third-Party Platform  processes the Payment Transaction and returns an authorization confirmation to the RMN .","11. The RMN  transmits a Payment Confirmation electronic message to the User\/Payee.","12. The RMN transmits a Payment Confirmation electronic message to the User\/Payor.","Processing Financial Transactions Via Arbitrage or Auction Rule-Module(s)","In one illustrative embodiment, processing a User's financial transaction comprises invoking a Rule-Module  governing an automated arbitrage, or auction, software program.

As a result, the User-customized search engine is automatically and progressively refined and customized to the User's evolving preferences and online activity patterns as tracked and interpreted by the User's own electronic, automated intelligent agent.","As an example of the above, the User's intelligent agent can direct the User's search engine to automatically conduct periodic, customized online data retrievals reflecting User-customized priorities for: product or service promotional offers or discounts via email or instant messaging; User-customized investment updates; User-customized medical or health information; competitive product or service prices across a broad range of online Account Issuers; hobby or recreational interests; interactive User-customized online advertisements, wherein product or service providers are permitted to provide unsolicited information to a User based upon certain User-customized criteria; online event calendaring, wherein a User is automatically notified of upcoming events or activities reflecting their interests.","Further, the intelligent agent can extrapolate from the User's existing preferences and online activity patterns to automatically and periodically recommend to the User new data that may expand or delete the User's Pattern Data  and Execution Commands  based upon the intelligent agent's algorithmic projection of what the User's online preferences and activities will be in the future.","In another embodiment, an Execution Command  functioning as an intelligent tracking and extrapolating agent centrally integrates data on the User's Internet browsing to provide User-customized recommendations on new products and services available from any number of Internet web sites or Internet Account Issuers. Examples include the Execution Commands for retrieval of new types of music, books, and investment opportunities that reflect the User's preferences, but that such recommendations are pre-selected based on the Execution Command  having automatically conducted competitive price-comparisons from various Third-Party Platforms . In another embodiment, an Execution Command  integrates User-customized data from a User's calendaring or scheduling software program to provide the User with customized recommendations on User-customized offering for products, services or upcoming events based on the User's pre-scheduled activities in their online calendar.","In another embodiment, an Execution Command  appends a customized, User-customized audio or visible identifier which accompanies an electronic transmission for presentation to the counter-party. This identifier is appended to the User's electronic transmission as a form of \u201celectronic personal signature\u201d to readily notify the counter-party that the authenticated User sent the message. This identifier may be a unique image or sound sampled from the User, or it may be a non-unique, distinct graphical or audio selected by the User to reflect their personal preferences, such as a cartoon image or a favorite sound or audio tone.","In another embodiment where greater security is required, an Execution Command  governs the appending of a User-unique network credential or digital certificate to an electronic transmission. If a User employing a UUC  (or optionally a UUC \u2014PVC ) seeks to append their digital certificate to an electronic transmission, the User stores at least one command to sign electronic documents using their private keys, which are themselves centrally stored on a Rule-Module Nexus  server. As such, the User's private keys are invoked as a header of the User's electronic transmission which, in combination with the electronic document itself and an MD5 calculation of the document, together form a digital signature. At a later time, an authorized counter-party can use the User's public key from the Master RMN  or a third-party certifier to verify the authenticity of the sender and the electronic document's contents to yield a secure, authenticated electronic transmission. In this way, Users do not have to manage their own private keys, nor do they have to retain physical possession of their digital certificates via smart cards or personal computers with resident User-customized data. In one embodiment, public keys of a particular certifying authority are initially stored in the UIA  at the time of construction.","In another embodiment, an Execution Command  governs the processing of an on-line, User-customized calendaring program or Internet calendaring web site, wherein the User's online scheduling calendar is automatically updated by the User-customized search engine and the User-customized intelligent search and tracking agent based upon User-customized Pattern Data .

Examples of such subordinated Users could be the children or the) spouse of a User. Examples of such access and presentation, or viewing, filters may be restrictions predetermined by the primary User governing: subordinated User access to Internet web sites with adult or violent content; subordinated User access to online television or radio programming with adult or violent content; subordinated User access to the Internet  with restrictions covering online session length; subordinated User access to educational online resources which are automatically \u201cpushed\u201d to the subordinated User during a particular online session, as pre-determined by the primary User, in order to pro-actively circumscribe the content which a particular subordinated User is permitted to view or download.","In another embodiment, an Execution Command  provided to the Nexus  by an authorized third-party, such as a User's employer, governs the processing and prioritization of electronic transmissions to the User on an intranet Network . As such, the Execution Command  determines which electronic transmissions are automatically \u201cpushed\u201d to the User during a particular online session, as pre-determined by the authorized third-party, in order to pro-actively circumscribe the content which a particular User is permitted to view or download","Embodiments of User-customized Execution Commands  governing the display or presentation of electronic transmissions include controlling the organization and prioritization of online content such that text, audio and graphics are displayed according to a User's pre-determined preferences. This includes displaying informational updates in a certain prioritization order, wherein User-customized regional news may be presented prior to national or international news, displaying expenditure records in User-customized categories which reflect anticipated tax deduction categories, such as home improvement expenses, charitable contributions, and the like, displaying customized User-customized Internet web sites or portals, including the User's predetermined bookmarks, preferred web links, calendaring programs, email mail addressing rosters, a plurality of email accounts with their accompanying inbox messages, User-customized instant messaging \u201cbuddy\u201d lists.","Other embodiments of User-customized Execution Commands  governing the display or presentation of electronic transmissions include: displaying accrued User-customized consumer rewards incentives or customized online advertising according to a User's prescribed priorities, such that skiing apparel is presented to the User at a time based on their calendaring program's designating their scheduled winter vacation or such that an advertisement for new coffee flavors from the User's preferred vendor is presented during the User's morning log-on session; displaying the User's customized fitness program on an Internet-connected exercise machine, whereby the User is reminded of the number of repetitions the User performed at what difficulty level during their last exercise session, and thereby also presents a recommended number of repetitions and a recommended difficulty level for the User's current session.","Other embodiments include Execution Commands  governing: presentation or display filters which circumscribe what text, graphic or audio content the User is permitted to view; presentation or display filters which govern which products or services a User is permitted to purchase, such as a subordinated User whose parent is a primary User, and where the subordinated User is prohibited from purchasing cigarettes, is limited in their selection of online Account Issuers, is limited in the amount of online session time the User is permitted to have in a single day, and the like.","In an illustrative embodiment, each verification request and each transmission request, whether successful or not, is logged in the Logging Platform (LF) .","In an illustrative embodiment, more than one Rule-Module Nexus  provides fault tolerance from either natural or man-made disasters. In this embodiment, each Verification Platform  uses a backup power generator, redundant hardware, mirrored platforms, and other standard fault tolerant equipment known in the industry","Execution Platform","In an illustrative embodiment, an Execution Command  of a Rule-Module  causes an electronic financial transaction to be executed by the Execution Platform . The Execution Platform  may be on a platform which is located within the Master RMN  itself, or it may be co-located with an entity platform  that is external to the Master RMN . In the event that a designated entity platform  cannot be contacted for the electronic financial transaction to be completed, the financial transaction is \u201cdeclined\u201d.","In one embodiment, if the Account Issuer approves the transaction, the Execution Platform  returns a transaction number to the User Account Registry , and the User's Financial Account  is thereby adjusted through either a credit or debit. The transaction number is returned to the UIA , which lists the transaction on a daily transaction summary. The User need take no further action since financial transactions are automatically settled, at which point a calculation is made to automatically adjust the User's designated Financial Account .","In another embodiment, the Execution Platform  uses Rule-Modules  from the Master Rule-Module Nexus  which permit an Account Issuer to itself contribute financial directly to an alternative Account Issuer based upon a User's purchases. In such transactions, units of financial are electronically debited from the User Account controlled by the Account Issuer, and corresponding units of financial are electronically credited to the alternative Account Issuer's Financial Account . An example would be that a purchase on a User's Citibank\u2122 Visa\u2122 Financial Account  will invoke a Rule-Module  wherein: Citibank\u2122 contributes 1% of the User's purchase amount from the financial transaction to the American Lung Association\u2122 registered Financial Account\u2122, or; Citibank\u2122 credits 1% to the User's purchase amount from the financial transaction towards frequent flier miles in the User's Star Alliance\u2122 Rewards Financial Account .","Decryption Platform","In an illustrative embodiment, all messages the Rule-Module Nexus  receives, with the exception of those not transmitted via a UIA , comprise a UIA-VC , a sequence number, and a Message Authentication Code (MAC). MACs, also known as cryptographic checksums, are well known in the computer industry, and are used to assure that any changes to the content of the message will be detectable by the entity receiving the financial transaction. The Decryption Platform (DP)  validates the message's MAC and checks the sequence number for that particular UIA . If the Decryption Platform  determines that both the MAC and the sequence number are valid, the DP 22 uses the unique secret key for that particular UIA  to decrypt the message. For the decryption to function properly, the Decryption Platform  must comprise a copy of each UIA's  DUKPT key table.","If the decryption operation fails, or if the MAC check fails, the message is considered an invalid message. The Decryption Platform  logs a warning to the logging facility (LF) , terminates processing for the message, and returns an error message to the originating UIA .","Before the Decryption Platform  replies to a message that includes a response key, it encrypts the response message with that response key. The Decryption Platform  also generates a MAC for the response and appends it to the message.","In an illustrative embodiment, error messages are not encrypted although the Decryption Platform  does include a MAC for message authentication. Such messages never include confidential information. However, most response messages include a status or response codes that can indicate whether the request succeeded or not. For example, when the Execution Platform  declines a financial transaction for a specific reason, it does not return an error message, it returns a normal Financial Transaction Response Message  with a response code set to \u201cfailed\u201d.","Gateway Platform (GP)","In an illustrative embodiment, the Gateway Platform  serves as an intermediary between redundant Verification Platform  and redundant in-house Registry  platforms, routing electronic financial transactions and\/or electronic transmissions from platforms on overload to platforms that have available capacity. The Gateway Platform  also periodically queries platforms to ensure that are operative and to alert the RMN  or RMN-authorized Third-Party Platform  administrator is any server is inoperative.","Prior Fraud Platform (PFP)","In an illustrative embodiment, the PFP  is a central repository for UUCs , PVCs , and other Pattern Data  which have had prior fraud associated with them. Every new User's UUCs  (and optionally PVCs ) are checked against all PFP  records with the intent of reducing recidivism. In one embodiment, there is an automatic User prior fraud check step, wherein the User's bid UUCs  (and optionally PVCs ) are compared against previously registered UUCs  (and optionally PVCs ) in the PFP  wherein if a match occurs, the Rule-Module Nexus  and Verification Platform  are alerted to the fact that the User has attempted to re-register or re-access the Rule-Module Nexus  after having already been registered with the PFP .","Firewall (FW)","In an illustrative embodiment, the Firewall (FW)  provides a first line of defense against network viruses and computer hackers. All communication links into or out of the Verification Platform  and Master Rule-Module Nexus  server sites first pass through a secure Firewall  Machine.","In an illustrative embodiment, the firewall  Machine, an Internet-Local or Subset-Internet router, only handles messages destined for the Gateway Platform  machines.","Intra-RMN Communications","In an illustrative embodiment, UIA-equipped Transaction Terminals  send packets to Verification Platform  and Master Rule-Module Nexus  server sites via modem, X.25, or other communication medium. The Verification Platform  and Master Rule-Module Nexus  server sites rely on an entity to supply the modem banks required to handle the volume of calls and feed the data onto the Master RMN  backbone.","In an illustrative embodiment, for communications between Verification Platform  and Master Rule-Module Nexus  server sites, the FW  Machines send out double-length DES encrypted packets. The server site LAN component handles the encryption and decryption: the firewall  does not have the ability to decrypt the packets.","In an illustrative embodiment, a properly configured network sniffer acts as an intruder detector as backup for the FW . If an anomalous message is detected, the intruding messages are recorded in their entirety, an operator is alerted, and the Firewall  is physically shut down by the sniffer.","In an illustrative embodiment, the Firewall  disallows any financial transactions from the internal network to the rest of the Internet. An electronic financial transaction message requires about 400 bytes and registration packets require about 10 to 20 KB. To handle 1000 electronic financial transactions per second and 16 registration packet per second, the Firewall  machines are able to process about 400 KB per second.","Logging Platform","In an illustrative embodiment, the Logging Facility  logs all electronic financial transaction attempts, whether successful or not, to write-once media, so that a record is kept of each financial transaction and each error that has occurred during the operation of the Verification Platform .","Interconnections and Communications Among the Electronic Verification Platform, Rule-Module Nexus and User Account Registry","A variety of conventional communications media and protocols may be used to connect or place the devices herein in communication.
