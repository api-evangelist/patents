{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Users may have accounts associated with different parties. For example, a user may have a social network account, an online shopping account, and an e-mail account, with each account being associated with a different party. The user may benefit from sharing the user's data from one account with another account. For example, sharing the user's online shopping data with the user's social network may lead to the user being offered shopping promotions or coupons based on the user's shopping data.","However, once a user shares data from his or her account with a third-party account (e.g., a third-party application), the user (a second party) may not know what information from the first-party account is being accessed and used by the third-party account. The user may not know how or when the third-party account accesses or uses the user's data from the first-party account.","The subject matter discussed herein relates generally to data processing and, more particularly, to the control and enforcement of access of user data.","Control and enforcement of access of user data are described, including receiving a request from an application to access data associated with a user; determining that a service profile and another service profile are associated with the user, the service profile includes at least one data service specified by the user and the another service profile includes another at least one data service specified by the user; identifying the service profile has been associated, by the user, with at least the application; determining whether the data requested by the application are provided by the at least one data service included in the service profile; and granting access by the application to the data requested when the data requested by the application are provided by the at least one data service; or denying access by the application to the data requested when the data requested by the application are not provided by the at least one data service.","In some implementations, another service profile may be associated with at least another application, which is mutually exclusive from the at least the application associated with the service profile.","In some implementations, the request may be received by intercepting the request intended for a target not performing the interception.","In some implementations, the service profile is identified based on an identifier associated with the at least the application.","In some implementations, the service profile is identified from a cache.","In some implementations, the at least one data service includes one or more boundaries defined by the user and can be redefined by the user.","In some implementations, the request may be granted by passing through the request from the application to a server controlling access to the data requested.","In some implementations, an error code may be returned to the application when the request is denied.","The subject matter discussed herein provides one or more advantages. One advantage may be providing the user with transparency with respect to access of user data, as well as an ability for the user to control and enforce access of user data.","The subject matter described herein is taught by way of example embodiments. Various details have been omitted for the sake of clarity and to avoid obscuring the subject matter. Examples shown below are directed to structures and functions for implementing and enabling control and enforcement of access of user data.","Described herein are example embodiments of systems, devices, and methods that enable user control and enforcement of access to user data and services by other applications (e.g., third-party applications).","Data associated with users can be classified into categories (e.g., email data, video data, social network data, etc.). A user may be provided a mechanism (e.g., user interface) to define one or more service profiles, and each of the service profiles may include one or more categories of data. The user may decide which applications to associate with the service profiles. Once an application (e.g., a third-party application) is associated with a service profile, the application may access the categories of data included in the service profile and may not access any category of data not included in the service profile.","For example, a user may define a service profile \u201cRecommendation Services,\u201d to which the user may identify and add categories of data, such as data from location data service, social network data, and data from authenticated search (e.g., to personalize the user experience and search results). The user may control access by applications (e.g., third-party applications) to data associated with the user. For example, the user may create and\/or modify a service profile to, for example, turn on and off a category of data; add, modify, or delete one or more applications (e.g., third-party applications) associated with the service profile; and\/or perform other configurations of the service profile.","When an application (e.g., third-party application) requests access to data associated with a user, the access request may be checked against a service profile, with which the application is associated, to determine whether the application has access to the user data. For example, if the application requests access to the user's e-mail data, and the service profile defines that access to the user's e-mail data is allowed by the application, the application is granted access to the user's e-mail data. If, however, the service profile does not define that the user's e-mail data are a category of data the application is allowed to access, the application is denied access to the user's e-mail data.","As used herein, the term \u201cproduct\u201d or \u201cservice\u201d or \u201capplication\u201d refers to any information, data, communication, infrastructure, organization, service, assistance, entertainment, or the like provided by one or more providers via online communication to at least one user. Examples of products, services, or applications may include, but are not limited to, online searching, e-commerce services, maps, locational data, dating services, online forums, online platforms, bulletin boards, social networks, websites, sites, chat rooms, email communication, image sharing sites, video sharing sites, audio sharing sites, data sharing platforms, data storage, software, tax preparation and filing, gaming, mobile applications, news, translation, toolbar, calendar, instant messaging, short message service, voice, phone, video communication service, and the like. Products, services, or applications may be provided on any platform or device ranging from a mobile device (e.g., smartphone), to a semi-mobile device (e.g., a laptop), and to a non-mobile device (e.g., a kiosk, television, computer, etc.). A product, service, or application may communicate to a provider or another product, service, or application using a wired or wireless connection.","As used herein, the term \u201cwebsite\u201d or \u201cweb site\u201d or \u201csite\u201d refers to a set of web pages for providing or supporting related services. A website can be hosted on at least one computing device (e.g., a system, server, web server, application server, client, or any label) accessible via a network or connection (wired and\/or wireless). A website can be accessed and\/or supported using at least one top-level Uniform Resource Locator (URL, e.g., \u201cabc.gov\u201d, \u201c123.org\u201d, \u201czxc.com\u201d, \u201cbestads.com\u201d, \u201cvirtualbank.com\u201d, and the like). A website can be operated and\/or supported by one or more business entities. For example, ZXC Corporation may operate the website \u201czxc.com\u201d that includes web pages, content, and\/or services from \u201czxc.bestads.com\u201d (e.g., advertisement services provided by another firm) and \u201cvirtualbank.com\/zxc-payment-services\u201d (e.g., financial services provided by a financial institution).","As used herein, the term \u201conline account\u201d or \u201caccount\u201d refers to a product, service, or application associated with a user. A user may have, subscribe to, and\/or use one or more accounts or online accounts (e.g., a user may have an email account, a social network account, a photo sharing account, a video sharing account, an online storage account, a mobile account, a blog account, etc.). Each of the email service, social network, photo sharing service, video sharing service, online storage, mobile service, etc. can be referred to as a product, service, or application.","An account can be an Internet or external account (e.g., an end user subscribing to an openly, publicly, or semi-publicly available service), an intranet or internal account (e.g., an employee subscribing to a service of a company or firm), an extranet or controlled availability account (e.g., an account available to vendors, customers, or other controlled subscribers), or another type of account.","As used herein, the term \u201ccategory\u201d or \u201ctype\u201d with respect to data associated with a service profile refers to the grouping of data and services by a user. A category of data may come from a service (e.g., email service), a part of a service (e.g., only emails to and from some users or email addresses), or a combination of two of more services (e.g., the combination of at least a part of one service, such as email services, with at least a part of another service, such as calendar service or contracts management service). For example, in one service profile, a user may define or group incoming emails as \u201cemail data\u201d (excluding outgoing emails). In another service profile, a user may define outgoing emails as \u201cemail data\u201d (excluding incoming emails). In yet another service profile, a user may define all emails (e.g., incoming and outgoing emails) as \u201cemail data\u201d. In any of these example groupings of \u201cemail data,\u201d or in any other example, a user may include some or all of the user's address book contacts as part of \u201cemail data.\u201d To further illustrate, a user may define a \u201cmedia\u201d category of data in different service profiles to include different combinations of one or more of audio data, video data, photo data, the metadata thereof, and literal data.","As used herein, a category of data may be referred to as data, user data, user's data, data stream, service data, service, data service, or the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","120","130","160","180","120","120"]},"Data\/services manager  may include and\/or manage, for example, posts\/comments data  (e.g., associated with a social network), location services , transaction\/financial data , photo data , video data , audio data , email data and service , and other data and services  (e.g., users profile data and\/or other data\/services). Service  may be a social network that produces and stores posts\/comments data , which includes users' posts, comments, and other data associated with users on a social network (e.g., contact information, circles, etc.). Photo data , video data , and\/or audio data  (e.g., user-provided or user-interested photos, videos, and audios) may be stored by social network service  and\/or other media sharing\/storing (e.g., cloud storing) services (not shown).","Access manager  may be operated to protect access to a user's data from third-party applications (e.g., guarding against unauthorized access to the user's data). For example, a user (e.g., a user using device ) may have granted a third-party (e.g., third-party application ) access to some of the user's data and\/or services (e.g., managed by data\/services manager ) which are not associated with the third-party. A user's data may be referred to as a data stream.","When third-party application  needs to access any data or services associated with the user from data\/services manager , the third-party application  may issue an access request . Access manager  receives the access request . To determine whether to grant access request , access manager  may consult access information manager  or one or more service profiles  (described in  below).","In some implementations, the access request  is not intended for access manager . Access manager  intercepts the access request  on behalf of its intended target. Intercepting access requests may provide advantages of not having to change the existing data processing system while providing the ability to control and enforce access of user data (e.g., without changing the executable instructions running on the intended target of the access requests).","For example, access manager  may send a permission request  to access information manager . The permission request  may include a User ID associated with the user and\/or a Service ID associated with the third-party application . Access information manager  may identify one or more service profiles  based on the User ID and\/or Service ID. The service profiles may include at least one category of data accessible by the third-party application . Access information manager  returns the identified service profiles  to access manager  in, for example, a permission response .","In some implementations, such as in implementations where permission request  includes the user data and\/or type of user data to be accessed, access information manager  may return an answer (e.g., a status code) in permission response  based on the user data and\/or type of user data to be accessed. The answer may be derived from determining whether the data to be accessed have been categorized (e.g., defined) in at least one of the identified service profiles . The answer, in an implementation, may indicate that \u201cthe access is granted\u201d or \u201cthe access is denied.\u201d The answer may be returned in addition to or in place of one or more service profiles  as described above.","Access manager  may then determine whether to grant the access request  based on the permission response . For example, if access manager  receives one or more service profile  (e.g., the access information manager  has not made an access grant\/deny determination), access manager  uses the service profiles  to determine whether the data to be accessed have been categorized (e.g., defined) in at least one of the identified service profile .","If the access request  is granted, access manager  issues data\/service (DS) request  to data\/services manager  (e.g., one or more servers (not shown) that manage user data and services). The DS request  may include the necessary information (e.g., User ID, Service ID, user data and\/or type of user data to be accessed, etc.) to allow the one or more servers to respond. In implementations where the access request  is intercepted, the access request  can be passed through as DS request .","DS response  from data\/services manager  to access manager  may be passed through as access response  to third-party application . In some implementations, access manager  may formulate, based on DS response , an access response  and send the access response to the third-party application .","If the access request  is denied for any reason (e.g., access to user data by the third-party application  is not granted or has been revoked), access manager  may ignore the access request  (e.g., not returning an access response ). In some implementations, access manager  may return a status or error code in an access response .","The access flow illustrated with access request , permission request , permission response , DS request , DS response , and access response  is only an example flow (-----). Environment A may support many access flow variations. For example, access manager may be implemented to have \u201cknowledge\u201d of some service profiles  and\/or information previously received from data\/services manager . The knowledge may be, for example, in a form of information caching.","For example, access manager  may cache previous permission responses  and use the cached permission responses  to determine whether to grant or deny subsequent access requests  without sending a permission request  every time an access request  is received (e.g., --- flow). An access flow of --- may affect performance of the flow, responsiveness of user experience, and lightening of the load of access information manager .","In a --- flow, when an access request  is, for example, a repeat request or a request similar to a previous request, to which a permission response  has been received and cached, access manager  may determine that a new permission response  based on the access request  would be the same or similar to a previously received permission response . In that case, without sending a new permission request  and waiting for a corresponding permission response , access manager  may determine whether to grant or deny the access request  based on the previously received permission response .","Some or all of the cashed permission responses  may be purged, for example, periodically (e.g., X number of minutes or every Y number of hours, etc.) and\/or when access information manager  notifies access manager  that one or more service profiles  have been updated.","In some implementations, access manager  may cache previous DS responses  for responding to subsequent access requests  without sending a permission DS request  every time an access request  is received (e.g., --- flow). An access flow of --- may affect performance of the flow, responsiveness of user experience, and lightening of the load of data\/services manager .","In a --- flow, when an access request  is, for example, a repeat request or a request similar to a previous request, to which a DS response  has been received and cached, access manager  may determine that a new DS response  based on the access request  would be the same or similar to a previously received DS response . In that case, without sending a new DS request  and waiting for a corresponding DS response , access manager  may formulate an access response  based on one or more previously received DS response .","Some or all of the cached DS responses  or data contained therein may be purged, for example, periodically (e.g., X number of minutes or every Y number of hours, etc.) and\/or when data\/services manager  notifies access manager  that one or more previously sent DS responses  or data contained therein are out updated (e.g., data contained therein have been updated).","To further improve performance, some implementations may combine the benefits of data flows --- and --- to arrive at a data flow of -. For example, access manager  may provide the same access response  in response to a repeat access request . A data flow of - provides an added feature of shielding access information manager  and data\/services manager  from repeat requests, which can be malicious, such as in denial of service attacks.","An access manager  may be implemented in any manner and\/or using any structure. For example, in some implementations, access manager  may be a central server that receives or intercepts all accesses of user data by all third-party applications . In other implementations, access manager  may be deployed in a distributed manner. For example, there may be two or more access managers  for load balancing the accesses by third-party applications . In further implementation examples, one or more access managers  may be dedicated to serve one or more specific third-party applications . The combination of the above implementation examples and other examples not described may be used to deploy access manager(s) .","A third-party application  may be any product, service, application, website, account, etc. provided by a third-party. As used herein, the term \u201cthird party\u201d refers to a party that is not a user (second party) of a service or a party that provides data and services managed by data\/services manager  (first party).","Access information manager  may be implemented, as shown, separated from manager  and data\/services manager . In some implementations, access information manager  may be implemented as part of access manager  and\/or part of data\/services manager . Access information manager  may be implemented in any manner and\/or using any structure. For example, access information manager  may be implemented as a central server, two or more distributed servers, two or more dedicated servers, and\/or any combination thereof. Access information manager  is further described in  below.","A user may access one or more third-party applications using device . A device  may be any device, such as a telephone, smartphone, tablet computing device, laptop, desktop computer, television, a device in a vehicle, etc.","Data\/services manager  may include one or more data stores, devices, and\/or servers that provide one or more data streams and\/or services controlled by a party that is not a user or a third party.

For example, the App may be a Global Positioning System (GPS) application that provides a user's GPS or locational data, which can be used to locate or identify the user. For example, the App on device  may provide the user's location data to application , which may provide the user's location data via location services  to, for example, a third-party application  or another app or service (e.g., a weather app that needs the user's location data to provide weather forecasts for the user's location).","Data streams and\/or services in Data\/services manager  are made available through service profiles  to third-party applications and applications across different platforms and across different functions.
