{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Overview","Example Implementations","Example Procedures","Example Device","CONCLUSION"],"p":["This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. Section 119(e) to U.S. Provisional Patent Applications Nos. 61\/107,945, 61\/107,935, and 61\/107,921, each of which was filed on Oct. 23, 2008, the entire disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.","Mobile communication devices (e.g., wireless phones) have become an integral part of everyday life. However, the form factor employed by conventional mobile communications devices is typically limited to promote mobility of the mobile communications device.","For example, the mobile communications device may have a relatively limited amount of display area when compared to a conventional desktop computer, e.g., a PC. Therefore, conventional techniques used to interact with a desktop computer may be inefficient when employed by a mobile communications device. For example, it may be difficult to select multiple items of content using convention techniques on a mobile communications device that has a limited amount of display area.","A mobile communications device user interface is described. In an implementation, a method is implemented by a mobile communications device that includes outputting a user interface having a portion that is configured to accept content. When an option is selected in relation to the portion to initiate a communication and the content includes one or more contacts, the communication is formed that includes the content and is automatically addressed to the one or more contacts.","In an implementation, one or more computer-readable storage media includes instructions that are executable by a mobile communications device to configure a user interface to include a portion that is configured to accept a plurality of contacts via a drag-and-drop operation. The instructions are further configured to provide an option that is selectable to initiate a communication to each of the plurality of contacts.","In an implementation, a mobile communications device includes a display device, a processor, and memory configured to maintain a plurality of applications and an operating system that are executable on the processor. The operating system is configured to expose a feature to the plurality of applications to output in a user interface for display on the display device. The feature involves a portion that is selectable in the user interface to accept content via a drag-and-drop operation and output one or more indications of actions that are performable on each of the content accepted in the portion.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Mobile communications devices typically have a small form factor to aide mobility of the mobile communications device. For example, the mobile communications device (e.g., a mobile phone) may be configured with a relatively minimal amount of display area and limited input devices (e.g., a keypad) so that the device may be easily transported. Consequently, traditional techniques used to interact with a conventional computer (e.g., a desktop PC) may be frustrating when used in conjunction with a mobile communications device.","For instance, selection and sharing of content (e.g., photos, video, and so on) on a mobile communications device may be difficult using traditional techniques due to the limitations of the small form factor described above. Consequently, traditional mobile communications devices were configured to interact with a single item of content at a time.","A mobile communications device user interface is described. In an implementation, a portion of a user interface is configured as a \u201cbucket\u201d to allow a user to drag-and-drop multiple items of content into it. The portion may be persisted between applications by an operating system such that a user may navigate between applications and store items of content from the applications using the portion. Actions may then be applied to the content that has been accepted in the bucket as a whole, such as to form a communication, a playlist, and so on, further discussion of which may be found in relation to the following sections.","In the following discussion, a variety of example implementations of a mobile communications device (e.g., a wireless phone) are described. Additionally, a variety of different functionality that may be employed by the mobile communications device is described for each example, which may be implemented in that example as well as in other described examples. Accordingly, example implementations are illustrated of a few of a variety of contemplated implementations. Further, although a mobile communications device having one or more modules that are configured to provide telephonic functionality are described, a variety of other mobile devices are also contemplated, such as personal digital assistants, mobile music players, dedicated messaging devices, portable game devices, netbooks, and so on.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIGS. 2-3"],"b":["100","102","102","102","102"]},"The mobile communications device  is further illustrated as including a first housing  and a second housing  that are connected via a slide  such that the first and second housings ,  may move (e.g., slide) in relation to one another. Although sliding is described, it should be readily apparent that a variety of other movement techniques are also contemplated, e.g., a pivot, a hinge and so on.","The first housing  includes a display device  that may be used to output a variety of content, such as a caller identification (ID), contacts, images (e.g., photos) as illustrated, email, multimedia messages, Internet browsing, game play, music, video and so on. In an implementation, the display device  is configured to function as an input device by incorporating touchscreen functionality, e.g., through capacitive, surface acoustic wave, resistive, optical, strain gauge, dispersive signals, acoustic pulse, and other touchscreen functionality. The touchscreen functionality (as well as other functionality such as track pads) may be used to detect gestures, further discussion of which may be found in relation to .","The second housing  is illustrated as including a keyboard  that may also be used to provide inputs to the mobile communications device . Although the keyboard  is illustrated as a QWERTY keyboard, a variety of other examples are also contemplated, such as a keyboard that follows a traditional telephone keypad layout (e.g., a twelve key numeric pad found on basic telephones), keyboards configured for other languages (e.g., Cyrillic), and so on.","In the \u201copen\u201d configuration as illustrated in the example implementation  of , the first housing  is moved (e.g., slid) \u201caway\u201d from the second housing  using the slide . Other implementations are also contemplated, such as a \u201cclamshell\u201d configuration, \u201cbrick\u201d configuration, and so on.","The form factor employed by the mobile communications device  may be suitable to support a wide variety of features. For example, the keyboard  is illustrated as supporting a QWERTY configuration. This form factor may be particularly convenient to a user to utilize the previously described functionality of the mobile communications device , such as to compose texts, play games, check email, \u201csurf\u201d the Internet, provide status messages for a social network, and so on.","The mobile communications device  is also illustrated as including a communication module . The communication module  is representative of functionality of the mobile communications device  to communicate via a network . For example, the communication module  may include telephone functionality to make and receive telephone calls. The communication module  may also include a variety of other functionality, such as to capture content, form short message service (SMS) text messages, multimedia messaging service (MMS) messages, emails, status updates to be communicated to a social network service, and so on. A user, for instance, may input a status update for communication via the network  to the social network service. The social network service may then publish the status update to \u201cfriends\u201d of the user, e.g., for receipt by the friends via a computer, respective mobile communications devices, and so on. A variety of other examples are also contemplated, such as blogging, instant messaging, and so on.","The mobile communications device  is also illustrated as including a user interface module . The user interface module  is representative of functionality of the mobile communications device  to generate, manage, and\/or output a user interface  for display on the display device . A variety of different techniques may be employed to generate the user interface.","For example, the user interface module  may configure the user interface  to include a portion  to collect a plurality of content, such as the images  in the user interface  of . The user interface module  may then expose a plurality of actions  that may be performed using each of the content collected in the portion . A variety of different actions  may be performed, such as to form a communication , form a playlist , form a slideshow , and so on. Thus, in this way content may be first collected using the portion  (the \u201cbucket\u201d) and then an object (e.g., the communication, playlist, or slideshow) may be formed. This differs from conventional techniques in which the object was first formed (e.g., a playlist, a communication, and so on) and then populated with content. A variety of different techniques may be used to collect content using the portion , an example of which is described in relation to the following figure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","122","120","200","202","204","206","208","122","102","202","120","210","212","210","110"]},"At the second step , touchscreen functionality of the mobile communications device  is used to detect the selection. In response, a thumbnail image  of the image  of the dog is created which follows the dragging of the user's finger  across the display device . For example, an animation may be displayed to give the appearance that the thumbnail image  \u201cpops off\u201d the image  of the dog. Additionally, the display of the image  may also be changed to indicate the selection, which is illustrated through the use of grayscale in the second step .","At the third step , the thumbnail image  has been dragged proximal to the portion  of the user interface  to follow the user's finger . In response, an animation is displayed that gives an appearance of the thumbnail image  being \u201cdropped in the bucket.\u201d For example, the animation may cause the thumbnail image  to be rotated and scaled (e.g., shrunk). In this way, the user is informed that the content (e.g., the image ) is being input. A variety of other examples are also contemplated.","At the fourth step , the display of the image  returns back to the original state, e.g., to match the original state in the first step . Additionally, a display of the portion  is changed to indicate that the portion contains the image. Thus, the user is informed in this instance that the portion  \u201ccontains\u201d the image . This process may be repeated to include a wide variety of content in the portion  from a wide variety of applications. For example, the content included in the portion  may be heterogeneous (e.g., \u201cmixed\u201d) to include music, images, movies, contacts, documents, and so on obtained from a variety of different applications. Although a drag-and-drop operation has been described for a single item of content, multiple items may also be selected (e.g., sequentially or at one time) and then dragged together. A variety of different actions may then be performed based on what content is included in the portion , further discussion of which may be found in relation to the following figure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","122","210","122","122","120"]},"The user interface  may also include options that are selectable to perform represented actions, examples of which are illustrated as upload  and send . The upload  option is selectable to cause content included in the portion  to be uploaded to a network site, such as a social network service. For example, the user interface module  may determine that a contact (e.g., \u201cEllie\u201d in the illustrated example) has been included in the portion . Accordingly, the user interface module  may upload content that is not the contact to a network location specified in the contact \u201cEllie.\u201d A similar technique may also be employed to form a communication to one or multiple contacts, further discussion of which may be found in relation to the following procedures.","The following discussion describes user interface techniques that may be implemented utilizing the previously described systems and devices. Aspects of each of the procedures may be implemented in hardware, firmware, software, or a combination thereof. The procedures are shown as a set of blocks that specify operations performed by one or more devices and are not necessarily limited to the orders shown for performing the operations by the respective blocks. In portions of the following discussion, reference will be made to the environment  and systems - of , respectively.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 6"],"b":["400","402","108","104","104","104"]},"One or more indications of actions are output that are performable on each of the content accepted in the portion (block ). Thus, in this example, the content is gathered and then a variety of actions are performable on the content by selecting the action (block ). For example, a playlist may be created in response to selection of a corresponding action (block ) \u201ccreate playlist\u201d when the portion includes content configured as media, e.g., songs, videos, and so on. In another example, the content may be uploaded to a social network site in response to selection of a corresponding action (block ) \u201cupload.\u201d For instance, the media module  may automatically (or in conjunction with manual interaction of a user) provide credentials to a social network website via the network  to upload content to a user's account upon selection of an \u201cupload\u201d action. In a further example, a communication is formed in response to selection of a corresponding action (block ), such as an email, text message, and so on. Further discussion of communication formation may be found in relation to the following figure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","502","122"]},"When an option is selected in relation to the portion to initiate a communication and the content includes one or more contacts, the communication is formed to include the content and is automatically addressed to the one or more contacts (block ). For example, the media module  may identify which of the content accepted via the portion  includes relevant contact information, e.g., a telephone number, email address, and so on. Therefore, when an option is selected (e.g., a representation of an action \u201cemail\u201d) the communication is formed and populated with the relevant contact information of each of the contacts accepted by the portion  automatically and without further user interaction. A variety of other examples are also contemplated, such as formation of a SMS, MMS, and so on.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIGS. 1-3"],"b":["600","600","102","600"]},"Device  includes input  that may include Internet Protocol (IP) inputs as well as other input devices, such as the keyboard  of . Device  further includes communication interface  that can be implemented as any one or more of a wireless interface, any type of network interface, and as any other type of communication interface. A network interface provides a connection between device  and a communication network by which other electronic and computing devices can communicate data with device . A wireless interface enables device  to operate as a mobile device for wireless communications.","Device  also includes one or more processors  (e.g., any of microprocessors, controllers, and the like) which process various computer-executable instructions to control the operation of device  and to communicate with other electronic devices. Device  can be implemented with computer-readable media , such as one or more memory components, examples of which include random access memory (RAM) and non-volatile memory (e.g., any one or more of a read-only memory (ROM), flash memory, EPROM, EEPROM, etc.).","Computer-readable media  provides data storage to store content and data , as well as device applications and any other types of information and\/or data related to operational aspects of device . For example, an operating system  can be maintained as a computer application with the computer-readable media  and executed on processor . Device applications can also include a communication manager module  (which may be used to provide telephonic functionality) and a media manager .","Device  also includes an audio and\/or video output  that provides audio and\/or video data to an audio rendering and\/or display system . The audio rendering and\/or display system  can be implemented as integrated component(s) of the example device , and can include any components that process, display, and\/or otherwise render audio, video, and image data. Device  can also be implemented to provide a user tactile feedback, such as vibrate and haptics.","Generally, the blocks may be representative of modules that are configured to provide represented functionality.
