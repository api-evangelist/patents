{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/760,007, filed Jan. 18, 2006 and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/846,965 filed Sep. 25, 2006.","The present invention relates to cannabinoid receptor modulators, particularly, antagonists or inverse agonists of the CBreceptor, useful for the treatment of obesity, metabolic disorders, addiction, diseases of the central nervous system, cardiovascular disorders, respiratory disorders, and gastrointestinal disorders, pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds, and methods of treatment using the compounds and compositions to treat conditions such as obesity, metabolic disorders, addiction, diseases of the central nervous system, cardiovascular disorders, respiratory disorders, and gastrointestinal disorders.","The CBreceptor is one of the most abundant neuromodulatory receptors in the brain, and is expressed at high levels in the hippocampus, cortex, cerebellum, and basal ganglia (e.g., Wilson et al., 2002, vol. 296, 678-682). Selective CBreceptor antagonists, for example pyrazole derivatives such as rimonabant (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,432,984), can be used to treat various conditions, such as obesity and metabolic syndrome (e.g., Bensaid et al., 2003 vol. 63, no. 4, pp. 908-914; Trillou et al., 2002 vol. 284, R345-R353; Kirkham, 2002 vol. 284, R343-R344), neuroinflammatory disorders (e.g., Adam, et al., 2002, vol. 12, no. 10, 1475-1489; U.S. Pat. No. 6,642,258), cognitive disorders and psychosis (e.g., Adam et al., 2002, vol. 12, pp. 1475-1489), addiction (e.g., smoking cessation; U.S. Patent Publ. 2003\/0087933), gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., Lange et al., 2004, vol. 47, 627-643) and cardiovascular conditions (e.g., Porter et al., 2001 vol. 90, 45-60; Sanofi-Aventis Publication, Bear Steams Conference, New York, Sep. 14, 2004, pages 19-24).","However, there is still a need for improved cannabinoid agents, particularly cannabinoid receptor modulators (e.g., antagonists or inverse agonists of the CBreceptor) with fewer side-effects and improved efficacy. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide fused bicyclic and spirocyclic cannabinoid receptor modulators useful in the treatment of diseases or conditions mediated by cannabinoid receptors.","In one embodiment, the present invention is directed to a compound of Formula (I):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0006"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"16.34mm","wi":"52.83mm","file":"US07897601-20110301-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["m is 0 or 1, n is 1 or 2, and m+n is 1 or 2;","the dashed lines  in Formula (I) represent single or double bonds as permitted by valence requirements;","Ris selected from the group consisting of \u2014C(O)\u2014N(R), \u2014C(O)\u2014O-alkyl, and \u2014C(O)\u2014R;","Ris selected from the group consisting of H, unsubstituted alkyl, alkyl substituted with one or more U groups, and -alkylene-N(R);","or Rand Rtogether with the carbon atoms to which they are shown attached in Formula (I) form a group Q as shown in Formula (IA):"]}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0012"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"16.51mm","wi":"54.19mm","file":"US07897601-20110301-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0013"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"226.82mm","wi":"51.56mm","file":"US07897601-20110301-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["Yis \u2014O\u2014 or \u2014N(R)\u2014;","Yis \u2014O\u2014 or \u2014N(R)\u2014;","R, R, R, and Rare each independently selected from the group consisting of H, \u2014O\u2014R, R, and \u2014N(R);","Ris selected from the group consisting of H, alkyl, arylalkyl, alkenyl, -alkylene-N(R), -alkylene-O\u2014R, -alkylene-R, \u2014C(O)\u2014R, -alkylene-C(O)H, \u2014C(O)\u2014O\u2014R, and Boc;","Ris selected from the group consisting of H, -alkylene-R, \u2014C(O)\u2014R, \u2014S(O)\u2014R, \u2014S(O)\u2014R, \u2014C(O)\u2014N(R), R, and Boc;","with the proviso wherein the group \u2014N(R), both Rgroups taken together with the N atom to which they are bonded form an unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl substituted with one or more Xgroups, or said substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl group is fused with aryl, heteroaryl, cycloalkyl or heterocycloalkyl;","Ris selected from the group consisting of H, TBS, TIPS, Tf and R;","each Ris independently selected from the group consisting of H, unsubstituted alkyl, alkyl substituted with one or more U groups, -alkylene-R, -alkylene-R, -alkylene-R, \u2014C(O)\u2014R, -alkylene-O\u2014R, R, unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl substituted with one or more Xgroups, and benzo-fused cycloalkyl;","Ris selected from the group consisting of unsubstituted alkyl, alkyl substituted with one or more U groups, -alkylene-O-alkyl, -alkylene-O-aryl, unsubstituted aryl, and aryl substituted with one or more Xgroups;","Ris selected from the group consisting of unsubstituted aryl and aryl substituted with one or more Xgroups;","Ris selected from the group consisting of unsubstituted heteroaryl and heteroaryl substituted with one or more Xgroups;","Ris selected from the group consisting of unsubstituted cycloalkyl, cycloalkyl substituted with one or more Xgroups unsubstituted alkyl, and alkyl substituted with one or more U groups;","each Ris independently selected from the group consisting of H, \u2014N, halogen, alkenyl, -alkylene-R, -alkylene-O\u2014R, -alkylene-N(R), -alkylene-C(O)H, \u2014OH, \u2014CN, \u2014O-alkyl, \u2014C(O)N(R), \u2014N(R), \u2014NRC(O)R, \u2014NRC(O)R, \u2014NRC(O)N(R), \u2014NRS(O)R, \u2014O-alkenyl, \u2014C(O)R;

When IIIis subjected to the Diels-Alder reaction it gives the cyclization product IV. The yield and selectivity of the products in this step can depend on a variety of reaction conditions such as the solvent used, the temperature employed for the cyclization, the additives used in the reaction medium such as Lewis acids etc. Following the Diels-Alder reaction an Rgroup can be introduced and the double bond reduced to provide Vwhich can be subjected to the deprotection conditions to cleave the protecting group to give VI.

Non-specific binding was defined in the presence of 10 \u03bcM CP55,940. For saturation studies, concentrations of H-CP55,940 ranging from 0.1-5 nM were incubated with membranes in the presence and absence of 10 \u03bcM CP55,940. Assays were terminated after incubation for 1\u00bd hours by rapid filtration onto 0.3% polyethylenamine treated GF\/C filterplates using a BRANDEL cell harvester. The plates were dried and MICROSCINT scintillation cocktail was added, after which the bound radioactivity was quantified using a TOPCOUNT scintillation counter.","The dissociation constant (K) of H-CP55,940 at the CBand CBreceptor were determined by plotting specific binding at each concentration of radioligand, and analysis by non-linear regression. For competition studies, the concentration of each drug that inhibited 50 percent of H-CP55,940 binding (IC) was determined by non-linear regression analysis of the radioligand displacement curves. Affinity constants (K) were calculated using the equation derived by Cheng and Prusoff (1973), defined as: IC\/1+[conc. ligand\/K].","GTP\u03b3S Binding Protocol","The functional efficacy of compounds to activate second messengers within the cell was determined utilizing the GTP\u03b3S binding assay. Guanine nucleotides are phosphorylated within the plasma membrane of the cell following binding and activation by agonists. A radiolabelled derivative of guanine triphosphate (GTP) is utilized in this assay as it cannot be dephosphorylated and therefore accumulates following agonist binding. The simultaneous presence of an antagonist into this system will shift the agonist concentration curve to the right, with increasing concentrations of antagonist producing a greater rightward shift in the dose-response curve of the agonist.","Commercially purchased membranes were incubated with 10 mM GDP to allow sufficient substrate for phosphorylation in the presence of agonist. The membranes were then pre-incubated with increasing concentrations of test compound for 30 minutes to determine if they were capable of stimulating phosphorylation alone. Increasing concentrations of the non-selective cannabinoid agonist WIN55,122 were then added in the presence or absence of each concentration of test compound. The assay was then incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. To complete the assay, S-GTP\u03b3S was added and the assay incubated for another 30 minutes. Assays were terminated by rapid filtration onto 10 mM sodium phosphate-treated GF\/C filterplates using a BRANDEL cell harvester. The plates were dried and Microscint scintillation cocktail was added, after which the bound radioactivity was quantified using a TOPCOUNT scintillation counter.","The stimulation of S-GTP\u03b3S binding as a function of the concentration of the agonist WIN55,122, in the absence and presence of test compound, was plotted and the ECdetermined by nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism software. A Schild analysis of the rightward shift in the dose response curve of WIN55,122 in the presence of test compound was determined by plotting the concentration of test compound against the negative log of the dose ratio [1-(ECagonist+test compound\/EC50 of agonist alone)]. A linear regression analysis yields the Kb, defined as the X-intercept of the linear equation.","Preferred compounds of Formula I of the present invention, and salts, solvates, or esters thereof, have Kvalues of about 200 nM or less.
