{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION","CATALOG OF PARTS"],"p":["The present invention generally relates to traffic control barriers, and more specifically to an improved self-contained automatic pop-up bollard system.","Traffic control devices are well known. There are numerous examples in the prior art of various devices to control or limit traffic access to restricted areas. Recent terrorist attacks have presented numerous problems for controlling traffic access to highly secured areas. Local, state and federal governments have elevated concerns for securing areas from the threats of terrorists. The military has elevated concerns for securing military bases as well.","Terrorist attacks on embassies, and other sites of foreign governments or corporations have become commonplace. Some of the more notorious attacks have involved terrorists driving large trucks laden with explosives through the gates of an embassy or other secured sites and detonating the explosives. In response to these attacks, many such sites have installed a variety of barriers in front of their gates. However, the barriers installed at these installations also obstruct the passage of authorized vehicles.","Examples of some pertinent prior art patents are listed and discussed below:","U.S. Pat. No. 4,624,600, issued on Nov. 25, 1986 to R. H. Wagner, et al, and entitled ANTI-TERRORIST VEHICLE IMPALER. This patent discloses a barrier device disposed in a trench in a roadway with an impaler arm that pivots into an oncoming vehicle when released by an explosive charge. The impaler arm is secured in place by a trigger that releases by the explosive charge, and a counter weight on the opposite end of the impaler arm. The counterweight is of sufficient mass so that the pivoting impaler arm turns about the pivot under the force of gravity, thereby thrusting the impaler arm above the surface of the roadway. The impaler arm projects at an angle toward a vehicle to be stopped, which is impaled by the arms.","U.S. Pat. No. 4,705,426, issued on Nov. 10, 1987 to B. A. Perea entitled SECURITY AND DEFENSE BARRIER discloses a vault buried within and transverse to the roadway. The vault has within a latched plurality of barrier arms that may be raised by any powered means, or manually, and raised barrier arms are positioned within the vault so that impact forces are transmitted directly to the vault and to a foundation, and little or no load is supported by a pivoting mechanism. The raised barrier arms have a hook on the end so that the speeding vehicle attacking the barrier will be snagged and prevented from inadvertently or intentionally vaulting the barrier.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,248,215 issued, Sep. 28, 1993, to M. Fladung entitled ROAD BARRICADE. This patent discloses a car park barricade that is fastened to the road surface with a barricade element optionally positioned parallel to the road surface or in a position at an angle thereto. The barricade element is swiveled upwards about an axis parallel to the road surface and vertical to the blocking direction by means of a drive mechanism comprising a spindle element.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,702,512 B1, issued Mar. 9, 2004 to G. S. Reale entitled VEHICLE ARRESTING INSTALLATION. This patent discloses a barrier for blocking the passage of a vehicle wherein the barrier has a bollard post positioned to obstruct a vehicle path. The post is coupled to piercing bars or pikes that are normally kept in a compact stand-by state in a recessed housing bordering the vehicle path. The bars deploy pivotally when the vehicle strikes and pivots back the post. The bars or pikes impale the body of the vehicle and break away in an assembly together with the barrier post, to interfere with continued or powered driving of the vehicle.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,997,638 B2, issued Feb. 14, 2006 to C. J. Hensley, et al entitled ANTI-TERRORIST ROAD BLOCK. This patent discloses a road block having an extendible bollard that is manually or electronically actuated by a powerful spring force for slow extension, and by both the spring and a power lift for rapid expansion.","U.S. Pat. No. 7,118,304 B2, issued Oct. 10, 2006 to R. R. Turpin and Joey W. Blair (the inventor hereof) entitled AUTOMATIC SELF CONTAINED COLLAPSIBLE TRAFFIC BARRIER BOLLARD SYSTEM. This patent discloses a collapsible traffic barrier located in a steel vault. A rod is rotatably mounted to support members inside the vault, wherein the rod extends across the vault from end to end. A plurality of bollards are secured to the rod near the first end thereof, whereby rotation of the rod rotates the bollards upward at an angle above the roadway and into the direction of an oncoming vehicle.","U.S. Pat. No. 7,641,416 B2, issued Jan. 5, 2010 to G. D. Miracle entitled VEHICLE BARRIER DEPLOYMENT SYSTEM. This patent discloses a system having at least two lifting members, at least one barrier member, and an actuation assembly. The lifting members are pivotally secured to a base member, and are operable to be selectively raised and lowered in a vertical direction relative to the base member. The barrier member is in communication with the lifting members, and is configured to stop a moving vehicle when the lifting members are in a raised position. The actuation assembly is in communication with lifting members, and is operable to selectively raise and lower the lifting members by moving at least a portion of each of the lifting members in a direction transverse to the traffic lane.","All of the prior art devices suffer from one or more disadvantages that are overcome by the system and structure of the present invention disclosed hereinbelow. Most of the prior art devices discussed above will only stop vehicles going in one direction, unlike the system of the present invention. As a result of the structure of the present invention vehicles may be stopped in multi directions, especially both directions in a single roadway. Moreover, many of the prior art devices require a lubricant or hydraulic fluid to operate, which creates environmental problems.","The present invention is a pop-up bollard barrier system that is to be used for restricting physical access to high security areas wherein the highest level of protection is required. The system must be capable of stopping a 15,000 pound vehicle traveling at 50 mph. Vehicle barriers of this type are currently being used in areas around the world, but they are typically incapable of mechanically functioning reliably during an extended period of time. Other systems of this type are known for their complexity and are expensive to maintain, plus they are very expensive to install.","The present invention eliminates the need for high maintenance costs, high installation costs, and mitigates environmental issues related to lubricants and hydraulic oils typically used in such devices. Moreover, the present invention provides an inexpensive way to build and operate such a pop-up bollard barrier system.","Referring now to the drawings and to  in particular, a perspective view of the system  of the present invention illustrates at least three bollards ,  and  in a partially raised position. The system  includes a bollard assembly , which will be illustrated in , B and C and amplified further hereinafter; and, a vault  for receiving the bollard assembly , which will be illustrated in  and also amplified further hereinafter. In accordance with one embodiment, the bollards are formed of three 12\u2033\u00d712\u2033\u00d7\u00bd\u2033 steel tubes and upon activation they rise and extend from within the bollard assembly  secured within the vault  that is buried in the ground, and then project \u2033 vertically into the roadway  of vehicles when access is not approved. The vault  is surrounded by concrete reinforced to 3000 PSI and merges with the roadway . Each of the bollards , , , has affixed thereto a reflector A, A and A, respectively. The bollard assembly  is covered by a series of removable steel plates  through .","With reference now to  the first of a series of partially cut-away elevational views of the bollard assembly  is shown to include the bollards ,  and  in a sequence of movements from a fully recessed position () to a partially elevated position () to a fully deployed position (). Again with reference to , the bollard  is removed in order to show bollard post , which acts as a guide for the bollard  to rise and fall. Bollard guide post  comprises two pieces of channel steel A and B, which is illustrated in greater detail in  and discussed hereinbelow. Strips  are made of a material known in the industry as Delrin (which is an engineered thermoplastic product available from DuPont Corporation) and the strips are attached to and spaced about the sides of the post . These strips provide a smooth surface for the bollards to glide over with a minimum of friction since the Delrin thermoplastic has a very low coefficient of friction. Accordingly, no lubricant is required between the guide posts  and the individual bollards ,  and .","The bollard assembly  is operated with a single drive mechanism in the form of an electromechanical actuator  that powers the three bollards to the up and down position simultaneously. In accordance with one embodiment, one end of the actuator  is coupled to a pivot arm  and the other end thereof is coupled to frame  of the assembly . The pivot arm  is coupled to a single fulcrum  through a common shaft . The belt  (which actually comprises several belts operating in parallel) is connected to an end of the fulcrum opposite the common shaft , and a series of ratchets , which are coupled to the ends of the belts  at the end of the fulcrum , are used to tighten the belts. The ratchets  are standard off-the-shelf components and will not be amplified further herein. The belts  are guided around a series of pulleys  and A in order to raise each individual bollard , , . The actuator  operates the fulcrum  with the assistance of a group of springs  attached between the frame  and a pivot arm  coupled to the common central shaft . The pivot arm  in one embodiment is actually an extension of the pivot arm . That is, they comprise opposite ends of a single member pivoting about the central shaft .","The springs  may comprise any group of springs necessary to assist the lifting capability of the electromechanical actuator . The fulcrum design takes into consideration the need for the electromechanical actuator  to operate as a single drive for the three individual bollards , , and , and with the assistance of the spring system . The spring system  is designed to assist from the down position to the full up position of the bollards. The actuator  and the spring system  are connected to the structure using pins and devises  and , respectively, thereby allowing for free movement of motion required to deploy the bollards. In one embodiment, the actuator  has a 12\u2033 stroke, or extension, but is capable of moving the bollards to full deployment (\u2033) based on the length of the pivot arm .","The actuator  is operated from a source of 208 single phase alternating current (AC), when activated by a signal to the AC source. Alternatively, there is a back-up battery BB if the source of AC should fail. One terminal of the battery BB is coupled to the actuator  and the other terminal is connected to the frame . Circuitry for operation of the actuator  is conventional in nature and will not be amplified further herein.","The bollard assembly is different from others on the market in that square tubing is employed, which offers a much more robust product with higher structural capabilities requiring less material. The use of this product allows for more safety signage (such as reflectors A, A and A) as well as less demand on the steel industry, thereby adding a savings not only to the \u201cGREEN\u201d concept but to cost savings for the end user as well. The bollard works over a double channel guide post  that will allow the bollard to slide up and down providing support and guidance for deployment. The Delrin product  acts as a slide attached to the guide post  to allow for smooth and controlled deployment of the bollards. This offers a stable position of the bollard while being deployed without the requirement of maintenance for metal products that would normally abrade and wear due to friction.","In accordance with one embodiment, two pieces of 3\u2033\u00d73\u2033\u00d7\u00bd\u2033 angle iron form a collar  that are fastened to two sides of the bottom of the bollards with four \u00be\u2033\u00d74\u2033 bolts  (not shown in this FIG., but illustrated in greater detail in ). The belt  runs around the pulley  then up through the tower  to another pulley A at the top of the tower and back down to a loop  on one end of the belt, which attaches to a 1 \u00bd\u2033 pin . The pin  extends through the middle of the bollards , , and  at the bottom thereof. Each bollard is individually connected to the fulcrum  by the use of a loop in the belt , attached to the 1\u00bd\u2033 pin , then through a pulley configuration (, A) to the ratchet  used for final adjustment for the tension of the belt . This arrangement is illustrated in , and amplified further hereinafter.","The collar  acts as a stop for the bollard post on impact with a vehicle and for security of maintaining the bollard in position at all times. The bollard rests on the collar , which acts as a leveling stop for the final up position of the bollards , , . Upon impact of the barrier system, if a bollard is damaged, it can simply be unbolted, whereupon maintenance personnel can remove the bollard pin  and then remove the bollard itself for replacement. The lifting belt can then be reconnected to the 1\u00bd\u2033 pin , thereby allowing the product to be quickly put back into operation after a crash. The collar  along with the bolts  and the 1\u00bd\u2033 pin  on each side of the bollard prevents the bollard post from being removed by vandals as well as prevents the bollard from being pulled apart from the barrier system upon impact by an errant vehicle.","The bollard assembly  of the present invention employs connection joints encased in an engineered thermoplastic product similar to Delrin, which is available from DuPont Corporation. Use of this product for the connection joints eliminates the need for lubrication of the moving parts, which would normally wear and require lubrication. This addition helps improve the \u201cGREEN\u201d concept thereby eliminating yet another possibility for an environmental issue.","In accordance with one embodiment, a belt drive was used to allow for a \u201cno\u201d maintenance, flexible, quiet and long lasting system. Cables, chains and other products were considered but the belts  turned out to be the most practical for this application. In accordance with one embodiment, the belts  are made of Dyneema, which is an ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene. The belts  are \u215b\u2033 thick and 1\u2033 wide and have a tensile strength of approximately 7,000 pounds. The lifting requirement is calculated to be 350 pounds thereby allowing for a huge safety margin. The 4 inch pulleys , A for the belt application are a manufactured product that is made for up to 1\u00bc\u2033 wide belt with a brass bushing, and steel with powder coat paint.","As stated hereinabove, the present invention is built in two components, the bollard assembly , and a vault  buried in the roadway . With reference to , a cut-away view illustrates the end of the bollard assembly  inside the vault , with bollard  in a partially raised position. The bollard assembly  is made to lock into the vault  by means of pins  secured into 6\u2033\u00d712\u2033\u00d71\u2033 double steel extension clamps  anchored in the concrete and attached to the walls of the vault . The clamps  are also welded to a No. 5 re-bar cage  that extends nine inches from the sidewalls and six inches from the bottom of the vault . In accordance with one embodiment, the vault  is sized to be 10\u2032\u00d73\u2032\u00d754\u2033 and is constructed of \u00bc\u2033 plate steel on the sides with a 1\u00bd\u2033 plate steel on the bottom. The vault  is reinforced with 3\u2033\u00d73\u2033\u00d7\u00bc\u2033 angle iron , which acts as an added keyway to lock the vault  into the concrete. The re-bar cage  is separated on 12\u2033 centers and encases the vault on both sides and extends 6\u2033 on each end and extending to within 6\u2033 from the compacted soil on the bottom. The re-bar cage  will serve to tie the 18\u2033\u00d754\u2033 concrete foundation on both sides and the 12\u2033\u00d754\u2033 concrete foundation to the extension arms that are pinned to the bollard assembly , thereby anchoring the entire vault  and bollard assembly  together to absorb and hold the impact of a crash of 1,250,000 pounds of Kinetic energy resulting from the 50 mph crash.","Again with reference to , the shoulder  is made of 1\u2033\u00d712\u2033\u00d736\u2033 steel that runs astride the entire bollard assembly  and to the walls on either side of the vault . The shoulder  includes 1\u00bd\u2033 openings in each end for receipt of the pin  that secures the bollard assembly  into the vault at the clamps . With reference now to , a top view of an end of the bollard assembly  secured within the vault  is shown. Cross-brace members  are welded between the shoulders  in order to completely surround each of the bollards, and in particular bollard  in . Corner braces  are welded in each of four corners formed by the intersection of the shoulders  and the cross-brace members . This adds rigidity to the surrounds for the bollards ,  and .","Referring now to , an isometric view of a detail of the belt  clasped to the pin  via a loop , which pin is secured to the bottom of the bollard . The collar  is shown attached to either side of the bollard , at the bottom thereof, by means of bolts  and nuts . As stated hereinabove, the collars act both as a stop for the bollard's upward travel, but also prevents removal of the bollard by vandals or the like. It may also be appreciated that removal of the collars  can be accomplished by removal of the nuts  and the bolts . The pin  may be slipped through the loop  in the belt  and through the vias on either side of the bottom of the bollard .","Referring now to  an isometric view of a detail of the top of a bollard post A, B showing the pulley for the belt . The Delrin strips  are shown spread about the sides of the bollard post A, B, which form a smooth surface for the bollard post  to slide up and down upon. It is pointed out that the bollard  (shown in ) slides over the bollard post . A pair of steel plates  and  is welded between the tops of the bollard posts A and B for support thereof and for supporting the pulley A by means of a pin .","The present invention employs a two-part system with the vault  and the bollard assembly  as an insert, which will dramatically ease the production and maintenance of the system once installed. The system  incorporates a mechanism to operate multiple bollard posts simultaneously with one motor, thereby dramatically lowering the cost of the system and maintenance thereof once installed. The design of the system  allows one to remove the bollard assembly  from the vault , which is secured in a permanent foundation, and still have the ability to reattach the bollard assembly  or a replacement assembly. All of this includes the ability to stop a 15,000 pound truck traveling at 50 mph, creating 1,250,000 pounds of kinetic energy. Upon impact, a maintenance crew will have the ability to simply remove and replace only the damaged bollard if required, while leaving the vault and bollard assembly  in a condition that would allow for continued use after minor repairs are made, if necessary.","While various embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described herein, it will be obvious that such embodiments are provided by way of example only. Numerous variations, changes and substitutions may be made without departing from the invention herein. Accordingly, it is intended that the invention be limited only by the spirit and scope of the appended claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["AC Source of alternating current","BB Backup Battery",{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0003","num":"0042"},"b":"10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0004","num":"0043"},"b":"11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0005","num":"0044"},"b":["12","14","16"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0006","num":"0045"},"b":["12","14","16"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0007","num":"0046"},"b":"17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0008","num":"0047"},"b":["18","25","10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0009","num":"0048"},"b":"26"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0010","num":"0049"},"b":["26","26"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0011","num":"0050"},"b":["27","36"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0012","num":"0051"},"b":["28","26"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0013","num":"0052"},"b":"29"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0014","num":"0053"},"b":"30"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0015","num":"0054"},"b":["31","29"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0016","num":"0055"},"b":["32","30"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0017","num":"0056"},"b":["33","32","31"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0018","num":"0057"},"b":["34","30"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0019","num":"0058"},"b":["35","10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0020","num":"0059"},"b":["36","29"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0021","num":"0060"},"b":["37","29"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0022","num":"0061"},"b":["38","38","30"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0023","num":"0062"},"b":["39","36"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0024","num":"0063"},"b":"40"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0025","num":"0064"},"b":["41","10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0026","num":"0065"},"b":"42"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0027","num":"0066"},"b":["44","17","10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0028","num":"0067"},"b":["45","10","44"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0029","num":"0068"},"b":["46","10","44"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0030","num":"0069"},"b":["47","44"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0031","num":"0070"},"b":"48"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0032","num":"0071"},"b":["49","30","42"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0033","num":"0072"},"b":"50"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0034","num":"0073"},"b":["51","40"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0035","num":"0074"},"b":["52","51"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0036","num":"0075"},"b":["56","38"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0037","num":"0076"},"b":["57","38"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0038","num":"0077"},"b":["60","38"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0039","num":"0078"},"b":["61","44"]}]}}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The invention is explained in the following description in view of the drawings that show:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 2A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 2B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 2C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
