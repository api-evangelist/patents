Discreetness is a desirable characteristic of an absorbent article to an adult, and part of that discreetness includes the elimination of malodors from the used article. Reduction of the longer-term malodors emanating from the vicinity of the area of disposal of the soiled articles, either in the home or in the institution, is also needed.","It is known that several gases contribute to the malodor resulting from the breakdown of human exudates, such as urine, feces or menses. Of these gases, ammonia is considered to be one of the most potent and recognizable odors associated with aged human exudates, although there are other gases including those of organic acids and sulfur-containing compounds that contribute to malodor. Many prior efforts to diminish malodor from used absorbent articles have focused on reducing ammonia. Ammonia is widely believed to contribute to diaper dermatitis, also known as diaper rash.","Ammonia is produced by the breakdown of urea from urine. Certain bacteria, in the presence of the enzyme urease, digest the urea and produce carbon dioxide and ammonia. But as the bacteria reproduce, more urea is digested, and the malodor (ammonia production) increases with time. It takes hours for ammonia to be produced in significant quantities according to this degradation process. Other odors emanating from urine or waste may be detectable immediately or after short times.","There have been numerous attempts to prevent malodor from used diapers. One category of such attempts involves masking. With masking, another more pleasant odor, such as a perfume, is introduced in such quantities as to overpower the malodor. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,769,832. Such methods do not reduce ammonia production, so even if effective masking occurs, the unhealthful inhalation of ammonia gas would continue, and the harmful impact on skin would not be diminished.","Other techniques to reduce odor involve adsorption or absorption. For example, superabsorbent polymer, molecular sieves, activated charcoal, and silica have been used as odor control agents. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,376,741 B1. Malodor can also be reduced by eliminating or delaying ammonia production. Included in such methods are agents which act as urease inhibitors, such as sodium tetraborate pentahydrate (U.S. Pat. No. 6,342,653). Methods involving the use of weak acids such as citric acid to lower the pH of the absorbents in the diaper have also been tried. A more acidic pH is known to retard the degradation rate of urea. In addition, sodium bicarbonate has been used to inhibit odors from malodorous organic acids (U.S. Pat. No. 5,037,412). Other methods to reduce ammonia production use antimicrobial agents against bacteria, some in conjunction with lower pH (Baker, 2001). Certain quaternary ammonium compounds are examples of such antimicrobials, which have been used to counter ammonia production from urine (U.S. Pat. No. 4,842,593).","Other publications describing treatment of bodily malodors include U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,369,290 B1; 5,733,272; 5,429,628; 6,229,062 B1; 5,591,146; 5,103,500; 5,079,004; 4,059,114; 3,920,020; and 3,691,271; and US Statutory Invention Registration H1,732.","All of the above-described attempts to reduce malodor have demonstrated limited efficacy or have raised other health or environmental issues or concerns. Hence, there is a need for treatments for absorbent articles such as diapers that allow the articles to be effective in reducing the malodor of bodily fluids exposed thereto, and which are safe to wear and are not unhealthy to the general public. Ideally, the treatment removes odors from the soiled article quickly and should also reduce the odors created over longer periods of time, such as that of ammonia.","Accordingly, the inventor has identified a class of quaternary ammonium compounds that are effective in reducing a malodor of bodily fluids. These compounds are useful in absorbent articles, including diapers.","Thus, in some embodiments, the invention is directed to absorbent articles for retaining a malodorous bodily fluid. The absorbent articles comprise an additive in an amount effective to reduce the malodor of the bodily fluid. In these embodiments, the additive is a quaternary ammonium salt that is water soluble at 37\u00b0 C., comprises an alkyl C-Cchain, and contains at least two oxygen atoms in the anionic portion of the salt.","In other embodiments, the invention is directed to methods of making an absorbent disposable article. The methods comprise combining a liquid pervious topsheet, a liquid impervious backsheet, an absorbent core, and an additive present in an amount effective to reduce a malodor of a bodily fluid, such that the article may be worn by a human in a manner allowing the article to absorb and retain a bodily fluid. The additive in these embodiments is a quaternary ammonium salt that is water soluble at 37\u00b0 C., comprises a C-Cchain, and contains at least two oxygen atoms in the anionic portion of the salt.","The present invention is also directed to additional methods of making an absorbent disposable article. The methods comprise obtaining an absorbent core comprising an additive, and combining a liquid pervious topsheet, a liquid impervious backsheet, and the absorbent core such that the article may be worn by a human in a manner allowing the article to absorb and retain a bodily fluid. As in embodiments described above, the additive is a quaternary ammonium salt that is water soluble at 37\u00b0 C., comprises a C-Cchain, and contains at least two oxygen atoms in the anionic portion of the salt.","The invention is additionally directed to methods of preparing an absorbent article. The methods comprise treating the absorbent article with an additive in an amount effective to reduce the malodor of a bodily fluid later absorbed by the absorbent article. As in embodiments described above, the additive is a quaternary ammonium salt that is water soluble at 37\u00b0 C., comprises a C-Cchain, and contains at least two oxygen atoms in the anionic portion of the salt.","The inventor has discovered that various quaternary ammonium compounds are effective in reducing various malodors from bodily fluids when incorporated into an absorbent article. The compounds are quaternary ammonium salts that are water soluble at 37\u00b0 C., comprise an alkyl C-Cchain, and contain at least two oxygen atoms in the anionic portion of the salt. Without being bound by any specific mechanism, it is believed that these compounds are unexpectedly effective in binding to compounds that contribute to the malodor, for example ammonia.","Thus, in some embodiments, the invention is directed to absorbent articles for retaining a malodorous bodily fluid. The absorbent articles comprise an additive in an amount effective to reduce the malodor of the bodily fluid. The additive is a quaternary ammonium salt that is water soluble at 37\u00b0 C., comprises an alkyl C-Cchain, and contains at least two oxygen atoms in the anionic portion of the salt. Absorbent articles comprising the additive exhibit a consistent reduction in the concentration of ammonia and other malodorous materials from a used absorbent article, when compared to articles without the additive. Furthermore, articles of the invention achieve these odor reduction characteristics without using an excessive, uneconomical quantity of the additive. Additionally, several compounds that meet the criteria of the additives are commercially available. Finally, the treated article reduces malodor immediately and for an enduring period of time.","In preferred embodiments, the additive has Formula I",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"14.14mm","wi":"56.47mm","file":"US07834233-20101116-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sub":["1","21 ","16","21 ","3","2 ","16","21 ","16 ","18 ","3"]},"In even more preferred embodiments, the additive has Formula II",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"22.27mm","wi":"59.27mm","file":"US07834233-20101116-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sub":["16 ","18 "]},"In the most preferred embodiments, the additive has one of the following formulas:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"49.61mm","wi":"45.47mm","file":"US07834233-20101116-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sub":["16","21 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"50.46mm","wi":"42.33mm","file":"US07834233-20101116-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sub":["16 ","18 "]},"The quantity of the active agent in an absorbent article of the invention may range from 0.001-10 wt. % of the absorbent material.

SAPs generally are 25% to 90% neutralized, with the more commonly used SAP materials being about 65% to 80% neutralized. SAPs having this level of neutralization tend to have a pH value of about 6.0. For neutralization less than about 65%, the SAP may bear a lower pH. A desirable pH for low pH SAP is 5.0-5.5.

Two examples of these tests are as follows. In the first, the concentration of ammonia is measured over time from treated and untreated absorbent compositions containing a urine specimen. In the second test, the level of malodor is judged subjectively between untreated and treated absorbent articles at specific times after they have been soiled. Details of the test procedures are outlined below.","The following is a detailed description of the test method to measure ammonia concentrations. A series of absorbent structures are prepared according to the following. The base absorbent structure is fluff pulp or a combination of fluff and SAP. Then, for example, an aqueous solution is prepared containing a known quantity of a potential treatment for ammonia malodor. An equal quantity of the solution is sprayed onto all but one of the series of absorbent structures. The spraying is applied as uniformly as possible. One absorbent structure is sprayed with an equal volume of water and is the control. All absorbent structures are left out several hours to dry. Each of the absorbent structures is then transferred to Nalgene\u00ae Brand 125-ml, narrow-mouth polycarbonate Erlenmeyer flasks. A similar protocol occurs if the treatment is in the form of a solid. Instead of spraying the solid onto the absorbent substrate, the solid is simply manually mixed as uniformly as possible into the absorbent structure.","Straughan\u00ae Gastec\u00ae ammonia gas dosimeter tubes, grade 3D, are broken off and thereby opened at one end. The declared detection range of the 3D tubes is 25-500 ppm-hr. The open ends of the tubes are forced through the holes in No. 5 one-hole black-rubber stoppers. The tubes are forced through the stoppers to a depth where the entire measuring range of the tubes is visible through the flask. Donors collect a suitable quantity of fresh urine specimen in disposable collection cups marked with volume indications. The specimen is then poured into additional marked cups, one for each flask prepared, and divided into equal volumes. The specimen from each cup is then poured slowly into the open mouth of each flask. The flasks are then sealed tightly with the stoppers, with the open end of the ammonia dosimeter tubes inside the flasks. The date and time are then written on a small label on the flasks.","The flasks are then placed into a water bath set at 37\u00b0 C. The ammonia dosimeter tubes are checked at discrete time intervals to determine the extent of color change in the reactant within each tube. The original color of the reactant is purple, but in the presence of ammonia, the color changes to yellow. Based on discrete markings on the detector tube, the time-weighted average concentration of ammonia measured in parts per million-hour are read from the scale and recorded. Conversion to a time-weighted average concentration in parts per million requires division by the number of hours the sample has been in the water bath. Readings of ammonia concentrations are read up to 72 hours time or less if any of the concentrations exceed the maximum limit of the detection tube's range.","Using the test method above, additives that are within the scope of the invention will outperform the control and are also expected to maintain a time-weighted average concentration of about 2 ppm or less of ammonia at all times during the experiment. The human detection threshold for odor from ammonia gas varies per individual, ranging from 0.6-50 ppm (Smith et al., 1999), with most people not able to detect ammonia presence at about 2 ppm or less. Hence, we set the limit for efficacy of a treatment of the invention for the time-weighted average concentration of ammonia at about 2 ppm or lower.","The test method for olfactory perception is as follows. An absorbent article is prepared containing an effective amount of the treatment. An identical article, without treatment, is also taken. The articles are labeled with codes unknown to the tester so that the test is done blindly. The tester then donates a suitable quantity of fresh urine specimen in a disposable collection cup marked with volume indications. The specimen is poured into another such cup so that the two cups contain equal volumes of urine. The urine from each cup is poured onto each absorbent article, with the location of the pouring at a position within the target zone of the article. The tester smells the articles immediately and evaluates the odor. Next, the articles are enclosed into plastic Zip-Lock bags. The bags are placed in a convection oven set at 37\u00b0 C. and incubated for 24 hours. The testers are then asked to open the bags and evaluate the odor. For the treatment to be considered effective, the articles treated with materials within the scope of the invention must be overwhelmingly preferred by the testers.","Preferred embodiments of the invention are described in the following Examples. Other embodiments within the scope of the claims herein will be apparent to one skilled in the art from consideration of the specification or practice of the invention as disclosed herein.
