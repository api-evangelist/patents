The resulting product is administered locally into soft tissues by sub-cutaneous or intra-muscular injection where it will locally sustain release the drug.","This invention relates generally to providing novel blend of end-capped and uncapped providing novel biocompatible and biodegradable PLGA microspheres for burst-free programmable sustained release of hydrophobic biologically active agents which degrade over a period of up to 100 days in an aqueous physiological environment. The active agents contemplated within the scope of this invention includes the delivery of poly-peptide antibiotics, antimalarials, antituberculosis drugs, anesthetics, analgesics, anticancer agents, antiparasitic agents, antibacterial agents, antifungal agents, antiinflammatory agents, immunosuppressive agents, immunostimulatory agents, dentinal desensitizers, odor masking agents, nutritional agents, antioxidants, and insulins.","The invention also relates especially to providing novel pharmaceutical compositions for sustained release of compounds for treating cancer, inflammatory and\/or autoimmune disorders from PLGA microspheres.","This invention is particularly effective for the localized delivery of chemotherapeutic hydrophobic anticancer agents, inclusive of paclitaxel(taxol)doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, campthothecin, cisplatin, and metronidazole, their corresponding derivatives and functionally equivalents, and combinations thereof from PLGA microspheres.","One-third of all individuals in the United States of America (U.S.) alone will develop cancer.","Although the five-year survival rate has risen dramatically to nearly fifty percent as a resulting progress in early diagnosis and the therapy, cancer still remains second only to cardiac disease as a cause of death in the U.S. twenty percent of Americans die from cancer, half due to lung, breast, and colon-rectal cancer.","Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death in women in the U.S. Approximately 135,000 women are diagnosed with and 42,000 women die from breast cancer annually (1). Breast cancer treatment plans include a combination of surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy (CT). The general treatment plan for stage I and II breast cancer is conservative surgery and radiotherapy (2,3,4,5). The general treatment plan for stage III and IV breast cancer is a combination of surgery, radiotherapy, and systemic CT using chemotherapeutic agents such as taxol (6,7,8,9,10).","Taxol treatment is recommended for the treatment of breast cancer when CT for metastatic disease has failed or when disease relapse has occurred within 6 months of adjuvant CT. Advantages of taxol treatment include: (1) lack of cardiotoxicity; (2) a mechanism of action, the stabilization of microtubules, which targets a large percentage of tumor cells, as opposed to normal cells; and (3) inhibition of angiogensis (11,12). Taxol is systemically administered intravenously (i.v.), primarily as a bolus administration. Systemic CT using taxol, as well as other chemotherapeutic drugs, is highly effective, in terms of additional years of life gained as a result of therapy; however, there are many problems associated with this treatment regimen.","CT drugs are high by cytotoxic (13), and typically, large doses of CT drugs are needed to produce an optimal therapeutic response(13, 14); therefore, CT drugs have a low therapeutic index(13). Side effects commonly seen with taxol CT include: nausea, vomiting, fever, weight changes, musculoskeletal pain, neuropathy, general malaise, immune dysfunction, and the development of tumor resistance to taxol (9,15,16).","An additional side effect seen in patients treated with taxol is a severe hypersensitivity reaction due to Cremophor EL, taxol's solubilizing agent (17). This side effect is controlled via patient pre-medication using a combination of corticosteroids, antihistamines, and histamine receptor antagonists. Often, patients become so ill during therapy that they are removed from treatment regimens or that drug dosages are lowered. The consequence of these regimen changes is fluctuating drug levels, which equates to decreased efficacy.","The problems associated with systemic taxol treatment signal the need for the development of a drug delivery system which offers a safer and a more effective means of administering toxic agents, such as taxol, to breast cancer patients, as well as to other cancer patients.","Delivery systems based on prolonged exposure to taxol have been investigated as a means to overcome the problems associated with bolus administration of taxol. These systems include infusional administration of taxol over 1,3,24, or 96 hours and administration of taxol via polymeric carrier vehicle. Infusional data suggests that cytotoxicity may be enhanced due to the increased exposure of cycling cells and has shown, in vitro, 4.4 fold less resistance in multi-drug resistant MCP-7 human breast carcinoma cells exposed to taxol for 24 hours as compared to 3 hours (16). A 96-hour taxol infusion study in patients with metastatic breast cancer showed that this infusion schedule: (1) was better tolerated than bolus administration of taxol, as evidenced by mild side effects, such as nausea and myalgia; (2) did not cause significant hypersensitivity reactions despite the omission of corticosteroid pre-treatment; (3) did not result in any cardiac, renal, or hepatic toxicity, and (4) resulted in major objective responses in 7\/26 patients (26.9%), with a 6 month median response duration (16). In this trial, the predominant toxic side effect was granulocytopenia which resulted in taxol dose reduction in 3\/26 patients (11.54%) and in hospitalization of 4\/26 patients (15.38%).","Taxol infusion regiments offer significant advantages over bolus administration of taxol in terms of systemic toxicity, efficacy, and resistance; however, immune dysfunction still appears to be the major limiting factor in the success of this treatment regimen.","Certain chemotherapeutics such as paclitaxel (taxol) and camptothecin, which are efficacious when administered systemically must be delivered at very high dosages in order to avoid toxicity due to poor bioavailability. For example, paclitaxel (taxol) has been used systemically with efficacy in treating several human tumors, including ovarian, breast, and non-small cell lung cancer. However, maintenance of sufficient systemic levels of the drug for treatment of tumors has been associated with severe, in some cases \u201clife-threatening\u201d toxicity, as reported by Sarosy and Reed, J. Nat. Med. Assoc. 85(6):427-431 (1993). Paclitaxel is a high molecular weight (854), highly lipophilic deterpenoid isolated from the western yew, Taxus brevifolia, which is insoluble in water. It is normally administered intravenously by dilution into saline of the drug dissolved or suspended in polyoxyethylated castor oil. This carrier has been reported to induce an anaphylactic reaction in a number of patients (Sarosy and Reed (1993) so alternative carriers have been proposed, such as a mixed micellar formulation for parenteral administration, described by Alkan-Onyuksel, et al., Pharm. Res. 11(2), 206-212 (1994). There is also extensive non-renal clearance, with indications that the drug is removed and stored peripherally. Pharmacokinetic evidence from clinical trials (Rowinsky, E. K., et al., Cancer Res. 49:4640-4647 (1989) and animal studies (Klecker, R. W., Proc. Am. Cancer Res. 6.43:381 (1993) indicates that paclitaxel penetrates the intact blood-brain barrier poorly, if at all, and that there is no increased survival from systemic intraperitoneal injections of paclitaxel into rats with intracranial gliomas. Paclitaxol has been administered in a polymeric matrix for inhibition of scar formation in the eye, as reported by Jampel, et al., Opthalmic Surg. 22, 676-680 (1991), but has not been administered locally to inhibit tumor growth.","This invention provides a method and novel pharmaceutical compositions for local delivery and burst-free programmable sustained release of hydrophobic drugs from biocompatible, biodegradble poly (DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microspheres. The hydrophobic drugs are released over a time period while at the same time preserving its bioactivity and bioavailability.","It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a chemotherapeutic composition and method of use thereof which provides for effective long term release of chemotherapeutic agents that are not stable or soluble in aqueous solutions or which have limited bioavailability in vivo for treatment of solid tumors.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide a composition and method of use for the treatment of solid tumors with chemotherapeutic agents that avoids high systemic levels of the agent and associated toxicities.","The novel compositions described herein are formulated of chemotherapeutic agent, such as paclitaxel (taxol), doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, campthothecin, cisplatin, metronidazole campthothecin and combinations, derivatives, or functional equivalents thereof, which are not water soluble and has poor bioavailability in vivo encapsulated into a biocompatible\/biodegradable polymeric matrix or in combination with hydrophillic agents for use especially in the treatment of breast cancer.","The polymer bound taxol formulations of this invention represent another strategy to achieve prolonged exposure to taxol which appears to be more advantageous than infusion regiments. Of greatest utility are the biodegradable polymers, which include the poly(lactide-co-glycolide)(PLGA) copolymer. A variety of biodegradable polymer bound taxol formulations have been developed and have been shown to inhibit tumor growth and angiogenesis in animal models with minimal systemic toxicity; however, the release kinetics of taxol in these systems, which range from 10-25% of the drug released in approximately 50 days, are, most likely, not optimal for clinical use (18,17,11,12,19,20,21,22). The advantages of biodegradable polymers as a carrier for taxol include: (1) complete biodegradation, requiring no follow-up surgery to remove the drug carrier when the drug supply is exhausted (23,24); (2) tissue biocompatibility (25); 3) ease of administration via s.c. ir u,n, ubhectuib (23,26,27); (4) controlled, sustained release of the encapsulated drug upon hydrolysis of the polymer(27,23,28,24);(5) minimization or elimination of systemic toxicity, such as neutropenia 23,24,26,27); and (6) the convenience of the biodegradable polymer system itself, in terms of versatility (23,29,24,26).","Surprisingly, our data indicates that we have developed a series of taxol\/PLGA formulations which exhibit different and highly desirable rates of sustained, controlled release of taxol. Due to the sustained release characteristics of these microspheres, taxol\/PLGA microsphere formulations are intended as a one-time treatment which sustain releases taxol from a subcutaneous (s.c) or intramuscular (i.m.) depot. Taxol\/PLGA microspheres having a core load of 10%, 20%, 40%, and 50% were prepared via solvent evaporation and were characterized via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), particle sizing, and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Microsphere morphology of these formulations showed intact spheres with an average diameter range of 5.69-7.75 um (FIGS. ,,,). Taxol core loading efficiency of all formulations ranged form 91.9%-95.48%. In vitro release of taxol into 37 degrees C PMS\/albumin (pH 7.4; 0.4% albumin) over time was calculated based on the residual amount of taxol in the microsphere pellet. Results showed: (1)40.19% taxol release in 10 days using a 10% core load formulation; (2) 71.58% taxol release in 6 days using a 20% core load formulation (FIG. ); (3) 48.09% taxol release in 6 days using a 40% core load formulation (FIG. ); and (4) 39.84% taxol release in 6 days using a 50% core load formulation (FIG. ).","A preliminary toxicity study using placebo PLGA microspheres and taxol\/PLGA microspheres (20% core load formulation) was performed using C57\/black, 6-8 week old, intact female mice. Animals were randomized into 12 groups of 4, ear notched, and weighed. Microencapsulated taxol and control polymer were individually resolubilized and injected either subcutaneously (s.c.) or intramuscularly (i.m. (inocula volume=50 ul). The right side of the animal received control polymer, and the left side of the animal received microencapsulated taxol. Each day, animals were examined for signs of toxicity. On days 2,4,6, and 8, animals were weighed, one from each group was sacrificed, and blood was collected for WBC count and for taxol quantitation via HPLC.","Treatment groups were as follows: (1) dose of 0.04 mg\/kg using s.c. route; (2) dose of 0.4 mg\/kg using s.c. route; (3) dose of 2 mg\/kg using s.c. route; (4) dose of 4 mg\/kg using s.c. route; (5) dose of 8 mg\/kg using s.c. route; (6) dose of 16 mg\/kg using s.c. route; (7) dose of 0.04 mg\/kg using i.m. route; (8) dose of 0.4 mg\/kg using i.m. route; (9) dose of 2 mg\/kg using i.m. route; (10) dose of 4 mg\/kg using i.m. route; (11) dose of 8 mg\/kg using i.m. route; and (12) dose of 16 mg\/kg using i.m. route. Dosage selection was based on the maximum tolerated systemic dose of taxol in mice, which is 16 mg\/kg of taxol every 5 days over a 3 week period.","Results showed: (1) no signs of toxicity at the injection sites of any animal at any time; (2) no signs of weight loss rather, on average, the animals gained weight; and (3) no appreciable changes in white blood cell (WBC)count. Taxol concentration in serum samples was too low to be detectable\/quantitable via our taxol extraction and HPLC methods. Additionally, problems experienced with the serum samples-were: (1) protein interference with the taxol peak; (2) moderate to gross hemolysis of the serum samples; and (3) the presence of additional peaks in the chromatogram, which may have been taxol metabolites. Further refinement of our methodologies for taxol extraction from serum and for trace HPLC analysis, which is currently in progress, will increase the sensitivity of taxol detection and quantitation and will eliminate these problems. Since no signs of toxicity were determined, this study is being repeated using taxol doses up to 150 mg\/kg; however, this preliminary data suggests that depot administration of taxol via microspheres should not cause systemic toxicity.","Applicants have demonstrated that a s.c., or an i.m. injection of taxol encapsulated in a PLGA copolymer is equally as effective as, or perhaps better than, conventional systemic taxol therapy for human breast cancer treatment and does not cause the side effects commonly associated with conventional therapy.","Specific Embodiments","Most specifically, the embodiments of this invention are inclusive of the following items:\n\n","The following examples are offered by way of illustration and not by way of limitation.","Experimental","The abbreviations used herein are defined as follows:","A) Acronym and Symbol Definition",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00075","num":"none"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul200002","list-style":"none"},"li":["ABC=3 amino-9-ethylcarbazole","CRDA=collaborative research and development agreement","CT=Chemotherapy","HPLC=HIGH PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY","i.v.=Intra-venous","i.p.=Intrapariteneal","i.m.=Intra-muscular","MDR=Multi-drug resistant","PBS=Phosphate-buffered saline","PLGA=Poly(lactide-co-glycolide)","s.c.=Subcutaneous","SEM=Scanning electron microscope"]}},"Preliminary Results: Paclitaxel (taxol) is being used as the prototype hydrophobic drug for the development of a PLGA copolymer delivery vehicle for hydrophobic drugs. Paclitaxel is a diterpene anticancer agent isolated from the bark of the Western Pacific yew, Taxus brevifolia () (3). Taxol binds intracellular microtubules, adversely affecting functions critical to cell mitosis via promotion of abnormal microtubule formation and via stabilization of formed microtubules (4,5). Taxol exhibits non-linear pharmacokinetics, in that there is a disproportionate relationship between changes in dose and resulting peak plasma concentrations (6). Taxol use is indicated for the treatment of human breast cancer after failure of combination CT for metastatic disease or upon disease relapse within 6 months of adjuvant CT.","PHASE I. Validation of Methodology for paclitaxel analysis.","A. Accuracy\/Precision","1. Experimental Set Up: A 5.0 ug\/ml paclitaxel solution was run 10 times, and the relative standard deviation percent (RSD%) was calculated.

Experimental Set-Up: A 15 mg sample of paclitaxel powder was irradiated with 20.7-21.4 kGy, a radiation level 10% greater than the standard 20 kGy target. A comparison between the paclitaxel peak of the irradiated sample was compared to that of an unirradiated sample.","2. Result: Gamma irradiation did not affect the paclitaxel peak.\n\n","1. Experimental Set Up: Liquid\/liquid extraction of paclitaxel is highly time-consuming and labor intensive, therefore, an alternative method for paclitaxel extraction, solid phase extraction, was recently examined in terms of extraction efficiency.

The purity and the threshold angle between the paclitaxel samples and the paclitaxel standard were calculated. These calculated numbers correspond to the purity of the paclitaxel peak that is being analyzed via paclitaxel's HPLC methodology.","2.

System Parameters:\n\n","3. Results\n\n","b. SEM Results:\n\n","d. Conclusions\n\n","Encapsulation of hydrophobic drugs in PLGA copolymer offers numerous advantages over standard hydrophobic drug administration. The advantages of biodegradable PLGA copolymer as a carrier for hydrophobic drugs include: (1) complete biodegradation, requiring no follow-up surgery to remove the drug carrier when the drug supply is exhausted (2,7); (2) biocompatibility(8); (3) ease of administration, in that anticancer drugs incorporated into biodegradable polymers can be administered via subcutaneous(s.c.) or intra-muscular(i.m.) injection (2,9,10); and (4) the convenience of the biodegradable copolymer system itself, in terms of versatility and cost (2,7,9,11).","Most importantly, hydrophobic drugs incorporated into PLGA copolymer would allow for controlled release of the drug, as evidenced by drug release from previously reported lactide\/glycolide drug delivery systems (2,7,10,12,13,14,15,16).","A variety of chemotherapy (CT) drug delivery systems have been reported in the current literature; however, problems of poor, limited drug release from the drug carrier and of burst phenomenon are apparent. CT drugs are highly hydrophobic in nature; thus, CT drugs belong to the class of drugs which are illustrative of this invention.","Taxol encapsulated into liposomes prepared from phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine were tested in mice bearing colon-26, a taxol resistant murine adenocarcinoma (17,18). Taxol encapsulated into poly-(e-caprolactone)(19) and into microspheres of ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer and poly(d,1-lactic acid) (20) have been tested for their ability to inhibit angiogenesis. Taxol encapsulated into nanocapsules composed of a polymeric wall of poly lactic acid have been tested in murine leukemia models; however, toxicity of the carrier was demonstrated (21). Overall, these studies show tumor growth inhibition and angiogenesis inhibition; however, the release kinetics of taxol in these systems, which range form 10-25% of the drug released in approximately 50 days, may be sub-optimal, in terms of taxol dosages to be used clinically.","Cisplatin encapsulated in PLGA has been developed for local, intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration in the context of ovarian cancer (22) In vivo data indicated that i.p. administration of cisplatin\/PLGA, as opposed to i.p. administration of an aqueous solution of cisplatin, increased the mean survival time of tumor-bearing rats; however, this formulation was not a stable cisplatin-releasing dosage form because of the burst phenomenon.","The conditions under which we encapsulate hydrophobic drugs (see section A) are specifically designed to overcome the limitations of the CT drug delivery systems described above.","C. Discussion of Problems Which the Invention is Designed to Solve.","The pharmacokinetics of systemically administered drugs is, typically, problematic in terms of efficacy and of toxicity. Standard i.v. administration of hydrophobic drugs, such as paclitaxel, results in alternating periods of overdose and drug inefficacy, while administration of controlled release drug formulations eliminates those peaks and valleys and provides a more constant systemic drug concentration over time () (23) Systemic i.v. administration of taxol is the primary means of delivering potent CT drugs to cancer patients. Systemic CT is highly effective in cancer treatment, in terms of additional years of life gained as a result of therapy; however, there are many problems associated with systemic CT. CT drugs are highly cytotoxic (24), and, typically, large doses of CT drugs are needed to produce an optimal therapeutic response (24,25); therefore, CT drugs have a low therapeutic index (24).","Side effects commonly seen with standard CT dosages include: nausea, vomiting, fever, weight changes, hot flashes, musculoskeletal pain, alopecia, dermatitis, conjunctivitis, general malaise, and immune dysfunction (26,27). An additional side effect seen in patients treated with taxol is a severe hypersensitivity reaction due to Cremophor EL, taxol's solubilizing agent (17). Often, patients become so ill from CT that they have to be removed from treatment regimens (28). The consequence of this removal from therapy is fluctuating CT drug levels, which equate to decreased efficacy of CT drugs.","The PLGA copolymer technology discussed in this disclosure is designed to bypass the problematic pharmacokinetics of systemically administered drugs and the systemic toxicity typically associated with this mode of administration. The in vivo pharmacokinetics of a PLGA\/drug formulation, in which there is controlled release of the drug from the PLGA copolymer, will, most likely, eliminate systemic toxicity (FIG. ). At time 0 of standard i.v. drug therapy, a toxic amount of drug is delivered systemically. This toxic dose is a shock to the patient's biologic system, causing significant toxic side effects within a short period of time. This toxic drug level then rapidly drops to one of minimal effectiveness. This pattern ultimately results in a short exposure time of the biologic system to a therapeutic level of drug.","Drug release from a controlled release system is smooth and constant, with an extended period of time that the systemic concentration of the drug is at a therapeutic level. This extension is highly advantageous because it provides a more effective drug regimen. An additional medical concern when administering CT drug is that of drug interaction problems. Standard taxol CT requires pre-medication with corticosteroids, antihistamines, and histamine H2 receptor antagonists because of the toxicity of Cremophor EL. This pre-medication increases the potential for drug interactions that can affect taxol's pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. As a PLGA copolymer formulation of this drug requires PLGA copolymer powder and taxol powder only, Cremophor EL can be eliminated from taxol CT; thus, taxol tolerability should be enhanced.","Given that hydrophobic drugs, such as CT drugs, are highly problematic under standard conditions of systemic administration, PLGA formulations for this class of drugs which minimize or eliminate systemic toxicity via controlled drug release will lead to more effective drug regimens and to a more efficient and economical use of this class of drugs.","D. List all Known and Other Possible Uses for the Invention","PLGA copolymer technology will provide clinicians with an alternative to systemic administration of hydrophobic drugs, such as taxol doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil camptothecis, cisplatin, and metronidazole, which are problematic in terms of systemic toxicity complications. This alternative is that of a a.s.c.\/i.m. depot which control releases hydrophobic drugs. The advantages of this depot system in terms of hydrophobic drug delivery are: (1) improved patient compliance, as the number of drug dosings are decreased because the depot contains an amount of drug equivalent to multiple doses; (2) isolation depot from the tissue via its incorporation in PLGA thus reducing the drug concentration exposed to the one time and decreasing the chance of tissue injury of the drug copolymer, tissue at any at the depot site; (3) controlled drug release, which may allow for increased dosages of hydrophobic drugs to be administered without systemic toxicity complications. In terms of specific clinical applications of this technology, hydrophobic drug\/PLGA formulations are envisioned to play a role in the treatment regiment of cancer and of infection.","Administration of paclitaxel\/PLGA microspheres will offer a safer and a more effective means of delivering taxol to breast cancer patients than standard i.v. administration. Systemic taxol CT is now approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of breast cancer after failure of combination CT for metastatic disease or after relapse within 6 months of adjuvant CT. The proposed paclitaxel\/PLGA formulation will potentially, be used under the specific conditions as an alternative to systemic taxol CT. Additionally, the increased tolerability and efficacy of paclitaxel encapsulated in PLGA copolymer will, potentially, make this formulation an exemplary first-line CT agent for the treatment of breast cancer.","An expanded use of the proposed paclitaxel\/PLGA formulation is envisioned Paclitaxel\/PLGA may potentially be therapeutic for cancers other than breast cancer which are currently being treated with taxol CT regiments. Due to the increased tolerability of paclitaxel\/PLGA, paclitaxel may be considered as a component of first-line CT regiments for tumors or various origin.","Additionally, the process of microencapsulating paclitaxel in PLGA copolymer is, most likely, capable of being applied to the microencapsulation of hydrophobic drugs other than paclitaxel. The microencapsulation technology used to prepare paclitaxel\/PLGA microspheres is not specific to paclitaxel only, as it is a general chemical process. The advantages of microencapsulating paclitaxel in PLGA copolymers, in terms of improved tolerability and efficacy, are ones that can, most likely, be applied to any CT drug whose standard treatment results in undesirable systemic toxicity. Potential CT drugs to benefit from the PLGA copolymer technology described in this disclosure include: metronidazole, cisplatin, doxorubicin, camptothecin, and Sfluorouracil.","Moreover, this invention relates to and contemplates the use of the novel PLGA copolymer technology as a delivery system for bioactive agents such as heart drugs, like Capoten, Prinivil\/Prinzidel; Vasotec, Pepcid,Mevacor, Antidepressents, like Prozac; arthritic drugs, like Naprosyn; antihistimines, like Claritin, Deconamine; anti-ulcer drugs, like Prilosec, Zantac; antiherpes drugs like Zovirax; Aids treatment drugs like, Crixivan, AZT; drugs for treating osteoporisis, like Esamax; blood pressure drugs; and drugs for the treatment of anxiety, diabetes, insomnia, alzheimer disease, migraine headaches, vitamins and diet regulating drugs, the active ingredient in each, derivatives and combinations thereof, or in combination with other bioactive agents.","E. List the Features of the Invention that are Believed to be Novel","Novel Features of Described Hydrophobic Drug\/PLGA Formulations:","1. Hydrophobic drug\/PLGA administration via the s.c. or i.m. route, a formulation which has the characteristics of: (1) depot formulation; (2) controlled drug release.","2. Elimination or significant decrease in the systemic toxicity of hydrophobic drugs, such as paclitaxel, cisplatin, doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, camptothecin, and metronidazole, due to the pharmacokinetics of controlled release drug formulations.","A) Produced sufficient quantities of our previously developed taxol\/PLGA formulations for in vitro and in vivo testing.","B) Conduct in vitro analysis of the efficacy of taxol\/PLGA using a taxol sensitive uterine sarcoma cell line and various human breast cancer cell lines.","C) Using a nude mouse xenograft model:","1) Establish a maximum tolerated dose for the series of taxol\/PLGA formulations.","2) Compare the in vivo tumoricidal effect of taxol\/PLGA to that of conventional administration of free taxol.","Methods Practiced","A) Production of taxol\/PLGA Microspheres","1) Taxol\/PLGA microspheres were prepared via solvent evaporation.","2) Core load, the percentage of taxol captured in the PLGA copolymer, was determined via HPLC using a pentylfluoryl phenyl column.","3) Morphology of taxol\/PLGA microspheres were examined via SEM. Particle size distribution of the taxol\/PLGA microspheres were calculated using the Accusizer Model 770 Single Particle Optical Sizer.","4) Taxol release from the PLGA copolymer were determined via taxol extraction using a SPE column and subsequent HPLC analysis.","B) In Vitro Analysis of the Efficacy of Taxol\/PLGA Microspheres","1) Commercial cell lines used to test microspheres: ATCC CRL-1902; primary breast carcinoma, human; ATCC CRL-1897; breast carcinoma, human; ATCC CRL-1976; taxol sensitive uterine sarcoma, human. Institutional cell lines to be used to test microspheres: MDA MB 435 cells, MDA MB 231 cells, and MCF-7 cells, all of which are breast cancer cell lines.","2) Cell lines were subcultured to expand the line for subsequent in vitro testing.","3) Cells from each cell line will be tested in exponential growth phase. 24 hours post plating, wells will be treated with media only, media+free taxol (solubilized in Cremophor EL), or media+taxol\/PLGA microspheres. Cells will be harvested 0,24,48, and 72 hours post taxol treatment for subsequent in vitro analysis. Taxol treatment of breast cancer cell lines is appropriate methodology to study the in vitro effect of taxol, as taxol\/Cremophor EL treatment of various breast cancer cell lines has been shown to have anti-tumor effect, in terms of cytotoxicity (FIG. ).","4) In vitro assays performed at each time point:\n\n","1) The efficacy of taxol\/PLGA microspheres was evaluated using a nude mouse xenograft model. This model has successfully and safely been used at the Lomardi Cancer Research Center, as evidenced by taxol\/Cremophor El treatment of athymic nude mice carrying MDA 231 human breast cancer xenografts (FIG. ). Briefly, mice will be inoculated s.c. into the mammary fat pads at 2 sites per mouse with 1\u00d710 to 2\u00d710 MDA 231 human breast cancer cells which have been MAP tested. Taxol treatment was begun 1-30 days post cell inoculation. Saline was the injection vehicle for the microspheres, and Cremophor EL was the injection vehicle for the free taxol. The taxol\/Cremophor EL treatment schedule was approximately 3 weeks duration on a 5 day basis. The taxol\/PLGA treatment schedule consisted of a one dose, i.m. or s.c. injection for the approximate 3 week duration.","2) Animals were sacrificed at specified time points during the treatment regimen.","3) Testing at animal-harvest time points:\n\n","Spore Animal Experiment #20:","Objective: Conduct toxicity study on microencapsualted taxol.

All publications and patent applications are herein incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each individual publication or patent application was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference.","Although the foregoing invention has been described in some detail by way of illustration and example for purposes of clarity of understanding, it will be obvious that certain changes and a modifications may be practiced within the scope of the appended claims."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00021","num":"00021"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00022","num":"00022"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00023","num":"00023"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00024","num":"00024"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00025","num":"00025"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00026","num":"00026"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00027","num":"00027"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00028","num":"00028"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00029","num":"00029"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00030","num":"00030"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00031","num":"00031"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00032","num":"00032"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00033","num":"00033"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00034","num":"00034"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00035","num":"00035"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00036","num":"00036"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00037","num":"00037"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00038","num":"00038"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00039","num":"00039"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00040","num":"00040"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00041","num":"00041"},"figref":"FIG. 21"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00042","num":"00042"},"figref":"FIG. 22"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
