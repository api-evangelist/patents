{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Financial cards include non-stored value cards, such as credit cards and charge cards, as well as debit cards. A credit card is part of a system of payments named after the small card (typically plastic) issued to users of the system. It is a financial card entitling its holder to buy goods and services based on the holder's promise to pay for these goods and services. The issuer of the credit card grants a line of credit to the card owner (also referred to herein as the user) from which the user can borrow money for payment to a merchant or as a cash advance to the user.","A credit card allows the user to revolve their balance at the cost of having interest charged. A credit card is different from a charge card as a charge card requires the balance to be paid in full each month. Most credit cards and charge cards are issued by local banks or credit unions, and are the same shape and size as specified by the ISO 7810 standard.","A debit card (also known as a bank card or check card) is a card which provides an alternative payment method to cash when making purchases. Functionally, it can be called an electronic check, as the funds are withdrawn directly from either the bank account from the remaining balance on the card. Debit cards are issued in the name of individual account holders while stored value cards are anonymous.","Debit cards, credit cards, and charge cards, as well as other non-stored value cards, are issued after an account or application for an account has been approved by the institution providing the card. After receiving the card, the user may use the card to make purchases at merchants accepting that card.","Card security relies on the physical security of the card itself as well as the privacy of the credit card number. Therefore, whenever a person other than the card owner has access to the card or its number, security is potentially compromised. Card fraud refers to theft and fraud committed using a credit card, charge card, debit card, or any similar payment mechanism as a fraudulent source of funds in a transaction. The purpose may be to obtain goods without paying or to obtain unauthorized funds from an account. Card fraud is also an adjunct to identity theft.","In issuing a financial card to the user, the card is mailed directly to the user. The mailing of the financial card is a highly insecure process. The card may be intercepted in the mail by someone other than the true card owner, thereby increasing the likelihood of card fraud and identity theft.","An institution system may approve a user for a financial card. The institution system may notify the user that an application for the financial card has been approved and may advise the user to go to an automated teller machine (ATM) to obtain the financial card. The ATM may generate a financial card and issue the financial card to the user.","In an implementation, the user may customize the financial card. The user may provide customization information comprising one or more designs, images, and\/or layouts that are to be used in the generation of the financial card. The user may provide the customization information to the institution system or to the ATM prior to the ATM generating the financial card.","In an implementation, an event may occur in which a replacement financial card may be warranted. The event may comprise an expiration of the financial card or the compromise of the card number, for example. The user may be notified of the event by the institution system and may be advised to go to an ATM to obtain the replacement financial card. The ATM may generate and issue a replacement financial card to the user.","This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the detailed description. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["199","190","105","102","102","199"]},"A user  and an associated user computing device  are shown. In an implementation, the user  may be an individual who owns an account  that is held by the institution and accessible via the institution system . The account  may be any type of account that may be associated with a financial card, such as a credit card account, a charge card account, or an account for depositing funds and from which funds may be withdrawn, such as a savings account, a checking account, a brokerage account, and the like. The computing device  may be any type of computing device such as a personal computer (PC) or handheld computing device or a mobile device, such a personal digital assistant (PDA), a mobile phone, a smart phone, and the like.","The ATM  is a computerized telecommunications device that provides the user  (as well as other customers or of the institution  or users, for example) with access to financial transactions in a public space without the need for a human clerk or bank teller. The ATM  may be placed anywhere, such as, for example, near or inside the premises of a bank or in a location such as a shopping center mall, an airport, a grocery store, a gas station, a restaurant, or any place people may gather. The ATM  may have a sign indicating the name of the bank or institution owning, operating, or otherwise affiliated with, the ATM .","Although ATMs were originally developed as just cash dispensers, they have evolved to include many other bank related and non-bank related functions. ATMs include many functions such as providing deposit currency recognition and acceptance, facilitating payment of routine bills, fees, and taxes, printing bank statements, loading monetary value into stored value cards, selling items such as postage stamps, lottery tickets, train tickets, concert tickets, shopping mall gift certificates, etc., providing games and promotional features, providing check processing, etc.","In an implementation, the ATM  may generate a financial card  and issue the financial card  to the user . As described further herein, the financial card  generated and issued by the ATM  may be a newly issued card for the user , a card customized by the user , or a replacement card issued for the user .","In an implementation, the user  may apply for a card and an associated account from the institution  via the institution system , e.g., via an application provided on a website  of the institution system , via an application that the user  fills out and mails, faxes, or emails to the institution system , or via an application taken over the telephone by a representative of the institution system , for example.","The institution system  may receive the application and may process the application, perform underwriting in an implementation, and approve the user  for the financial card  and an associated account. The institution system  may notify the user  that the application for the financial card  has been approved and may advise the user  to go to the ATM  to obtain the financial card . The user  may be provided with a list of suitable ATMs, any one of which may generate and dispense the financial card  to the user . In an implementation, the ATM  may be associated or affiliated with the institution .","The user  may visit the ATM  and may be identified and authenticated by the ATM . Any technique may be used for identification and authentication, such as receiving and analyzing one or more pieces of identification of the user , such as a driver's license, other financial cards issued to the user , and\/or biometrics of the user  such as fingerprints, eye retinas and irises, voice patterns, facial patterns, and hand measurements. In an implementation, the user  may provide a previously issued financial card of the institution  into the ATM  and be identified and authenticated based on the previously issued financial card.","The ATM  may perform the identification and authentication alone or in conjunction with the institution system . The ATM  may communicate over a communications network with the institution system  to perform the identification and authentication processing.","After the user  is identified and authenticated, the ATM  may receive information that is to be provided on the card from the institution . As with the identification and authentication, in an implementation, the communication may be performed through an ISO 8583 messaging system, though any communication technique(s) may be used. In addition to techniques employed for transaction security and secrecy, the communications traffic between the ATM  and the institution system  may also be encrypted via methods such as secure sockets layer (SSL) or transport layer security (TLS).","The ATM  may connect to the institution system via a dial-up modem over a telephone line, directly via a leased line, or via an Internet connection. Common lower-level layer communication protocols that may be used by the ATM  to communicate with the institution system  include SNA (systems network architecture) over SDLC (synchronous data link control), X.25, and TCP\/IP over Ethernet, for example.","Sensitive data in ATM transactions may be encrypted with data encryption standard (DES) or triple DES. Remote key loading techniques may be used to ensure the secrecy of the initialization of the encryption keys in the ATM . Message authentication code (MAC) or partial MAC may also be used to ensure messages have not been tampered with while in transit between the ATM  and the institution system .","The ATM  may generate the financial card  using the information from the institution system  (and the user  in an implementation) and may issue the financial card  to the user . The information for the financial card  may be provided to the ATM  from the institution system  pursuant to a request made to the institution system  from the user  and\/or the ATM .","The ATM  may comprise a central processing unit (CPU) to control the user interface and transaction devices, a magnetic and\/or chip card reader to identify the user, a personal identification number (PIN) pad, a secure cryptoprocessor (a dedicated computer or microprocessor for carrying out cryptographic operations, embedded in a packaging with multiple physical security measures, which provides tamper resistance), a display used by the user for performing the transaction, function key buttons or a touchscreen used to select the various aspects of the transaction, and a record printer to provide the user with a record of their transaction. Such components may be comprised within the ATM computing device  shown in . An example computing device is described with respect to .","Recently, due to heavier computing demands and the falling price of computer-like architectures, ATMs have moved away from custom hardware architectures using microcontrollers and\/or application specific integrated circuits to adopting a hardware architecture that is very similar to a PC. Many ATMs are now able to use operating systems such as Microsoft Windows and Linux. With the migration to commodity PC hardware, standard commercial off-the-shelf operating systems and programming environments can be used inside of ATMs. Typical platforms used in ATM development include RMX, OS\/2, and Microsoft operating systems. Java, Linux, and Unix may also be used in these environments.","The ATM  may also comprise a vault to store the parts of the machinery having restricted access, and a housing for aesthetics and to attach signage to. Such components are well known and not shown in .","The ATM  may comprise blank cards  that may be used in the generation of financial cards for users. The blank cards  may be stored in the vault of the ATM , for example. The ATM  may comprises a card generator  that receives information from the institution system  that is to be provided onto the financial card , and provides the information onto one of the blank cards  during the generation of the financial card . The ATM  and the institution system  may communicate to tie the financial card  to an account of the user .","It is contemplated that the blank cards  may comprise information, designs, logos, etc. pertaining to the institution , the ATM , or another entity, for example; however, the blank cards  do not comprise information directed to the user  such as the name of the user  or an account number of the user . In an implementation, the blank cards  do not comprise a card number or an expiration date. Such information (e.g., a user name, a card number, an expiration date, etc.) may be provided on the card by the ATM  when generating the financial card  from one of the blank cards , as described further herein.","Card information is stored and provided in a number of formats. Account numbers are often embossed or imprinted on the financial card , and a magnetic stripe on the back contains the data in machine readable format. Fields can vary, but the most common include name of user , card number or account number, expiration date, verification, CVV (card verification value), or other card security code. The card generator  may comprise an embosser, a printer, an encoder, a card programmer, etc., that may be used to provide the information onto the financial card .","In an implementation, the card generator  may print designs on the financial card , such as one or more institution logos or identifiers and\/or one or more designs or images that may be selected by the user . In an implementation, the user  may select the designs or images at the ATM , may provide the designs or images to the ATM , or may have previously selected and\/or provided the designs or images via the institution system .","In an implementation, the ATM  may only generate and issue financial cards for the institution  that operates the ATM . In an alternate implementation, the ATM  may generate and issue financial cards for any institution.","The ATM  may comprise a card issuer  that issues the financial card  to the user  after the financial card  has been generated. The card issuer  may confirm receipt from the user  that the user  has received the financial card . The card issuer  may also activate the financial card , either pursuant to one or more actions by the user  or automatically prior to, or after, dispensing the financial card , depending on the implementation.","In an implementation, the ATM  may comprise a card destroyer  that may destroy (e.g., shred, cut, etc.) unused or no longer valid financial cards, such as a financial card that has expired or a financial card for which a replacement card has been issued.","The institution system  may include a user interface module , a financial card engine , and a data source access engine . The user interface module  may generate and format one or more pages of content  as a unified graphical presentation that may be provided to the user computing device  as an output from the financial card engine . In an implementation, the page(s) of content  may be provided to the user computing device  via a secure website  associated with the institution system . On the website , the user  may be presented with information pertaining to the account , an application for a financial card, the financial card , and\/or customization information for the financial card , as described further herein. An example computing device, such as an example user computing device , is described with respect to .","The user  may communicate with the institution system  by way of a communications network such as an intranet, the Internet, a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a public switched telephone network (PSTN), a cellular network, a voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) network, and the like. The user  may also communicate with the institution system  by phone, email, instant messaging, text messaging, web chat, facsimile, mail, and the like.","The financial card engine  may provide, receive, and process an application for the financial card  using a card application module . In an implementation, the card application module  may obtain data from internal data source(s)  and\/or external data source(s)  by the data source access engine  that may be used in the generation of an application for the financial card . Data may also be requested and received from the user  (e.g., via the website ). Such data may also be used in providing the application to the user , receiving the application from the user , and processing the application.","The financial card engine  may issue the financial card  to the user  (alone or in conjunction with the ATM ) after approving the application for the financial card . A card issuing module  may determine usage parameters, such as spending limits on the financial card , geographic regions where the financial card  may be used, which goods and services may be purchased with the financial card , and which merchants may accept the financial card  for purchases, for example. The card issuing module  may obtain data from the internal data source(s) , the external data source(s) , and\/or the user  and use this data along with tools, applications, and aggregators, for example, to determine the parameters, in an implementation.","The card issuing module  may provide information to the user  regarding the approved application and how to obtain the financial card  (e.g., by going to the ATM  for issuance of the financial card ). The card issuing module  may provide instructions and information to ATM  regarding the generation and issuance of the financial card  to the user  via the ATM . The instructions and information may be directed to identifying and authenticating the user  and the information that is to be provided onto the financial card . The card issuing module  may also provide activation information and\/or instructions to the ATM  to activate the financial card  for the user . In an implementation, the card issuing module  may activate the financial card  for the user .","In an implementation, the card manufactured at the ATM  could be of lesser stock then a traditional financial card, sacrificing long-term durability. In an implementation, the financial card  could be valid for a fixed period of time. This type of card would be useful for travelers and may function as a traveler's check in credit, charge, or debit card form where at the end of the travel period the financial card  would no longer function.","In an implementation, the user  may customize the financial card  via a card customization module . Such customization may allow personalization of the financial card  by the user . For example, the user may select or provide one or more images or designs for the financial card  and\/or may arrange the images, designs, and other data on the financial card  that will be generated and issued to them. In an implementation, the user  may use the user computing device  to provide customization information (e.g., images, designs, and\/or arrangements) for the financial card  to the card customization module . The card customization module  may store the customization information in storage, such as storage  or internal data source(s) . The customization information may be provided to the card issuing module , via the card customization module  or the storage, and may be provided to the ATM  for use in generating the financial card  for the user .","In an implementation, the card customization module  may provide options regarding layout, images, designs, etc. for the financial card  to the user  via the website . The user  may select which one or more options they would like for the financial card . Such selected options may be stored and\/or provided by the card customization module  as customization information for subsequent use in generating the financial card  for the user .","In this manner, the user  may design the financial card  (e.g., via the user computing device ), and may later retrieve it at the ATM . Thus, the financial card  is issued to the user  without a mail event.","In an implementation, the user  may customize the financial card  to comprise information pertaining to the user , such as a user photograph or picture, an account number or identifier of a user account, medical information of the user , and contact information of the user  and friends or family members of the user , for example. The information may be encoded or in the clear. In this manner, in an implementation, the financial card  may also serve as an identification card of the user .","The financial card engine  has access to data, files, and documents pertaining to the user  as well as any other data, files, and documents that are currently stored by the institution system  as well as external data, files, and documents that may be useful in processing an application for the financial card  and\/or issuing the financial card  to the user . Data pertaining to the user  and\/or the user account(s) may be retrieved from internal data source(s)  and\/or external data source(s) . The retrieved data may be stored centrally, perhaps in storage . Information may also be provided to the institution system  from the user .","Internal data source(s)  may contain data, metadata, email, files, and\/or documents that the institution system  maintains pertaining to the user , such as personal data such as name, physical address, email address, etc., as well as other account information. The institution system  may access this information when processing or issuing the financial card  or setting the usage parameters, for example.","A user access system may be communicatively coupled to the financial card engine  and may be configured to send machine-readable instructions to the financial card engine . As mentioned above, the institution system  may provide a unified graphical presentation output. The unified graphical presentation may be transmitted to the user access system. In an implementation, the unified graphical presentation may be combined with other materials and transmitted to the user . In an implementation, the unified graphical presentation is received by the user access system and transmitted directly to the user  without the inclusion of any other materials.","The user access system may be implemented as a web server in an implementation. The user access system, through the use of any suitable interactive web technology, provides an interactive experience to the user  through which access to financial card data and status and related data can be accomplished. Any technology that provides interactivity through a web browser is considered to be within the scope of the present discussion and may include, without limitation, Hyper-Text Mark-Up Language (HTML), Dynamic HTML (DHTML), JavaScript, and Ajax.","The institution system  may include any combination of systems and subsystems such as electronic devices including, but not limited to, computers, servers, databases, or the like. The electronic devices may include any combination of hardware components such as processors, databases, storage drives, registers, cache, random access memory (RAM) chips, data buses, or the like and\/or software components such as operating systems, database management applications, or the like.","The institution system  may comprise one or more computing devices . The computing device(s)  may have one or more processors , storage  (e.g., storage devices, memory, etc.), and software modules . The computing device(s) , including its processor(s) , storage , and software modules , may be used in the performance of the techniques and operations described herein. An example computing device and its components are described in more detail with respect to .","Examples of software modules  may include modules that may be used in conjunction with receiving and processing an application for the financial card  for a user , providing issuance information and card generation information to the ATM , issuing the financial card  to the user , receiving and providing card customization information, generating web page content for display, and receiving instructions from the user , for example.

The term computer-readable media as used herein includes both storage media and communication media.","Computing device  may also have input device(s)  such as a keyboard, mouse, pen, voice input device, touch input device, etc. Output device(s)  such as a display, speakers, printer, etc. may also be included. All these devices are well known in the art and need not be discussed at length here.","Computing device  may be one of a plurality of computing devices  inter-connected by a network. As may be appreciated, the network may be any appropriate network, each computing device  may be connected thereto by way of communication connection(s)  in any appropriate manner, and each computing device  may communicate with one or more of the other computing devices  in the network in any appropriate manner. For example, the network may be a wired or wireless network within an organization or home or the like, and may include a direct or indirect coupling to an external network such as the Internet or the like.","It should be understood that the various techniques described herein may be implemented in connection with hardware or software or, where appropriate, with a combination of both. Thus, the methods and apparatus of the presently disclosed subject matter, or certain aspects or portions thereof, may take the form of program code (i.e., instructions) embodied in tangible media, such as floppy diskettes, CD-ROMs, hard drives, or any other machine-readable storage medium wherein, when the program code is loaded into and executed by a machine, such as a computer, the machine becomes an apparatus for practicing the presently disclosed subject matter. In the case of program code execution on programmable computers, the computing device generally includes a processor, a storage medium readable by the processor (including volatile and non-volatile memory and\/or storage elements), at least one input device, and at least one output device. One or more programs may implement or utilize the processes described in connection with the presently disclosed subject matter, e.g., through the use of an application programming interface (API), reusable controls, or the like. Such programs may be implemented in a high level procedural or object-oriented programming language to communicate with a computer system. However, the program(s) can be implemented in assembly or machine language, if desired. In any case, the language may be a compiled or interpreted language and it may be combined with hardware implementations.","Although exemplary embodiments may refer to utilizing aspects of the presently disclosed subject matter in the context of one or more stand-alone computer systems, the subject matter is not so limited, but rather may be implemented in connection with any computing environment, such as a network or distributed computing environment. Still further, aspects of the presently disclosed subject matter may be implemented in or across a plurality of processing chips or devices, and storage may similarly be effected across a plurality of devices. Such devices might include PCs, network servers, and handheld devices, for example.","Although the subject matter has been described in language specific to structural features and\/or methodological acts, it is to be understood that the subject matter defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the specific features or acts described above. Rather, the specific features and acts described above are disclosed as example forms of implementing the claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The foregoing summary, as well as the following detailed description of illustrative embodiments, is better understood when read in conjunction with the appended drawings.
