{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Embodiments generally relate to computer systems and more particularly to methods and systems for providing a resource expression for access control.","Access control enables an authority to control access to resources in a computer based system. Access control deals with resources on one side and users on the other side. It enables an administrator or the authority to prevent unauthorized users from accessing resources. However, one of the main challenges faced in the access control system is the complexity of the overall system. In other words, a single computer storing millions of files, with thousands of connected users able to access the resources distributed across a network, and with operations allowed on given resource such as right to view, to modify, to delete, and the like, increases the complexity of the access control system.","In a typical access control system, the resources are placed in the foreground. Each resource is equipped with an access control list that holds a user or user groups with some permission (i.e., whether the resource is granted or denied) for a particular resource. Therefore, setting the security rights on the resource side makes it impossible to grant or deny access to all resources. It would require a change to the access control list of each existing resource, which is not feasible.","Currently, users are placed in the foreground. The concept of role is introduced and specified by the role based access control model. The role is a profile restricted to granted permissions and the role cannot contain denied permissions. Therefore, the role that grants every resource becomes available. However, once a universal role (i.e., permission to all resources) is assigned to the user, it becomes difficult to forbid the user from the permission of some resources.","In general, administration of current access control systems remains cumbersome and time consuming. Also, analyzing which resources are authorized and denied to the user is difficult. Moreover, no method or system provides the complete view of the net rights of the user.","Various embodiments of systems and methods for providing an expression of a resource for access control are described herein. In one aspect, one or more business security profiles associated with a user are received. The business security profile is defined including a resource expression. The resource expression can include a resource expression with a quantifier or a resource expression without a quantifier. Further, a net profile of the user is computed using symbolic calculus on the resource expression of the one or more business security profiles. The net profile of the user includes a set of granted resources and a set of denied resources. Based upon the computed net profile, access to a resource is authorized for the user.","These and other benefits and features of embodiments of the invention will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description of preferred embodiments thereof, presented in connection with the following drawings.","Embodiments of techniques for providing an expression of a resource for access control are described herein. A resource or system resource can be a physical or a virtual component having an identity in an enterprise or organization. For example, the resource includes an electronic document, an image, a service, a file, a network connection, a memory, and the like. In one embodiment, an expression of the resource provides access status of the resources for a user. The user refers to an agent, a human, a computer, other mechanism or actors capable of accessing the resource. The resource expression can include a resource expression with a quantifier or a resource expression without a quantifier.","According to an embodiment, one or more business security profiles associated with a user are received. The business security profile is defined including a resource expression. Further, a net profile of the user is computed to authorize access to a resource for the user. In this way, an administrator or authority of the organization can define a business security profile including a set of granted resources, a set of denied resources and a set of undefined resources. Further, the net resource for which access is granted and denied to the user is determined and accordingly the access to the resources is authorized for the user.","In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of the invention.","Reference throughout this specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d, \u201cthis embodiment\u201d and similar phrases, means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, the appearances of these phrases in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110"]},"In one embodiment, the resource expression includes a resource expression with a quantifier or a resource expression without a quantifier. The resource expression with the quantifier consists of access to all granted resources except a set of denied resources or consists of all denied resources except access to a set of granted resources. The resource expression without the quantifier includes at least one of a set of granted resources, a set of denied resources, and a set of undefined resources. In other words, the resource expression without the quantifier consists of the set of granted resources and the set of denied resources, wherein both the sets are disjoint sets.","In one embodiment, an organization may define a plurality of business security profiles for different categories. For example, a sales profile to include the resource expression for sales related resources, a marketing profile to include the resource expression for marketing related resources, and the like. Further, the defined business security profile is assigned to the user or a user group. Defining the business security profile and assigning the business security profile to the user or the user group are described in greater detail in  respectively.","At step , a net profile of the user is computed using symbolic calculus on the resource expression of the received one or more business security profiles. In one exemplary embodiment, the user may be associated with a plurality of the business security profiles. Therefore, a net profile of the user is computed to determine a net resource for which the user is authorized to access. For example, if a user is associated with two business security profiles, such as a sales profile and a marketing profile, a net profile is computed to get a composite set of resources for which access is granted and a composite set of resources for which the access is denied in association with both the sales profile and the marketing profile.","In one embodiment, computing the net profile of each user includes aggregating at least one of a maximum value (Max) and a minimum value (Min) of the business security profiles of the user. For example, when the user belongs to a user group H which is a subgroup of a user group G, then the minimum value of the associated H and G profiles is taken as the net profile of the user. When the user belongs to two independent groups G and I, the maximum value of the associated G and I profiles is taken as the net profile of the user. Therefore, the net profile of a user is obtained by an equation (1) as shown below.\n\nNet profile of a user=Max(Min())\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nWherein, Pi and Pj are the profiles assigned to the user's groups in which the user is a member. The truth tables defining the maximum and minimum operators are depicted in Tables 1 and 2 respectively.\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"119pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"7pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},"TABLE 1"]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Pj",{}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"14pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Maximum(Pi, Pj)",{},"Granted","Denied","Undefined"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Pi","Granted","Granted","Granted","Granted"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Denied","Granted","Denied","Denied"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Undefined","Granted","Denied","Undefined"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"119pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"7pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},"TABLE 2"]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Pj",{}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"14pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Minimum(Pi, Pj)",{},"Granted","Denied","Undefined"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Pi","Granted","Granted","Denied","Granted"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Denied","Denied","Denied","Denied"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Undefined","Granted","Denied","Undefined"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"Tables 1 and 2 depict the nature of the maximum operator and minimum operator respectively. The maximum operator behaves as a logical OR operation (as depicted in Table 1), wherein the maximum operator grants access to the resource if the resource is granted in at least one associated business security profile. For example, considering two business security profiles (e.g., Pi and Pj), if the resource is granted in Pi or in Pj, the access for the resource is granted for the user. Further, if the resource is denied in any of the business security profiles (Pi or Pj), the resource is denied for accessing for the user. Furthermore, if the resource is undefined in Pi and granted in Pj, the access for the resource is granted. Similarly, if the resource is denied in Pi and undefined in Pj, the resource is denied for accessing for the user. Also, if the resource is undefined in Pi and Pj, the resource remains undefined.","The minimum operator behaves as a logical AND operation (as depicted in Table 2), wherein the minimum operator grants access to the resource if the resource is granted in all the associated business security profiles. For example, considering two business security profiles (e.g., Pi and Pj), if the resource is granted in Pi and denied in Pj, the resource is denied for accessing for the user. Similarly, if the resource is denied in Pj and granted in Pj, the resource is denied for accessing for the user. Further, if the resource is granted in both the business security profiles (e.g., Pi and Pj), the access for the resource is granted for the user. Furthermore, if the resource is undefined in Pi and granted in Pj, the access for the resource is granted. Similarly, if the resource is denied in Pi and undefined in Pj, the resource is denied for accessing for the user. Also, if the resource is undefined in Pi and Pj, the resource remains undefined.","In one embodiment, the symbolic calculus includes operations on at least one of a set of granted resources, a set of denied resources and a set of undefined resources using a set operator selected from a group consisting of union (U), intersection (\u2229), and except (or difference, \u201c\u2212\u201d) operators. The net profile of each user includes a set of granted resources and a set of denied resources for each user, and no undefined resources. For example, two profiles P and P, wherein profile P includes a set of granted resources (G) and a set of denied resources (D), denoted by G\/D. The slash operator (\/) is a placeholder used to distinguish the granted set of resources (G) from the denied set of resources (D). Therefore, profile P is represented by P=G\/D, wherein the profile P includes the grated set of resources (G) and the denied set of resources (D). Profile P includes a set of granted resources (G) and a set of denied resources (D), denoted by G\/D.","In one exemplary embodiment, if there were no undefined resources, the corresponding equations would be:\n\nMin(12)=(12)\/(12)\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nMax(12)=(12)\/(12)\u2003\u2003(3)\n\nWhere,\n\n","In another exemplary embodiment, with possible undefined values, the equations (2) and (3) are refined to generate equations (4) and (5) as given below.\n\nMin(12)=(12)\u222a(21)\/(12)\u2003\u2003(4)\n\nThe result of the set difference operator (\u2212) is the members of the first set that are not the members of the second set. In other words, a resource is granted if the resource is granted in one profile, and not denied in another profile. And, the resource is denied if the resource is denied in at least in one profile.\n\nMax(12)=(12)\/(12)\u222a(21)\u2003\u2003(5)\n\nIn other words, a resource is denied if the resource is denied in one profile but not granted in other profile. And, the resource is granted, if the resource is granted in at least in one profile.\n\nFor example, profile P includes granted resources R and R and denied resources R and R. Profile P includes granted resources R, R and R, and denied resources R, R and R.\n\nThen, using equation (4),\n\nMin(12)=[({12246})\u222a({13534})]\/({34246})\n\nMin(12)=({15})\/({2346})\n\nTherefore, resources R and R are granted, and resources R, R, R and R are denied. Using equation (5)\n\nMax(12)=({12135})\/[({34135})\u222a({24612})]\n\nMax(12)=({1235})\/({46})\n\nTherefore, resources R, R, R and R are granted, and resources R and R are denied.\n","In another exemplary embodiment, an expression (G\/D) with a quantified expression (All Granted\/D) is considered. The quantifier \u2018All Granted\u2019 is replaced by the set U of all existing resources at computation time, denoted as given below\n\nAll Granted\/\n\n(U\u2212D) denotes all resources expect the denied resources. Now, considering profile P including (G\/D) and profile P including (All Granted\/D), and using equation (4), Min (P, P) can be computed as Min (P, P)=(G\u2212D)\u222a(U\u2212D)\u2212D\/D\u222aD. Then, for the granted set (U\u2212D)\u2212D=U\u2212(D\u222aD). Further, (G\u2212D) is a subset of U\u2212(D\u222aD) because G and D are disjoint. So G\u2212D has no common element with both D and D. Thus, (G\u2212D)\u222a((U\u2212D)\u2212D)=U\u2212(D\u222aD).\n\nTherefore,\n\nMin(12)=(2)\u22121\/(12)=\u2212(12)\/(12)\n\nMin(12)=All Granted\/(12)\n\nFurther, Max (P, P) can be computed using equation (5) as given below Max (P, P)=G\u222a(U\u2212D)\/(D\u2212(U\u2212D)) U (D\u2212G). Then, G\u222a(U\u2212D)=U\u2212(D\u2212G). Further, (D\u2212(U\u2212D))=U\u2212(D\u2229D) which is a subset of (D\u2212G). Hence, (D\u2212(U\u2212D))\u222a(D\u2212G)=D\u2212G.\n\nTherefore,\n\nMax(12)=\u2212(21)\/(21)\n\nMax(12)=All Granted\/(21)\n\nThese give two new equations for quantified expression (All Granted\/D) as follows:\n\nMin(12)=All Granted\/(12)\u2003\u2003(6)\n\nMax(12)=All Granted\/(21)\u2003\u2003(7)\n\nFor example, profile P includes granted resources R and R and denied resources R and R. In the same example, profile P includes all granted resources except resources R, R and R are denied.\n\nThen, using equation (6),\n\nMin(12)=All Granted\/({34245})\n\nMin(12)=All Granted\/({2345})\n\nTherefore, net profile includes resources R as granted resource and R, R, R and R as denied resources.\n\nUsing equation (7)\n\nMax(12)=All Granted\/({24512})\n\nMax(12)=All Granted\/({45})\n\nTherefore, net profile includes R and R as granted resources, and R and R as denied resources.\n","Similarly, the net profile for an expression with a quantified expression (All Denied\/G) is computed which leads to two more equations (8) and (9) as given below:\n\nMin(12)=All Denied\/(21)\u2003\u2003(8)\n\nMax(12)=All Denied\/(12)\u2003\u2003(9)\n\nWherein, profile P includes (G\/D) and P includes (All Denied\/G).\n","In yet another exemplary embodiment, for all the quantified expressions with no undefined resources, the equations used to compute net profile are given in equations (10) to (15) as shown below:\n\nMin(12)=All Granted\/(12)\u2003\u2003(10)\n\nMax(12)=All Granted\/(12)\u2003\u2003(11)\n\nWherein, profile P includes (All Granted\/D) and profile P includes (All Granted\/D)\n\nMin(12)=All Denied\/(21)\u2003\u2003(12)\n\nMax(12)=All Granted\/(12)\u2003\u2003(13)\n\nWherein, profile P includes (All Granted\/D) and profile P includes (All Denied\/G).\n\nMin(12)=All Denied\/(12)\u2003\u2003(14)\n\nMax(12)=All Denied\/(12)\u2003\u2003(15)\n\nWherein, profile P includes (All Denied\/G) and profile P includes (All Denied\/G).\n","In summary, using the equations as described above, the net profile of each user can be computed. For example, consider three profiles P, P and P, where P includes all granted resources, P includes all granted resources except R and R, and P includes all denied resources except R. The net profile can be computed as Max((Min(P, P)), P).","Using equation (2),\n\nMin(12)=(All Granted\u2229All Granted)\/(12)\n\nMin(12)==All Granted\/{12}\n\nFurther, using equation (13)\n\nMax(3)=All Granted\/({121})\n\nMax(3)=All Granted\/{R2}\n\nTherefore, the net profile includes all granted resources except resource R.\n","At step , access to a resource is authorized to a user based upon the computed net profile. In summary, the introduction of quantifiers for resource expression eliminates any undefined value and gives a list of resources the user is authorized to access. The above derived equations with quantifiers are simpler and therefore the complexity of the access control system is minimized. Further, the above derived equations include set algebra, which is simpler when compared to conventional Boolean binary operations. For example, considering two profiles P and P, wherein P includes all granted resources except a resource R and P includes all granted resources except a resource R. Using Boolean binary operation, All Granted except R gives R granted, R granted, R denied, R granted, R granted, and so on. All Granted except R gives R granted, R granted, R granted, R denied, R granted, and so on. Further, using binary operation AND, access for each of the resources are computed, which can include millions of resources (e.g., R granted AND R granted=R granted; R granted AND R granted=R granted; R denied AND R granted=R denied; and so on). On the other hand, by using set algebra, the result of All Granted except R and R is obtained by computing the union of sets except {R} and {R, which results All Granted except R and R. Therefore, Boolean binary operation uses a full list of existing resources that would render the computation of rights unfeasible.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"200"},"In one exemplary embodiment, universe views  and universe objects  are considered as the resources. Further, an option is provided for an administrator to create a business security profile name as in . For example, a sales profile  is created. The sales profile  includes resource expression for resources universe views  and universe objects . For example, \u2018all universe views\u2019 are denied except for \u2018sales view\u2019 and \u2018advanced sales view\u2019 in the universe views . Further, \u2018all objects\u2019 are granted except for \u2018variable\u2019, \u2018class\u2019 and \u2018US customers\u2019 in the universe objects . In general, for the universe, different security profiles can be created by defining a set of granted resources and a set of denied resources. Further, an option is provided for the administrator to grant the resource (e.g., \u2018insert granted\u2019 ), deny the resource (e.g., \u2018insert denied\u2019 ), and delete the resource (e.g., \u2018delete\u2019 ).","In one exemplary embodiment, the administrator can grant all resources or grant all resources except a set of resources or deny all resources or deny all resources except a set of resources for accessing the resources for the business security profile. However, if a resource is not granted nor denied, the particular resource remains undefined. In one exemplary embodiment, the quantifiers of the resource expression give a status to future resources as well. In other words, an all-granted quantifier grants access to any resource that will be created or installed in future and the all-denied quantifier does the converse. In one embodiment, the defined business security profile is assigned to one or more users. In one embodiment, the one or more users can include at least one of a user, a user group, and all users in the organization. Assigning the business security profile to the one or more users is described in greater detail in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","305","310","305","310","315","330","335"]},"For example, a sales profile  in the profile display region  is assigned to sales user group  as in . Further, the description of the user is displayed in . In general, specific business security profile can be assigned to different users. For each profile, different securities can be defined with an introduction of quantifiers. Further, a net profile of a user is computed as described above to determine the list of resources that the user is authorized to access. In one embodiment, the usage of above described equations applies to resources and as well as folders of resources. For example, considering the objects of a given universe (which are organized in classes and subclasses as files are organized in folders and subfolders), the following inheritance rules are applicable as obtained from the above described equations: if a class is denied, then all the objects and subclasses below are denied; and if a class is granted, then the objects and subclasses that are not denied are granted.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","405","410","415","420","425","405","410","415","425"]},"Further, the defined business security profiles are assigned to associated user groups. For example, the all users' profile  is assigned to a user group V. Similarly, the Company profile , the Sales profile , the Marketing profile , and the Board profile  are assigned to user groups C, S, M, and B respectively.","Furthermore, a net profile of each user is computed using symbolic calculus on a resource expression of the assigned business security profile. For example, the net profile of a user in the user group V is Pa (i.e., all resources denied). The net profile of a user in the user group C is Max(Pa, Pc) (i.e., all resources denied except company view). The net profile of a user in the user group S is Max(Pa, Min(Pc, Ps)) (i.e., all resources granted except marketing view). The net profile of a user in the user group M is Max(Pa, Min(Pc, Ps)) (i.e., all resources granted except sales view). And, the net profile of a user in the user group B is Max(Pa, Min(Pc, Pb) (i.e., all resources granted). In summary, an administrator can define to set both positive (i.e., grant) or negative (i.e., deny) security to the resources, and combine the two securities and the undefined securities to compute what a user is authorized for accessing the resources. Accordingly, the user is authorized to access the resources.","Some embodiments of the invention may include the above-described methods being written as one or more software components. These components, and the functionality associated with each, may be used by client, server, distributed, or peer computer systems. These components may be written in a computer language corresponding to one or more programming languages such as, functional, declarative, procedural, object-oriented, lower level languages and the like. They may be linked to other components via various application programming interfaces and then compiled into one complete application for a server or a client. Alternatively, the components may be implemented in server and client applications. Further, these components may be linked together via various distributed programming protocols. Some example embodiments of the invention may include remote procedure calls being used to implement one or more of these components across a distributed programming environment. For example, a logic level may reside on a first computer system that is remotely located from a second computer system containing an interface level (e.g., a graphical user interface). These first and second computer systems can be configured in a server-client, peer-to-peer, or some other configuration. The clients can vary in complexity from mobile and handheld devices, to thin clients and on to thick clients or even other servers.","The above-illustrated software components are tangibly stored on a computer readable storage medium as instructions.
