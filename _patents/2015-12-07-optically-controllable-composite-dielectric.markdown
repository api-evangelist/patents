In particular, this invention relates to techniques for producing a dynamically controllable artificial dielectric (AD).","Composite dielectrics are of high interest because their electromagnetic properties can be controlled synthetically. In particular, the method of mixing several dielectric components together to achieve a final effective permittivity is useful for many electromagnetic applications and examples have been around for more than a century. As one example, there may be a need for a particular permittivity to obtain a specific electromagnetic impedance to minimize radio frequency (RF) reflection.","A composite material in which at least one of the components is a good conductor is referred to as an artificial dielectric as coined by W. E. Kock, \u201cMetallic delay lenses,\u201d 27 (1), 59-82 (January 1948). The term \u201cartificial dielectric\u201d is used to distinguish the polarization properties of a conductor from that of an insulating dielectric. The conductor consists of what is known to those skilled in the art as \u201cfree\u201d charge whereas a dielectric insulator consists of \u201cbound\u201d charge. Either achieves a similar polarization response to an applied electric field. A dynamic photo-variable dielectric response can be realized by using a photo-conductive material as a component in the composite dielectric (H. Kallman et al., \u201cInduced conductivity in luminescent powders. II. AC impedance measurements,\u201d 89 (4) 700-707, February 1953). The dielectric permittivity constant of a photo-conductive material as a first component (component-1) can be represented by the complex relation:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["\u025b","p"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"msubsup":{"mi":["\u025b","p","\u2032"]},"mo":"-","mrow":{"mi":"j","mo":"\u2062","mfrac":{"mi":["\u03c3","\u03c9"]}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}}},"where \u2208\u2032is the real part of the permittivity, j=\u221a{square root over (\u22121)} is the imaginary number, \u03c3 is the photo-conductivity, \u03c9 is the angular frequency and the subscript p means photo-conductive particulate. In eqn. (1), the imaginary component stems only from conductivity and is assumed to be much larger than from other dielectric loss effects.","For the case of a two-element material, the permittivity of the second component (component 2) can be represented simply as \u2208, where the subscript b refers to an insulating binder. Here the second component is treated as an insulator and so has conductivity of zero, i.c.,\n\n\u2208=\u2208\u2032.\u2003\u2003(2)\n","Many dielectric mixing equations exist depending on geometrical and material parameters. One popular mixing equation known by those artisans of ordinary skill is the Lichtenecker equation (K. Lichtenecker: \u201cDie Dielektrizit\u00e4ts-konstante nat\u00fcrlicher and kunstlicher Mischk\u00f6rper,\u201d 27, 1926) given by:\n\n\u2208=\u2208\u2208\u2003\u2003(3)\n\nwhere fis the volumetric fill factor of component-1. Note that eqn. (3) is written for a two-component composite dielectric, but can be extended to multiple components (R. Simpkin: \u201cDerivation of Lichtenecker's Logarithmic Mixture Formula from Maxwell's Equations,\u201d 58 (3) 545-550, March 2010.). This equation is generally appropriate for mixtures that are symmetric, meaning that geometrically the particles can be interchanged and the equation remains valid.\n","For the case that the photo-conductive component is within an insulating binder material, then another relation has been shown to be effective from Kevin A.

Practical photo-controllable composite dielectrics require tradeoffs in design to achieve a desired parameter space of operation. One tradeoff is the desire to use highly photo-conductive particulates as the active component in the composite, which has the detrimental effect of limiting the thickness of the material to very thin geometries. For example, utilizing band-to-band transitions of particulates fabricated from semi-conducting materials can limit the optical penetration depth.","Incorporating eqn. (1) into eqn. (4), the effective permittivity is found to change with conductivity.  illustrates a plot of eqn. (4) for three different conductivity values, with the top curves  representing the real part of the permittivity, while the bottom curves  are the imaginary part of the permittivity, which shows frequency dispersion. As conductivity increases, the curves sweep from left to right towards higher frequencies. As the curves sweep past a selected frequency, the effective permittivity changes, thus showing photo-control of the permittivity.","Such a photo-controllable composite dielectric has been demonstrated in which the photo-conductive particulate was undoped semi-insulating (USI) GaAs and the binder component was poly(methyl methacrylate\/urethane resin) (PMMA\/U). See Boulais (2014). USI GaAs demonstrates one advantage of using semi-conducting or semi-insulating particulates that have deep level traps, because light can penetrate deep throughout the material.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["350","360","370","340","350"],"sup":"7 "},"Using higher intensity light is possible to accomplish this, but the alternative method would not be efficient because much of the energy would merely shift the curve to the higher range of frequencies. A more advantageous solution involves a material with a higher value of conductivity at a lower intensity of light to sweep the curve past 10Hz. This renders a more controllable composite dielectric that is more sensitive to light and more efficient.","The selection of natural materials with a desired conductivity can be limiting. In the case of crystalline or organic semiconductors, conductivity is often controlled by doping the material with impurities. The absorption rate can be high when bandgap material is used because direct electron-hole pair generation stems from the lattice atoms instead of the impurities. High absorption can be desirable due to enhanced sensitivity to light, but this can also be less optimal because of limitations in the penetration depth of light. In the case of composite dielectrics, high absorption could limit the light from reaching particulates that are deeper within the material and thereby diminishing controllability of the composite dielectric. Such materials would be limited to very thin inks.","For the aforementioned USI GaAs particulates case, light absorption was minimal enabling light to reach particulates very deep within the composite. The selected wavelength of light only interacted with deep level traps within the material in K. A. Boulais et al.: \u201cCircuit analysis of photosensitive capacitance in semi-insulating GaAs\u201d, 60 (2) 793-798 (February 2013). Direct electron-hole pair generation was suppressed. This led to a tradeoff in lowering sensitivity to light, and restricted the operable frequency range unless high intensity light was used.","Exemplary embodiments relate to a means to a photo-controllable composite dielectric in which the active particulates can be highly photo-absorptive, thus minimizing the need for the tradeoff between optical sensitivity and composite material thickness. Optical absorption is controlled geometrically instead of by material properties alone. Thus, highly absorptive materials can be used while permitting light to penetrate deeper into the composite dielectric to reach particulate throughout. The exemplary technique removes the restriction of low optical absorption for a tunable composite dielectric, such as in the case of conventional USI GaAs. In turn, this process enables new materials to be used that cover a broader range of frequencies while also having higher sensitivity to light.","Here, any range of photo-conductivity can be used without concern of high optical absorption. An example of a material might be a semi-conductor that photo-conducts by light absorption creating direct electron-hole pairs. Absorption in many such materials can be excessive, thereby limiting light penetration to 100 \u03bcm for example. Thus, if the optically controllable artificial dielectric (AD, e.g., ink ) is only 1 \u03bcm thick, then light can reach approximately fifty particulates deep.","Photo-capacitive and Photo-resistive Ink: Based on conductive particulates in binder matrix, one desires to produce a practical and affordable manner of large area (square meters to several square miles) manufacturing of tunable metamaterial (MM) medium and other tunable electronic devices. Exemplary embodiments provide a liquid suspension that covers the surface of insulators, fill cavities or likewise and become part of an electrical circuit.","Alternatively, exemplary embodiments include a solid with particulates imbedded within that are distributed homogeneously or non-homogeneously. For example, a wax material can be used and when heated, the wax flows as an ink  that includes the particulates. When dried, cured or otherwise solidified, this material (herein called liquid suspension) changes the effective capacitance of the covered (or filled) medium to any electrical signal traveling through the medium when illuminated with light.","This change in capacitance is related to a functional dependence of the intensity of light. The functional dependence could be linear, logarithmic or any other mathematical form depending on the particulate material of choice, such as USI GaAs and Si. Weak intensities of the illuminating light produce small capacitance changes and high intensities of the illuminating light will produce large capacitance changes. In addition, the change in capacitance can be inversely proportional to any mathematical form that describes the intensity of the illuminating light.","The liquid suspension components (e.g., binder ) will also determine the sensitivity to light and which type of light (infrared, visible, ultraviolet) produces the desired effect. In addition, the particle size and volumetric fraction of the suspension's components affect the optically controllable AD properties under illumination and both properties can be used as parameters to design a medium that satisfies specific requirements for the electronic circuit of interest. The active component of the ink  is the particulates , but the binding matrix can play an important role to enhance the effect.","There are two fundamental mechanisms to transfer an electrical signal through an arbitrary medium, such as the binder : conduction and induction. Here the actual electrical charges move through the binder medium with an effective drift velocity. The ability of an electrical charge to travel through the medium varies greatly from material to material. This property is known as the conductivity of the medium or its reciprocal known as the resistivity.","Conductivity and resistivity are the two physical parameters known with the highest ratio between the largest known value and the smallest. For known values, the ratio of conductivity-to-resistivity between the most conductive materials known (not including superconductors) to the least conductive is on the order of 10. When superconductors are considered, this ratio effectively becomes infinitively large.","Another way that electrical signals can travel through a medium is by the mechanism known as displacement. Here the electrical charges do not physically travel through the medium, but rather the electrical information travels by changing the polarization of sectors imbedded in the medium. Materials with imbedded polarization are classed as dielectrics, and the property that measures this property is the dielectric constant. There is a large range of dielectric values among the materials, but not nearly as large as in the case of conductivity. For an electrical signal travel via displacement must vary with time.","An example of time-varying electrical signal is the alternating current (AC) that feeds electricity to home appliances. An ideal insulator is a medium that does not permit any conduction but enables displacement. Such medium can be placed between two conductors in a manner that electrical energy can be stored in such device. This device is commonly known as a capacitor or condenser. Since the early days of electronics, the value of a capacitor has been recognized. Capacitors are used in almost every circuit that uses AC electricity.","By varying the dimensions of the electrodes and insulator, different values of capacitance can be achieved. Traditionally, when a capacitor capable of a capacitance change is used, the capacitance change is achieved by mechanical means. This means that somehow either changing the relative surface area of the electrodes, or changing the distance of the gap between the electrodes, using mechanical devises, achieves the required capacitance. Mechanical devises are very slow compared to the times required in some applications (durations as small as 10sec). For applications where mechanical actuators cannot be used, changing the capacitance using light could be the desired solution.","Photo-capacitance is the ability to change the effective capacitance of a medium using light. In the 1970s many researchers used this property to characterize the electrical properties of GaAs and as a quality control criterion. GaAs photo-capacitance is optimally produced by infrared light (approx. 0.950 \u03bcm wavelength) when using sub-bandgap light energies that interact with deep level traps.","A very simple and effective photo-capacitor can be made by placing a GaAs wafer between two metal electrodes and impose illumination. When such device is connected to a high frequency AC resonant electric circuit, the resonance frequency will change by changing the intensity of the infrared light. Boulais (2013) demonstrated the ability of GaAs tuning a split-ring resonator (SRR) from 100 MHz up to 1.8 GHz by changing the intensity of infrared light illuminating a GaAs crystal placed in the \u201cgap\u201d of the ring. An SRR is an electrical structure that consists of a conductor shaped as a ring with a small gap. The gap is used to provide the ring with capacitance. These structures have been extensively studied in the last fourteen years because of artisan interest in electromagnetic metamaterials.","Metamaterials are periodic structures of electrical devices. These structures potentially have the ability to show electromagnetic properties like electrical permittivity and magnetic permeability very different to any known natural material. Metamaterials can have remarkable properties, but they are inherently resonant structures. This means that they tend to exhibit their properties in one narrow frequency value, including the development of tunable metamaterials.","The results of Boulais (2013) are the first to demonstrate the possibility of a large bandwidth tunable metamaterial. However, satisfaction of military (and commercial) needs by metamaterials requires developing the capability to manufacture large structures in an economical and practical way. These GaAs single crystal photo-capacitors placed in the SRR's gap are not a cost-effective solution to the manufacturing process. A better solution is an ink substance that can be printed on split-ring gaps at large area fast production factories. The manufacturing process can be accomplished with the exemplary photo-capacitive ink . Exemplary devices can be used to tune any device as well as frequency selective surfaces and non-periodic structures, and not only metamaterials.","Exemplary embodiments provide a medium that features an electrical capacitance or conductance change when illuminated with light. The components within the medium include photoconductive pigment, such as from semiconductor particulates  (e.g., USI GaAs and Si). The medium features photo-capacitance in powder form, other types of photoconductive media also in powder form, and any binder  that could be solvent-based. Binders could include thermoplastic solid materials, such as wax.","In all methods, the powder components may be surface modified to enhance compatibility with the binder. The exemplary sample used poly-(methyl methacrylate) (or PMMA) as the polymer, intrinsic GaAs in powder form, and acetone or (CH)CO as the solvent. An alternate exemplary sample used semiconductor grade wax, such as Aremco Products Inc. Crystalbond\u2122 509 (translucent to the frequency of infrared light being used), and intrinsic GaAs in powder form.","The purpose of the dielectric is to create large capacitance between the particulates . The purpose of the particulate  (that form the pigment) is to provide a lossy capacitance in which the loss is optically controlled. All the components are mixed in solution and the suspension is applied in the part of the circuit component to be tuned using light. Thus, the real part (curves ) of the dielectric constant of the medium mixture can be adjusted by optically controlling the imaginary part (curves ) of the dielectric through the Kramers-Konig relation, which is well known to artisans of ordinary skill.","Prior to mixing, the surface properties of the powder materials may be adjusted using surface modifying groups, such as alkyl-silane or alkyl-phosphonate molecules, to enhance integration with the other mixture components. (Alkyl-phosphonates are esters of phosphoric acid.) The suspension is permitted to completely dry. Once dried the newly formed electrical photocapacitor is connected to a high frequency AC electrical circuit. The resonant frequency of the AC circuit is measured, and the ink  is illuminated with light. In exemplary embodiments, a solid-state infrared laser has been used to illuminate at an infrared wavelength of 0.950 \u03bcm. The intensity of the light is varied, and the resonant frequency of the circuit changes.","A mathematical model can be used to clarify the electrical behavior of the tunable pigment based ink  in an example configuration. The model  defines the ingredients of the ink  in terms of electrical components ,  and . The behavior is then clearly evident even though in practice the physical implementation can be quite different. For example, the model  assumes a periodic arrangement of unit cells  (medium) and  (particulate), but in practice the arrangement can be random.","In the exemplary model, the photo-sensitive pigments component of the optically controllable AD or ink  in one such application are particulates of semiconducting or semi-insulating materials. However, they can also be other materials such as photo-conductive polymers, photo-sensitive molecular doped polymers, liquid crystal powder, and barium titanate (BaTiO) powder, for example. Thus, a single particulate can be represented electrically as a parallel combination of one resistor  and one capacitor . The binder  surrounding the particulates  forming the matrix is assumed to be purely insulating and is represented in terms of pure capacitance .","The binder  must be transparent or translucent to the photon-energy such that light can reach pigment material deep within the material, although exceptionally thin inks  might not require this restriction (single layer for example). The light causes an increase in conductive charge which changes the electric and magnetic dipole moment of the particulate .","Although it is not necessary, binder materials with high dielectric constant and low loss tangent have better performance because high permittivity can increase the tuning range of capacitance and resistance. Candidate materials for the binder  can be, but not limited to, polymer ceramic (e.g., polysiloxanes), strontium titanate (SrTiO), titanium dioxide (TiO), and magnesium titanate (MgTiO). The model  assumes a periodic arrangement of unit cells consisting of particulates  and binder  that are arranged in a block-like structure. Further, magnetic materials can be added to the binder material to control the magnetic properties.

For a particular GaAs size, several formulations with varying volume fractions of GaAs particulates  to polymer binder  were also evaluated. Photo-capacitance has been observed in all samples. However, there were significant differences in the amount of photo-capacitance observed. For GaAs particles, a size of about 0.5 mm\u00d70.5 mm\u00d71.00 mm in a volume of GaAs to polymer, provided the largest photo-capacitance effect of all formulation attempted.","To date, a formulation has not been produced with a photo-capacitance effect as large as in single crystal GaAs, which has effectively a volume fraction ratio of unity, or V=1.

The electric dipoles from the inclusions are controlled by photo-generation of charge carriers using infrared light. An infrared transparent binder provides the matrix material. An important feature of the exemplary process is that the permittivity is linear with electric field intensity over a useable parameter space.","The primary application involves a pigment based ink , or paint, to be utilized as a tuning mechanism for metamaterials and other resonant based structures. Other applications include a controllable gradient index lens in which inhomogeneous light intensity can provide a dynamic response for focusing or steering of beams, and RF circuit elements including filters, phase delays, antennae and other microwave devices.","Frequency selective surfaces (FSS) are EM materials that also have a periodic arrangement of resonant conductive inclusions that can be used to control EM radiation. The FSS is typically fabricated in planar form to control the transmission or reflection properties of EM radiation. In terms of wave propagation in a periodic structure, the FSS utilizes the optical branch and the MM utilizes the acoustic branch. The electromagnetic bandgap (EMB) between these branches provides a stop-band that is useful to minimize surface waves, for example.","Exemplary embodiments provide dynamic control to the effective permittivity of an AD by using light by exploiting photo-conductive particulates  in place of the fixed conductors used for static ADs. Infrared light is used to \u201cshort out\u201d the parasitic capacitance of the particulates leaving only the series capacitance between the particulates.","The change in internal capacitance appears as a constituent change in permittivity for wavelengths much greater than the particulate size and spacing. As a dynamically controllable AD by optical photon stimuli, the notion of a controllable lens in which an EM beam can be focused to various lengths, or steered in different directions comes to mind. Of particular interest is the incorporation of these materials as a pigment based ink  that can be printed at low cost to tune resonant MM, EBG and FSS structures, or RF components such as filters, phase delays and small antennae.","In experimental results, active particulates  were prepared by pulverizing USI GaAs using a mortise and pedestal.

Low frequency signals were found to aid in accurate resistive loss measurements. An HP-4284A precision LCR meter  capable of frequencies up to 1 MHz was used for the measurements in series resistance-capacitance mode. A 100 mV signal voltage was employed to measure the complex impedance as a function of optical power density, gap length and probe frequency.
