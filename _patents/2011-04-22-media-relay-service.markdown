title: Media relay service
abstract: Disclosed are various embodiments for a call control application bridges communication devices with a media call. In one embodiment, the call control application receives a request to place a media call from a source device to a destination device. The call control application determines if at least one of the source device and the destination device is associated with a telephone number registered in a relay registry. In response to a determination that the telephone number is registered in the registry, the call control application directs an intermediary agent to place a first media call to the source device and a second media call to the destination device. The call control application then bridges the first media call and the second media call via the intermediary agent.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Users can communicate with each other on electronic communication devices such as telephones, cellular phones, smart phones, computers and\/or other such devices. For example, a user can dial a phone number or some other unique identifier to be in direct communication with another user. However, a deaf and\/or hard-of-hearing person may find it difficult to use a traditional communication device such as a telephone and\/or a cellular phone. For instance, the deaf and\/or hard-of-hearing person is hearing-impaired and thus would not be able to effectively communicate with a hearing-enabled person over a telephone. Additionally, in some instances, a hearing-impaired person communicates exclusively using sign language. As such, a telephone and\/or a cellular phone is not an effective device for a hearing-impaired person.","Disclosed are embodiments for a non-transitory computer-readable medium embodying a program executable that comprises code that receives an electronic request to place a media call, code that determines whether either the source device or the destination device is registered in a relay registry, code that employs an intermediary agent to originate a first media call to the source device and a second media call to the destination device, and code that bridges the first media call and the second media call to form a connection between the source device, destination device and the intermediary agent.","Further, disclosed are embodiments for a system having a computing device that includes a call control executable comprising logic that receives a request from a source device to place a call to a destination device, logic that determines whether either the source device or the destination device is associated with a telephone number registered in a relay registry, logic that originates a call to the source device and the destination device, and logic that connects the source device and the destination device based on a location of a impaired user with respect to the source device and the destination device.","Additionally, disclosed are embodiments for method comprising receiving in a call control from a source device an electronic request to place a video call to a destination device, determining if at least one of the source device and the destination device is associated with a telephone number registered in a relay registry, originating a first video call to the source device and a second video call to the destination device in response to the determination, and bridging the first video call with the second video call.","Disclosed are embodiments for connecting a source device and a destination device with a media call where at least one of the users of the source device and the destination device is deaf and\/or hard-of-hearing (hereinafter \u201chearing-impaired\u201d). In the following discussion, a general description of the system and its components is provided, followed by a discussion of the operation of the same.","U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,206,386 entitled \u201cMethod and System for Electronic Communication with the Hearing Impaired,\u201d 7,746,984 entitled \u201cMethod and System for Call Initiation in a Video Relay Service,\u201d and 7,746,985 entitled \u201cMethod, System and Device for Relay Call Transfer Service\u201d are incorporated herein by reference. As described in these patents, a video relay service can be utilized to aid hearing-impaired telephone users to communicate with hearing-capable users. For instance, as described in the above-listed patents, a video relay service can establish a first communication with a first device with a voice phone and establish a second communication with a second device.

In one embodiment, the intermediary agent  may be a computer system having computing capability. In another embodiment, the intermediary agent  may be a human being.","Next, a general description of the operation of the various components of the networked environment  is provided. To begin, a user on the source device  submits a request to place a media call to the destination device . The call control  receives and processes the request for the media call and directs the API  to determine if a user having a user id on the source device  and\/or the destination device  is registered in the relay registry . Upon a determination that a user is registered in the relay registry , the call control  directs the media server  to connect the source device  and the destination device  with a media call. In one embodiment, the call control  may direct the media server  to directly connect the source device  and the destination device , as will be described with respect to . In another embodiment, the call control  may direct the media server  to connect the source device  and the destination device  via the intermediary agent , as will be described with respect to .

It is understood that the flowchart of  provides merely an example of the many different types of functional arrangements that may be employed to implement the operation of the portion of the call control  as described herein. As an alternative, the flowchart of  may be viewed as depicting an example of steps of a method implemented in the computing device  () according to one or more embodiments.","According to one embodiment, the call control  directly connects the source device  with the destination device  with a media call, such as for instance, a video call. The call control  determines if at least one user on the source device  and\/or destination device  is registered in the relay registry . Upon making this determination, the call control  makes a media call to the source device , a media call to the destination device , and then bridges the two media calls into one connection.","Beginning with line , the call control  receives a request for a media call from the media application  on the source device . For instance, the call control  may execute the API  to process the request for the media call. In one embodiment, the request may be an electronic request such as an email, a text message, a request made through a browser, a telephone call and\/or any other form of electronic communication. The request may contain information identifying the source device  and the destination device  to which a media call is requested. For instance, the information may include a telephone number for the source device, such as, a mobile phone number and\/or a telephone number for a land line. In addition, the information may also include a user id  that uniquely identifies the user on the source device  and\/or the user on destination device . Next, in line , the API  transmits an acknowledgement back to the media application  on the source device . For instance, the acknowledgement may be an electronic communication such as an email and\/or text message that confirms receipt of the request for the media call.","In line , the API  determines whether the source device  and\/or the destination device  is associated with a telephone number registered in the relay registry . Alternatively, the API  may also determine if a user on the source device  and\/or destination device  having a user id  is registered in the relay registry . For example, the relay registry  may be the iTRS database and\/or any other hearing-impaired registry that documents deaf and\/or hard-of-hearing users. In one embodiment, the API  gathers the user id(s)  included as a parameter in the electronic request for the media call sent by the source device  and determines if the user id(s)  is found in the relay registry . As shown in line , the API  denies the request for the media call if no user id  and\/or telephone number associated with the source device  and\/or the destination device  is found in the relay registry . For instance, the API  may transmit an electronic notification back to the source device  denying the request.","Next, in line , the API  determines that at least one user id  and\/or telephone number associated with the source device  and\/or the destination device  is found in the relay registry . In line , responsive to this determination, the API  passes the parameters included in the request for the media call onto the call control . For instance, the parameters may include a telephone number, user id , and\/or any other type of parameter for the source device  and\/or the destination device .","Upon receiving the parameters, the call control  directs the media server  to first make a media call to the source device  as shown in line . In one embodiment, the media server  makes a media call using a telephone number that may be included in the parameters of the request. For instance, the media server  may make a video call to the telephone number where the source device  is a video phone. A media application  on the source device  may respond to video call made by the media server . In another embodiment, the media server  may determine contact information for the source device  with the user id . For instance, the media server  may determine an internet protocol (IP) address for the source device  from the user id  that can be used to initiate a video call with the source device . Having made the media call to the source device , the media server  notifies the call control  that a successful connection with the source device  has been made, as shown by line .","In line , the call control  directs the media server  to make a media call to the destination device .

For instance, the media server  may make the call using the parameters included in the request for the media call, such as a telephone number associated with the destination device  and\/or a user id  of a user on the destination device . A media application  on the destination device  may receive the video call made by the media server . Having made the media call to the destination device , the media server  notifies the call control  that a successful connection with the destination device  has been made, as shown by line .","Next, in line , the call control  sends a command to the media server  to bridge the two media calls made to the source device  and the destination device . As shown by line , the media server  bridges the two media calls forming a direct connection between the source device  and the destination device .

The media server  directs the intermediary agent  to first make a media call to the source device  in line . For instance, the media server  may provide identifying information for the source device  to the intermediary agent , such as, for instance, a telephone number associated with the source device , the user id  for a user on the source device , and\/or any other type of identifying information.","In line , the intermediary agent  makes a media call to the source device . Using the above example, the intermediary agent  makes a video call to the source device  since the API  determined that a hearing-impaired user is on the source device . The video call may be received by the media application  on the source device . In another embodiment, the intermediary agent  may make a different type of media call such as, for instance, an audio call, a three-dimensional video call, and\/or any other type of media call. Having made the media call to the source device , the intermediary agent  notifies the media server  that a successful media call was executed in line . For instance, the intermediary agent  may send an electronic notification as an acknowledgement of the media call.","In response to receiving the acknowledgement of line , the media server  then directs the intermediary agent  to make a media call to the destination device .

Using the above example, the hearing-impaired user on the source device  communicates with the intermediary agent  via the video call. For instance, the hearing-impaired user may communicate using sign language. The user on the destination device  communicates with the intermediary agent  via the audio call, for instance, the user may communicate using normal speech. In one embodiment, the intermediary agent  translates the sign language used to communicate with the hearing-impaired user on the source device  to the speech used to communicate with the user on the destination device , and vice versa.","In one embodiment, the video call to the source device  and the audio call to the destination device  may not be bridged to form one connection.
