{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, imported, sold, and licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America without the payment to me of any royalty thereon.","This invention relates in general to the field of antennas. In particular, this invention relates to an automatic antenna-switching apparatus that allows the user to connect a single multiband communications platform to several antennas and automatically switch between antennas based on the selected frequency without additional user actions.","There are numerous situations where maintaining continuous tactical military communications is a mission critical requirement. Interruptions in communications can cause confusion, tactical disadvantages and a potential loss of life. Achieving continuous communications capability in the military is made more difficult by the fact that our armed forces often use numerous different types of communications platforms employing different and distinct frequencies and antennas, such as the AN\/PSC-5, EPLRS, SATCOM radios and future Joint Tactical Radio System (\u201cJTRS\u201d) terminals.","The difficulties caused by a multiplicity of frequencies and communications devices are exacerbated by the additional complexities caused by operating such different communications devices at a single location or in confined areas. Furthermore, the large number of different communications devices, each with its own unique operating frequency and energy polarization schemes have also spawned a corresponding number of unique antenna systems designed for each specific military radio. Similar situations may also occur in commercial environments such as shipping, transportation and finance where continuous communications are needed amidst multiple communications systems. Multiband communications could become more reliable with a simplified system that permits the user to use a single multiband communications platform with a group of different antennas organized with an autonomous antenna switching apparatus into a single and simplified communications system.","Current military use of the 225\u2013400 MHz spectrum provides a cogent example of the long-felt need for such a simplified system. Most military users of the 225\u2013400 MHz band have adopted vertically polarized energy by convention. However, a small portion of the 225\u2013400 MHz band dedicated to satellite communications requires circular, not vertical, polarization. Adopting the unique conventions for SATCOM signal polarization allows for less interference between satellite and terrestrial VHF communications systems. Prior art passive RF selection devices are unable to determine the precise boundaries of the satellite sub-band and are therefore incapable of selecting the proper antenna.","Thus there has been a long-felt need for communications equipment that permits users to connect a single multiband communications platform to several different antennas and automatically switch between the antennas without suffering from the dangers, disadvantages, shortcomings and limitations of complex and costly equipment and interrupted communications from prior art passive RF selection arrangements. Prior art passive radio frequency selectors are considered deficient because their unintended emissions are losses that can also generate increased RFI\/EMI concerns on platforms fitted with multiple antennas.","In order to satisfy this long-felt need for connecting a multiband communications platform to multiple antennas, the present invention provides an automatic antenna-switching apparatus which allows the military and commercial user to connect a single multiband communications platform to a group of antennas with different frequencies by detecting the actual RF energy input and automatically switching to the desired antenna in the group of antennas, without suffering from the problems, shortcomings, disadvantages and limitations of prior art passive selection devices. The present invention provides an automatic antenna-switching apparatus that detects an RF energy input representing the user's selected frequency and makes a logical decision through embedded software to select the properly polarized and matched antenna for the intended radio band. In accordance with the present invention, the automatic antenna-switching apparatus could be provided with either fixed output antenna port selections, or re-programmable selection points to adapt to additional or future bandwidth and antenna requirements. The types of military radios where this apparatus could be used include: the AN\/PSC-5, AN\/PRC-117, AN\/PRC-113, URC-200 and the JTRS system. In commercial communications, the automatic antenna-switching apparatus could be employed in communications centers and in developing mobile communications centers designed to bridge communications systems between military, public service and Homeland Defense missions or applications. This invention's automatic antenna-switching device permits the commercial and military user to employ multiple communications platforms, automatically and autonomously switch from one antenna to another and maintain communications without suffering from the problems, shortcomings, disadvantages and limitations of interrupted service through changes in radio transceivers, or manual selection of antenna systems.","It is an object of the present invention to provide an antenna-switching apparatus for switching between multiple antennas.","It is another object of the present invention to provide an automatic antenna-switching apparatus for a multiband communications platform to automatically switch between multiple antennas.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide an automatic antenna-switching system for a multiband communications platform to automatically switch between multiple antennas based on detecting RF energy from a multiband radio system and selecting the appropriate antenna that matches the frequency and required polarization of the RF energy.","These and other objects can now be advantageously attained by an automatic antenna-switching apparatus comprising a multiband radio system, a single RF input port, a means for antenna-switching and a group of connected antennas. In accordance with the present invention, the user tunes the multiband radio system to the desired frequency, the automatic antenna-switching apparatus detects an RF signal input and then automatically selects an antenna optimized for the desired portion of the spectrum from the connected antennas based on the frequency represented by the RF signal input, e.g. VHF High Frequency from 108\u2013224 MHz. The present invention also includes an automatic antenna-switching system and a method for automatically switching antennas for a multiband communications device to different frequencies.","Referring now to , which is a conceptual flow diagram of the automatic antenna-switching apparatus of the present invention, the automatic antenna-switching apparatus  comprises an RF input port , a means for RF sensing , a means for antenna port selection  and a plurality of different output antennas \u2013. A multiband radio system capable of transmitting over a range of frequencies, which is represented by box , sends RF energy  to an RF input port . The RF energy  travels to a group of RF output connectors \u2013 and is sampled by an RF sensing coil . The RF energy  is sent to the RF sensing means , which senses the RF energy  with a means for frequency counting. The frequency counting means determines the exact frequency represented by the RF energy  during a particular radio transmission. The RF sensing means  sends a frequency count output  to the antenna port selection means . The antenna port selection means  further comprises software to compare the frequency count output  with the available connected output antennas \u2013. The antenna port selection means  can also include a port selection logic circuit. An external software logic programming port  permits the user to modify the software of the antenna selection means  when changing the output antennas \u2013. The antenna port selection means  provides an antenna selection output  to a selected one of the RF output connectors \u2013, which, in turn, switches on the corresponding output antenna \u2013. A conditioning power supply  provides electrical power for the internal circuits of the apparatus . The automatic antenna-switching apparatus  is enclosed in a metal container  in order to improve environmental operations, as well as minimize or eliminate unwanted radio frequency interference of passive RF energy multi-port couplers, through signal leakage to a non-selected antenna \u2013.","The automatic antenna-switching apparatus  will select the proper connected output antenna \u2013 based upon a user selected operating frequency on a transmission-by-transmission basis. The automatic antenna-switching apparatus  of the present invention functions autonomously, in that it operates automatically without user input or awareness of its operation. The power supply  further comprises a broad input, polarization insensitive direct current power supply, capable of receiving primary power from both military and civilian platforms. In the preferred embodiment, the automatic antenna-switching apparatus  is connected to a multiband radio system , however, the automatic antenna-switching apparatus  is versatile and the user can disconnect the multiband radio system  and connect a single frequency, trunked or spread spectrum communications service instead.","In operation, when the multiband radio system  is connected to the automatic antenna-switching apparatus , the user tunes the multiband radio system  to the desired operating frequency, e.g. VHF High Frequency from 108\u2013224 MHz, and the multiband radio system  is momentarily keyed to send the RF energy  to the RF input port . This keying function could either be deliberate to activate the antenna-switching apparatus , or incidental with the initial attempted communications by the user. Additionally, the connected output antennas \u2013 could be configured for either the fixed portions of the frequency\/polarization band or programmable for changes in the future with an external common serial connector, or an internal connector.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["10","24","27","24","27","24","25","26","27","26","10"]},"Numerous variations of the automatic antenna-switching apparatus  of the present invention are possible. For example, the automatic antenna-switching apparatus  can also support single frequency, trunked and spread spectrum communications services. The automatic antenna-switching apparatus  can be used in mobile communications platforms, fixed site communication stations, installed in any position or orientation and can also be sealed to be weather proof. The present invention also contemplates an automatic antenna-switching system comprising the multiband communications device , the antenna-switching apparatus  and a plurality of communications antennas \u2013.","Referring back to , the present invention also contemplates a method of automatically switching antennas for a communications device to different frequencies, comprising the steps of connecting an RF input port  to a communications device , receiving RF energy  from the communication device , the RF energy  having a given frequency, forming an RF sensing coil , connecting the RF input port  to the RF sensing coil  and a plurality of output antenna connectors \u2013 and connecting the plurality of output antenna connectors \u2013 to a plurality of output antennas \u2013, each output antenna having a plurality of antenna characteristics, forming a means for RF sensing  to include a means for frequency counting, forming a means for antenna port selection  to include a means for frequency comparison and placing the RF input port , the RF tuning coil , the RF sensing means , the antenna port selection means  and a plurality of output antenna connectors \u2013 into a metal housing . The method of the present invention also comprises the steps of providing the RF energy  from the RF sensing coil  to the means for RF sensing , sending a frequency count output  from the RF sensing means  to the means for antenna port selection , comparing the frequency count output  with the plurality of antenna characteristics to generate an antenna selection output , providing the antenna selection output  from the antenna port selection means  to a selected one of the plurality of RF output connectors \u2013, switching on one of the plurality of output antennas \u2013 that correspond to the selected RF output connector and transmitting the RF energy  on the corresponding one of the plurality of output antennas \u2013. In the preferred embodiment of the method of the present invention, the communications device  can be a multiband communications device.","The variations of the automatic antenna-switching apparatus can also apply to this invention's automatic antenna-switching system and the method of automatically switching antennas for a multiband communications device to different frequencies.","It is to be further understood that other features and modifications to the foregoing detailed description are within the contemplation of the present invention, which is not limited by this detailed description. Those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that any number of configurations of the present invention and numerous modifications and combinations of materials, components, arrangements and dimensions can achieve the results described herein, without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention.
