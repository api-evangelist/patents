The novel salt can be prepared by an efficient, economic and reproducible process and particularly suited to large-scale preparation. The oxalate salt is therefore surprisingly amenable to large scale pharmaceutical processing and formulation.","The present invention also relates to three novel polymorphic forms (I, II and III) of Donepezil oxalate, which are characterized by powder X-ray diffraction and or infrared absorption peaks recorded in potassium bromide.","Polymorphic crystals of compound (R) oxalate are hereafter referred as Oxalate form (I), Oxalate form (II) and Oxalate form (III).","The oxalate provides a melting point in the range of from 170 to 180\u00b0 C., such as 175 to 180\u00b0 C., for Oxalate form (I) and Oxalate form (II), and a melting point in the range of from 95 to 96\u00b0 C. for Oxalate form (III).","The present invention encompasses the oxalate salts isolated in a purified form. Also, the invention provides the oxalate salts in a pharmaceutically-acceptable form, especially in bulk form, such form having good flow properties, especially good bulk flow properties.","The invention also provides a process for the preparation of the oxalate, in which 1-benzyl-4-[(5,6-dimethoxy-1-indanone)-2-yl]methyl piperidine (compound R) is preferably dispersed or dissolved in a suitable solvent and reacted with oxalic acid; and thereafter the oxalate formed is recovered by filtration.","A suitable solvent is an alkanol, for example propan-2-ol, or a hydrocarbon, such as toluene, a ketone, such as acetone, an ester, such as ethyl acetate, an ether such as tetrahydrofuran, a nitrile such as acetonitrile, a halogenated hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane.","The concentration of compound (R) is preferably in the range of from 3 to 25% weight\/volume, more preferably in the range of from 5 to 20%. The concentration of oxalic acid solution is preferably in the range of from 3 to 50% weight\/volume.","The reaction is usually carried out at ambient temperature or at an elevated temperature, although any convenient temperature that provides the required product may be employed. A preferred temperature is in the range of about 20 to about 120\u00b0 C., such as 40\u00b0 C. to 90\u00b0 C., or more preferably about 70\u00b0 C.","Oxalate Form (I) Crystals","The powder X-ray diffraction pattern of oxalate form I crystals is shown in .
