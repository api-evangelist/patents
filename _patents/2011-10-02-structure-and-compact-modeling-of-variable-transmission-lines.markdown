The government of the United States may have certain rights to the disclosed subject matter.","The present invention relates to the field of circuit design, and more particularly relates to a structure and model for variable transmission lines.","The present invention provides a fabricated variable transmission line that is digitally tuned. Digital tuning of the transmission line enables the compensation of process variation in both the active and passive devices of the RF design. Along with several embodiments of the variable transmission line, the present invention also provides a method of compact modeling. The variable transmission line structure and compact modeling enables circuit level simulation using a parametric device that in one embodiment can be included as an integral part of a silicon foundry design kit. Variable transmission lines provide several advantages including enabling more accurate RFIC design in silicon technologies that have high variability.","There is thus provided in accordance with the invention, a variable transmission line comprising a semiconductor substrate, a signal line, a first plurality of capacitor ports below the signal line, each capacitor port operative to be connected to either ground or a floating potential, a bottom ground plane and one or more side shield wires.","There is also provided in accordance with the invention, a variable transmission line comprising a semiconductor substrate, a signal line, plurality of capacitor ports below the signal line, each capacitor port operative to be connected to either ground or a floating potential, a bottom ground plane, one or more side shield wires surrounding the signal line and wherein characteristic impedance of the transmission is tuned by connecting each capacitor port to either ground or a floating potential and maintaining constant the one or more side shield wires.","There is further provided in accordance with the invention, a variable transmission line comprising a semiconductor substrate, a signal line, a plurality of capacitor ports that substantially surround the signal line forming a tunnel like structure, each capacitor port operative to be connected to either ground or a floating potential, a bottom ground plane, one or more side shield wires surrounding the signal line and wherein characteristic impedance of the transmission is tuned by connecting one or more of the plurality of capacitor ports to either ground or a floating potential and maintaining constant the one or more side shield wires.","The present invention provides a fabricated variable transmission line that is digitally tuned. Digital tuning of the transmission line enables the compensation of process variation in both the active and passive devices of the RF design. Along with several embodiments of the variable transmission line, the present invention also provides a method of compact modeling. The variable transmission line structure and compact modeling enables circuit level simulation using a parametric device that in one embodiment can be included as an integral part of a silicon foundry design kit. The use of variable transmission lines provide several advantages including enabling more accurate RFIC design in silicon technologies that have high variability.","A diagram illustrating a cross-sectional view of an example embodiment of the variable transmission line of the present invention is shown in . The general two-dimensional (2D) plan, generally referenced , comprises a signal line (S) , a plurality of side shields (R, R, . . . , Rn) ,  on either side of the signal line , a bottom ground , crossing lines ,  and capacitor port (C port) lines . The C port lines are effective to modify the capacitance which is significantly changed when a C port line is coupled to ground. The one or more side shields are effective to modify the inductance L of the transmission line by controlling the return current through the transmission line.","A diagram illustrating a top-plan view of an example embodiment of the variable transmission line of the present invention is shown in . The two-dimensional (2D) plan, generally referenced , comprises a signal line (S) , side shields (R) ,  on either side of the signal line , a bottom ground (not shown), crossing lines ,  and capacitor port (C port) lines . Note that for clarity sake the structure in  shows only one side shield R on either side of the signal line. It is appreciated, that any number of side shield lines may be used.","The structures shown in  enable a digitally controlled, independent modification of both the capacitance and the inductance of the structure. This enables the entire functional space of the variable transmission line to be covered. For example, the effective electrical length of the device can be modified while the impedance is kept constant. In addition, it is possible to only the modify the capacitance while keeping the inductance constant, as well as modifying the inductance while keeping the capacitance constant, etc.","In one embodiment, the capacitance is modified by connecting zero or more C port lines either to ground or to a floating potential. The C port lines are placed physically close and orthogonal to the signal wire of the transmission line. Further, the mechanism provides for the grouping of the orthogonal wires (i.e. C port lines) thereby enabling more accurate modeling of variable length transmission lines.","In one embodiment, the inductance of the variable transmission line structure is modified by switching the return current of the transmission line between several side shielding wires. This effectively changes the loop area and the resulting inductance per unit length. The change of capacitance in this case, however, is negligible. This creates a variable transmission line whose capacitance and inductance can be independently tuned.","Note that the characteristic impedance Zof the variable transmission line is a function of the capacitance C and inductance L only and is given in Equation 1 below. This assumes that the skin effect resistance losses and silicon losses are sufficiently low, which is justified in the high frequencies used in millimeter wave design.\n\n\u2003\u2003(1)\n","The variation of capacitance or inductance leads to a variation in characteristic impedance of the transmission line. The tuning range of characteristic impedance is related to the range of its variation.","In many practical cases capacitance only variation may be sufficient to get a wide tuning range for the characteristic impedance of the transmission line. In this case, only the C port line needs to be used while keeping the side shields constant. By grounding or floating the crossing lines the variation of capacitance and resulting variation in characteristic impedance is achieved. The structures of variable transmission lines with capacitance variation only presented here are convenient for compact modeling of such structures.","Several example 3D diagrams of variable transmission line structures are presented infra. A diagram illustrating a perspective view of an example embodiment of the variable transmission line of the present invention incorporating long C port lines is shown in . The variable transmission line structure, generally referenced , comprises a signal line , side shields , , long C port lines  and ground plane . The long C port lines in this embodiment extend under the signal line and the side shields.","A diagram illustrating a perspective view of an example embodiment of the variable transmission line of the present invention incorporating short C port lines is shown in . The variable transmission line structure, generally referenced , comprises a signal line , side shields , , short C port lines  and ground plane . The short C port lines in this embodiment extend under the signal line only and do not extend to the side shields.","Note that the variable transmission line structures shown in  comprise crossing lines which extend only under the signal line or under the signal line and side shields. In one embodiment, the signal line may comprise the highest metal layer of the given back-end-of-line (BEOL) metal-dielectric stack in order to be able to achieve a maximum possible characteristic impedance. The transmission line structure with long C port lines () has a smaller tuning range for the characteristic impedance compared with the structure with short C port lines ().","Short C port lines increase the tuning range considerably since their capacitance to ground is much lower and hence the floating potential of the shorter C port lines is closer to the signal potential and further from the ground potential. When the C port lines are switched to their ground potential short and long C port lines behave approximately the same.","The connection of long C port lines to ground (for switching purposes), however, may be simpler since it can be done beyond the side shields. In the case of short C port lines () the connection of the short C port lines to the switching transistors is achieved using vias going down through holes in the bottom ground plane down to the silicon surface.","The vias which connect between the C port lines and the switching transistors below (which switch the C port lines from the floating to grounded state) have a detrimental effect on the tuning range. This is due to the fact that the vias have relatively large capacitance to the bottom ground plane and therefore they reduce the C port lines potential in its floating state down to the ground potential. For smaller overall length of the variable transmission line, this via effect becomes stronger since there are more such vias per unit length.","In the structure of , the long C port line length has residual capacitance when in the floating state (effectively adding capacitance to the side shields) which limits the tuning range of the transmission line. Use of short C port lines in the structure of  (described below) corrects for this. The shorted C port line, however, is more sensitive to the actual manner in this the C port line is connected to ground.","In an alternative embodiment, the crossing lines and C port lines may be not only under the signal line as in  but over the signal line as well. Structures with double C port lines under and over the signal line are presented below. A diagram illustrating a perspective view of an example embodiment of the variable transmission line of the present invention incorporating long C port lines both under and over the signal line is shown in . The variable transmission line structure, generally referenced , comprises a signal line , side shields , , long C port lines  below the signal line and long C port lines  above the signal line, and ground plane . Note that the long C port lines in this example structure extend both under and over the signal line and side shields.","A diagram illustrating a perspective view of an example embodiment of the variable transmission line of the present invention incorporating short C port lines under the signal line and long C port lines over the signal line which form a tunnel structure is shown in . The variable transmission line structure, generally referenced , comprises a signal line , side shields , , long C port lines  that extend above the signal line and side shields , , short C port lines that extend below and to the sides of the signal line , and ground plane . Note that the long C port lines in this example structure extend over the signal line and side shields and C port lines that extend under the signal line. Both long and short C port lines are connected to form a tunnel like structure surrounding the signal line.","Use of double C port lines significantly increases the tuning range of the characteristic impedance of the transmission line. A disadvantage, however, is that the signal layer cannot be the highest metal layer in the given back-end-of-line (BEOL) metal-dielectric stack option and thus the highest characteristic impedance cannot be reached. The tuning range of the characteristic impedance of the structure () is larger than the tuning range of the structure of . In both cases, connection of the C port lines to the ground is relatively simple (i.e. connection beyond the side shields).","It is noted that the two layers of C port lines are not necessarily identical in that any pattern and other characteristics may be used for each C port line later. The addition of a second layer provides significantly more tenability for the transmission line at the cost of using an additional metal layer.","A diagram illustrating a perspective view of an example embodiment of the variable transmission line of the present invention incorporating long C port lines and a plurality of side shields is shown in . The variable transmission line structure, generally referenced , comprises a signal line , a plurality of side shields  on one side of the signal line and another plurality of side shields  on the other side of the signal line, long C port lines  below the signal line and ground plane . Note that the long C port lines in this example structure extend both under and over the signal line and side shields. As described supra, the multiple side shields function to modify the inductance L of the transmission line by controlling the return current through the transmission line.","A diagram illustrating a perspective view of an example embodiment of the variable transmission line of the present invention incorporating connections to transistors from the sides of C port lines is shown in . The variable transmission line structure, generally referenced , comprises a signal line , side shields , , C port lines  below the signal line and ground plane . The C port lines  are connected to transistors  and vias  to ground. One or more C port lines are grouped together and either left floating or switched to ground as a group. In this example, the C port lines are connected in groups of three lines for each transistor connected to ground. It is appreciated that any number of C port lines may be grouped together depending on the implementation.","A diagram illustrating a perspective view of an example embodiment of the variable transmission line of the present invention incorporating connections to transistors from the center of C port lines is shown in . The variable transmission line structure, generally referenced , comprises a signal line , side shields , , C port lines  and ground plane . The C port lines  are connected to transistors  and vias  to ground. One or more C port lines are grouped together and either left floating or switched to ground as a group. In this example, the C port lines are connected in groups of three lines for each transistor connected to ground. It is appreciated that any number of C port lines may be grouped together depending on the implementation.","The technique of grouping C port lines as provided by the present invention will now be described in more detail. In order to enable compact and accurate modeling of the capacitance variable portion of the transmission line, the physical density of the orthogonal C port lines is kept constant when changing the overall transmission line length. Namely, the same number of C port lines per unit length is maintained.","Let us define a basic transmission line modeling element, which comprises, for example, 15 crossing lines with width=\u2018wcr\u2019 and spacing=\u2018scr\u2019, where wcr and scr are arbitrary fixed values preferably equal to minimum design rule values. If the total length of the variable transmission line comprises exactly an N number of such basic transmission line elements then we have a total of 15\u00d7N C port lines. We then group these into 15 groups as follows: (1) connect together the first N ports (group number 1); (2) connect together the next N ports: N+1 . . . 2N (group number 2); and (3) connect together the last N ports: N*14+1 . . . N*15 (group number 15).","A diagram illustrating an example of a plurality of groups (e.g., 15) for every two C ports together (N=2) is shown in . In this example, the grouping, generally referenced , comprises a plurality of groups (e.g., 15), each comprising two (N=2) C port lines . If the total length of the variable transmission line comprises N number of basic transmission line elements plus a portion of basic transmission line then in one embodiment, a linear approximation can be used thus maintaining 15 total groups.","In one embodiment, the technique for gradually switching the 15 groups from a \u201cfloating\u201d state to a \u201cgrounded\u201d state is to follow a thermometer code sequence as shown below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"maths":[{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mn":"000000000000000"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001-2","num":"00001.2"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mn":"100000000000000"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001-3","num":"00001.3"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mn":"110000000000000"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001-4","num":"00001.4"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mn":"111000000000000"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001-5","num":"00001.5"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mi":"\u2026"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001-6","num":"00001.6"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mi":"\u2026"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001-7","num":"00001.7"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mn":"111111111111111"}}]},"Note that in the thermometer code sequences given above a \u20180\u2019 denotes the ground state and a \u20181\u2019 denotes the floating state.","The total capacitance of the variable transmission line changes substantially linearly (except the first and the last steps). A graph illustrating the total capacitance dependency on the number of grounded C ports is shown in . Following the thermometer code approach, described above we obtain a discontinuity in the impedance across the transmission line in the interface between the part in which the C port lines are floating and the part in which the C port lines are grounded. This does not have much of an impact since in the worst case the relatively small impedance change is averaged over a transmission line length of a quarter wavelength. Note that preferably, transmission line devices longer than a quarter of a wavelength are avoided in order to prevent resonances.","Alternatively, a different code can be followed which effectively distributes the grounded and floating C port lines more uniformly across the transmission line thereby maintaining a uniform impedance across the transmission line. It has been found, however, that following such a uniform code generally yields less linearity in the variation of capacitance.","Changing the number of grounded C port lines from 0 to 15 (wherein the remaining C port lines are left floating), in the example provided supra, provides 16 values of capacitance and thus 16 values of characteristic impedance for a given variable transmission line.","The compact modeling technique provided for the above described transmission line structure is a natural extension of modeling methodology for fixed microstrip transmission lines. The variable transmission line is modeled separately for the variable capacitance part and for the variable inductance part. Note that the model presented herein only covers the variable capacitance part.","In one embodiment, the C port lines are modeled using a capacitance matrix wherein each C port line has mutual capacitances to each of the other C port lines as well as to the signal line and to ground. Note that ground comprises, for example, both the side shields ,  and the bottom ground plane  ().","The model is significantly simplified by reducing the capacitance matrix into a five diagonal matrix, in which each C port line has mutual capacitance only to its nearest neighbors, the signal line and to ground. A diagram illustrating an example equivalent network for reduced capacitance matrix calculation for the C ports is shown in . The equivalent network, generally referenced , comprises a plurality of C port lines  that are capacitively coupled by capacitors ,  to its nearest neighbors, and capacitively coupled by capacitor  to the signal line  and capacitively coupled by capacitor  to ground .","A further simplification can be made by assuming that the mutual capacitance to the nearest neighbors has the same value for any C port line except for the two C port lines on the two ends of the transmission line. In order to assume a constant value we maintain the physical density of the C port lines to be constant across the variable transmission line device as well as keep this same density when changing the overall variable transmission line length.","The variable inductance part of the transmission line is modeled using an appropriate inductance matrix. It should be noted that, in one embodiment, the inductance matrix itself can be highly frequency dependent.","The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention.
