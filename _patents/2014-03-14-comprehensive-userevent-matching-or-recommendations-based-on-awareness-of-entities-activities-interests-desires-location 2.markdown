title: Comprehensive user/event matching or recommendations based on awareness of entities, activities, interests, desires, location
abstract: A method for comprehensive user/event matching or recommendations is described. The method includes a network environment which receives one or more pieces of user data, event data, or social data from users or third party data sources, determining the relevance of the data for users, and displaying the identified data to user in the form of recommendations.

No. 61\/794,283 filed on Mar. 15, 2013 for \u201cComprehensive User\/Event Matching or Recommendations Based on Awareness of Entities, Activities, Interests, Desires, Location.\u201d","Field of the Invention","The invention relates generally to social networking and, in particular, to systems and methods for serving meaningful \u201creal-world\u201d recommendations.","Description of the Related Art","Social networking services include social utilities that track and enable connections between users (including people, businesses, and other entities), which have become prevalent in recent years. In particular, social networking services allow users to communicate more efficiently information that is relevant to their friends or other connections in the social networking service. Social networking services typically incorporate a system for connecting users to content that is likely to be relevant to each user. For example, users may be grouped according to one or more common attributes in their profiles, such as geographic location, employer, job type, age, music preferences, page likes, followers, or other attributes. Users of the social networking service and\/or external parties can then use these groups to customize or target information delivery so that information that might be of particular interest to a group can be communicated to that group.","Furthermore, advertisers wishing to use members' affinities, or common attributes, as targeting criteria for advertisements have difficulty placing their ads in contextually relevant areas, a problem called \u201cad blindness.\u201d As a result, members are inundated with advertisements for products unrelated to the context of what the members are currently viewing. Thus, these ads are largely ignored by members of a social network.","Despite prior art designed to increase the relevance of this information, the systems and methods of the prior art do not achieve the desired outcome, and continue to overwhelm the user with large amounts of non-relevant information. Additionally, methods for indicating user interests including page likes and followers on social networks today are largely comprised of non-useful and non-meaningful data for real-world (offline) interactions, thus the power for directing content, recommendations, and advertising that promotes real world interactions is greatly limited.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["A recommendation engine that connects users with the things that they find important.

When a user  subscribes to services provided by the network environment , a user profile may be generated for user . For example, user  may specify interests explicitly, and through engagement with the service, implicitly specify other interests. For example, the user  may select interests \u2018electronic music\u2019, \u2018yoga\u2019, and \u2018sushi\u2019. Furthermore by frequently viewing and attending events\/experiences associated with \u2018yoga\u2019 and \u2018electronic music\u2019, the user also provides meaningful data about true interests, and provides meaningful data about \u2018sushi\u2019 a potentially less relevant interest. For each input to recommendation engine , thresholds may exist to define and refine recommendations . For example, if event data  contained an event \u2018Sushi and Yoga Night\u2019, this may trigger a threshold for user to receive that event. However, one or more user or system-defined criterion may limit or further refine the threshold. For example, a certain number of ghost users may be necessary to show the event, or the event may have to be within a certain distance of the user's location.\n        \n        ",{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0006-0007","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["302","209","107","104","102","103","102","302","209","103","103","101","206"],"i":"a ","ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0013","list-style":"none"},"li":["Interest indication  is one embodiment of a method whereby user  and\/or  may provide user-interests  explicitly to network environment .","Various types of recommendations\u2014events, activities, experiences, people, deals, specials, desire matchups, advertisements and\/or other content may be displayed in the feed .
