title: System and method for mitigating multicast message duplication in a wireless network
abstract: According to one embodiment of the invention, a method for mitigating duplication of multicast data streams to wireless client devices. The method comprises the operations of detecting, by one or more network devices, a multicast message, and controlling, by the one or more network devices, a forwarding of information within the multicast message to a network device handling multicast data transmissions. The forwarding is controlled based on information within the multicast message and the presence of such information in prior established data structure.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Embodiments of the present disclosure relate to the field of network communications, and in particular a system and method for mitigating multicast message duplication caused by virtual local area network (VLAN) pooling in a wireless network such as a wireless local area network (WLAN) operating in accordance to the IEEE 802.11 Standard.","Currently, it is common for enterprise networks to utilize virtual local area networks (hereinafter referred to as \u201cVLANs\u201d). A \u201cVLAN\u201d is a group of client devices that are adapted to communicate as if these devices were connected to the same broadcast domain irrespective of their actual physically location. Configured through software rather than hardware, VLANs provide flexibility as to allow a client device, without any hardware reconfiguration, to retain its membership on the same VLAN even though it is physically moved from one location to another.","VLAN pooling is an abstraction of the assignment of client devices to different VLANs. Currently, one issue with VLAN pooling is that it may cause the transmission of duplicate multicast streams over a wireless shared media. In infrastructure mode, when VLAN pooling is used, wireless client devices for a particular Basic Service Set (BSS), which is identified by a specific BSS Identifier (BSSID), may be randomly allocated to one or more different VLANs. Hence, wireless client devices on the same BSSID but assigned to different VLANs will likely receive duplicate multicast streams.","More specifically, an upstream multicast router sends a copy of a multicast stream for each VLAN for which a wireless client device has registered to receive multicast packets. These duplicated multicast streams are routed to an access point (AP) of a targeted BSS for wireless transmission. As a result, wireless client devices on the same BSSID and different VLANs will receive duplicate multicast streams for the same multicast group.","Based on current VLAN pooling operations, it is quite possible for multiple client devices in the same multicast group to end up on different VLANs. In a worst case scenario, for a VLAN pool with \u201cn\u201d VLANs, the multicast router will provide \u201cn\u201d copies of multicast streams for transmission via the AP. Such duplication leads to a substantial increase in over-the-air channel utilization, resulting in a waste of wireless spectrum.","A method of mitigating multicast stream duplication when using VLAN pooling techniques is needed.","In the following description, several specific details are presented to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. While the context of the disclosure is directed to VLAN pooling stream control logic that is configured to mitigate multicast message duplication, one skilled in the relevant art may recognize, however, that the concepts and techniques disclosed herein can be practiced without certain details such as the exclusion of one or more operations, logic elements, or the like.","Herein, certain terminology is used to describe features for embodiments of the disclosure. For example, the term \u201cnetwork device\u201d generally refers to any device that includes logic configured to communicate with a network and\/or process information related to such communications. Different categories of network devices may include, but are not limited or restricted to (1) a client device being any consumer electronics with wireless network connectivity (e.g., tablet; laptop; desktop; netbook; television; set-top box; video gaming control; mobile handset with cellular and\/or wireless connectivity such as a smartphone, personal digital assistant \u201cPDA\u201d; etc.); (2) an access point; (3) a data control device (e.g., network switch, controller, etc.); (4) a multicast router; or the like. Hence, a \u201cwireless\u201d client device has wireless connectivity to the network.","It is contemplated that a network device includes hardware logic such as one or more of the following: (i) processing circuitry; (ii) one or more communication interfaces such as a radio (e.g., component that handles the wireless data transmission\/reception) and\/or a physical connector to support wired connectivity; and\/or (iii) a non-transitory computer-readable storage media (e.g., a programmable circuit; a semiconductor memory such as a volatile memory such as random access memory \u201cRAM,\u201d or non-volatile memory such as read-only memory, power-backed RAM, flash memory, phase-change memory or the like; a hard disk drive; an optical disc drive; etc.) or any connector for receiving a portable memory device such as a Universal Serial Bus \u201cUSB\u201d flash drive, portable hard disk drive, or the like.","Herein, the term \u201clogic\u201d is generally defined as hardware and\/or software. For example, as hardware, logic may include processing circuitry (e.g., a microcontroller, any type of processor, a programmable gate array, an application specific integrated circuit, etc.), semiconductor memory, combinatorial logic, or the like. As software, logic may be one or more software modules, such as executable code in the form of an executable application, an application programming interface (API), a subroutine, a function, a procedure, an object method\/implementation, an applet, a servlet, a routine, a source code, an object code, a shared library\/dynamic load library, or one or more instructions. These software modules may be stored in any type of a suitable non-transitory storage medium (described above) or transitory computer-readable transmission media (e.g., electrical, optical, acoustical or other form of propagated signals such as carrier waves, infrared signals, digital signals).","The term \u201cinterconnect\u201d is broadly defined as a logical or physical communication path such as, for instance, electrical wire, optical fiber, cable, bus trace, or a wireless channel using infrared, radio frequency (RF), or any other wireless signaling mechanism. The term \u201cmessage\u201d constitutes a grouping of data, which may be placed in the form of a packet, a stream (e.g., a sequence of packets), a frame, an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) cell, or any other series of bits having a prescribed format.","Lastly, the terms \u201cor\u201d and \u201cand\/or\u201d as used herein are to be interpreted as an inclusive or meaning any one or any combination. Therefore, \u201cA, B or C\u201d or \u201cA, B and\/or C\u201d mean \u201cany of the following: A; B; C; A and B; A and C; B and C; A, B and C.\u201d An exception to this definition will occur only when a combination of elements, functions, steps or acts are in some way inherently mutually exclusive.","Certain details are set forth below in order to provide a thorough understanding of various embodiments of the disclosure, albeit the invention may be practiced through many embodiments other that those illustrated. Well-known logic and operations may not be set forth in detail in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring this description. Moreover, the illustrated embodiments of the disclosure, and the description associated therewith, should be considered as examples of the principles of the invention and not intended to limit the disclosure to those specific embodiments. It should be understood that this disclosure covers all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the present disclosure.","General Network Architecture","Referring to , a general block diagram of a network  supporting multiple Basic Service Set Identifiers (BSSIDs) along with virtual local area network (VLAN) pooling is shown. As described, VLAN pooling is an abstraction of the assignment of client devices to different VLANs, which may be managed by a network device implemented within network infrastructure  such as a controller, an access point or another type of network device.","Herein, network infrastructure  is a collection of network devices that are adapted to support communications with one or more network devices (e.g., client device ). The components formulating network infrastructure  may vary, depending on the selected network architecture. For example, according to one embodiment of the disclosure, network infrastructure  is implemented with VLAN pooling stream control logic  that mitigates multicast message duplication over a wireless medium. This reduction in multicast message duplication is accomplished by using a single unique identifier for each VLAN pool and controlling the exchange of messages between network devices within network infrastructure  as described below.","More specifically, as an illustrative embodiment, a first network device  within network infrastructure  is implemented with VLAN pooling stream control logic , which is configured to select a unique identifier for each VLAN pool. Each unique identifier, referred to herein as the \u201cPrimary VLAN,\u201d is a VLAN identifier (VLAN ID) for one of a plurality of VLANs forming that VLAN pool. As all VLANs forming the VLAN pool are now mapped to their corresponding Primary VLAN, first network device  receives a single multicast message for transmission to wireless client devices within a particular BSSID, even though these client devices are on different VLANs.","Furthermore, after configuration of infrastructure network  in which a Primary VLAN is assigned to each VLAN pool and such mapping is stored, first network device  also controls a process for routing control messages used by a second network device  to formulate and maintain multicast group memberships. These control messages may include a request to join a particular multicast group (e.g. JOIN message) or a request to leave a particular multicast group (e.g. LEAVE message). First network device  suppresses the routing of JOIN and\/or LEAVE messages in accordance with forwarding decision processes described below.","Until now, VLAN pooling management has failed to avoid duplication of multicast messages to those wireless client devices that belong to the same BSSID but are members of different VLANs. However, by configuring first network device  to associate a single, unique VLAN ID (e.g. the Primary VLAN) to a corresponding VLAN pool and controlling upstream routing of the incoming JOIN and\/or LEAVE messages, multicast message duplication can be mitigated.","For instance, according to one embodiment of the disclosure illustrated in , where network  is a wireless local area network (WLAN), network infrastructure  comprises one or more access points (APs) -(N\u22671) that are coupled to a controller  and a multicast router  over an interconnect . Herein, AP is configured to establish communications with wireless network devices within its coverage area such as wireless client device -(M\u22671) for example.","Controller  comprises VLAN pooling stream control logic  that is configured to monitor for certain types of messages  received by AP -from wireless client devices -and, in various situations, extract information from these messages  for controlling wireless delivery of multicast messages. These types of monitored messages  may include, but are not limited or restricted to signaling that includes an Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) JOIN message, an IGMP LEAVE message, a Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) JOIN message, a MLD LEAVE message, or the like.","For instance, as shown in , according to one embodiment of the disclosure, message  comprises one or more wireless frames , where each wireless frame  is configured in accordance with a wireless communication standard, such as the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11 Standard for example. More specifically, frame  comprises a header , a payload  and a frame check sequence (FCS) .","More specifically, header  includes address fields  that are adapted to include a BSSID . BSSID  identifies the BSS in which the wireless client device of  resides. BSSID  may be extracted from message  by a network device within network infrastructure .","Furthermore, besides BSSID , a multicast group address  may be extracted from an IGMP message  encapsulated within payload  of frame . IGMP message  includes a type field  that identifies if the IGMP message is a JOIN or LEAVE message and a group address field  for containing multicast group address .","Referring to both , using BSSID , network infrastructure  is able to ascertain the Primary VLAN that, established during a configuration stage for network infrastructure , represents the VLAN pool supported by BSSID . By collecting BSSID , the Primary VLAN and multicast group address , network infrastructure  is able to determine whether incoming information should be used to populate one or more data structures that are accessed by controller  in controlling upstream and\/or downstream messaging with multicast router . For instance, based on the stored contents within the data structure(s), controller  determines whether incoming message  should be routed upstream to multicast router .","Multicast router  is a network device that is responsible for transmitting multicast data streams to targeted Primary VLANs. To accomplish such transmissions, multicast router  would be adapted with a client membership table (not shown) that features a plurality of fields for each entry. These fields may include, but are not limited or restricted to Primary VLAN, multicast group address, message type\/version and port number.","Referring now to , another exemplary block diagram of network  supporting VLAN pooling is shown. Herein, in lieu of relying on a separate controller  to monitor for JOIN and\/or LEAVE messages from client devices -as shown in , the functionality of controller  is integrated into at least AP . Therefore, adapted with VLAN pooling stream control logic , AP monitors for JOIN and\/or LEAVE messages from client devices -, and upon detecting such messages, AP extracts data to populate data structures that are relied upon to control upstream\/downstream routing of multicast-related messages. These data structures include, but are not limited or restricted to a Primary VLAN table and a Multicast VLAN table as described below.","Referring to , another detailed exemplary block diagram of network  supporting VLAN pooling is shown. Herein, in lieu of relying on a separate multicast router  to transmit multicast streams to client devices -, the functionality of multicast router  is integrated into controller . Therefore, adapted with VLAN pooling stream control logic , controller  monitors for certain types of messages (e.g., JOIN and LEAVE messages) from client devices -. Upon detecting such messages, controller  extracts data to populate data structures that are relied upon to control the routing of outgoing multicast messages.","Referring to , an exemplary diagram of a network device  with functionality for mitigation and perhaps elimination of multicast message duplication for VLAN pooling is shown. Herein, network device  (e.g., controller, AP, etc.) comprises VLAN pooling stream control logic . According to one embodiment of the invention, VLAN pooling stream control logic  includes processing circuitry  and memory , which are coupled to one or more interfaces  that enable network device  to communicate with other network devices. For instance, interface  may be implemented as a physical interface including one or more ports for wired connectors. Additionally, or in the alternative, interface  may be implemented as an antenna unit for transmitting and\/or receiving wireless signals from other network devices.","As shown in , according to one embodiment of the disclosure, processing circuitry  is coupled to memory  for execution of VLAN control logic  which is stored in memory . VLAN control logic  comprises a first module  configured to control the selection of a Primary VLAN associated with each VLAN pool (hereinafter referred to as \u201cPrimary VLAN Selection module\u201d ) and one or more modules  configured to control forwarding decisions for certain types of messages (e.g., JOIN and\/or LEAVE messages) received by network device  as described below. As shown, a JOIN Forwarding Decision module  and a LEAVE Forwarding Decision module  may be deployed as part of VLAN control logic . Also, VLAN control logic  comprises an Acquisition Primary VLAN (APV) module  that acquires the Primary VLAN as described below.","Data Structure Formulation During Device Configuration","Referring to , during network configuration, one or more data structures are formulated to create a logical mapping between a BSSID and a Primary VLAN selected as a representative VLAN ID for a VLAN pool. According to one embodiment of the disclosure, this logical mapping is provided through a plurality of data structures, namely a first data structure  and a second data structure . These data structures  and  are illustrated as tables, but it is contemplated that other data structure formats may be used.","Stored in memory  and illustrated in , first data structure  (hereinafter referred to as \u201cVLAN Pool_name table\u201d) is populated during initial configuration of network device  in order to maintain a mapping between multiple BSSIDs  supported by the network and a set of configuration parameters  associated with each BSSID. For instance, a first entry  of data structure  includes a first BSSID (BSSID_1) along with a set of configuration parameters (Parameters < >) corresponding to BSSID_1. One of the configuration parameters includes a VLAN_pool_name_, which is the alphanumeric name (or data representative of the name) assigned to a VLAN pool supported by BSSID_1. Hence, VLAN Pool_name_table  enables network device , after extracting BSSID_1 from a JOIN or LEAVE message received from a client device, to determine the VLAN pool name.","Also stored in memory  and illustrated in , second data structure  is populated during device configuration in order to maintain a mapping between a VLAN pool name (e.g., VLAN_pool_name ) and a Primary VLAN  (e.g., VLAN_ID_) associated with VLAN_pool_name . The pseudo-code outlining the selection of the Primary VLAN from VLANs within a corresponding VLAN pool identified by the VLAN pool name and describing operations performed by Primary VLAN Selection module  of  during execution is set forth below in Table 1.","Herein, three types of data structures are used for Primary VLAN selection. These data structures include a VLAN pool represented as a sorted array of VLAN IDs (P); a flag for the VLAN pool being represented as a Boolean (F); and an intermediate VLAN pool being represented as a sorted array of VLAN IDs (T).","Furthermore, each flag is assigned a state from among a plurality of states. For illustrative purposes, the states for each flag include the following: (i) \u2018E\u2019\u2014Exclusive; (ii) \u2018I\u2019\u2014Intersection; (iii) \u2018S\u2019\u2014Subset; and (iv) \u2018O\u2019\u2014Overlap. An order of priority for the flag states is defined in the increasing order\u2014\u2018E\u2019<\u2018I\u2019<\u2018S\u2019<\u2018O\u2019. For instance, a flag assigned to an \u2018S\u2019 state cannot be reassigned to an \u2018I\u2019 state during a next iteration of operations by Primary VLAN selection module . Rather, the flag can be updated only with a higher priority state such as an \u2018O\u2019 state.","The priority state assigned to the flag identifies what \u201caction\u201d is to be taken after a comparison is performed on the contents within two different VLAN pools. For this illustrative embodiment, these actions include (1) \u2018E\u2019=keep the original set of VLAN IDs; (2) \u2018I\u2019=remove intersecting VLAN IDs; (3) \u2018S\u2019=keep the subset of VLAN IDs; and (4) \u2018O\u2019=keep the overlap set of VLAN IDs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Pseudo-code for Primary VLAN Selection Module"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"Pseudo-code: Select \u2018Primary VLAN\u201d"},{"entry":"Initialize F= \u2018E\u2019 (initialize a flag)"},{"entry":"Initialize T= Pwhere i = 1 .. n"},{"entry":"For each VLAN pool, Pwhere j = 1 .. n"},{"entry":"\u2003For each VLAN pool P, where i = 1 .. j\u22121"},{"entry":"Update Fi and Fj to one of the flags as per priority [E\/I\/S\/O] by comparing"},{"entry":"Ti and Pj"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003If Fi == \u2018I\u2019"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003T= T\u2212 (T\u2229 T)"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003Else If F== \u2018S\u2019 || \u2018O\u2019 || \u2018E\u2019"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003T= T\u2212 (T\u2282 T)"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003If F== \u2018I\u2019"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003T= T\u2212 (T\u2229 T)"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003Else If F== \u2018S\u2019 || \u2018O\u2019 || \u2018E\u2019"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003T= T\u2212 (T\u2282 T)"},{"entry":"For each VLAN pool, Pwhere j is 1...N"},{"entry":"\u2003VLAN_Primary [j].primary_vlan = T[0]"},{"entry":"\u2003VLAN_Primary [j].vlan_poolname = P.name"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Referring to , an exemplary flow diagram of a process conducted for selecting the Primary VLAN for a VLAN pool is illustrated. Initially, as set forth in operation , various parameters are initialized. For instance, for computation purposes, temporary VLAN pools (T) are created and set to be equivalent to their corresponding VLAN pools. Also, a first flag (Fi) is set to an Exclusive state (\u2018E\u2019) while a counter \u201cj\u201d is set to \u20181\u2019.","As set forth in operation -, count values are adjusted to selectively control the comparisons between different temporary VLAN pools (T& T) to ensure that comparisons are conducted for all combinations of temporary pools T, . . . , and T) For instance, where the total number of VLAN pools is equal to three (N=3), temporary VLAN pool comparison is performed as follows: T2 is compared to T1, T3 is compared to T1; and T2 is compared to T3.","More specifically, the Primary VLAN selection process involves a determination as to whether a first count value \u201cj\u201d exceeds the total number (N) of VLAN pools (operation ). If so, the Primary VLAN selection process ends. However, if the first count value \u201cj\u201d is less than or equal to \u201cN\u201d, a second count value \u201ci\u201d is set to \u20181\u2019 and compared to a decremented first count value (j\u22121) as illustrated in operations  and . These count value adjustments are used to control which temporary VLAN pools (T& T) are compared and the updating of their flags (Fi & Fj) as set forth in operations  and .","If i>j\u22121, an iteration is performed in which \u201cj\u201d is incremented (operation ) and operations - are repeated. However, where j\u2266N and i\u2266(j\u22121), a comparison is conducted between the two temporary pools (T& T) and flags corresponding to these temporary pools are set to a state based on the comparison (operations  and ).","If a flag (Fi) associated with temporary pool (T) is set to \u2018I\u2019, which denotes that VLAN pool Tpossesses common VLAN IDs when compared with VLAN pool T, the intersecting VLAN IDs are removed from the VLAN pool T(operations  and ). If flag (Fi) is not set to \u2018I\u2019 state, any VLAN IDs for VLAN pool Tthat are a subset of Tare removed from VLAN pool T(operation ). The same operations are repeated for comparison from a perspective of VLAN pool T(operations ,  and ).","Thereafter, the second count value (i) is incremented (operation ) and the process repeats starting at operation . This process continues until all combination of temporary VLAN pools (e.g., T, T& T) have been compared. Based on such a comparison, any unique VLAN ID remaining for each temporary VLAN pool may be selected as the Primary VLAN (operation ).","In the event that there are multiple VLAN IDs remaining as part of a temporary VLAN pool, according to one embodiment of the disclosure, a first VLAN ID from the temporary VLAN pool is selected. According to another embodiment, the last VLAN ID from the temporary VLAN pool is selected. According to other embodiments, the VLAN ID having the highest or lowest VLAN ID is selected as the Primary VLAN. According to yet another embodiment of the disclosure, the Primary VLAN may be randomly selected, provided that each VLAN ID is unique for that VLAN pool.","In order to better understand the operations set forth in , an illustrative example will be analyzed to determine Primary VLANs for three VLAN pools (P, Pand P). Herein, as there are three VLAN pools, \u201cN\u201d is equal to 3 so that \u201cj\u201d will range in value from 1 to 3 while \u201ci\u201d will range in value from 1 to \u201cj\u22121\u201d.","Herein, each of the exemplary VLAN pools P, P and P include VLANs, which are identified by VLAN IDs represented by a simple numerical value (1-7) for illustrative purposes.

Now, \u201cj\u201d is set to \u201c2\u201d and the computational iterations are performed. Between computational iterations, it is contemplated that operations may be performed for adjusting the count values (i, j).","For the first computational iteration (j=2, i=1), the computations resulting from a comparison of T& Tare set forth below.\n\n","In comparing Tto T, it is determined that VLAN Pool Tpossesses some VLAN IDs {6, 7} that are included in VLAN Pool Tand other VLAN IDs {1, 2, 3} that are not included in VLAN Pool T.

Similarly, the Primary VLANs for VLAN pools Pand Pare selected as VLAN ID \u201c6\u201d and VLAN ID \u201c4\u201d, respectively.","Data Structure Formulation During Network Device Operations","Referring now to , network device  generates and populates a third data structure  during operation when network device  monitors messages received by one or more APs for JOIN or LEAVE messages. This data structure  is represented in a table format, and thus, is referred to herein as the \u201cMulticast VLAN table.\u201d Of course, other formats besides a table may be used.","From these JOIN and LEAVE messages, Multicast VLAN table  is populated to provide a mapping between the multicast group address  and its corresponding BSSID  and Primary VLAN  as shown in a first entry . With Primary VLAN  representing a VLAN pool, the Group\/BSSID duplet  is created for determining whether to further populate the Multicast VLAN table . An additional field  (\u201cNum_Members\u201d) maintains a count value to record the number of multicast group members for a particular Group\/BSSID duplet.","Operational Flow of VLAN Pooling with Reduced Multicast Message Duplication","Referring to , an exemplary flow diagram of the operations for formulating and maintaining VLAN pooling with reduced multicast message duplication is shown. For clarity, the operations will be described in accordance with the network infrastructure set forth in , although deviations from such operations may be conducted depending on the network infrastructure selected.","Initially, a network device with VLAN pooling stream control logic monitors the receipt of certain ingress messages with a selected multicast management protocol such as IGMP, MLD, or the like (operation ). For instance, upon detecting receipt of a JOIN message (e.g., IGMP JOIN message, MLD JOIN message, etc.), the network device performs an Acquisition Primary VLAN (APV) process as shown in  (operations  and ).","More specifically, as illustrated in , the JOIN message includes a BSSID that is used to obtain a VLAN pool name using VLAN Pool_name table  of  (operation ). VLAN Pool_name table  provides a mapping between the BSSID and a corresponding VLAN pool name supported by the BSSID.

For example, the JOIN message is not forwarded to the multicast router.","If the network device determines that Multicast VLAN table  does not feature an entry with information that matches the G-PV-B triplet, a second determination is made whether Multicast VLAN table  includes an entry with information that matches the multicast group address (G) and the Primary VLAN (PV) as illustrated in operation . The collection of the multicast group address and the Primary VLAN is referred to as a \u201cG-PV duplet\u201d.","If a match is detected, the JOIN message is discarded so that this message is not forwarded to the multicast router (operation ), however if a match is not detected, the JOIN message is forwarded to the multicast router (operation ).

For this illustrative network infrastructure, the AP routes the JOIN message (or information from the JOIN message) upstream to controller . Controller  obtains a VLAN pool name using the BSSID (Bz) and subsequently learns the Primary VLAN (PVy) for the VLAN pool and executes the JOIN Forwarding Decision module.","Herein, controller  checks if an entry with information identical to the multicast group address (Gx), Primary VLAN (PVy) and BSSID (Bz) exists, namely the \u201cGx-PVy-Bz triplet\u201d. If no entry exists with the Gx-PVy-Bz triplet, controller  adds an entry with \u201cGx\u201d, \u201cPVy\u201d and \u201cBz\u201d into the Multicast VLAN table and sets count value within Num_Members field to 1, and thereafter, determines if an entry within the Multicast VLAN table exists for \u201cGx\u201d and \u201cPVy\u201d, namely the \u201cGx-PVy\u201d duplet.

This determination may be accomplished using Multicast VLAN table  of .","More specifically, network device  receives multicast data stream  that is directed to a targeted Primary VLAN  (e.g. Primary VLAN \u201cPV1\u201d), and thereafter, determines which entries within Multicast VLAN table  feature targeted Primary VLAN . Since Multicast VLAN table  is optimized so that each entry, if having the same multicast group (Gx) and Primary VLAN (PVy), requires a different BSSID (Bz), the lookup effectively operates as a mapping of the multicast stream to all associated BSSIDs. As a result, if Multicast VLAN table  contains multiple entries for a given multicast group and Primary VLAN, network device  replicates multicast data streams for each of these BSSIDs for subsequent transmission to wireless client devices within these specific BSS.","For instance, continuing the illustrative example as shown in  by considering Multicast VLAN table  having the contents as shown in , upon receiving a multicast data stream for multicast group (G1) that is directed to a first Primary VLAN (PV1), network device  having access to this Multicast VLAN table would determine that there are two entries  and  directed to PV1. As shown, entry  is associated with a first BSSID (B1) while entry  is associated with a seventh BSSID (B7). Hence, the multicast data stream would be replicated for transmission of two multicast data streams, with one multicast data stream directed to a first BSSID (B1) and the other multicast data stream directed to a seventh BSSID (B7). This multicast forwarding technique ensures that wireless client devices do not receive duplicate multicast streams when in the same BSSID but are associated with different VLANs.","It is to be understood that the above description is intended to be illustrative, and not restrictive.
