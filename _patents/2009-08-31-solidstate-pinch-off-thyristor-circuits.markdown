{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF U.S. GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention was made with Government support under Army Research Laboratory Contract No. W911NF-04-2-0022. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates to semiconductor devices and, more particularly, to thyristor circuits.","Semiconductor bistable switches may be used in high current applications such as, for example, power supplies and\/or other electrical power conversion applications. For example, thyristors may be solid-state semiconductor devices with four layers of alternating N and P-type material. Thyristors may act as bistable switches, conducting when they are forward biased and their gate receives a current pulse, and continuing to conduct as long as they are forward biased. Thyristors may generally have three states: 1) reverse blocking when voltage is applied in a direction that would be blocked by a diode; 2) forward blocking when voltage is applied in a direction that would cause a diode to conduct, but the thyristor has not been triggered into conduction; and 3) forward conducting mode when the voltage is applied in a direction that would cause a diode to conduct and a triggering current has been received at the gate. Once a thyristor is in the forward conducting mode, the device remains latched in the on-state as long as the anode remains positively biased relative to the cathode (i.e., until the anode current falls below a holding current.)","A thyristor in forward conducting mode may be switched off when an external circuit causes the anode to become negatively biased. In some applications, this may be done by switching a second thyristor to discharge a capacitor into the cathode of the first thyristor. This technique may be referred to as forced commutation. For example, a conventional gate turn off thyristor (GTO) may be turned off by either shorting or applying reverse bias to the gate to cathode junction. A large amount of current may be typically necessary to do this.","Brief reference is made to , and , which are a symbol and equivalent circuit schematic diagram, respectively, of a conventional gate turn off thyristor. Although normal thyristors may not be fully controllable switches (a \u201cfully controllable switch\u201d can be turned on and off at will), a GTO  can be turned-on by a gate signal and can also be turned-off by a gate signal of negative polarity. Like a normal thyristor, GTO turn on may be accomplished by a current pulse between the gate terminal  and the cathode terminal . As the gate-cathode may behave like a PN junction, there may be some relatively small voltage between the terminals. Accordingly, the turn on phenomenon in a GTO may not be as reliable as a conventional thyristor and thus a small positive gate current may be provided even after turn on to improve reliability.","Turn off in a GTO may accomplished by applying a negative voltage pulse between the gate terminal  and the cathode terminal . Some of the forward current (about one-third to one-fifth) may be drained and used to induce a cathode-gate voltage, which in turn induces the forward current to fall and the GTO to switch off (transitioning to a blocking state.)","In addition to requiring significant currents to turn off, GTO's may suffer from long switch off times. For example, after the forward current falls, there may be a long tail time where residual current continues to flow until all remaining charge from the device is taken away.","Furthermore, a conventional GTO structure may have a maximum limit on controllable current. Additionally, in conventional thyristors, the load current can reach a point where it cannot be turned off by reverse biasing the gate. This limitation may be on the order of twice rated operating current.","Other technology may use a high power gate driver connected to turn off the thyristor by reverse biasing the gate to cathode junction. Cascode techniques have been done in the past, but cascode devices (aka Emitter-Turn-Off (ETO) thyristor) have been realized with discrete GTO thyristor in series with a discrete MOSFET. Such devices may have additional conduction losses with the discrete MOSFET and difficulty commutating the devices at high load currents and high dV\/dt due to stray inductances between the MOSFET and the GTO.","GTO's with integrated turn-off switches have been proposed in the past, namely the MOS controlled thyristor (MCT). Such structures may use integrated N and P channel MOSFETs to control the thyristor structure. The PMOS transistor may be used to turn the device on and the NMOST transistor may be used to turn off the device. Turn off may be accomplished by shorting out the base to emitter junction of the NPN portion of the thyristor structure. A disadvantage of this device may be its maximum controllable current may be limited due to a finite resistance of the NMOS transistor.","Some embodiments of the present invention provide semiconductor bistable switching devices. Such devices may include a thyristor portion including an anode layer, a drift layer, a gate layer and a cathode layer. The gate layer may be operable to receive a gate trigger current that, when the anode layer is positively biased relative to the cathode layer, causes the thyristor portion to latch into a conducting mode between the anode and the cathode. Devices may include a transistor portion on the thyristor portion, the transistor portion including a source, a drain and a transistor gate. The drain may be coupled to the cathode of the thyristor portion.","In some embodiments, the anode layer of the thyristor portion is operable as a switching device anode and the source of the transistor portion is operable as a switching device cathode. Some embodiments provide that the transistor gate is operable to receive a turn off signal that causes a current conducting channel between the source and the drain to increase in resistance. In some embodiments, the transistor portion includes a junction field effect transistor (JFET) that is configured to pinch off current flow from the source to the drain responsive to a voltage applied to the transistor gate.","Some embodiments provide that the thyristor portion includes a gate turn off thyristor (GTO). In some embodiments, the anode layer, drift layer, gate layer and cathode layer are disposed in a silicon carbide (SiC) layer.

Some embodiments may include a patterned transistor gate layer adjacent a current channel formed by at least one of the patterned transistor drain layer or the patterned transistor source layer.","In some embodiments, the patterned transistor drain layer, the patterned transistor source layer and the patterned transistor gate layer include a junction field effect transistor (JFET).","Some embodiments provide that the thyristor anode layer includes a p-type SiC layer, the thyristor drift layer includes a n-type SiC layer, the thyristor gate layer includes a p-type SiC layer and the patterned thyristor cathode layer includes a n-type SiC layer.","In some embodiments, the thyristor anode layer includes a n-type SiC layer, the thyristor drift layer includes a p-type SiC layer, the thyristor gate layer includes a n-type SiC layer and the patterned thyristor cathode layer includes a p-type SiC layer.","Some embodiments of the present invention include semiconductor bistable switching circuits.

In some embodiments, a voltage level at the second node is clamped to a voltage that corresponds to the voltage across the first semiconductor diode and the second semiconductor diode when the circuit is in a conducting state.","Some embodiments provide that the circuit is turned on from a non-conducting state between the first and third nodes to a conducting state between the first and third nodes by forward biasing the first node relative to the third node and providing a momentary bias to the second node relative to the third node. In some embodiments, the circuit is turned off from a conducting state between the first and third nodes to a non-conducting state between the first and third nodes by supplying a current to the fourth node to cause a conducting channel in the transistor portion to have increased resistance that inhibits current flow therethrough.","Embodiments of the present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which embodiments of the invention are shown.

Thus, n-type material has a majority equilibrium concentration of negatively charged electrons, while p-type material has a majority equilibrium concentration of positively charged holes.","Various embodiments of the present invention may arise from the present realization that high-voltage and\/or high-current switching devices and\/or circuits may benefit from voltage controlled and\/or low current turn-off functionality. In this regard, a pinch off thyristor provides an integrated functionality of a gate turn off thyristor (GTO) and voltage and\/or low-current controlled conducting channel formed on the cathode of the GTO.","Reference is now made to , which is an equivalent circuit schematic diagram illustrating a semiconductor bistable switching device according to some embodiments of the present invention. In some embodiments, the switching device may include a thyristor portion  that is serially connected to a transistor portion . In some embodiments, the thyristor portion  and the transistor portion  may be integrated into a monolithic device. Some embodiments provide that the switching device  includes terminals and\/or nodes corresponding to an anode , an on gate , an off gate  and a cathode .","As illustrated, the thyristor portion  may be understood in terms of a tightly coupled pair of bipolar junction transistors (BJT's) that are arranged to cause a self-latching operation. For example, the thyristor portion  may include a four layer semiconductor device consisting of alternately n-type or p-type material (e.g., N-P-N-P and\/or P-N-P-N). Some embodiments provide that the four layers include an anode layer, a drift layer, a gate layer and a cathode layer.

For example, some embodiments provide that the transistor portion  includes a transistor gate (turn off gate ) that is operable to receive a turn off signal that causes a current conducting channel between a transistor source and drain to increase in resistance. Some embodiments provide that the transistor portion may include a junction field effect transistor (JFET) formed using silicon carbide (SiC), silicon (Si), gallium nitride (GaN) and\/or diamond, among others. For example, some embodiments provide that the transistor portion  may include a drain that is connected to the thyristor portion  at the intermediate node , a transistor gate that corresponds to the off gate , and a transistor source that corresponds to the cathode .","In use and operation of some embodiments described herein, turning on the switching device  may be accomplished by forward biasing the base to emitter junction. Some embodiments provide that this may be accomplished by providing a momentary current pulse at the on gate  when the anode  is positively biased relative to the cathode . As the transistor portion  may be a normally on device, the thyristor cathode may be at the same potential as the cathode , and current flows from the drain to the source via a current channel therebetween. The switching device  remains latched in a conducting state as long as the anode  is positively biased relative to the cathode and no signals are received at either of the on gate  or the off gate .","The switching device  may be turned off by negatively biasing the off gate  (the transistor portion gate) relative to the cathode  (the transistor portion source). The negative bias has the effect of pinching off the load current flowing through the transistor portion  at the cathode . In this manner, the load current may be commutated to the on gate , which rapidly turns off the thyristor portion  of the switching device .","Reference is now made to , which is an equivalent circuit schematic diagram illustrating a semiconductor bistable switching circuit according to some embodiments of the present invention.

In this manner, the externally connected switch  may be used to turn off the switching circuit by negatively biasing the off gate  and positively biasing the inverted off gate . Thus, the transistor portion  is turned off and the switch  is turned on. Accordingly, the cathode current may flow through the on gate  and the switch  to provide rapid commutation.

Some embodiments provide that during fault conditions, a load current may exceed IDSS and the transistor may transition from a triode (ohmic) operation to a saturated (current limited) operation. In some embodiments, this may cause the voltage across the transistor portion  to rapidly rise, which may reverse bias the base to emitter junction of the thyristor portion . As a result, the thyristor portion may be rapidly driven into a non-conducting or turned off state.","Additionally, some embodiments provide that the transistor portion may be exploited to provide a positive temperature coefficient on the anode to cathode voltage drop of the switching circuit during conduction.","Reference is now made to and , which are different conductivity types of integrated semiconductor switching devices in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention.
