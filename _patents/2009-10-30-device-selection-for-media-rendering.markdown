{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","REFERENCES"],"p":["The present invention generally relates to distribution of media content in a communication system, and in particular to selecting a device at which ordered media content is delivered and rendered.","Media consumption has increased tremendously over the last few years. Today, users can download or stream media in various forms, such as video and audio data, to their computers and mobile telephones for consumption and rendering therein. The traditional approach of such media content delivery and rendering has been to visit a web page of a content provider by a web browser implemented in the computer or mobile telephone. The user selects a particular media content that is available at the content provider to download or stream the media content to the computer or mobile telephone for rendering therein.","If the user, however, would like to consume the selected media content on another user device or terminal than the one that was used to order the media content, he or she generally has to perform a number of manual steps which are cumbersome or sometimes difficult. In particular, the user has to download the media content using the computer or mobile telephone and then transfer it to the device he or she would like to use for conducting the actual play back or rendering of the media. Additional problems can also occur in terms of the need for transcoding the media content into a suitable format that is required by the selected media rendering device.","There is therefore a need for a solution of providing an efficient delivery of media content to a media rendering device that can be different from the user terminal used for selecting and ordering media. Such a solution is in particular desired in the light of the emerging trend of providing media consumption in local networks as standardized by the Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA), where DLNA compatible user equipment and devices are able to communicate with each other via Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) and share media between the devices.","It is a general objective to enable delivery a of media content to a media rendering device present in a local network.","It is a particular objective to enable ordering of media content at a user terminal but delivery of the media content to a media rendering device in the local network.","These and other objectives are met by embodiments as disclosed herein.","Briefly, media rendering at a media rendering device available for a user and present in a local network connected to a global network is enabled by providing a link converting module connected to the global network. This link converting module receives media information relating to media content available at a content provider. The media information comprises links to the media contents, which are processed by the link converting module in terms of replacing the links with converted links instead directed towards a device selecting module. The media information with the converted links replacing the original media content links is sent to a user interface module implemented in a user terminal connected to the global network. The user selects a particular media content available at the content provider by activating one of the converted links. An activation command comprising the corresponding link and a user identifier is generated and transmitted to the device selecting module. The device selecting module employs the user identifier for providing a device identifier of a selected media rendering device accessible to the user and present in the local network. A media fetching command comprising the media content link and the device identifier is generated and transmitted destined to the selected media rendering device. The media rendering device can thereby access the media content through the received link to receive, decode and render the media content in the local network.","Another embodiment of the method of enabling media rendering at a media rendering device involves intercepting a media request by a request redirecting module connected to the global network. The media request comprises a user identifier and a link to a media content available at a content provider. The user interface module of the user terminal has generated the media request and transmitted it towards the content provider when the request redirecting module intercepts the media request. An activation command comprising the user identifier and the media content link is generated and transmitted to the device selecting module. The following operation procedures of the method are the same as described above.","A system for enabling media rendering in a rendering device comprises the link converting module and the device selecting module in an embodiment. The link converting module comprises a receiver configured to receive the media information with the media content links. A link converter replaces the media content links by converted links instead addressing the device selecting module. The media information with the converted links is transmitted by a transmitter of the link converting module to the user interface module of the user terminal. The device selecting module comprises a receiver configured to receive the activation command originating, in this embodiment, from the user interface module. An identifier provider retrieves the user identifier included in the activation command and provides a device identifier of a selected media rendering device based on the user identifier. A media fetching command comprising the media content link from the activation command and the device identifier is compiled by the device selecting module and transmitted to a service provider for further forwarding to the selected media rendering device.","In another embodiment, the link converting module is replaced by a request redirecting module comprising a receiver configured to intercept a media request from the user interface module and destined to the content provider. An activation command generator retrieves the media content link and the user identifier from the media request and compiles an activation command that is transmitted to the device selecting module.","Embodiments thereby allow a user to direct media contents on any arbitrary content provider to a media rendering device associated with the user and present in a local network instead of rendering the media content on the user terminal employed for ordering the media content.","Throughout the drawings, the same reference numbers are used for similar or corresponding elements.","Embodiments as disclosed herein relates to distribution of media content in a communication system and in particular to enabling selection of media rendering device to which the media content is delivered and rendered or played.","With reference to , the traditional approach in media content distribution has been to visit a web page of a content provider  using a web browser implemented in a user terminal , such as computer or mobile telephone. The user selects the particular media content, which is downloaded or streamed from the content provider  using a wired or wireless communication network  into the user terminal .","The embodiments instead allow the user to select media content from any content provider  connected to a global network  but where the selected media content is instead delivered, such as streamed, downloaded or pushed, to a media rendering device , ,  present in a local network  connected to the global network . Thus, the actual media rendering and playing can therefore take place in a media rendering device , ,  that is different from the user terminal  used for selecting the particular content. As a consequence, no manual transfer of the media content from the user terminal  to the relevant media rendering device , ,  is required by the user. Instead an automatic delivery of the media content from the content provider  to the media rendering device , ,  is possible.","The communication system  illustrated in  comprises the global network  to which the user terminal  and the content provider  are connected. The global network  can be a non-managed or open network, typically denoted Open Internet in the art. Alternatively, the global network  can be or comprise a managed or proprietary network operated by a network operator. In either case, the global network  houses or is connected to one or more content providers  having access to media content that is to be distributed to media rendering devices , ,  present in the local network . These content providers  can be network-arranged, dedicated content providers or indeed represent consumer generated media in the form of media available from other users in their respective local networks. The advantages of the embodiments is that media content selection and distribution can be achieved from any content provider  connected to the global network . As a consequence, the user is not limited to select only among media content available at a service provider  but the techniques presented herein instead open up for a vastly larger pool of content providers  that not necessarily have to have a distribution agreement with the service provider .","This is advantageous since even if the service provider  can provide a wide coverage for a broad set of media contents, it cannot cover everything that each and every user may want. There can also be the situation with content providers  who do not want to collaborate with the service provider , e.g. Sony music entertainment has not offered their contents on Apple's iTunes Music store. Moreover, in case of user generated contents, it will be impossible for a service provider  to cover all such user generated media content.","The embodiments solve these problems by enabling selecting of media content from any connected content provider  and the distribution of the content to a selected media rendering device , ,  present in a local network associated or accessible to the media selecting user.","The local network  is sometimes denoted local area network (LAN), personal network, personal area network (PAN) but is also known in the art under other names such as home network, residential network or consumer network. In some embodiments, the local network  can be based on Ethernet or one of the existing wire home networking technologies, such as Home Phoneline Networking Alliance (HomePNA) or the Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) G.hn standard, which provides a possibility of creating high-speed LAN using existing home wiring. Other examples include different LAN solutions to enable delivery of media content over IP and the customer's broadband connection, such as Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL), Very high-rate Digital Subscriber Line (VDSL), Public Ethernet, etc. Also wireless network solutions can be used to establish the local network, including combinations of wired and wireless techniques.","The media rendering devices , ,  of the local network  are generally interconnected to the global network  through a gateway (GW)  providing an interface between the two networks , . This gateway  operates in a similar way to a router in terms of forwarding data from the local network , such as media content requests, to the global network  and forwarding data from the global network , such as media fetching commands and the actual media content, to the local network .","The media rendering devices , ,  are advantageously DLNA compatible devices. The media rendering devices , , , can consequently perform the roles of Digital Media Player (DMP), Mobile DMP (M-DMP) or Digital Media Renderer (DMR). A DMP, M-DMP or DMR is a media rendering device that provides playback and rendering capabilities. TVs, stereos, home theatres, wireless monitors, game consoles, mobile phones and mobile media tables are illustrative examples of media rendering devices , ,  that can operate as DMP, M-DMP or DMR. The figure illustrates an example of a local network , in which a mobile telephone , a computer  and a set top box (STB)  with connected TV-screen  are presented as illustrative but non-limiting example of media rendering devices.","In the following media content should be interpreted broadly to encompass multimedia and media data, such as video, audio, text, graphics, data delivered over IP based networks to a media rendering device , ,  in a local network , where local processing, i.e. rendering and\/or play back of the media content is effected.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["1","22","40","22","4","30","4","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":["2","1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},"The media information can, in this embodiment, actually represent any information or data that can be processed by the user interface module, such as web browser, to display information to the user of the user terminal of at least one media content available at a content provider from which media information originates.","A next step S converts the link in the media information to the media content at the content provider into a converted link. The converted link is instead to a device selecting module, processor or device. Thus, instead of being associated with and addressing the media content at the media server as the original link, the converted link instead, if activated, addresses and calls the device selecting module.","In a particular embodiment of the converting step S, the media information is parsed through to identify any links to media contents available at the content provider. Each such identified link is then replaced by a respective converted link to the device selecting module.","The link conversion can, for instance, be implemented by converting an original hyper link to the media content with a Javascript function call comprising information of the hyper link. Thus, it is preferably possible to retrieve the original address information of the media content available from the content provider from the converted link. For example, the link: <a ref=http:\/\/cp.com\/music.mp3>Click here to play music<\/a> is replaced by <a onClick=\u201cnew DeviceSelectingModule(\u201chttp:\/\/cp.com\/music.mp3\u201d); return false;\u201d href=\u201cjavascript:void(0)\u201d>Click here to play music<\/a>.","In HTML 5 special tags are defined for media contents on a document, e.g. <video> and <audio> for video and audio content, respectively. In such a case, it is not necessary to detect the file names of each hyper link on the document. Instead, the tags can be used to identify links relating to media content available at the content provider.","The media information received in step S and the converted link(s) from step S are used to generate converted media information. In a preferred embodiment, the converted media information is obtained by replacing the original link(s) or address(es) in the media information with the converted link(s) or converted address(es) from step S. In either case, the converted media information is transmitted in step S to the user interface module implemented in the user terminal, such as computer  or mobile telephone  as illustrated in , . The transmission of step S is typically implemented by forwarding the converted media information from the link converting module, implemented in the user terminal, to the user interface module, also implemented in the user terminal in this embodiment.","The converted media information is processed by the user interface module and displayed at a display screen of the user terminal to the user. The user can therefore be presented by the web page as illustrated in . Note that the user is preferably not aware of any conversion of the links to the converted links. Instead this is hidden from the user and is only present in script of the presented document. Thus, the user is presented by information of the media content that is available from the content provider and preferably by presenting a web page that comprises at least one link that identifies the media content as illustrated in .","The user selects the particular media content that he\/she would like to receive, preferably by clicking on the link defining the particular media content of the displayed web page. Any link activation process known in the art besides clicking on the link with a mouse, using a touch sensitive screen or joystick can be used and depends on the particular user terminal design. Activation of the link causes an automatic generation of an activation command comprising information of the original link that had been converted in step S. In a preferred embodiment, the activation command actually comprises the complete original link itself as it is preferably retrievable from the converted link. Additionally, the activation command comprises an identifier of the user of the user terminal. This identifier could be a predefined user name previously assigned to the user and stored in the user terminal. Alternatively, any device identifier allowing identification of the user terminal could be used as user identifier. Actually any identifier allowing identification of the user for the purpose of identifying, as will be described further herein, at least one media rendering device accessible for the user in the local network  can be used in the activation command.","The activation command is transmitted from the user interface module to the device selecting module in step S. Thus, by converting the link in step S, a user-triggered activation of the converted link will send the activation command to the device selecting module instead of generating and transmitting a media request to the content provider.","The device selecting module uses the user identifier in the activation command for providing in step S a device identifier of a selected media rendering device available for the user and present in the local network. The selected media rendering device represents the device in the local network to which the selected media content should be delivered and where the actual rendering is taking place.","The device identifier of the selected media rendering device from step S is used together with the information or link of the selected media content for generating and transmitting a media fetching command in step S. The media fetching command is further destined to the selected media rendering device identified by the device identifier. Thus, the device identifier is used to identify the particular media rendering device to which the media fetching command is destined and the link is included in the media fetching command, to allow the media rendering device, upon reception of the link to access the media content at the content provider to thereby request the media content therefrom for rendering at the media rendering device. The method then ends.","Embodiments of the method illustrated in  thereby allows the selection of a media content at any content provider connected to the global network irrespective of any collaboration or agreement with a content service provider. Additionally, the selected media content is delivered at a media rendering device selected and present in the local network of the user. However, the actual ordering or selection of the media content performed using the user terminal can thereby take place anywhere as long as the user terminal is directly () or indirectly () connected to the global network. For instance, a user currently working at his\/her office can select and redirect the distribution of a video to his\/her set top box present at home. The user terminal employed for selecting the particular media content does not need to be present in the local network, even though this of course possible.","Embodiments further do not limit the delivery of the selected media content to the local network of the ordering user but can actually be used for enabling the user to order and distribute media content to his\/her friends. Thus, as long as the user is granted access to the identifier of the particular friend and can log in to get information of the media rendering devices of the friend, the method can be used to enable selection of media content at a user terminal of a first user but the actual delivery of the content to a media rendering device in a local network of a second user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIGS. 1 and 5"],"b":["12","13","14","30","10","10","12","13","14","30","30","30","10","12","13","14","30","12","13","14","2","12","13","14","12","13","14","2","12","13","14","12","13","14","12","13","14"]},"When a user wants to order media content from a content provider (CP) , he\/she uses his\/her user terminal  and the user interface module (UIM), such as web browser or other program module that allows accessing the content provider . In a typical embodiment, the user types in the web page of the content provider  in the user interface module to thereby request media information (MI) from the content provider . The content provider  returns the requested media information, such as in the form of a web page or document allowing display of a web page in the user interface module. The received media information is in this embodiment forwarded to a link converting module (LCM) preferably implemented in the user terminal . The link converting module converts link to media content at the content provider  into converted links (CL) that are instead directed towards a dialogue generator (DG) forming part of a device selecting module in this implementation example. The media information with the links replaced by the converted link constitute converted media information (CMI), which is returned to the user interface module for display on the display screen of the user terminal .","The user then clicks on one of the converted links in the displayed converted media information to thereby automatically generate an activation command comprising the corresponding link (L) that have been converted into the selected and clicked link by the link converting module. The activation command additionally preferably comprises an identifier (ID) of the user. Since the converted link is constructed to redirect the activation command to the dialog generator, the generator receives the identifier and uses the identifier included therein for composing a device identifier request. The device identifier request is sent from the dialog generator to the service provider . The service provider  retrieves the identifier from the request and compiles, in this embodiment, a list of the media rendering devices , ,  that has previously been announced as available for the particular user. A device list comprising device identifiers of the media rendering devices , ,  is generated and returned to the dialog generator. The local network  can comprise a single media rendering device , ,  accessible for the user but preferably comprises multiple, i.e. at least two, media rendering devices , ,  to select among. The device list then comprises a respective device identifier for each of the media rendering devices , , .","The device list may optionally include preference or priority information relating to the available media rendering devices. The preference information thereby indicates the respective preferred level of each media rendering device , ,  and can be determined based on various input information. For instance, the service provider  can use information of the actual media content, e.g. by including the link or information of the media content addressed by the link in the device identifier request. The information is used by the service provider  to identify the media rendering device(s) , ,  in the local network  that is best suited for rendering the media content. For instance, audio content is preferably played or rendered by a music player, mp3 player or stereo, whereas a set top box advantageously is used for rendering video content. Additional information that can be used for determining the preference level can be based on past history of selected media rendering devices , , . Thus, information of the particular media rendering devices selected in past media sessions can be used to determine preferences of media rendering devices , , .","A device presentation message is compiled by the dialog generator and comprises the device list or at least the device identifiers included in the device list and optionally the preference information. The device presentation message preferably also comprises the link to the selected media content. The device presentation message is transmitted to the user interface module for display on the display screen of the user terminal . An example of achieving device preference in the presentation of the media rendering devices is illustrated in .  illustrates such device presentation based on tag cloud to express how suitable a media rendering device is, i.e. the larger the display of the device identifier the more appropriate the media rendering device is for the user's current session.","In another embodiment, the device presentation can be a simple listing of the device identifiers or other information allowing identification of the available media rendering devices. In such a case, any preference levels can be implemented by listing the most suitable media rendering devices first and then in declining preference order in the device list.","Each item in the device presentation preferably works as a link. The user consequently clicks on one of the presented device identifiers (DI), which triggers forwarding information of the selected media rendering device and the link to a control application programming interface (API) invoker (CAI), which constitutes a part of the device selecting module. The control API invoker uses the device identifier and the link for compiling and transmitting a media fetching command (play) that is transmitted to the service provider . The service provider  transmits the media fetching command to the gateway  of the local network , which forwards the link to the media rendering device , ,  identified by the device identifier.","The media rendering device , ,  requests the content by accessing the received link to thereby transmit a media request to the content provider . This media request could be automatically generated by the media rendering device , ,  upon receiving the link from the gateway . Alternatively, the media rendering device , ,  displays on its display screen or a connected display screen  information to a user that media content is now available and can be fetched by the media rendering device , , . The user then confirms that the media content should be accessed, for instance by clicking on a button, touch-sensitive screen or other user input of the media rendering device , , . The confirmation causes the generation of the media request.","The content provider  delivers the media content to the requesting media rendering device , , , which starts decoding and rendering the media content, such as playing video content and\/or audio content. Additionally, the media rendering device , ,  preferably informs the gateway  that it has now successfully started receiving the media content. The gateway  in turn confirms to the service provider  that media content delivery has started. This confirmation is further forwarded to the control API invoker and preferably ultimately to the user interface module.","In the embodiments illustrated in , the user interface module, the link converting module and the link selecting module with the preferred dialog generator and the control API invoker are preferably all implemented in the user terminal , , which is further described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["1","50","50","2","10","2","3","50","3","3","50","1","30","50"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["50","20"]},"The signaling is preferably started in the same way as in  with the optional media rendering device presence publication. The user then requests media information from the content provider by means of the user interface module in the user terminal . The request for media information first arrives at the link converting module present in the request proxy and is then forwarded to the content provider . The requested media information is returned to the link converting module, which parses through the media information and replaces all links to media content with converted links as previously described. The resulting converted media information with the converted links is transmitted to the user interface module.","The remaining signaling in this implementation embodiment is conducted in the same way as in .","In the above described implementation embodiments, the link converting module receives the media information with any links and processes the information to get the converted media information with the converted links to the device selecting module instead of to the content provider.  is a flow diagram illustrating another embodiment of the method of enabling media rendering at a media rendering device available for a user and present in a local network connected to a global network. The method starts in step S, where a request redirecting module, processor or device intercepts a media request from a user interface module implemented a user terminal connected to the global network. The intercepted media request originates from the user interface module and is destined to a content provider. The media request comprises a link to a media content available at the content provider and an identifier of the user.","In a preferred embodiment, the media request has been generated by previously accessing a web page or site of the content provider using the user interface module of the user terminal. Media information in the form of the web page is received and displayed at the user terminal. The user then selects the particular media content it would like to distribute to a media rendering device, preferably by clicking on a link in the displayed media information. The user-triggered activation of the link generates the media request that is intercepted by the request redirecting module in step S.

The media fetching command comprises the link and the device identifier from the identifier provider .","Once the link reaches the media rendering device in the local network, the device can fetch the media content from the content provider to achieve rendering thereof at the media rendering device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0096","num":"0095"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 14"],"b":["101","101","130","130","131"]},"An activation command generator  generates an activation command based on the link and the user identifier. The activation command with the link and the user identifier is transmitted by a transmitter  to the receiver  of the device selecting module . The device selecting module  then processes the activation command in the same way as for the embodiment illustrated in .","With reference to , the device selecting module  and optionally the dialog generator of the device selecting module  preferably generates a device identifier request based on the user identifier received in the activation command. The device identifier request is transmitted by the transmitter  to a device registering server or service provider connected to the global network. In an embodiment, the device registering server provides a list of device identifiers associated with media rendering devices registered at the device registering server as being accessible to the user identified by the user identifier. The list of device identifiers is returned to the device selecting module , where the identifier provider  provides the device identifier of the selected media rendering device.","In a preferred implementation, the device selecting module  and preferably the previously mentioned dialog generator of the device selecting module  generates a device presentation message comprising information, such as device identifiers, of the multiple media rendering devices. The device presentation message is transmitted by the transmitter  to the user interface module for presentation on the display screen to the user. The user selects one of the presented media rendering devices as the preferred device for the current media content. The user interface module thereby transmits the device identifier of the selected media rendering device to the receiver  of the device selecting module . The received device identifier is brought to the identifier provider  that generates the media fetching command based on the device identifier.","In an alternative embodiment, the device identifier request is generated and transmitted to the device registering server together with information of the media type of the media content associated with the link. The data registering server performs an automatic selection of media rendering device based on the user identifier and the media type. The device identifier of the selected media rendering device is returned to the device selecting module  and the identifier provider .","Yet an alternative approach requests the list of device identifiers from the device registering server as previously described. The media rendering device to use for the present media content is then automatically selected by the device selecting module among the returned listed media rendering devices. The device selecting module  preferably uses media type and\/or user preferences received from the device registering server in selecting one of the multiple available media rendering devices.","In all these embodiments, once the device identifier of the selected media rendering device is available to the identifier provider , the media fetching command is generated to include the device identifier and the link to the media content at the content provider. The media fetching command is transmitted to a media control server or service provider connected to the global network and is then forwarded therefrom to the selected media rendering device in the local network.","The link converting module illustrated in  and the request redirecting module in  can be implemented as add-on modules to the user interface module implemented in the user terminal.","Add-ons for user interface modules, such as web browsers, is a well established concept which enables distribution of a plug-in software or program components which extend the ability of the web browsers [1]. Additionally, there are also add-ons which enable installation and running a script when a specified web site is loaded. An example of such an add-on is Greasemonkey [2].","In such a case, the link converting module or the request redirecting module can be implemented as a web browser add-on or a script run in, for instance, Greasemonkey. The link converting module\/request redirecting module is then loaded and triggered to perform the previously described operations when the web browser finishes loading a web site or page.","Also the device selecting module can be included in the add-on or implemented in one or more Javascript library files, which are loaded on-demand.

The device selecting module  is preferably implemented by a script execution engine.","The illustrated implementation example of  using web browser add-ons does not require any investment in the network infrastructure or the server side. End-users can easily download and install the add-on modules for web browsers from a web site or add-on software repository.","In an alternative implementation example as illustrated in , the link converting module  or the request redirecting module  is implemented in a request proxy , e.g. a HTTP proxy to thereby let it intercept traffic between the user interface module and content providers.","The device selecting module  with the preferred dialog generator  and the control API invoker  can be installed in the same way as discussed above in connection with .","A proxy-based implementation of the link converting module\/request redirecting module does not require installing an add-on for each and every user terminal and user interface module available for the user. The proxy-based implementation instead requires investment in the network infrastructure or at the server side, depending on the placement of the request proxy in the communication system. It though has the advantage of not requiring any software installation in the user terminal.","Regardless of implementation site embodiments as disclosed herein allow a user to direct media contents on any arbitrary web site to media rendering devices instead of playing the media content on a computer or mobile telephone which runs the web browser. As a consequence, any media content can be distributed to user homes and local networks without requiring investments in infrastructure of the content providers.","The units  to  of the system ,  may be implemented or provided as software, hardware or a combination thereof.
