No. 10\/071,907, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.","1. Field of the Invention","The current invention is directed to a system and method for evaluating wireless network traffic. In particular, the current invention is directed to a portable device that can monitor network traffic on a dynamic basis.","2. Description of the Art","Many network monitoring systems monitor the transport layer or internet layer when analyzing the performance of many networked systems. Others only analyze the physical layer. A spectrum analyzer is a typical wireless tool to detect general radio interferences or signal coverage holes. However, most networks in use when these monitoring systems were developed were static or hard wired networks. Thus, the analysis of the top levels of the network protocol allowed administrators to diagnose problems affecting the underlying protocol layers indirectly.","However, with the advent of mobile computing and of wireless communications, the typical network can include substantial portions of dynamic network legs. In this case, the network legs can be mobile and change the link characteristics, depending upon the local radio environment characteristics. In this manner, typical analysis of the topmost layers of the network protocol cannot deal effectively and timely with the problems presented with the advent of wireless legs in the network, or of a network made entirely of wireless links.","Accordingly, when a problem occurs in a wireless network, it is very difficult to determine its cause using the typical hard-wired monitoring technology to determine where the problem exists. It may occur at the sending end, within the wireless channel, at the receiving end, at an access point (AP), which is the wired to wireless bridge or at any other interconnection device, like a switch, router, or application gateway.","Additionally, wireless networks have become very popular in the last number of years. Working without any cable limitations is very convenient. However, the tools to troubleshoot or analyze these types of networks typically do not work without cables, nor do they work outside of a static platform. In this manner, they are not easily or flexibly carried around. In this manner, these tools do not easily allow an analyzer to be transported to various physical points within the wireless network, and to analyze the network and physical characteristics associated with the links in the network.","Further, the point at which the station is relative to the receiver or transmitter can play an important role. As such, the pure wireless connection and the role the relative positions of the units add a complexity to the wired network model.","In this manner, many typical wireless monitoring systems and methods suffer one or more shortcomings. Many other problems and disadvantages of the prior art will become apparent to one skilled in the art after comparing such prior art with the present invention as described herein.","Aspects of the invention are found in an apparatus for monitoring data on a wireless network. The data is transmitted according to a wireless data network protocol across the network. The apparatus is contained on a portable wireless network analysis device.","The portable wireless network analysis device has a wireless network interface that communicatively couples the portable wireless network analysis device to the wireless network. This allows the portable wireless network analysis device to receive data from the wireless network.","The portable wireless network analysis device also has a network traffic analyzer. The network traffic analyzer is communicatively coupled to the wireless network interface. The analyzer receives and analyzes the data received from the wireless network.","The portable wireless network analysis device is capable of being operated by a user at one location and transported to second location. The portable wireless network analysis device is able to continue to monitor data on the wireless network while being transported from the first location to the second location.","The apparatus may also have a user interface. Information about the data may be displayed on the user interface. In a specific instance, the user interface is a display screen.","In a particular aspect, the apparatus is a personal digital assistant, which is commonly named as PDA. It should be noted that several computing devices might be used, as well, such as a palm-top device, a laptop device, or any other portable computing device.","In another aspect, the apparatus has a storage system. The storage system stores the data when initiated by a user.","The apparatus may have a filter system. The filter system filters the data based on a predefined criteria. In one case the predefined criteria is a network address. In yet another, the predefined criteria is a packet type. It should be noted that several types of predefined criteria may be imagined using parameters associated with network devices, network events, or physical parameters associated with the wireless network, such as channel or noise characteristics therein.","The apparatus may have an alarm system. The alarm system indicates when a predefined network event has occurred.","The predefined network event may be based on the usage characteristics of the network. These events include a rate of data exchange, or a utilization rate, to name a few examples.","The predefined network event may also be the occurrence of a specific network event. Such specific network events may indicate an error in data transmission, may be based on a network address, or may be a predetermined number of network events like checksum errors or frame errors. Additionally, the predefined network event may be based on a rate of specific network events.","Other aspects of the invention are drawn to an apparatus for monitoring data on a wireless network. The data is transmitted according to a wireless network protocol, and the data is arranged in a transport protocol. The apparatus is a portable wireless network analysis device.","The portable wireless network analysis device contains a wireless network interface that couples the portable wireless network analysis device to the wireless network. This allows the portable wireless network analysis device to receive data from the wireless network.","The apparatus contains a network traffic analyzer communicatively coupled to the wireless network interface. The network traffic analyzer receives the data and performs an analysis of the data relative to the wireless network protocol.","The portable wireless network analysis device is capable of being dynamically relocated from a first location to a second location. The portable wireless network analysis device is able to monitor the wireless network traffic during the relocation from the first location to the second location. Other aspects of the preceding apparatus may all be envisioned in this aspect as well.","Other facets of the invention are drawn to an apparatus for monitoring data on a wireless network transmitted according to a wireless network protocol. The apparatus has a computer readable medium containing instructions, where the apparatus is responsive to the instructions.","The apparatus contains instructions for receiving data from the wireless network with a wireless network interface. The wireless network interface is contained in a portable wireless network analysis device.","The apparatus contains instructions for analyzing the wireless network data. Moreover, the apparatus is selectively relocatable from a first location to a second location. The portable wireless network analysis device is still able to perform the steps of receiving and analyzing concurrently with the relocation. Other aspects of the preceding apparatus may all be envisioned in this aspect as well.","Still other facets of the invention are found in a method for monitoring data on a wireless network. The data is transmitted according to a wireless network protocol on the network.","The method contains the step of receiving data from the wireless network in a portable wireless network analysis device having a wireless network interface and analyzing the wireless network data. The portable wireless network analysis device may be selectively relocated from a first location to a second location. The portable wireless network analysis device is still capable of performing the steps of receiving and analyzing concurrently with the step of relocating. All aspects of the method and the apparatus used should be construed as capable of being transferred from one to another.","Other aspects, advantages, and novel features of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description of the invention when considered in conjunction with the adaptively clocked accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00041","num":"00041"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"22"},"A distributed data processing system  contains a wireless interconnected network . The network  provides a communications link for data traffic between all the various computing or processing devices and computers connected within the distributed processing system . It should be noted that any of the devices communicatively coupled to the network  may be coupled through one or more wireless links. The devices shown may be coupled in a peer-to-peer arrangement, or through some central interconnect device that is contained in the network . It should be noted that any part of network  may be made of pure wireless links, or a mixture of wired and wireless links.","The network  includes such wireless links as embodied by protocols such as the 802.11 standards promulgated by international standards organizations. This is in addition to all other types of wireless technologies, such as satellite infrared, or other radio frequency computer communication technologies.","In fact, the method of operation may be extended to those wireless technologies not necessarily defined as a network technology. These include technologies such as the Bluetooth standard for device-device communication under infrared, as an exemplary wireless communication technology that may also employ the benefits of the subject of this application.","The network  may operate under a number of different operating schemes. Communications may flow between the associated components of the distributed processing system  under various protocols, including TCP\/IP, IPX, Appletalk, or any of a number of associated protocols. Underlying wireless protocols can include such protocols as those envisioned under an 802.11 standard, as mentioned above. The network  may also be indicative of several interconnected networks. Other wireless communications between computing devices may be found in infrared communications schemes, though not explicitly set up as a network protocol. These other wireless communications protocols may include those such as promulgated by the Bluetooth standard.","The network  connects a plurality of devices, which are described now. This can be a general computing device  and a server . Additionally, a storage unit  can also be connected to the network , thus allowing the computing device  and the server  to communicate with and store data to and from the storage unit .","Additional computing components that connect to the network  may include a remote network appliance . These network appliances may include autonomous data collection devices.","Additionally, the network may couple such devices as portable network component . Such equipment is typically used in inventory practices or delivery practices. These components can include such devices as scanners and other tracking type mechanisms.","The network  may couple remotely located computing devices  having enabled network interfaces. These computing devices may be embedded in a consumer device . Exemplary consumer devices include such items as vending machines, automated teller machines, automated payment machines for use at stores and kiosks, or any device connected via a wireless protocol to a wireless network.","Additionally, an individual user may carry a so-called \u201csmart card\u201d . The smart card may contain sufficient data and\/or processing capabilities to allow connection to and communication with other components of the distributed data processing system .","It should also be noted that the distributed data processing system might also include numerous different types of networks. Any one of, or any combination of, for example, an intranet, a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), or an aggregation of units may be connected to each other in a fashion.","If using the network in a secure fashion, the network may be local to the individual clients. In another manner, such a secure network may be implemented upon a public network using various security protocols, thus creating a virtual private network (VPN) molded from the public network infrastructure. Additionally, the present invention may be implemented on a variety of hardware and software platforms, as described above.","Additionally, an interconnection device  can be used in the network  to connect different segments, and topologies. Some examples of these devices are switches, routers, access points, base stations, firewalls or other gateways. Interconnection devices can also be used to couple different interconnected networks.","Additionally, any of the aforementioned devices may have a direct or indirect link through the interconnection device . In this manner, for example, any one device associated with the network  may directly transmit data to any of the other devices associated with the network or an interconnected network. Additionally, any of the aforementioned devices may act as a type of interconnection device. In this manner, any of the aforementioned devices may pass along data from any one of the other aforementioned devices to another aforementioned device through an intermediary link or device.","The portable wireless network analysis device  contains a wireless interface . The wireless interface  couples the portable wireless network analysis device  to the network . Depending on the location of the portable wireless network analysis device relative to any of the other computing devices described above, the wireless interface  receives packets of information destined to any of the attached computing devices associated with the wireless network .","In one instance, when the portable wireless network analysis device  is in one location, it may receive packets originally transmitted or retransmitted by a subset of the devices mentioned above. In other instances, when the portable wireless network analysis device  moves from one location to another, the portable wireless network analysis device  may receive packets transmitted or retransmitted by a different subset of the devices.","In addition to the wireless interface, the portable wireless network analysis device  contains a network analysis module . In the operational aspects, packets of the data traveling in the network  are captured by the wireless interface . The packets and\/or the contents of the transmissions are relayed to the network analysis module .","In exemplary aspects, the network analysis module performs statistics, analysis, and diagnostics on the wireless network traffic being carried on the wireless network . Various type of information, such as source addresses, destination addresses, dropped packets, packet types, or packet sizes are collected and collated by the network analysis module .","Error analysis on the individual packets or frames may also be performed. These errors may include checksum errors, undersize or oversize errors, frame misalignment, or broadcast or multicast type errors associated with wireless networks.","Statistics on network traffic may also be performed. These functions include collation of packet totals, distribution of packet sizes, numbers of broadcasts, numbers of multicasts, numbers of errors of varying types, channel use statistics, utilization statistics, or packet rate statistics.","Additionally, several filtering aspects may be implemented as well. The network analysis module  selectively processes packets based on type, source address, destination address, source-destination pairs, broadcast and\/or multicast, wireless channel, computer \u201chop\u201d, \u201chop\u201d numbers, or other criteria. This other criteria can be any characteristic relating to the machines on the network, characteristics relating to the data or packets, or characteristics relating to the network itself.","In contradistinction to the real time aspect where the packets are analyzed on the fly for the particular trait or quality and then discarded, as described above, the portable wireless network analysis device  can store network traffic in a buffer associated with the network analysis module . In this manner, a \u201crecord\u201d and \u201canalyze\u201d sequence can be performed on a series of packets or other network traffic. In this manner, a full analysis of the complete sequence of network data traffic may be performed at a later time. A series of analyses and statistics may be developed for the recorded network traffic.","In other uses, the network analysis module  implements alarm signals based on network characteristics. For example, the network analysis module  monitors the traffic on the network . When certain occurrences happen, or thresholds are met, then the network analysis module  can initiate an alarm indicating the problem.","The alarm may be triggered selectively based on an operator's actions or selections. This selective triggering may include detailing one alarm with a selected alarm level, triggering an alarm when certain events happen, or triggering an alarm when logical combinations of occurrences happen.","For example, an alarm may be set when the ratio of packets with checksum errors reached a certain level. Or, an alarm could be set for the occurrence of frame alignment errors. Other alarm criteria may include miss-sized packets, utilization rate thresholds exceeding or falling below predetermined levels, packet rates exceeding or falling below predetermined levels, errors in multicast or broadcast packets, source-destination errors, or any of a number of other network parameters.","Additionally, the alarm triggers may be logical combinations of alarm events. For example, an alarm may be set when checksum errors are above a certain ratio, but only when the packet rate is also above a certain rate. In this manner complex analysis of the wireless network  may be performed.","Additional features of the portable wireless network analysis device include a capture engine. The user can selectively set a capture buffer size. The filters can be used with the capture engine to selectively screen the network data collected.","A decode engine may be utilized as well. The user can observe summaries, details, or hex dumps of data packets. The decode engine can apply parameters to locate specific frames. This can be by frame number, by text search, or by mark current frame. Time information is also decoded. This information includes relative time, delta time, and absolute time information.","The analysis module can also include a real time reporting module. As one example, this can be used in an 802.11 network to find all access points (APs) within range. It can display relative load on each AP within range, based on throughput and data throughput.","The analysis module can also perform response time calculations. In one case, the TCP\/UDP based application response time is provided for port based applications. Response time can also be measured based on the application layer and the true server client application response time.","Additionally the analysis module can report on statistics collected by the individual channels during channel surfing activity. This data includes control, data, and management frames. Additionally, such information, errors, retries, and different packet speeds can be reported.","In this manner, the portable wireless network analysis device allows users to see problems in real-time. This includes rogue AP detection (detecting access points that are not on the specified AP list), association failures, authentication failures, excessive noise, re-association failures, and frame timeouts, to name but a few.","Channel surfing capabilities are also provided. This allows the user to stay on every channel for a predetermined amount of time and then rove to the next selected channel.","Users can define triggers based on traffic parameters or network characteristics. Such triggers can include packets per second, or any other alarm condition or network condition, or combination of network conditions. Such alarms or triggers can be associated with specific actions on the portable wireless network analysis device. Such actions performed in light of any trigger, alarm, or combination thereof, include capture, save to disk, or the viewing of specific monitors or data.","In one aspect, the analysis of the application, presentation, session, or transport layers of the layered protocol scheme may be subsequent to analysis of the lower level protocols, or in conjunction thereof. In this aspect, the wireless monitoring concentrates on the structure and interaction of the network messages and the network itself relative to the physical, data link, and possibly network layers. In this manner, the monitoring of wireless networks is done at a lower layer than most typical network monitoring products but at a higher layer than physical-only-testers can do.","Links to the wireless network card will allow the system to observe and monitor the power levels associated with the network traffic. In this case, the reception characteristics of the wireless data from various points may be monitored and stored for analysis.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00077","num":"00077"},"figref":["FIGS. 2","FIGS. 2","FIGS. 2"],"i":["a","b","c ","a-c ","a-c "],"b":["2","2","1","1"]},"In , the wireless network couples the network devices , , , , and . In this manner, the wireless network has several interlinks. In , the portable wireless network analysis device  is originally placed at one location in the network, whereby it maintains contact to the network such that it can capture the network traffic to the devices  and . In this manner, the traffic that the devices  and  see may be analyzed. This includes the traffic inbound and outbound from those devices, as well as any traffic that includes those devices in any hops to other devices.","In , the portable wireless network analysis device  is originally placed at another location in the network, whereby it maintains contact to the network such that it can capture the network traffic to the devices , , and . In this manner, the traffic that the devices , , and  see may be analyzed. This includes the traffic inbound and outbound from those devices, as well as any traffic that includes those devices in any hops to other devices. In this manner, the portable wireless network analysis device  can analyze with granularity the sub-portions of a wireless network on an as needed basis.","This is particularly apparent when one realizes that the devices , , , , and  can all move relative to one another. In this manner, the portable wireless network analysis device  can analyze the fluid changes inherent in the wireless networking scheme.","For example, such changes may include physical relocation of a device, or a channel change of a device. It should be noted that, in current implementations, the portable wireless network analyzer could analyze these changes in various ways. For example, the portable wireless network analyzer can perform a search across channels for ID pairs to relocate the particular device. In this manner, the changes inherent in the wireless networking can be achieved.","It should be noted that while the devices , , , , and  are able to move, any one might be a stationary device. These devices include access points and other stationary network devices as described in FIG. .","In many networking schemes, the routing or network legs may take differing topologies, depending on the specific implementation. It should be noted that are meant to be generic for all wireless linked networks. It should also be noted that the portable wireless network analyzer may only see one side of a data transaction. For instance, the portable wireless network analyzer may be at a physical location that is relatively near one other device, such as the device , but substantially farther away from another. In this case, the portable wireless network analyzer may be able to monitor the data outbound from the device , but may not be able to monitor data inbound to it.","Specifically, in many implementations, the topologies can follow differing views, depending upon the specific hardware involved. For example, each wireless node may interconnect with other wireless nodes in a peer-to-peer arrangement. But in most cases the mobile wireless nodes communicate with fixed devices like access points, which forward the signal to and from the wired network. This mode is usually called infrastructure mode.","Thus, the numerous nodes are interconnected in this case in a weave-like fashion, much like that depicted above in relation to . In a specific aspect, this peer-to-peer arrangement is implemented in the 802.11 standard, and is called an Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS) configuration.","In another aspect of the same 802.11, a wireless access point (AP) defines a service range for the wireless network devices. In particular, the network devices in contact with the AP define a basic service set (BSS). Interconnected BSS networks make up an extended service set (ESS) topology. The access points may be coupled through wireless or wired means, or some combination thereof.","In particular, subnetworks within each service set may be defined. In this case, when a particular wireless network device is in communication with the particular subnetworks, the particular wireless network device may have a need to define itself as a node in any particular subnetwork. Alternatively, the wireless device can be configured to respond to all the subnetworks.","To differentiate the subnetworks or particular networks, each particular subnetwork or network may have an identification associated with it. In this case, the communications for one network will be ignored by those devices associated with another network based, at least in part, by this identification associated with the transmissions of data.","In the case of an 802.11 protocol, this is accomplished by an Extended Service Set Identifier (ESSID), which identifies the wireless local area network (LAN). The ESSID of the mobile device must match the ESSID of the AP to communicate with the AP. ESSID is a 32-character maximum string and is case-sensitive.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00090","num":"00090"},"figref":["FIGS. 3","FIGS. 2","FIG. 3"],"i":["a ","b ","a-c","a ","a.

In short order, the computing device  can load into the portable wireless network analysis device  additional modules that enhance the functionality of the analysis module contained therein. In this case, the portable wireless network analysis device  may be dynamically modified to monitor alternative wireless formats, or to provide alternative analysis tools, as they may become available.","The radio signals to a wireless connection, which normally travel in all directions from an antenna, are reduced very quickly.

It will miss all acknowledges from the access point. The portable wireless network analysis device will also see all acknowledgements from the station, but not the data from the access point that was acknowledged.","The portable wireless network analysis device can also monitor the signal strength for every single packet, regardless of its type (data, management or control). Using this information, the portable wireless network analysis device can correlate the active connections (stations to access points) based on the specific location where the portable wireless network analysis device was located.","The sample table below shows an exemplary display of signal strength information for the current observed radio layer connections at a certain position. Instead of numerical values, the portable wireless network analysis device can display other indicia of values. The network monitoring device can draw small indicators. These indicators may also be different colors for different signal ranges of values. Address books for address resolution can be implemented for an easier understanding of the environment.
