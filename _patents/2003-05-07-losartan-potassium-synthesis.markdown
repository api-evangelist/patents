No. 60\/468,208, filed 6 May 2003, and further claims priority from India National patent application Serial No. 335\/MUM\/2003, filed 3 Apr. 2003.","None.","The invention is related to an improved process for the synthesis of Losartan Potassium, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist.","Among cardiovascular drugs, Angiotensin II receptor antagonists like losartan potassium are prominently used as an active ingredient in the management of hypertension. Losartan potassium plays an effective role in patients having difficulty in tolerating ACE inhibitors. The chemical name of losartan potassium is 2-n-Butyl-4-Chloro-1[((2\u2032-tetrazol-5-yl)-1,1\u2032-bisphenyl-4-yl)methyl]-imidazole-5-methanol potassium.","It is known in the art to synthesize losartan potassium from the acid form of losartan. Losartan potassium (shown as the compound of formula (I) below) is known in the art as able to be synthesized by reacting its acid (shown as the compound of formula (II) below) with KOH. The intermediate acid form (II) in turn is known as able to be synthesized by detritylation of 2-n-butyl-4-chloro-5-hydroxymethyl-1-[((2\u2032-triphenylmethyltetrazole-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl)methyl]imidazole (shown as the compound of formula (III) below).","The synthesis of Trityl Losartan (the reactant of form (I) below) is known in the art. See 34 J. M. C. 2525-27 (1991); 59 J. O. C. 6391-94 (1994) U.S. Pat. No. 5,138,069). Trityl Losartan (and the Losartan acid) and may alternatively be prepared using the reactions and techniques described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,138,069 and patent application number WO93\/10106. \n\n","The preparation from Trityl Losartan (the reactant of form (III)) of Losartan acid (II) by acid-catalyzed cleavage of the trityl group from Trityl Losartan (III) is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,281,603. Another method disclosed to prepare Losartan acid from trityl losartan is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,281,604; in this process, Trityl Losartan (III) is refluxed in a mixture of methanol and tetrahydrofuran for 18 hours to get losartan acid (II).","Similarly, in patent application number WO01\/81336, Richter Gedeon describes treatment of Trityl Losartan (III) with potassium hydroxide in primary alcohols and crystallization of the product (I) from methanol with the help of anti-solvents such as dipolar aprotic solvent (acetonitrile), aprotic solvent (straight or branched chain or cyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons) or a protic solvent (sec-butanol).","The Richter Gedeon approach was found to be easy and superior to the existing methods, however was found to suffer from various drawbacks as summarized below:\n\n","The art teaches not only the need for purifying the resulting losartan potassium (I), the art teaches various methods to purify it. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,608,075 discloses two polymorphic forms of Losartan Potassium, which are form I and form II. Their method of preparation and characterization by X-ray powder diffraction pattern, DSC thermograms, FT-IR spectra, Raman spectra and CNMR (solid state) spectra is also given. The disclosed procedure for polymorphic form I is the addition of aqueous solution of (I) to a refluxing mixture of cyclohexane and isopropyl alcohol followed by azeotropic distilling out cyclohexane\/isopropyl alcohol\/water ternary azeotrope at 64\u00b0 C. while the form I crystallizes out at 69\u00b0 C.","Patent application number WO 98\/18787 describes a method which also starts with a solution of Losartan Potassium (I) in aqueous isopropyl alcohol and is heated to distill out water-isopropyl alcohol mixture to lower the water content to 2.6%. Further excessive seeding is carried out with slurry of Losartan Potassium (I) in cyclohexane until the seed remains undissolved. The precipitation of the product is then achieved by continuous distillation of ternary azeotrope with simultaneous addition of cyclohexane to the reaction mass. This azeotrope distillation is carried out until moisture level decreases to about 0.2 to 0.11%. The crystallized product thus obtained is filtered.","The invention is related to a process for the synthesis of Losartan Potassium of formula (I), which comprises detritylation of Trityl Losartan of formula (III) in a primary alcohol (we use the term \u201cprimary alcohol\u201d to mean an alcohol of the structure R\u2014OH, wherein the R group is a C1 to approximately C4 chain) with a potassium tertiary alkoxide (e.g., potassium tertiary butoxide) as a reagent, without needing to isolate the corresponding free acid of formula II. The Losartan Potassium product is isolated by crystallization from a solvent such as Isopropyl alcohol or tetrahydrofuran, or, optionally, a combination of both in a suitable ratio.","The invention deals with the single pot synthesis of Losartan Potassium (I) of very high purity. The process starts with Trityl Losartan (III), but uses a single solvent such as isopropyl alcohol or tetrahydrofuran. This leads to reduction of the solvent usage and losses. This process eliminates the need for extra purification of (I). The use of single solvents (isopropyl alcohol or tetrahydrofuran) also makes the single solvent easily recoverable and reusable in the process, reducing the cost of production significantly.","In an optional embodiment a combination of isopropyl alcohol and tetrahydrofuran in suitable proportions have also been used, giving high yields and purity. However, in this case the solvent mixture require fractional distillation after recovery.","The present process involves refluxing a mixture of Trityl Losartan (III) and an equimolar amount of potassium tertiary butoxide (KOBut) together in solvent comprised of a primary alcohol. The primary alcohol is preferably present in a volume of from three to six times the volume with respect to the Trityl Losartan (II). We prefer the reaction be maintained for about 3-10 hours, preferably for 4-8 hours, albeit reaction times may be adjusted depending on solvent concentration, temperature, etc. . . . Regardless of the specific reaction conditions used, one can monitor the reaction progress by Thin Layer Chromatography, to assess completion. \n\n\nAfter detritylation, the reaction mixture is cooled down to 0 to \u221210\u00b0 C. This cooling may be done with the primary alcohol present, or after it is substantially removed. We prefer that it is done after about 50% of the primary alcohol is removed. The product is then filtered to remove the by-product (namely trityl methyl ether). The filtered reaction mass is then concentrated to remove primary alcohol. It is preferable to remove primary alcohol before crystallizing the product from isopropyl alcohol or tetrahydrofuran, but the complete removal up to the last traces is not essential, as far as quality of the product is concerned.\n","The advantage of the modified process disclosed herein over prior art is that the product contains almost similar chemical profile, but the new process gives a product of high quality which meets current drug substance purity requirements, without requiring extra purification step. Another major advantage of this process is the use of a single solvent (isopropyl alcohol or tetrahydrofuran), which requires only 1.0-6.0 times the volume of solvent, as compared to larger volumes of solvents (as is done in prior art solvent mixtures). Similarly, the use of a single solvent improves solvent recovery and reusability, making the process cost effective, eco-friendly as well as plant friendly.","The following examples of the present invention are illustrated:","Under nitrogen atmosphere in a 500 ml flask, a solution of potassium tertiary butoxide (8.44 gm, 0.075 mole) in methanol (275 ml) is prepared. To this solution, 50.0 gm of trityl losartan (0.075 mole) is added. The mixture is refluxed for 8 hours. The completion of reaction is monitored on TLC. After satisfactory completion, the reaction mass is concentrated to 50%, and cooled to approximately \u22125\u00b0 C.

Isopropyl alcohol (75 ml) is charged and kept for 12 hours at 25-30\u00b0 C. The reaction mass is then cooled to 0-5\u00b0 C. and filtered. The resulting product, Losartan Potassium, is then washed with chilled isopropyl alcohol (15 ml). The final product is dried at 45-50\u00b0 C. under vacuum for 6 hours to remove residual isopropyl alcohol.
