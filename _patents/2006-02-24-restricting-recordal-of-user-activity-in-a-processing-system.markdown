No. 60\/661,695, entitled Method And System For Preventing Recordation Of User Activity In A Processing System, and filed on Mar. 14, 2005. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/661,695 is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The present invention generally relates to a method, system and\/or computer readable medium of instructions for restricting recordal of user activity in a processing system, and more particularly to a method, system and\/or computer readable medium of instructions for restricting or preventing user performed keystrokes and\/or mouse actions to be recorded by a software program or device, such as, for example, keylogger software.","A keylogger, as used herein, refers to software or hardware that is designed to record and\/or store keystrokes which a user types on a keyboard of a processing system. A keylogger can be designed to be unobtrusive or hidden to the user and usually operates without the knowledge of the user. By recording keystrokes, a keylogger may transfer such recorded details to another person or entity, wherein the details may comprise usernames, passwords or credit card details. This information may then be used to the detriment of the user of the processing system, without their knowledge.","A keylogger blocker, as used herein, refers to software or hardware that is designed to restrict a keylogger from operating normally or recording keystrokes made by a user.","A hook (also known as a hook procedure or hook function), as used herein, generally refers to a callback function provided by a software application that receives certain data before the normal or intended recipient of the data. A hook function can thus examine or modify certain data before passing on the data. Therefore, a hook function allows a software application, such as a keylogger, to examine data such as keystrokes before the data is passed to the intended recipient.","An API (\u201cApplication Programming Interface\u201d) hook (also known as an API interception), as used herein as a type of hook, refers to a callback function provided by an application that replaces functionality provided by an operating system's API. An API generally refers to an interface that is defined in terms of a set of functions and procedures, and enables a program to gain access to facilities within an application. An API hook can be inserted between an API call and an API procedure to examine or modify function parameters before passing parameters on to an actual or intended function. An API hook may also choose not to pass on certain types of requests to an actual or intended function.","A process, as used herein, is at least one of a running software program or other computing operation, or a part of a running software program or other computing operation, that performs a task.","A hook chain (Microsoft Windows\u2122 specific definition), as used herein, is a list of pointers to special, application-defined callback functions called hook procedures. When a message occurs that is associated with a particular type of hook, Microsoft Windows\u2122 passes the message to each hook procedure referenced in the hook chain, one after the other. The action a hook procedure can take depends on the type of hook involved. For example, the hook procedures for some types of hooks can only monitor messages, others can modify messages or stop their progress through the chain, restricting them from reaching the next hook procedure or a destination window.","A kernel, as used herein, refers to the core part of an operating system, responsible for resource allocation, low-level hardware interfaces, security, etc.","An interrupt, as used herein, is at least one of a signal to a processing system that stops the execution of a running program so that another action can be performed, or a circuit that conveys a signal stopping the execution of a running program.","In a networked information or data communications system, a user has access to one or more terminals which are capable of requesting and\/or receiving information or data from local or remote information sources. In such a communications system, a terminal may be a type of processing system, computer or computerised device, personal computer (PC), mobile, cellular or satellite telephone, mobile data terminal, portable computer, Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), pager, thin client, or any other similar type of digital electronic device. The capability of such a terminal to request and\/or receive information or data can be provided by software, hardware and\/or firmware. A terminal may comprise or be associated with other devices, for example a local data storage device such as a hard disk drive or solid state drive.","An information source can comprise a server, or any type of terminal, that may be associated with one or more storage devices that are able to store information or data, for example in one or more databases residing on a storage device. The exchange of information (ie. the request and\/or receipt of information or data) between a terminal and an information source, or other terminal(s), is facilitated by a communication means. The communication means can be realised by physical cables, for example a metallic cable such as a telephone line, semi-conducting cables, electromagnetic signals, for example radio-frequency signals or infra-red signals, optical fibre cables, satellite links or any other such medium or combination thereof connected to a network infrastructure.","Presently, there are two known categories of keylogger blockers: signature based and behaviour based.","A signature based keylogger blocker relies on a database of signatures for known keylogger software. Signatures are collections of information which contain a description of keylogger software, and may comprise characteristics such as file size, file name, a cryptographic hash or checksum, or pseudo code which represents program flow.","These signatures are read by the keylogger blocker and used to determine whether or not to allow execution of a suspected process. A problem with signature based keylogger blockers is that they require constant maintenance and updating of the signature database in order to be effective. Signature based keylogger blockers do not restrict the operation of a keylogger which is not covered in the signature database.","A behaviour based keylogger blocker attempts to restrict keylogger software from functioning correctly by examining behaviour of keylogger software and restricting \u2018suspicious\u2019 activity. Currently available behaviour based keylogger blockers can restrict some known and unknown keyloggers from recording keystrokes, however currently known behaviour based keylogger blockers are not sufficient to stop keylogger software from establishing a hook in the hook chain, and thus these keylogger blocker programs may be easily bypassed by keyloggers. Additionally, currently known behaviour based keylogger blockers fail to restrict or terminate a keylogger's process and notify a user in real-time.","Referring to , there is illustrated a system structure used by presently known keylogger blockers. On start-up, this system structure installs a system wide keyboard hook onto the hook chain (C). Whenever a particular hook is called which the keylogger blocker wishes to restrict propagating through the hook chain, the next hook in the chain (E) is not called, or a system buffer containing keystates is cleared. This method restricts information propagating to all other installed hooks, such as keyboard hooks. However, this restriction of the propagation of information is risky as other hooks further down the hook chain may not receive required data, and may subsequently stall an operating system running on the processing system.","There exists a need for a method, system and\/or computer readable medium of instructions to at least restrict or prevent the recordal of keystrokes and\/or mouse actions which address or at least ameliorate problems inherent in the prior art.","The reference to any prior art in this specification is not, and should not be taken as, an acknowledgment or any form of suggestion that such prior art forms part of the common general knowledge.","According to a first broad form, the present invention provides a method of restricting recordal of user activity in a processing system, the method comprising:","intercepting a kernel API call of the processing system;","determining if a process initiating the kernel API call is malicious; and","in response to a positive determination, terminating the process.","Preferably, but not necessarily, the method comprises performing behavioural analysis of the process to determine if the process is malicious.","Also preferably, but not necessarily, determining if the process is malicious comprises checking if the API call is related to a user interface.","In particular, but non-limiting, forms, determining if the process is malicious comprises checking if the API call is related to a graphical user interface.

In one particular, but non-limiting, form, the computer readable medium of instructions are embodied as a software program.","The following modes, given by way of example only, are described in order to provide a more precise understanding of the subject matter of a preferred embodiment or embodiments.","A particular embodiment of the present invention can be realised using a processing system, an example of which is shown in . In particular, the processing system  generally comprises at least one processor , or processing unit or plurality of processors, memory , at least one input device  and at least one output device , coupled together via a bus or group of buses . In certain embodiments, input device  and output device  could be the same device. An interface  can also be provided for coupling the processing system  to one or more peripheral devices, for example interface  could be a PCI card or PC card. At least one storage device  which houses at least one database  can also be provided. The memory  can be any form of memory device, for example, volatile or non-volatile memory, solid state storage devices, magnetic devices, etc. The processor  could comprise more than one distinct processing device, for example to handle different functions within the processing system . Input device  receives input data  and can comprise, for example, a keyboard, a pointer device such as a pen-like device or a mouse, audio receiving device for voice controlled activation such as a microphone, data receiver or antenna such as a modem or wireless data adaptor, data acquisition card, etc. Input data  could come from different sources, for example keyboard instructions in conjunction with data received via a network. Output device  produces or generates output data  and can comprise, for example, a display device or monitor in which case output data  is visual, a printer in which case output data  is printed, a port for example a USB port, a peripheral component adaptor, a data transmitter or antenna such as a modem or wireless network adaptor, etc. Output data  could be distinct and derived from different output devices, for example a visual display on a monitor in conjunction with data transmitted to a network.

The interface  may allow wired and\/or wireless communication between the processing unit  and peripheral components that may serve a specialised purpose. The processor  receives instructions as input data  via input device  and can display processed results or other output to a user by utilising output device . More than one input device  and\/or output device  can be provided. It should be appreciated that the processing system  may be any form of terminal, server, specialised hardware, or the like.","The processing system  may be a part of a networked communications system. Processing system  could connect to network, for example the Internet or a WAN. Input data  and output data  could be communicated to other devices via the network. The transfer of information and\/or data over the network can be achieved using wired communications means or wireless communications means. A server can facilitate the transfer of data between the network and one or more databases. A server and one or more databases provide an example of an information source.","Referring now to , there is illustrated an example flow chart showing the process of intercepting an API call. At step , an event occurs in the processing system. At step , an operating system running in the processing system registers the occurrence of the event. At step , the operating system passes the registered event to the hook chain. At step , the event is passed to each hook in the hook chain such that different applications, processes, and devices may be notified of the registered event. Once the event has propagated throughout the hook chain, the method comprises at step  an application receiving notification of the event being registered by the processing system. At step , the application initiates an API call to an API procedure so as to carry out a response to the registered event. If an API hook has been established between the API call and the API procedure, the API call is intercepted before it reaches the API procedure. The API call may be allowed to continue calling the API procedure at step  or the API call may not be passed on to the API procedure, as shown at step .","An example method for restricting recordal of user activity in a processing system using interception of a kernel API call will now be described with reference to .","In particular, at step , the method comprises intercepting a kernel API call. Then at step , the method comprises determining if a process initiating the kernel API call is malicious. If the process is determined to be malicious, the method comprises terminating the determined process at step . If the process is determined not to be malicious, the method may optionally return to the beginning of the method and continue to determine whether any other processes are malicious.","A more detailed example of a method for restricting recordal of user activity in a processing system using interception of kernel API calls will now be described with reference to .","In particular, at step , the processing system is configured to intercept a kernel API call. The kernel API call may or may not be intercepted in processes system wide, although usually this may be done system-wide. However, a person skilled in the art will appreciate that it is not essential that the kernel API call be system-wide.","At step , the behaviour of the process is analysed to determine if the process is suspicious. This may comprise for example determining if the API call is GUI or non-GUI related, whether the process comprises a hidden window, comparing the process to signatures of known keylogger programs, and comparing the process to other common behavioural traits of keylogger software. If the process is determined to be suspicious, the method moves to step .","At step , the method comprises the processing system determining whether the initiating process of the intercepted API call is malicious based on the results of step . If the processing system determines that based on the behavioural analysis the initiating process is malicious the method moves to step , otherwise, the API call is passed to the API procedure, as shown at step  and the method returns to intercepting other kernel API calls at step .","At step , the method comprises identifying the requesting or initiating process. Thus, process information is generated in regard to the particular process, wherein the process information may comprise at least one of: a name of the process, a process identity number, a user that the process belongs, a time the process was started, a parent process identity number, associated processing cycles for the process, and\/or any associated open port number.","At step , the method comprises the determined process being terminated or killed. Therefore, the process stops requesting notification of the particular event occurring. For example, if the determined malicious process were a keylogger attempting to establish a hook in the hook chain to subsequently record keystrokes, the process would be restricted from being inserted into the hook chain.","Optionally (as indicated by the dotted outline), at step , the user may be notified of the determined process, and its subsequent termination. Additionally, the user may be prompted to authorise the termination of determined process. Optionally, the generated process information and determined parameters may be stored in file stored in the processing system's data store, such that a record of the terminated process may be subsequently viewed by a user.","An example method for restricting recordal of user activity in a processing system using interception of an input device API call for the processing system will now be described with reference to .","In particular, at step , the method comprises intercepting an input device API call. Then at step , the method comprises determining if a process is requesting a state of an input device using the intercepted input device API.","In response to a positive determination of a process requesting the state of an input device, the method comprises at step , updating a table, stored in the processing system's data store, with request information related to the determined process. In response to a negative determination, the input device API call is allowed to proceed to the API procedure at step , and as such the method continues to intercept appropriate API calls at step .","At step , the method comprises determining if a trend of requests exists by the process. If a trend exists, the method moves to step  to terminate the process. Otherwise, the method optionally continues to monitor processes requesting the state of the input device at step .","A more detailed example of a method for restricting recordal of user activity in a processing system using interception of an input device function for the processing system will now be described with reference to .","In particular, at step , the method comprises intercepting an input device API call. Typically, this would comprise intercepting a keyboard wide or mouse wide API call.","At step , the processing system is configured to determine if the initiating process of the input device API call is requesting the state of an input device, such as a keystroke pressed on a keyboard. In response to a positive determination, the method continues to step , otherwise the method continues to monitor processes requesting the state of the input devices being monitored.","At step , the method comprises determining the requesting process. This step would be similarly performed to step  previous discussed.","At step , the method comprises generating request information related to the requesting process. Thus, the process information generated in step  as well as parameter information may be used for generating request information for the associated process.","At step , the method comprises updating a table with the generated request information. The table is typically stored in the processing system's data store, i.e. memory. The table typically comprises past request information for processes that have requested the status of the monitored input devices. Therefore, the table may be used by the processing system for determining a trend in requests for the status, as performed at step .","At step , the information stored in the request information undergoes a behavioural analysis. This may comprise analysis of a continual polling of the status, polling at regular intervals, such as every tenth of a second, whether the GUI or non-GUI related, whether there is hidden windows, and other such variations of suspicious behaviour.","At step , the method comprises the processing system determining, using the results of the behavioural analysis, whether the initiating process is malicious. If the process is determined to not be malicious, the method continues back at step . However, if the process is determined to be malicious, the process is terminated at step .","Optionally (as indicated by the dotted outline), at step  the user may be notified of the process, as earlier described in relation to .","An example of a method for restricting recordal of user activity in a processing system using interception of a kernel device driver API call for the processing system will now be described with reference to .","In particular, at step , the method comprises intercepting a kernel device driver API call. Then at step , the method comprises determining if a process is attempting to alter a device driver using the intercepted device driver API call. In response to a positive determination of a process attempting to maliciously alter the device driver, the method comprises restricting the process from calling the API procedure at step .","A more detailed example of a method for restricting recordal of user activity in a processing system using interception of a kernel device driver API call for the processing system will now be described with reference to .","In particular, at step , the method comprises intercepting a kernel device driver API call. Therefore, any attempted modification, alteration, replacement, or deletion of a device driver is intercepted, such as the alteration of a mouse or keyboard driver.","At step , the method comprises determining whether a process initiating the API call is attempting to alter a device driver. In response to a positive determination, the method continues to step , otherwise the method continues to monitor any intercepted processes that may be altering a device driver.","At step , the method comprises determining if the user requires a prompt regarding the determined process attempting to alter the device driver. If the user requires prompting, the method moves to step , otherwise the API call is passed to the API procedure at step  and the method continues to step  where kernel device driver API calls are continued to be intercepted.","Thus, at step , a prompt may be displayed comprising for example a graphical window, warning of the determined process and requesting the user to provide a response to the prompt. The prompt may request an indication as to whether the user wishes to proceed with allowing the process to alter the device driver.","At step , the processing system receives a response from the user regarding the prompt. At step , the method comprises determining using the received response, whether the user wishes to allow the process to continue altering the device driver. In response to the user indicating that the user does wish to allow the process to continue altering the device driver, the API call is passed to the API procedure, as illustrated by step . However, if the user indicated that the device driver is not to be altered, the method moves to step .","At step , the method comprises restricting the process from altering the device driver by not allowing the API call passing to the API procedure.","At step , the method optionally comprises notifying the user of the terminated process, similarly described to step .","An example of a method for restricting recordal of user activity in a processing system by monitoring an interrupt structure of a kernel for the processing system will now be described with reference to .","In particular, at step  the method comprises monitoring the interrupt structure of the operating system kernel. This allows for particular interrupts associated with redirecting parameters associated with keystrokes to malicious programs.","This may comprise for example intercepting a hook for writing to relevant kernel structures.","Alternatively, this may comprise for example the kernel structure being read and stored in a global internal table, and additionally a temporary internal table is created which can be compared to the global table repeatedly to determine if an alteration has occurred.","At step , the method comprises determining whether a process is attempting to alter an input device interrupt in the interrupt structure. In response to determining that the process is attempting to alter the input device interrupt, the method comprises at step  restricting the process from altering the interrupt structure, and thus restricting parameters such as keystrokes to be recorded.","This may comprise for example, restricting the next hook in the hook chain from being called as this method restricts the kernel structure from being altered. The user may be notified of a process being restricted from altering the kernel structure.","Alternatively, this may comprise for example comparing the internal temporary table to the global table. If a change has occurred in the temporary table, a comparison to the global table may determine a discrepancy, and as a result of this determination, the global table is written back to the kernel structures. Additionally, the user may be notified of the restriction of a process altering the kernel structures.","It will be appreciated by the person skilled in the art, that any combination of keylogger blocking methods described in  through to  may be used together in order to increase the success of detecting a keylogger program.","Referring now to , there are illustrated example system structures that provide various embodiments of behaviour based keylogger blockers.","Illustrated in  is a system for providing a keylogger blocker based on kernel API call interception. The keylogger components of keylogger software are prevented from functioning correctly by examining keylogger behaviour, blocking \u2018suspicious\u2019 activity by preventing the keylogger establishing a hook in the hook chain and terminating the suspicious process. This can be achieved as follows:","1) Intercept the operating system kernel's API calls and keyboard\/mouse state API calls (F);","2) On any calls to the kernel APIs (B), examine specified parameters and determine whether a process is malicious.
