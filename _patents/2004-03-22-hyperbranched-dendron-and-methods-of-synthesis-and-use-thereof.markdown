title: Hyperbranched dendron and methods of synthesis and use thereof
abstract: Hyperbranched dendron (HD) polymers are synthesized using low molecular weight polyethyleneimine (BPEI-L) as a core and used for gene delivery. The obtained polymers display low toxicity and efficient gene delivery at low nitrogen-to-phosphate (N/P) ratios. Using successive attachment of ethyleneimine moieties to a PEI core, the polymer has a lower relative ratio of linear-to-branched structures than in the core PEI. The more extensive branching enables the polymer to condense plasmid DNA into nanostructure complexes with a size of less than or equal to about 100 nm. The complexes are stable and efficient in transfecting cells in the presence of serum. Bioluminescent imaging of in vivo gene expression using a luciferase reporter gene performed in live mice showed gene expression in the liver and in submandibular lymph nodes.

No. 60\/456,533, filed Mar. 21, 2003 and entitled \u201cCompositions Comprising Hyperbranched Dendron Polymers and Methods of Use Thereof,\u201d which is hereby incorporated in its entirety herein.","The United States government may have certain rights in this invention by virtue of grant number P50CA086355-03 from the National Cancer Institute.","1. Field of the Invention","The invention relates to a new, flexible hyperbranched dendron having multiple binding sites for negatively charged nucleic acids or other polyanions (e.g., DNA), and the synthesis of the hyperbranched dendron. The complexes of hyperbranched polymers and DNA are less than 90 nm in diameter and are very stable for prolonged periods of time; and the polymer material is of low toxicity. The polymer\/DNA complexes can bind to and transfect cells in the presence of any added negatively charged medium components (e.g., serum) with unexpectedly high efficiency. The in vitro transfection efficiency using the hyperbranched dendron of the invention is higher than transfection reagents that are currently commercially available. In addition, because of the high transfection efficiency and low cytotoxicity, the hyperbranched dendron shows good in vivo transfection efficiency and includes lasting gene expression.","2. Introduction","Non-viral gene transfer is frequently regarded as a potentially more safe alternative to the viral gene delivery. However, non-viral gene transfer to mammalian cells usually lacks the efficiency typical to that of viral transduction and requires substantial improvement. Non-viral delivery of DNA usually requires condensation with positively charged lipids or polycations to enable binding of polyionic complexes to plasma membrane and further internalization by cells. The condensation ideally yields complexes that could release DNA after the internalization. In recent years several cationic polymers that readily form complexes with DNA (e.g. polylysine, polyethyleneimine or various types of block and graft copolymers) have been investigated as potential nonviral vectors that enable transfer of DNA into mammalian cells. Interactions of a polycation and DNA frequently results in a formation of very compact colloidal complexes which are frequently unstable and may precipitate from solutions [Pelta, J., et al., \u201cDNA aggregation induced by polyamines and cobalthexamine,\u201d 271, 5656\u20135662 (1996).]. Physical properties of these complexes that define their size and stability depend heavily on chemical structure as well as on physical properties of the polycation.","As research in the area of synthetic carriers for DNA delivery expands beyond the traditional in vitro experiments, various polycations, including branched polyethyleneimine (BPEI), starburst polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers [Haensler, J., et al., \u201cPolyamidoamine Cascade Polymers Mediate Efficient Transfection of Cells in Culture,\u201d 4, 372\u2013379 (1993); Ohsaki, M., et al., \u201cIn vitro gene Transfection using dendritic poly(L-lysine),\u201d 13, 510\u2013517 (2002); KukowskaLatallo, J. F., et al., \u201cEfficient transfer of genetic material into mammalian cells using Starburst polyamidoamine dendrimers,\u201d 93, 4897\u20134902 (1996); Choi, J. S., et al., \u201cSynthesis of a barbell-like triblock copolymer, poly(L-lysine) dendrimer-block-poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(L-lysine) dendrimer, and its self-assembly with plasmid DNA,\u201d 122, 474\u2013480 (2000).], as well as hyperbranched polymers are now being closely investigated.","Some of the above polycations have shown high levels of gene transfer in mammalian cell culture. High transfection efficiency of BPEI and PAMAM compared to other polycations is explained by the effect of a \u201cproton sponge\u201d [Boussif, O., et al., \u201cOptimized galenics improve in vitro gene transfer with cationic molecules up to 1000-fold,\u201d 3, 1074\u20131080 (1996)]. This effect is supposedly caused by the protonation of tertiary amines present in the core of those polymers in acidic milieu of endosomes. Godbey et al. [\u201cTracking the intracellular path of poly(ethylenimine)\/DNA complexes for gene delivery,\u201d 96, 5177\u20135181 (1999)] reported that the protonated form of branched PEI or PAMAM may perturb endosomes probably due to membrane activity of cationic polymers or by osmotic effects causing occasional lysis. Haensler et al. (supra) has reported that dendrimers show high level of transfection in a wide variety of cells in culture with low concomitant cytotoxicity. However, in a later study they reported that stringently synthesized and purified, monodisperse PAMAM dendrimers showed low levels of transfection.","Furthermore, the transfection activity of PAMAM dramatically improved after the random degradation by heat treatment in a solvolytic solvent [Tang, M. X., et al., \u201cIn vitro gene delivery by degraded polyamidoamine dendrimers,\u201d 7, 703\u2013714 (1996)] leading to a hypothesis that polydisperse \u201cfractured\u201d dendrimers are more flexible than monodisperse PAMAM enabling \u201cfractured\u201d dendrimer to form compact complex with DNA. Interestingly, fractured dendrimers are able to swell when released from DNA. Recently, Lim et al. [Lim, Y. B., et al., \u201cCationic hyperbranched poly(amino ester): A novel class of DNA condensing molecule with cationic surface, biodegradable three-dimensional structure, and tertiary amine groups in the interior.\u201d 123, 2460\u20132461 (2001); Lim, Y. B., et al., \u201cBiodegradable, endosome disruptive, and cationic network-type polymer as a highly efficient and nontoxic gene delivery carrier,\u201d 13, 952\u2013957 (2002)] reported biodegradable hyperbranched poly(amino esters) with high transfection efficiency and low cytotoxicity in vitro. This polymer is attractive, because unlike PAMAM dendrimer, it degrades within several days at physiological pH and, in addition, can be synthesized more easily than the fractured dendrimer.","The majority of PEI-mediated transfections use a low-branched polymer having MW from 25 kD to 800 kD that show good transfection efficiency in vitro [Boussif, O., et al., \u201cOptimized galenics improve in vitro gene transfer with cationic molecules up to 1000-fold,\u201d 3, 1074\u20131080 (1996); Fischer, D., et al., \u201cA novel non-viral vector for DNA delivery based on low molecular weight, branched polyethylenimine: Effect of molecular weight on transfection efficiency and cytotoxicity,\u201d 16, 1273\u20131279 (1999); Godbey, W. T., et al., \u201cPoly(ethylenimine) and its role in gene delivery\u201d 60, 149\u2013160 (1999)]. Unfortunately, high molecular weight PEI has high cytotoxicity that limits its scope of potential applications in vivo. To decrease the cytotoxicity and to increase water solubility of the DNA polymer complex, polyethylene glycol-graft-PEI has been obtained. Grafted PEI has lower transfection efficiency than the non-grafted PEI but the latter drawback is compensated with a low cytotoxicity at high N\/P ratio. There appears to be only one published report by Fischer, et al., (supra) describing the synthesis of a low molecular weight non-toxic branched PEI that showed at least two orders of magnitude higher transfection efficiency than a commercially available high molecular weight PEI. However, it is known that despite having a very low cytotoxicity, linear PEI (LPEI) is a less efficient transfection reagent than branched 25K PEI. As tertiary and secondary amine groups appear to cause less toxic effects than primary amine, LPEI is less toxic than branched low molecular weight PEI due to prevalence of secondary amino group. Overall, it appears that LPEI could be a good candidate for in-vitro and in-vivo gene delivery [Ferrari, S., et al., \u201cExGen 500 is an efficient vector for gene delivery to lung epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo,\u201d 4, 1100\u20131106 (1997); Goula, D., et al., \u201cSize, diffusibility and transfection performance of linear PEI\/DNA complexes in the mouse central nervous system,\u201d 5,712\u2013717 (1998); Goula, D., et al., \u201cPolyethylenimine-based intravenous delivery of transgenes to mouse lung,\u201d 5, 1291\u20131295 (1998)].","However, none of the previously described non-toxic polycations appear to form sufficiently stable submicron complexes with DNA that could be useful for gene transfer in the presence of serum. The ability to preserve transfection ability in serum is critical for in vivo gene delivery. Therefore, the goals of the present invention include designing a high transfection efficiency polymer system that: 1) would form nanosized, stable complexes with plasmid DNA that would be amenable to a long-term storage; 2) would be efficient at low N\/P ratios in presence of serum; 3) would have low cytotoxicity and\/or 4) would be useful for in vivo gene delivery.","The invention provides new transfection agents for both in vitro and in vivo gene delivery in mammalian cells and intact animals, preferably humans.","The invention includes compositions of hyperbranched dendron polymers, characterization thereof, methods of sythesis, and methods of transfection using the hperbranched dendrons.","In one aspect, the invention involves the synthesis of flexible hyperbranched dendron polymers based on a polyethyleneimine core. Synthesis is performed such that several primary amine groups will be at the surface of the dendron, while secondary and tertiary amine groups will be positioned in the core. This positioning of amine groups enables low cytotoxicity and high condensing of negatively charged polymers.","In another aspect, a hyperbranched dendron polymer having a randomly branched structure, a molecular weight of about 10 to 25 kD, and a ratio of secondary to tertiary amine groups of less than or equal to about 1.5 to 1 is provided.","In yet another aspect, the invention includes a hyperbranched dendron polymer made by a process comprising iterative attachment of ethyleneimine moieties to a branched polyethyleneimine core, wherein the process increases the amount of secondary and tertiary amines in the polymer while maintaining a plurality of primary amines on a surface of the polymer.","In another aspect, a complex between a hyperbranched dendron and a nucleic acid is prepared in solution by simple mixing of the two components. As the polymer materials can condense nucleic acids effectively with the formation of nanoparticles, even in the presence of serum, various types of nucleic acids can be effectively delivered to cells by the hyperbranched polymer of the invention.","The complex can be delivered with a reporter gene, such as that encoding firefly luciferase. The reporter can then be detected by whole body luminescence imaging technique. Observation of the expression of the reporter gene has shown the surprising effect of persistent (8 days) of lymph node expression of the marker gene has been observed in mice intravenously injected with ultrasmall complexes of DNA-hyperbranched dendron (diameter of <100 nm).","The complex can be used in vitro in the presence of serum for optimal cell survival. In addition, a low concentration of the hyperbranched dendron is needed for efficient transfection.","The polymer\/DNA complex can be administered to animals or humans for in vivo gene expression. Unlike other transfection agents, hyperbranched dendrons do not impart cytotoxicity, thus enabling the prolonged expression of desired genes, both in vitro and in vivo.","In another aspect, the invention includes a method for manufacturing a medicament for use in delivery of a nucleic acid in vivo.","The invention will be understood to include the various embodiments, combinations and sub-combinations described herein, and particularly as recited in the claims appended hereto. In particular, it should be understood that the dependent claims describing specific embodiments of the various aspects of the invention can be applied to each aspect of the invention as appropriate. For example, specific embodiments of the complexes of methods of the invention can also apply to like elements of the method for manufacturing a medicament for use in delivery of a nucleic acid in vivo.","A variety of polycations (e.g. PAMAM dendrimer, fractured dendrimer) as well as cationic liposomes have been used in the past as non-viral vectors for gene delivery into eukaryotic cells. All these vectors are similar in that they carry positively charged amines that form strong ionic bonds and condense negatively charged DNA. The mechanism of polycation-mediated cell transfection is still remains to be explained in full detail, but it is apparent that DNA compaction by positively charged molecules plays a vital role for achieving high transfection efficiencies. Unfortunately, most of the polymer vectors reported so far can be used mainly for in vitro cell transfection because of the inhibitive effects of serum and\/or high in vivo toxicity. To reduce toxicity, several groups achieved limited success by using derivatization of polycations with poly (ethylene glycol) resulting in vectors with low cytotoxicity and low transfection efficiency.","Using the present invention, novel hyperbranched dendron (HD) polymers are synthesized using low molecular weight polyethyleneimine (BPEI-L) as a core and used for gene delivery. The obtained polymers have showed low toxicity and are efficient for gene delivery at low nitrogen-to-phosphate (N\/P) ratio. Using successive attachment of ethyleneimine moieties to the PEI core, a process of the invention lowered the relative ratio of linear-to-branched structures in the core PEI from 1.58 to 1.24. This more extensive branching enables to condense plasmid DNA into nanostructures with a size of 70\u2013100 nm. The obtained DNA complexes were stable at least for 3 weeks at 4\u00b0 C. The HD-DNA complex prepared using the higher secondary and tertiary amine containing dendron exerted a very low cytotoxicity in vitro even if co-incubated with cells for 48 hours. Using firefly luciferase as a marker of protein expression, the inventive HD complexes were efficient in transfecting cells in the presence of serum. Under these conditions the transfection activity at the optimized N\/P ratio of 6 is approximately six fold higher than commercially available polycationic transfection reagent. Bioluminescent imaging of in vivo gene expression using luciferase reporter gene performed in live mice shows the expression in the liver and in submandibular lymph nodes. The in vivo gene expression data demonstrates that the HD polymers as in vivo transfection agents could be useful for lymph node gene delivery.","While not limiting the invention to any one underlying theory of operation, the invention was developed based upon a hypothesis that the optimization of the balance between the cationic charge density of polymer and DNA phosphates can lead to effective gene transfer and low cytotoxicity. The invention involves the design and development of novel flexible hyperbranched dendrons by controlling branching of the initial branched PEI core polymers. The polymers with pendant hyperbranched functionalities were designed to have similar molecular formulas to those of the idealized dendritic core. However, there was no architectural similarity between dendrimers and the resultant HD polymers (). Hyperbranched polymers usually consist of a mixture of isomers and are polydisperse; they contain varying amounts of linear units with dendritic and terminal building blocks [Magnusson, H., et al., \u201cThe effect of degree of branching on the rheological and thermal properties of hyperbranched aliphatic polyethers,\u201d 43, 301\u2013306 (2002)]. Structurally hyperbranched molecules occupy the niche in between the linear and dendrimeric polymers, having more branching than linear macromolecules but less branching than dendrimers. Dendrimers are well-defined, fully branched, monodisperse polymers. Even though hyperbranched polymers are polydisperse and not fully branched, they are more similar to dendrimers than to their linear counterparts. Intrinsic viscosity of a dendrimer and a hyperbranched amidoamine shows that despite structural similarity hyperbranched polymers have much lower intrinsic viscosity than dendrimers [Hobson, L. J., et al., \u201cPoly(amidoamine) hyperbranched systems: synthesis, structure and characterization,\u201d 40, 1279\u20131297 (1999)]. Intrinsic viscosity measurements demonstrated that hyperbranched amidoamine polymer have much lower stiffness, which helps to explain the chain flexibility of hyperbranched polymers [Hawker, C. J., In 147, pp 113\u2013160 (1999)].","During HD synthesis, chloroethyl amine reacts with primary amines or secondary amines of PEI core, resulting in a random, tree-like branched structure. As demonstrated previously, the reactivity of a chain end of dendrimer is higher than the chain end reactivity of a hyperbranched polymer. To increase the rate of reaction between the functional end groups and chloroethyl amine, a large excess of chloroethyl amine in alkaline conditions was used. The excess of chloroethyl amine or its cyclic byproduct was easily removed using ultrafiltraion.","Spectral NMR data was used to express the relative ratio of linear to branched structures, calculated from the integrals of secondary and tertiary amines. It is known that that highly branched, commercially available PEI with the high molar mass ranging from 25K to 800K have secondary to tertiary amine ratio of less than 1.2. The ratio measured in the case of hyperbranched dendron of the invention suggests that successive aminoethylation resulted in an increase of branching (Table 1). Thus, the increased branching enables the process to incorporate more secondary and tertiary amines than present in commercially available PEI core. Importantly, we observed a concomitant reduction of cytoxicity of hyperbranched dendrons compared to initial PEI core (). As reported previously, low molecular weight PEI (MW 10 KD) at a concentration of 0.1 mg\/ml for 24 h causes cell death of 70% of cells, whereas high molecular PEI (MW \u02dc25 KD) caused death of almost 100% of cells at the same concentration. In a separate study, a 25K branched PEI at a concentration of 0.1 mg\/ml showed a \u02dc90% cell death after 24 hr where a 52% hydrolyzed linear poly(2-ethyl 2-oxazoline) showed only a 20% cell death because of the high content of tertiary amines present in the backbone of the polymer. In the examples presented, at 0.1 mg\/ml the hyperbranched polymers (HD2 to HD4 in the examples below) resulted in a 10% cell death. The higher cell viability in the presence of HD could be a result of the increase of secondary and tertiary amine content in the polymer which is comparable to hydrolyzed linear poly(2-ethyl 2-oxazoline).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Properties of branched poly (ethylene imine)"},{"entry":"and hypebranched dendrons"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Polymer","MW(kD)","PDI","1\u00b0:2\u00b0:3\u00b0 amine"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"BPEI-L","9.5","2.46","2.68:1.58:1"]},{"entry":[{},"HD2","11.7","2.34","2.13:1.42:1"]},{"entry":[{},"HD3","13.7","2.32","1.96:1.31:1"]},{"entry":[{},"HD4","15","2.25","1.76:1.24:1"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"left","id":"FOO-00001"},"sup":"a"}]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"left","id":"FOO-00002"},"sup":"b"}]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"left","id":"FOO-00003"},"sup":["c","13"]}]}]}}]}}},"In contrast to a classic PAMAM dendrimer, the random open structure of the polymers of the invention helps to maintain flexible architecture. Again, while not limiting the invention to one mode of operation, the inventors hypothesize that this flexible architecture enables efficient interaction of the polymer with DNA. Through the consecutive aminoethylation (from HD2 to HD4), the surface charge as well as the interior core of the polymers are changed. This result in differences in a DNA neutralization complex composition. We found that the increase of ethyleneimine content in HD resulted in similar titration behavior of HDs in ethidium bromide displacement experiments with the exception of the position of the neutralizing point (). Therefore, at a specific concentration, different HDs have different surface charges because of the different branching order. This results in a dramatic change of N\/P ratio corresponding to a half-maximal displacement of ethidium bromide. This observation is a consequence of more ethyleneimine moieties bound to BPEI backbone. For hyperbranched polymers HD3 and HD4, the obtained N\/P ratios suggest the formation of a tight complex between the polymer and DNA. The overall increase in secondary and tertiary amine content in HD helps to maintain almost the same buffering capacity compared to BPEI-L (data not shown) but much higher buffering capacity when compared to linear polyethyleneimine (LPEI), suggesting that hyperbranched polymers could still retain endosomal disruption capability.","Hydrodynamic diameter measurements demonstrated small sizes of HD complexes (100 nm in diameter), supposedly due to the flexibility of hyperbranched dendron molecules. Interestingly, the data shows that in contrast to BPEI-L, particle size of HD complexes with DNA increased at a much slower rate or remained almost constant. Moreover, this effect was observed over a prolonged period of time (). These results were relevant for further transfection experiments. It is possible that transfection efficiency depends on the combination of available charge as well as the size of the complex, which could explain why HD2-DNA complexes have the comparable size to HD4, but show lower transfection efficiency. The transfection data suggested that the HD-DNA complex could tolerate the presence of other negatively charged serum proteins that may compete for HD with DNA. This was not the case if a high molecular mass PEI was used in the presence of the serum. Hyperbranched polymers have a much higher branching order compared to BPEI-L. Concurrently, because of the uncontrolled branching HDs, are flexible which potentially increases transfection efficiency.","It has been reported previously that branched cationic polymers transfect cells because of the high buffering capacity of the amines present on these polymers, which leads to the release of DNA from the endosome. Such lysosomotropic agents have been observed to induce osmotic swelling and lysis in response to the endosomal local pH drop. Hyperbranched dendrons contain three different types of nitrogen, allowing the polymer to collapse, or to swell, depending on the magnitude of local pH change. Endosomal swelling due both to polymer expansion and osmotic induced swelling from protonation of amines causes endosomal rupture and the release of the complex or DNA into the cytoplasm (using lysosomotropic agents). This may explain why the hyperbranched polymer D4 has much higher transfection efficiency than the less branched core BPEI-L at much lower N\/P ratios (). The optimized N\/P ratio in the case of HD was 5\u20136 times lower than in the case of BPEI-L pointing to a much lower amount of the polymer needed for high transfection efficiencies.","Since the complex of HD with plasmid vectors show exceptional stability, we decided to test whether during storage the complex retains the ability to transfect cells (). The results suggest that that \u201caged\u201d complex attains a more compact structure which could help in preserving its activity.","The question of whether stable complexes of plasmids with HD polymers will be efficient in gene transfer in vivo is also addressed. As a recent report suggested, in vivo bioluminescent imaging can be used to detect gene expression after non-viral gene delivery in vivo. In mice, seven consecutive days of luciferase imaging suggested that HD4 could induce a prolonged gene expression which reaches maximum at 72 hours in the liver and lymph nodes (). Both HD4 and HD3 appear to be more efficient than either BPEI-L or \u201cnaked\u201d DNA. Since both complexes bear only weak positive charge, we expected less interaction with blood components and lung endothelium. The latter could be the reason for low expression in the lung. Correlative luciferase activity measurements in tissue extracts () and histology also pointed to the expression of luciferase in the lymph node cells, the majority of positive cells located on the periphery and around germinal centers (). The distribution of positive cells in the tissue argues for the ability of HD-based complexes to transfect organs located at the sites distant to the injection site, presumably, because of the small size and weak positive charge.","The data demonstrates that by attaching additional secondary and tertiary amino groups to a commercially available polyethyleneimine core it is feasible to \u201ctune\u201d the molecular structure of PEI to achieve a substantial increase of transfection ability with the concomitant lower cytotoxicity in vitro. The advantages that may be found in HD vectors over initial branched PEI can include: 1) the high transfection efficiency at low N\/P ratios; 2) the formation of small stable complexes with DNA; 3) the tolerance of serum; 4) overall low toxicity of transfection conditions as the amounts of HD needed to achieve high transfection efficiency are low. Finally, the data in animals show that HD-based complexes have a potential for systemic and targeted transfection in vivo.","The materials and methods used, as well as a description of the results obtained, follows:","Materials and Methods",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":"Materials and analytical methods.

The increase of molecular weight is due to the conjugation of approximately 51-ethyleneimine groups. In the case of Dendron 3 (HD3) (mol mass 13.7K, PDI 2.32), and hyperbranched dendron 4 (HD4) (mol mass 15K, PDI 2.25), the number of ethyleneimine groups increased to 98 and 128 respectively. The resultant materials were purified from the non-reacted CEA using ultrafiltration, which insures the complete separation from the low-molecular weight amine impurities. Physical properties of the material changed from a liquid-like (low molecular weight branched PEI, BPEI-L) to a semisolid polymer (HD4). It should be mentioned that since size exclusion chromatography (SEC) tends to underestimate the true molecular masses of branched polymers, the molecular masses measured in our studies (Table 1) were somewhat lower than the exact molecular mass [Flory, P. J. ; Cornell University Press: Ithaca, N.Y., 1953].\n\n","In isotonic sucrose and glucose solutions the particle size of DNA-BPEI complexes at all N\/P ratios ranged between 50 to 120 nm. A similar behavior was observed for all HD complexes (). For HD4 complexes, particle size showed an increase from 90 nm to 160 nm when N\/P ratio was decreased from 18 to 1. In the case of HD3 complex, the lowest particle size was observed at N\/P ratio of 9.1, otherwise it varied slightly at different N\/P.  shows the stability of the complexes measured for 3 weeks. In 150 mM NaCl solution complexes were not stable and usually coagulated within three hours. In the case of 5% glucose with 20 mM HEPES complexes were stable and usually smaller (approximately 40\u201360 nm) than isotonic sucrose solution (data not shown).\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0071"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},"To obtain the further insight into the cytotoxicity effect and transfection efficiency, we carried out the transfection for 48 h without changing cell culture media.  shows the optimum N\/P ratio based on 48 h transfection. Our data suggested that even after a prolonged co-incubation the transfection efficiency was still 5\u20136 fold higher than in the case of Superfect. All HDs as well as the branched PEI (BPEI-L) had higher transfection efficiencies in the presence of serum than with positive control transfection agent. The 48 h transfection data suggested that for HD4 at N\/P=6.3 the highest transfection has been achieved, whereas for BPEI the best results were achieved at N\/P=23.4 (). In the case of a 48 h transfection, we observed a 10-fold decrease of measured luminescence compared to the 4 h transfection. Polymers HD3 and HD4 gave comparable results with respect to transfection efficiency.","Transfection efficiencies of freshly prepared complexes and complexes stored for 3 weeks were then compared (). A comparison of transfection efficiencies at the optimized N\/P ratios after a conventional 4 h transfection demonstrated that freshly prepared complexes have lower transfection efficiency than those stored for 3 weeks (). At 48 h time point HD4 and HD3 showed the highest transfection efficiency at N\/P=13 whereas the transfection efficiencies reached the highest levels at N\/P \u02dc23 and 19 for HD2 and BPEI-L, respectively (). In all cases prolonged storage of complexes in sucrose solution resulted in \u02dc8 fold higher transfection efficiencies.\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0075"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 2"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Percent of transfected cells by flow cytometry."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Polymer*","COS1**","C17.2","HUVEC"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"HD4","\u2009\u2003~40%","~20\u201325%","~20\u201325%"]},{"entry":[{},"HD3","~30\u201340%","~20\u201325%","~20\u201325%"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"*Cells were transfected for 6 h and incubated for 48 h as described in Materials and Methods."]},{"entry":[{},"**Histograms were analyzed using CellQuest software (ten thousand cells\/analysis were used)."]}]}}]}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0008","list-style":"none"},"li":"In vivo gene expression.

Hyperbranched polymers have densely branched tree-like structures and a large number of reactive groups. The tree-like structures of the hyperbranched polymers of the invention are emphasized by the nomenclature \u201cdendron,\u201d derived from the Greek word for tree. These polymers typically consist of a core, from which branches extend three dimensionally in space, forming a more or less spherical or rod-shaped structure depending upon the type of core used. As distinct from dendrimers (which require absolute control of all synthesis steps), the hyperbranched dendron polymers of the invention are produced by an iterative process that is uncontrolled, meaning that the exact structure of the molecule will be random, while, as explained above, amine groups are located so as to provide the desired reactivity. The hyperbranched dendron molecules of the invention are distinguished in the description above over known hyperbranched dendron molecules in terms of their structure, their properties, and the results obtained when using the inventive molecules in the further experiments described.","In certain compositions of the present invention, a nucleic acid is included. The nucleic acid can be either a deoxyribonucleic acid or a ribonucleic acid. The sequences in question can be of natural or artificial origin, and in particular genomic DNA, cDNA, mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, siRNA, hybrid sequences or synthetic or semi-synthetic sequences. In addition, the nucleic acid can be very variable in size, ranging from oligonucleotide to chromosome. These nucleic acids may be of human, animal, vegetable, bacterial, viral, and the like, origin. They may be obtained by any technique known to a person skilled in the art, and in particular by the screening of libraries, by chemical synthesis or alternatively by mixed methods including the chemical or enzymatic modification of sequences obtained by the screening of libraries. They can, moreover, be incorporated into vectors, such as plasmid vectors.","For the purposes of the invention, therapeutic gene is understood, in particular, to mean any gene coding for a proteinaceous product having a therapeutic effect. The proteinaceous product thus encoded can be a protein, a peptide, and the like. This proteinaceous product can be homologous with respect to the target cell (that is to say a product which is normally expressed in the target cell when the latter is not suffering from any pathology). In this case, the expression of a protein makes it possible, for example, to remedy an insufficient expression in the cell or the expression of a protein which is inactive or feebly active on account of a modification, or alternatively to overexpress the said protein. The therapeutic gene may also code for a mutant of a cell protein, having enhanced stability, modified activity, and the like. The proteinaceous product may also be heterologous with respect to the target cell. In this case, an expressed protein may, for example, supplement or supply an activity which is deficient in the cell, enabling it to combat a pathology, or stimulate an immune response. The therapeutic gene may also code for a protein secreted into the body.","The therapeutic gene can also be an antisense gene or sequence, whose expression in the target cell enables the expression of genes or the transcription of cellular mRNAs to be controlled. Such sequences can, for example, be transcribed in the target cell into RNAs complementary to cellular mRNAs and can thus block their translation into protein. Antisense sequences also comprise sequences coding for ribozymes, which are capable of selectively destroying target RNAs.","The compositions and processes of the invention are also well suited to delivery of siRNA into cells in vitro and in vivo for therapeutic, diagnostic and\/or investigatory purposes. RNA interference (RNAi) is a phenomenon in which a small double-stranded RNA (referred as small interference RNA or siRNA) can knock down the expression of its corresponding gene. RNAi has been observed in plant, and for a number of years and it been recently discovered that RNAi also works in mammalian systems. Small interference RNA (siRNA) is 19\u201322 nt double-stranded RNA that generally works by cleaving and destroying its cognate RNA. siRNA first assembles into RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs), and it then activates the complex by unwinding its RNA strands. The unwound RNA strands subsequently guide the complex to the complementary RNA molecules, where the complex cleaves and destroys the cognate RNA, which results in RNAi phenomenon. Applications of RNAi using the complexes and processes of the present invention include: a stable cell line with a specific gene knocked-out so that its phenotype can be studied; a knock-out mouse line can be established using transgenic siRNA method; siRNA can be put into a vector with an inducible promoter to study its effect; and siRNA can be delivered in vivo and used for gene therapy purposes.","Nucleic acid molecules used with the invention may also include, for example, sequences permitting the expression of the therapeutic gene and\/or of the gene coding for the antigenic peptide in the desired cell or organ. These sequences can be the ones which are naturally responsible for expression of the gene in question when these sequences are capable of functioning in the infected cell. They can also be sequences of different origin (responsible for the expression of other proteins, or even synthetic sequences). For example, they can be promoter sequences originating from the genome of the cell which it is desired to infect. Similarly, they can be promoter sequences originating from the genome of a virus. In addition, these expression sequences may be modified by the addition of activation or regulatory sequences or sequences permitting a tissue-specific expression.","Moreover, the nucleic acid can also contain, especially upstream of the therapeutic gene, a signal sequence directing the therapeutic product synthesized into the pathways of secretion of the target cell. This signal sequence can be the natural signal sequence of the therapeutic product, but it can also be any other functional signal sequence, or an artificial signal sequence.","Advantageously, complexes of the invention described herein having a hyperbranched dendron polymer and a nucleic acid molecule can have a small size. In particular, polymers of the invention have been shown to condense with nucleic acid plasmids and molecules into nanostructures with a size of less than or equal to 100 nm, and in certain circumstances, as low as 50 nm, or in the range of 50 to 70 nm. This small size, among other advantages, can allow greater penetration of the complex in vivo to provide desired gene expression or other activity in desired locations within a mammal, such as, for example, in the lymph nodes\u2014a result that heretofore has not been achieved using non-viral vectors.","Other advantages of certain complexes of the invention include their ability to provide lasting therapeutic effects in vivo, with gene expression shown over extended periods of time, and the ability of the complex to be lyophilized and stored dry. The dried complex can later be used with excellent results. In addition, the complexes of the invention have been shown to have uniquely lasting stability and, in particular, remain stable in the presence of serum.","The examples presented herein were generated using an in vivo mouse model system in which gene expression is reasonably correlated to gene expression in humans, and in mammals more generally.","Each of the references and documents (including any manufacturer's specifications, instructions, etc.) cited to or referenced herein, as well as any in the provisional application from which this application claims priority, is hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. Such incorporated documents and their teachings can be used with the invention described herein and are expressly not admitted to be prior art.","The invention being thus disclosed and illustrative embodiments depicted herein, further variations and modifications of the invention will occur to those skilled in the art. In particular, it should be clear that all of the properties and characteristics of the hyperbranched polymers described above can be combined in any way, and that such properties and characteristics and similarly be applied to compositions or complexes that include the hyperbranched polymer, as well as to methods for synthesizing or using such polymers, compositions or complexes.
