title: Clock radio with computer-based remote control facilitator
abstract: A clock radio includes a clock a user interface that is dynamically configurable from a remote computer. Once configured, the user interface allows a user to select radio programs that are accessible by the remote computer. When a user selects a radio program via the interface, a signal indicating the selected radio program is transmitted from the clock radio to the remote computer. The remote computer then accesses the selected radio program and transmits the selected radio program to speaker(s) for broadcast.

No. 10\/629,179, by inventor David M. Maymudes, filed Jul. 28, 2003, which in turn is a divisional of U.S. Pat. No. 6,748,278, entitled \u201cRemote Controlled System With Computer-Based Remote Control Facilitator,\u201d by inventor David M. Maymudes, issued Jun. 8, 2004, each of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.","Remote controlled systems have been around for many years. People are familiar with remote controlled televisions, stereos, VCRs (video cassette recorders), and other such commercial products.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0004","num":"0003"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","102","108","104"]},"Universal remote controllers make it possible to control more than one device. Universal remote controllers have generic user interfaces, such as a numeric keypad, control buttons, and a multi-positional actuator pad, which can be used to control several devices like a television, VCR, and set top box. Unfortunately, universal remote controls are complicated, often difficult to program, and hence, are not always very flexible.","Accordingly, there remains a need for improved remote controlled systems that enable inexpensive controllers to control multiple different devices without the hassles of pre-programming such controllers.","A remote controlled system employs a computer-based remote control facilitator to facilitate remote control of a controlled device from a non-dedicated remote controller. The computer facilitator is coupled to the remote controller and controlled device via a wireless or wire-based network. Neither the remote controller nor the controlled device need have any awareness of the other, or any knowledge as to how to communicate with one another. In fact, both devices can be completely unrelated to one another, particularly in terms of what a user would perceive as their primary or intended use. For instance, the remote controller may be a cell phone and the controlled device might be a television or stereo. More generally, the remote controlled system allows any device with some form of user interface to control, via the computer-based facilitator, any other device.","In the described implementation, the computer facilitator is a general-purpose computer that runs an open platform operating system. The computer facilitator executes a software application that corresponds to the controlled device. The application contains program code, data, information, and any other intelligence that may be used by the computer facilitator to assist the remote controller in controlling the controlled device.","During operation, the computer facilitator senses that a remote controller is nearby. As one example, the facilitator, remote controller, and controlled device are compatible with the universal plug and play (UPnP) architecture. With UPnP, the facilitator can learn the existence of potential devices as well as the information (an IP address) needed establish TCP\/IP connections to them. The remote controller provides a description of its capabilities and components and this description is stored as schema at the facilitator.","From the schema, the computer facilitator chooses an appropriate user interface based on the physical properties of the remote control device and on the device to be controlled. The UI provides options to the user, and allows the user to select a desired option. This selection is returned to the computer facilitator. The remote controller has no inherent or pre-configured knowledge of the controlled device, or any way to control it. The remote controller simply presents the options received from the computer facilitator and returns the user's choice.","The application running at the computer facilitator translates the user's selection into a command that is sent to the controlled device. The command directs the controlled device to perform an action related to the option selected by the user.","The remote controlled system is very beneficial in that an inexpensive remote controller can be used to control many unrelated devices in homes and offices. The remote controller need not be tied to a specific brand or model of controlled device nor understand what it is doing; rather, the remote controller gains its power and flexibility from the general-purpose computer.","In fact, the remote controller may be a device that one would not expect to be used for controlling other devices. For instance, the remote controller may be implemented as a cell phone with an LCD display and numeric keypad. This cell phone may be controlled by the computer facilitator to present menus used to control a living room stereo system. The cell phone does not have to know anything about music playback, but simply shows on its screen the menus provided by the computer. The cell phone reports the button presses back to the computer without any knowledge of what those presses mean.","Another specific implementation of the remote controlled system is a clock radio. In this implementation, the clock radio consists of a clock\/UI, one or more speakers, and a general-purpose computer that facilitates remote control of the speakers from the clock\/UI.","This invention concerns a remote controlled system having a computer-based remote control facilitator that facilitates remote control of a controlled device from a non-dedicated remote controller. For discussion purposes, the computer-based remote control facilitator is described in the context of a personal computer, although other computer form factors or computing devices may be used. In addition, the remote controller and controlled device are configured using technology conforming to the Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) architecture, which is an architecture for pervasive peer-to-peer network connectivity of PCs of all form factors, intelligent appliances, and wireless devices. UPnP is a distributed, open networking architecture that leverages TCP\/IP and the Web to enable seamless proximity networking in addition to control and data transfer among networked devices in the home, office, and everywhere in between. However, it is noted that other networking architectures may be employed.","Basic System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","202","204","206","202","204","206","208","208","202","206"]},"The computer-based remote control facilitator  is configured to assist the remote controller  in controlling the controlled device . The remote controller  may be embodied in a way that resembles a common remote controller, such as familiar controllers for televisions, VCRs, stereos, or set top boxes. Alternatively, the remote controller  may be implemented as some other useful device that may be utilized temporarily to control another device.","Neither the remote controller  nor the controlled device  need have any awareness of the other, or any knowledge as to how to communicate with one another. In fact, both devices can be completely unrelated to one another, particularly in terms of what a user would perceive as their primary or intended uses. For instance, the remote controller  may be a cell phone and the controlled device  might be a television or stereo. A user would not expect to use a cell phone to control a television, but this type of situation can be accomplished by the remote controlled system . In essence, any device with some form of user interface can be used to control, via the computer-based facilitator, any other device. This architecture is explored below in more detail with reference to .","It is further noted that the remote controller  and the controlled device may be implemented as an integrated unit, as indicated by the dashed box , although the facilitator  supports communication between the controller  and controlled device . For instance, the remote controller  may be a UI and the controlled device  may be speakers within the same physical box.","The remote control facilitator  essentially controls both the remote controller  and the controlled device . The facilitator  provides information to the remote controller  that is presented to a user to enable the user to enter control data for controlling the controlled device . The facilitator  receives the control data from the remote controller  and translates that data into commands that are sent to the controlled device  to effectuate the action intended by the user.","The computer-based remote control facilitator  is illustrated as a general-purpose computer having a processor , volatile memory  (e.g., RAM), and non-volatile memory  (e.g., ROM, Flash, hard disk, floppy disk, CD-ROM, etc.). The facilitator  may also have one or more input devices  (e.g., keyboard, mouse, microphone, stylus, etc.) and a display  (e.g., monitor, LCD, etc.). The facilitator  is representative of many diverse types of computing devices, including desktop computers, laptops, set-top boxes, information appliances, and so forth.","The remote control facilitator  runs an operating system  and one or more application programs . The operating system  is preferably an open platform, multitasking operating system, such as a Windows-brand operating system from Microsoft Corporation. The application program  is an application associated that supports remote control of the controlled device  from the non-dedicated remote controller . The controlled device (CD) application  is loaded onto the computer facilitator  during initial installation and configuration of the controlled device. For example, when the user purchases a new controlled device (e.g., stereo or television), the manufacturer of the controlled device provides the software application  that may be loaded onto the computer facilitator .","For purposes of illustration, operating system  and application  are illustrated as discrete blocks stored in the non-volatile memory , although it is recognized that such programs and components reside at various times in different storage components of the facilitator  and are executed by the processor . Generally, these software components are stored in non-volatile memory  and from there, are loaded at least partially into the volatile main memory  for execution on the processor .","The controlled device application  contains program code, data, information, and any other intelligence that may be used by the facilitator  to assist the remote controller  in controlling the controlled device . The CD application  includes scenario-specific UI codes  that is passed to the remote controller . The UI codes  are specific to the scenario of controlling the controlled device . That is, the UI codes  are tailored to, or associated with, commands understood by the controlled device  to effectuate some action at the controlled device.","The CD application  also exposes a set of UPnP APIs (application program interfaces) . The APIs  are conventional to the UPnP architecture, and are known to the skilled artisan. For a more detailed discussion of the UPnP APIs, the reader is directed to \u201cupnp.org\u201d, a Web site for the forum governing universal plug and play. One suitable specification available at this site as well as from the Microsoft Web site, \u201cMicrosoft.com\u201d, is entitled \u201cUniversal Plug and Play Device Architecture Reference Specification,\u201d Version 0.90-Nov. 10, 1999, which is hereby incorporated by reference.","Of particular interest, the UPnP architecture defines the terms \u201cUser Control Point\u201d (UCP) and \u201cControlled Device\u201d (CD). Normally, anything the user interacts with directly is assumed to be a UCP. Such UCP devices are responsible for discovering controlled devices and rendering UI in HTML (or some other fashion) to allow the user to control the devices. For instance, when the user pushes a button, the device with the button tells the Controlled Device what it should do.","In the remote controlled system , the remote controller  is not a UCP device, meaning that it does not initiate any action itself, but is instead merely a \u201ccontrolled device\u201d. The computer-based remote control facilitator  acts indirectly as the UCP that controls both the remote controller  and the controlled device . Accordingly, the UPnP APIs  are implemented at the facilitator  to provide an interface through which the remote controller  and controlled device  may communicate.","The CD application  further maintains schema  related to the remote controller, as well as any other schema . The facilitator  uses the UPnP protocol to discover the schema of the remote controller . The remote controller schema  contains a description of the user interface at the remote controller .","Notice in  that the remote controller  provides a user interface (UI)  that allows a user to enter control data for controlling the controlled device . The UI  may be implemented to include any number of different components, including one or more buttons, multi-positional actuator pads, display screen, touch pad, touch screen, speaker, microphone, and the like. The remote control schema  describes the types of components and commands that the remote controller  can support.","In the illustrated implementation, the UI  has a display  that is capable of displaying one or more lines of alphanumeric characters and\/or a bitmap display that is capable of displaying characters and rudimentary symbols\/graphics. The UI  also has one or more input buttons  that allow the user to select options presented on the display . The schema  describes the type of display , the kind of data it can display (e.g., text strings, graphics, etc.), and the number and type of actuatable buttons .","Operation",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["202","204"]},"At step , the computer facilitator  senses that the remote controller  and the controlled device  are nearby. For instance, the facilitator  may employ the discovery techniques defined by the universal plug and play architecture. More specifically, in one implementation, the system  employs Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP), a simple network device discovery protocol used by UPnP to allow facilitator  to learn of the existence of potential peer devices, such as remote controller  and controlled device , as well as the information (an IP address) needed to establish TCP\/IP connections to them. In response to an SSDP search, UPnP devices, such as the remote controller  and the controlled device , return a description Uniform Resource Locator (URL) in the SSDP Location and optionally the Alternate Location (AL) SSDP headers. A successful result of an SSDP search is a URL, which can be resolved to an IP address for making a connection to the discovered device. SSDP is described in more detail in the above-referenced specification \u201cUniversal Plug and Play Device Architecture Reference Specification,\u201d Version 0.90.","As part of the discovery, the remote controller  provides a description of its capabilities and components. The description is stored as the remote controller schema  at the facilitator . Any other schema learned from the controlled device , is also stored at the facilitator  as other schema .","At step , the computer facilitator  provides UI codes  to the remote controller  over a link  of the network . The codes are transmitted using UPnP over the link , which may be wireless or wire-based. The UI codes  are related to the configuration and makeup of the remote controller as described in the remote control schema . In this manner, the codes  become associated with the components (e.g., buttons, display screen, i etc.) on the remote controller , even though such components would not normally be used to provide such control.","The UI codes  include text strings that may be displayed on a display of the UI . As an example, once the computer facilitator discovered the cell phone , the facilitator  may instruct the phone to display a top-level menu of services that could be controlled by the phone, perhaps something like the following four text strings:\n\n","The codes supporting the menu UI are associated the first four buttons on the phones numeric keypad. When the user presses the \u201c1\u201d button on the phone, the phone  fires a UPnP event indicating that the \u201c1\u201d button has been pressed, and this event is transferred back to the computer via link .","At step , the computer facilitator  receives the event from the remote controller  and acts on it. Depending upon the event, the facilitator  may return another set of UI codes that are more specific to one or more controlled devices . This is represented by the dashed return path from step  to step . In this example, the user selected \u201cMusic\u201d by pressing the \u201c1\u201d button. The computer facilitator  sends new strings for the phone to display that pertain to the selected \u201cMusic\u201d option, such as:\n\n","Eventually, at step , the facilitator  receives an event that is intended to control the controlled device . The application  translates the event returned from the remote controller  into a command that is sent via link  of network  to the controlled device  to effectuate the action intended by the user. For instance, suppose the user hits the \u201c3\u201d button on the Music menu. In one scenario, assuming that KUOW 94.9 is a local station, the computer facilitator  receives this event and converts it to a command instructing a stereo (i.e., controlled device ) to tune to the FM radio station KUOW 94.9.","In another scenario, assuming that KUOW 94.9 is not a local radio station, the computer facilitator translates the event to a command to connect to an audio feed on the Internet and to route the audio output to a set of UPnP speakers. Here, the speakers are the controlled device , rather than the stereo.","The remote controlled system  is very flexible in that it essentially allows any controlled device with some form of UI to control essentially any other controlled device, assuming there is an application resident on the computer facilitator to support such control. Remember, in the above example, the phone has no inherent or pre-configured knowledge of the stereo or Internet link, or any way to control it. The phone is simply displaying a list of text strings provided by the computer facilitator and returning button presses entered by the user.","The flexibility makes it easier for a user to modify their system architecture. If the user acquires a new controlled device, he\/she can upgrade or re-configure the software running on his\/her PC, rather than having to upgrade the firmware on the cellular phone in order to control it. Modifying the software is substantially easier due to the much richer programming environment.","System With Multiple Controlled Devices",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","402","404","1","404","406","1","406","402","404","406","408","402","404","406","404","406"]},"One type of controlled devices referenced by numbers ()\u2013(N) represents devices that may be utilized as the remote controller  in . These controlled devices have a user interface (UI) ()\u2013(N) that may present a set of options to the user and receive the user selections. The UI-based controlled devices ()\u2013(N) need not have any knowledge of the options, or how the selections made by the user effectuate actions at the computer facilitator  or any one of the controlled devices . Indeed, the UI-based controlled devices ()\u2013(N) may be representative of cellular phones, portable handheld computers, personal digital assistants, or any device that has a display and input keys that may be used by the computer facilitator to present a user with options to control another device.","The second type of controlled devices referenced by numbers ()\u2013(M) represents devices that are not utilized as the remote controller  of . The controlled devices ()\u2013(M) may be any device that is communicatively coupled to the computer facilitator  (e.g., e.g., UPnP-compatible devices) and can be controlled to perform some function. Examples of controlled devices ()\u2013(M) include televisions, stereos, VCRs, speakers, microwave ovens, lights, alarms, and so forth.","It is noted that the UI-based controlled devices ()\u2013(N) may themselves be controlled devices. That is,  illustrates two types of controlled devices, but the illustration is not intended to suggest that only UI-based controlled devices control non-UI-based controlled devices. Rather, one UI-based controlled device can conceptually control another UI-based controlled device.","The computer facilitator  is implemented as facilitator  described in . It includes a controlled device application ()\u2013(M) for each of the controlled devices ()\u2013(M) that are being controlled. When a controlled device is detected as being nearby, the computer facilitator  discovers the device's capabilities and whether it has a UI. If a UI is present, the computer facilitator  stores the schema of the UI-based controlled device in association with one or more of the applications .","To facilitate control of a controlled device from a UI-based controlled device, the computer facilitator  chooses an appropriate set of UI codes to send to the UI-based controlled device based on the physical properties of the remote control device and on the set of devices to be controlled. For instance, the UI-based controlled device may have a four-line LCD display and numeric keypad. The UI codes contain menus for the LCD display, and associate options in those menus with the keys of the numeric keypad. Upon receiving user input from the UI-based controlled device, the computer facilitator  converts the button selection to a command that initiates performance of an action at the facilitator or the controlled device.","Clock Radio",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["200","500","500","502","504","506","508","510","512","502","514","504","506","510","516"]},"The clock  maintains time-of-day to provide the basic clock function of the clock radio . Although less preferred, the clock may alternatively reside at the computer facilitator  and the time is periodically sent to the UI .","The computer facilitator  is a general-purpose computer that is equipped with a tuner  for tuning to an audio feed. The tuner  may be implemented in many ways. For instance, it may be an RF tuner to receive RF signals carrying the audio data. Alternatively, the tuner  may be implemented as a cable tuner for selecting an appropriate cable channel that carries audio data. Another alternative is for the tuner  to be implemented as a browser that downloads audio data from a music Web site.","The computer facilitator  also has a clock radio application  that supports communication between the clock\/UI and the speakers. The clock radio application  contains the UI codes for enabling a user to select a desired radio program, the UPnP APIs to support communication with the clock\/UI and speakers, and the schema describing the UI . In the illustrated implementation, the schema describes the UI  as having an LCD display  to display text strings and four buttons  to receive user input.","The computer facilitator  provides the UI codes to the UI  to enable a user to select a radio station. The options are displayed on the LCD display  and associated with the buttons . When the user presses a button  to make a selection, a UPnP event is triggered and transmitted back to the computer facilitator . The button press is converted to a command that directs the tuner  to tune to the desired station and to output the audio feed to the speakers .","Conclusion","Although the description above uses language that is specific to structural features and\/or methodological acts, it is to be understood that the invention defined in the appended claims is not limited to the specific features or acts described.
