title: Sea vessel retrieval of unmanned underwater vehicles
abstract: One or more docking cages releasably attached to a tow line extending from the stern of a retrieval ship, emit tracking beacon beams picked up by sensors in unmanned underwater sea craft vehicles being approached, for steered propulsion thereof into rammed hook attachment to the cages. A sea craft vehicle thereby releasably attached to a cage, is towed onboard the retrieval ship by storage reel-in of the tow line, which is then disconnected from the cage and the retrieved vehicle for subsequent use in retrieval of other unmanned sea craft vehicles.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/550,738 filed Mar. 3, 2004, entitled \u201cSEA VESSEL RETRIEVAL OF UNMANNED UNDERWATER VEHICLES\u201d, incorporated herein by reference.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","The present invention relates generally to underwater deployment and retrieval of unmanned sea craft vehicles from underwater locations.","Presently there are no facilities available for efficient retrieval of small unmanned sea craft vehicles directly from underwater deployment without use of drogues under control of personnel on the retrieval ship. It is therefore an important object of the present invention to provide for a more rapid retrieval of large numbers of such small unmanned sea craft vehicles by placement thereof onboard the retrieval ship without extensive visual maneuvering of the submerged sea-craft vehicles during the retrieval operations.","In accordance with the present invention, an elongated flexible tow line is extended from storage in a retrieval ship, with one or more docking devices attached thereto, such as wire cages or spiked spheres. As the retrieval ship is approaching an unmanned vehicle, such as seacraft deployed underwater, a tracking signal beacon is emitted from one of the docking cages attached to the tow line for signal pick-up by a sensor in the underwater vehicle in response to which propulsion and steering of the vehicle toward the towed docking cage is effected. The vehicle is thereby rammed into the tow line at the docking location for attachment thereto. Beacon emission is then shut down in response to signal transmission through the attached tow-line followed by reel in of the tow line into the retrieval ship while bringing the attached vehicle onboard. As each of the vehicles is retrieved onboard, it is disconnected from the tow line which is then reeled into storage and made available for subsequent reuse during repeated retrieval operations.","Referring now to the drawing in detail,  illustrates a seawater retrieval ship  afloat in a body of seawater  adjacent to a relatively smaller self-propelled unmanned sea craft vehicle  to be retrieved by personnel on board the retrieval ship  from an underwater deployment location within the seawater . Pursuant to the present invention, retrieval is effected by use of one or more retrieval docking cages  towed underwater by means of a single elongated flexible tow line  extending from a stern end  of the retrieval ship .","As shown in , each of the cages  is a generally spherical shape, made of metallic wires to which the tow line  is attached at equally spaced locations behind the stern  of the ship . Centrally positioned within each of the cages  is a single optical beacon emitter  from which a tracking signal beacon beam  may be dispatched toward the unmanned seawater vehicle  to be retrieved. Each of the unmanned underwater vehicles  to be retrieved has a docking hook  projected in a fixed direction from its forward end  opposite a rear end  on which propelling blades  are mounted. An optical beam receiver  projects from the forward end  of the vehicle  for reception of the beacon signal beam  when the cage  and the vehicle  are approaching each other as shown in , so as to insure propulsion and steering of the vehicle  toward the cage . When the vehicle  rams into the cage  during approach to the retrieval ship , a hook  projecting from the vehicle  engages the cage  as shown in . The vehicle  is then brought onboard the ship  as shown in  by reel-in of the tow line  connected to the hook  as hereinafter explained.","As diagrammed in , the hook  projects through the front end  of the vehicle  from a hook attachment signal generator  operationally connected through a hook control switch  to a propulsion and steering control system  through which the vehicle  is propelled and steered toward the retrieval docking cage  in response to the signal beam  received therefrom through an optical sensor  connected to the optical beam receiver  on the vehicle . Thus upon engagement of the hook  with the cage , a signal is generated by the generator  and applied through the hook control switch  to the control system  to the system  so as to terminate propulsion of the vehicle  and accommodate subsequent crane pick-up of the vehicle  for placement onboard the ship  as shown in .","As diagrammed in , hook engagement signals transmitted through the tow line  are received within the ship  and are applied through a signal line  to an on-board controller . Also diagrammed in  is a source of electrical power  from which electrical energy is transmitted through a power line  and the tow line  to the beacon emitter  in the docking cage  for operation thereof. The tow line  when reeled in enters into a storage  within the ship . The signal line  connected to the controller , the beacon operation power line  extending from the power source  and a propulsion fuel line  extending from a source of fuel on the ship  are enclosed within a multi-purpose cable  extending inwardly from the ship stern end  as shown in . Accordingly, when the cage  and the vehicle  are brought onboard the ship  they are disconnected from the tow line . An information signal in the signal line  will then be delivered to the on-board controller  to shut off the beacon power source  connected to the power line , and initiate retrieval reel-in of the tow line  into the storage  during interruption of ship propulsion by cut-off of fuel flow through the fuel line .","The foregoing described operations involving hook engagement of the cage  with the unmanned seawater vehicles , transfer thereof onboard the ship , disconnection of the tow line  therefrom and storage reel-in of the disconnected tow line , is repeated after the tow line  is withdrawn from the storage  for attachment to other cages  through which hook engagement with other unmanned sea craft vehicles  occurs. A large number of such vehicles  may thereby be quickly and efficiently gathered in a low radar and visual signature environment and towed to a safe area for reeled in retrieval.","As alternatives to the hereinbefore described embodiment utilizing the optical beacons , an acoustic beacon may instead be utilized pursuant to the present invention. Also, the wire cages  utilized for tow line hook attachment may be replaced by use of spiked spheres with hooks thereon to engage vehicle mounted loops.","Obviously, other modifications and variations of the present invention may be possible in light of the foregoing teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING","p":["A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of its attendant advantages will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawing wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 1 and 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"],"b":["5","5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 1"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
