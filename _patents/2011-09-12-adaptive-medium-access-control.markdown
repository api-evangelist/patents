title: Adaptive medium access control
abstract: Bandwidth allocation configuration and fully decentralized adaptive medium access control (AMAC) systems and methods with support for time critical applications, spectrum efficiency, scalability enhancements, and fair allocation of bandwidth among nodes sharing a common channel. The methods fully integrate TDMA and CSMA/CA channel access approaches and incorporate adaptive congestion and collisions avoidance scheme to reduce bandwidth wastage and diminish adverse cross layers interactions. AMAC improves support for multi-media traffic while allowing higher transmission incidents from large number of transmitting devices sharing a common channel, with fair distribution of the available bandwidth, to enable improved multi-level-security connectivity over a common multi-hop wireless network, provide end-to-end performance enhancement for constant bit rate traffic, variable bit rate traffic, and distribute bandwidth fairly amongst competing TCP traffic flows that traverse varying length paths in multi-hop ad-hoc wireless networks.

The U.S. Government has certain rights in the invention.","1. Technical Field","Methods and systems are disclosed herein with respect to adaptive medium access control (AMAC) and, more particularly, AMAC in wireless ad hoc networks, including wireless mobile ad-hoc networks.","2. Related Art","A wireless ad hoc network is a decentralized type of wireless network that does not rely on a preexisting infrastructure, such as routers in wired networks or access points in managed-infrastructure wireless networks. Instead, each node participates in routing by forwarding data for other nodes. A determination as to which nodes forward data is made dynamically based on network connectivity. The decentralized nature of wireless ad hoc networks makes them suitable for a variety of applications where central nodes cannot be relied on.","Wireless ad hoc networks may be classified by their application, such as mobile ad hoc networks (MANET), wireless mesh networks (WMN), and wireless sensor networks (WSN)","Wireless links between nodes may be influenced by node resources, such as transmit power, computing power, and memory. Wireless links may also be influenced by factors such as reliability, link distance, signal loss, interference, and noise.","Since links can be connected or disconnected at any time, an ad-hoc network must be able to provide dynamic restructuring that is timely, efficient, reliable, robust and scalable. In a MANET, where nodes are mobile, dynamic restructuring can be even more challenging.","Due to the extensive variety of possible situations that may occur in wireless ad hoc networks, modeling and simulation may be employed with extensive parameter sweeping and what-if analyses, which may be performed with modeling and simulation tools, such as an open source Network Simulator II (NS2).","In an ad-hoc network, contention amongst nodes for access to a shared wireless medium often results collisions and channel congestion.","Conventional computing\/communication networks manage network resources and network access from a dedicated or central control node, and with protocols and infrastructure that are not readily amenable to wireless ad-hoc networks, and particularly not amendable to wireless mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs).","Conventional wireless local area networks (WLANs) use carrier sense multiple access\/collision avoidance (CSMA\/CA) technology, such as specified in IEEE standard 802.11. The collision avoidance mechanism employed by CSMA\/CA utilizes a random back-off period prior to each transmission. The random nature of the back-off period reduces but does not eliminate the probability of collisions. In order to detect and recover from collisions, an acknowledgment mechanism must be used with each transmitted message. When an acknowledgment is not received, a message may be re-transmitted. With each re-transmit attempt, the back-off period is randomly selected from an expanded contention time window using a binary exponential back-off scheme.","Many published studies have shown that these random back-off and collision recovery schemes significantly compromise the performance of CSMA\/CAWLANs in terms of access delay, delay jitter, and network throughput, particularly as the number of stations and offered load increases.","There is a need to for more flexible and adaptive techniques to avoid collisions and congestion.","Disclosed herein are adaptive medium access control (AMAC) methods and systems, which may be implemented in a decentralized fashion, in a wireless ad-hoc network, including a wireless mobile ad-hoc network (MANET).","AMAC may include synchronizing periodic epochs of time and a state of a schedule with other nodes of the network. The schedule may include alternating contention periods and contention free periods within the epochs. The contention free periods may allocated amongst the nodes.","AMAC may permit a node to initiate a transmission during a contention free period allocated to the node, and extend and complete the transmission during an immediately-subsequent contention period.","The contention free periods may include a relatively short contention free period equal to a sum of a deferral period and a time to exchange request-to-send and clear-to-send control frames, in which case, and an allocated node may be permitted to retain use of the channel into a subsequent contention period to transmit a data packet and receive an acknowledgment. A node may reserve one of the short-duration contention free periods in each of multiple successive epochs to support a variable bit rate application of the node. A node may reserve multiple ones of the short-duration contention free periods in each of multiple successive epochs to support a constant bit rate application of the node. A short contention free period may be useful to guarantee access to a node, with limited risk of unused bandwidth in the event that the allocated node does not have data ready to transmit at the time of an allotted contention free period.","AMAC may include adaptive collision protection for broadcast packets based on channel congestion. The node may maintain a running measure of congestion during each epoch, which may include measuring busy times of contention periods, aggregating the measured busy times over durations of corresponding epochs, and computing an aggregate channel congestion factor over the duration of the corresponding epochs as a function of an elapsed time of the epoch and a corresponding aggregate of the measured busy times of contention periods within the epoch. The node may preclude broadcasting of a packet from the node during a contention period when the channel congestion factor is above a configurable congestion factor threshold, which may be configurable.","AMAC may include adaptive collision protection for unicast packets, where a node maintains a count of a number of times a unicast packet is re-transmitted from the node, and precludes re-transmission of the unicast packet from the node during contention periods when the count reaches a first count threshold. The node may further preclude re-transmission of the unicast packet from the node during contention free periods allocated to the node when the count reaches a second count threshold.","These and other features are described herein.","In the drawings, the leftmost digit(s) of a reference number identifies the drawing in which the reference number first appears.","1. Introduction","Wireless communication is a critical enabling technology for many applications in commercial, scientific, government, and military environments. Design choices made at the lower layers of the OSI communication stack may have major implications on the overall performance of applications when communicating over shared wireless channels, particularly in multi-hop wireless networks. More specifically, Medium Access Control (MAC) designs should avoid adverse cross layer-interactions.","A good general purpose wireless MAC design suitable for broad range of applications must consider several issues and achieve a good balance among several conflicting requirements. Such wireless MAC design should offer robust adaptive techniques to allow efficient utilization of channel capacity while maintaining fair distribution of bandwidth among competing nodes during heavy and low traffic load conditions; this MAC must support adaptive congestion avoidance and recovery methods without causing adverse cross-layer interactions with upper-layer protocols. The wireless MAC design must scale to allow large number of nodes and high incidents of packets transmissions from competing traffic flows to co-exist and fairly share the available channel capacity; and this MAC design should provide efficient support for time-critical traffic and deterministic bandwidth guarantees for bandwidth-sensitive constant bit rate traffic as well as asynchronous variable rate traffic.","The most common wireless MAC designs in deployment are the Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), and Carrier Sense Multiple Access\/Collision Avoidance (CSMA\/CA). Unfortunately, these MAC techniques do not provide sufficiently fine grained adaptability to adjust to varying traffic loads. These MAC techniques also provide limited scalability and suffer from a variety of adverse cross-layer interactions, which may limit their suitability for applications in multi-hop wireless network environments.","MAC designs that employ a pure TDM access method partition the bandwidth of a shared channel into fixed intervals, where each interval can be dedicated for use by one node to transmit data to any node within its transmission range. TDM utilizes a common periodic time reference that occurs at fixed intervals of a TDM superframe. Each periodic superframe is partitioned into finite periods of equal size, or timeslots. Each timeslot occurs once every superframe. Any node using a TDM system can be assigned dedicated timeslots to transmit data to any destination within its radio transmission range. TDM MAC design offers excellent support for applications with strict requirements for minimum bandwidth and\/or maximum access delay from the communication system. Specifically, where a node is assigned a recurring time slot, the node will not have to wait more than the duration of one superframe to send data.","Similarly, MAC systems that use FDMA techniques allocate a specific RF channel, a dedicated portion of the spectrum, for use by a single node; or assign a dedicated portion of the spectrum, RF channel, for a pair of nodes to exchange traffic in Time Division Duplex (TDD) mode. FDM systems provide the lowest access delay guarantees and allow deterministic bandwidth allocations. However, since RF spectrum is a finite and very scarce resource, FDM MAC systems are not viable solution for large scale networks; because in order to be able to fully interconnect \u201cn\u201d nodes in full mesh single hop ad-hoc fashion, the FDM system needs O(n!) dedicated channels. Moreover, in multi-hop Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANET), FDM systems require very complex coordination scheme between all nodes to allow any pair of transmit and receive nodes to synchronously switch their transmitter and receiver circuits to the appropriate dedicated channel; this is a very complex process that will introduce significant bandwidth overhead.","In contrast, standard CSMA\/CA MAC systems use a simple stochastic access control mechanism and rely on collision avoidance and recovery methods to allow large number of nodes to share a common channel. CSMA\/CA MAC systems will scale to allow large number of nodes to internetwork using a single channel, if the aggregate traffic load on the channel is significantly lower than the total capacity, or bandwidth of the shared channel. However, standard CSMA\/CA systems will experience heavy incidents of collisions and poor bandwidth distribution as the traffic load increases as nodes simultaneously compete for the shared channel. Moreover, CSMA\/CA systems suffer from hidden node collisions and exposed node induced congestion issues when utilized in multi-hop wireless networks.","Many civilian and military applications depend on un-tethered connectivity to be able to internetwork while on the move using wireless links. The operations and services of these applications rely on TCP\/IP family of protocols to leverage existing web services that increasingly expect higher quality of service guarantees, scalability, and fair distribution of bandwidth. For example, in order to economically provide broadband internet connectivity to citizens living in rural areas, we must rely on multi-hop wireless networks. In addition, in recent years, there are increased deployments of TCP\/IP broadband mobile access services using multi-hop mesh networks across several U.S. metropolitan areas supported by various commercial ventures and local municipalities. In military application, the advent of groups of unmanned air and ground vehicles and unattended sensors to support tactical missions will require robust multi-hop wireless networks; and DoD test ranges must provide enhanced wireless networking capability to support high data rate, telemetry-like, traffic from a large number of test articles. Additionally, the test data and applications may require a Multi-Level Security (MLS) capability at systems under tests, the test control system, and the wireless network used to collect test data which often results in higher transmission incidents and increased contentions.","It is clear that there is an acute need for technologies that enable efficient use of the spectrum, increase scalability to large number of mobile nodes and traffic flows, as well as support for responsive and adaptive fair allocation of bandwidth among the connected mobile devices. Our proposed AMAC system and methods will support multi-hop wireless networks and are suitable for use in infrastructure based as well as infrastructure-less mobile ad-hoc networks without causing adverse cross-layer interactions within the multi-layer TCP\/IP protocol stack.","2. Adaptive Medium Access Control (AMAC) Protocol",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","100"]},"Each node may include a medium access controller (MAC), to provide adaptive medium access control (AMAC), as disclosed herein.","AMAC may include distributed adaptive control algorithms and bandwidth partitioning methods that collectively provide support for fully integrated contention and contention free medium access control, which may be implemented to provide and\/or support deterministic bandwidth and access delay guarantees for nodes that compete in sharing of resources of a wireless channel. AMAC may be applied to a wireless access system that supports a common time reference and synchronized schedule amongst multiple nodes, where the schedule allocates channel bandwidth amongst competing nodes for defined periodic durations, or periods of time.","A prototype AMAC system as taught herein, has been implemented as an extension of decentralized media access control (DMAC) techniques taught in U.S. Pat. No. 7,881,340, titled, \u201cDecentralized Media Access Control for Ad-hoc Mobile Wireless Network,\u201d which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, including with respect to establishing a common time reference based on a repeating scheduled beacon transmit time (SBTT), contention periods and contention free periods, time-scheduling of contention and contention-free periods, and granting access to the contention periods.

AMAC is not, however, limited to DMAC techniques to establish and\/or synchronize epochs. AMAC may be implemented, for example, with one or more other decentralized and\/or centralized techniques to establish and synchronize periodic epochs, such as GPS global timing and\/or other centralized timing schemes.","2.2. Periodic Schedule of Alternating Contention Free Periods (CFPS) and Contention Periods (CPs)","Periodic epochs  may include alternating contention periods (CPs) and contention free periods (CFPs), such as described below with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0073"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","302","304","306"]},"Nodes  may include distributed and adaptive control methods and algorithms to collaborate with one another to maintain synchronization of a common state of a contention free periods schedule (CFPS), such as taught in U.S. Pat. No. 7,881,340. Synchronization of a common state of a CFPS is not, however, limited to the example of U.S. Pat. No. 7,881,340.","A CFPS may identify all CFPs that occur within an epoch, and may include information for each CFP. CFP information may include, for each CFP, identification of a node that is allocated exclusive use of the channel during the CFP, a start time of the CFP, and a duration of the CFP. A node to which a CFP is allocated may be referred to herein as an allocated node and\/or a local node.","2.3. Retaining Channel During a Subsequent Contention Period","AMAC may be implemented to permit an allocated node to initiate a transmission during a reserved CFP and complete the transmission during an immediately-subsequent CP, such as described below with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0077"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","402","404","406","408"]},"The allocated node also initiates transmission of data  to the other node during CFP .

Transmission by the allocated node may thus be referred to herein as a protected transmission .","Where the allotted node does not need does not utilize the channel beyond the end of CFP , other nodes may contend for the channel during CP , such as with one or more conventional Carrier Sense Multiple Access\/Collision Avoidance (CSMA\/CA) techniques.","2.4. Contention Period Duration","AMAC may be implemented to insure that, when scheduling CFP , CP  is of sufficient duration to permit a node to transmit during CP . This may be useful, for example, to insure that another node has sufficient time to evaluate channel congestion and transmit data over the channel in the event that the allocated node of CFP  does not use CP . AMAC may be implemented to insure that CP  is of sufficient duration to permit the other node to transmit a maximum-size data packet over the channel.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0082"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","502","1","502","2","504"]},"AMAC may be implemented to preclude acceptance or insertion of CFP - within the epoch unless a resultant, or minimum duration of CP  is sufficient to transmit at least one data packet.","AMAC may be implemented to insure that a minimum duration of CP  is sufficient to transmit at least one data packet having a of maximum allowed packet size of an underlying physical layer.","As illustrated in EQS. 1-7 of , AMAC may be implemented to insure that minimum duration of CP  is at least equal to a sum of:\n\n","The example of  may be based on conventional CSMA\/CA access techniques. Methods and systems disclosed herein are not, however, limited to conventional CSMA\/CA access techniques.","The prototype AMAC system described above expands upon DMAC techniques to support alternating CFPs and CPs, with algorithms to verify, prior to accepting a new CFP into a CFPS, that the time between the start of the new CFP and the end of a preceding CFP, within a periodic DMAC SBTT frame, is sufficient to provide a CP with sufficient duration to permit transmission of at least one maximum size packet for the underlying physical layer using a conventional CSMA\/CA access scheme with RTS\/CTS exchange.","2.5. Short-Duration Contention Free Periods, Guaranteed Access, and Fine Grain Adaptive Spectrum Efficiency","Many civilian and military applications require strict Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees from the network service to support application traffic with strict maximum time delay and\/or minimum throughput constraints. These constraints may be important in a variety of applications, such as Voice-Over-IP (VOIP), streaming video, other multimedia commercial applications, telemetry networks applications military test ranges, and tactical-edge wireless network applications. Often due to the QoS guarantees requirements, wireless networks designer have adapted dedicated point-to-point frequency division multiplexing (FDM) and time division multiplexing (TDM) link layer technologies.","Such link layer technologies may, however, be inefficient with respect to spectrum utilization. Specifically, with link layer technologies, generated traffic rate is asynchronous with time varying characteristics in terms of average data rate, size of traffic burst, size of packets. As a result, it may not be feasible to accurately estimate the amount of bandwidth to be statically assigned to each communicating device. Instead, the highest possible data rate may need to be reserved for each node, which may lead to underutilized bandwidth. Alternatively, modifications may be made to support allocation of traffic on-demand on a packet-per-packet basis, or burst-per-burst basis, which may introduce unacceptable delays and\/or significant increases in control traffic overhead, which may negate any potential spectrum efficiency gains from releasing and reserving bandwidth on-demand.","With a conventional TDM or FDM link layer technology, allocation of dedicated bandwidth may include reserving the maximum potential rate that the node may produce at any point in time. The reserved channel capacity may, however, be underutilized if the node does not have sufficient data to fill the reserved capacity. In practice, a dedicated channel of an FDM network may be left idle and\/or fill patterns may be transmitted much of the time. Similarly, in a TDM based wireless link, many timeslots may not be fully utilized because a device that owns the dedicated timeslot may not have data to send when the timeslot starts, or may have a short data packet that does not fill the total bandwidth available for transmission during the timeslot period.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0096"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["700","702","0","7","0","2","3","5","6","7","1","4"]},"As described in examples above, AMAC may be implemented to permit a packet transmission to start in a CFP and continue through a subsequent CP, and to permit other nodes to contend for the subsequent CP when the allotted node does not utilize the CP. In other words, an allotted node may utilize up to the total duration of a reserved CFP and a subsequent CP, when needed, yet other nodes may contend for the subsequent CP when the allotted node does not utilize the CP. This may permit more efficient use of channel bandwidth, particularly with respect to CPs.","AMAC may be implemented to support TDMA and CSMA\/CA access.","In the example of , CFP  provides at least enough time, or bandwidth, to permit an allotted node to perform an RTS\/CTS exchange, and to at least initiate data transmission. CFP are not, however, limited to the example of .","For example, a CFP may be limited to a time that is sufficient to permit an allotted node to perform an RTS\/CTS exchange. In such a situation, the allotted node may initiate and complete data transmission during a subsequent CP.","Relatively short CFPs may be used to effectively guarantee channel access to a node during an epoch, while limiting potential idle time of the channel in the event that the node does not have data ready for transmission at the allotted time.","A shorter CFP may reduce the minimum amount of time allotted to a node, without reducing the permissible amount of time for which the node may use the channel to transmit a packet. A shorter duration CFP may limit channel idle time in the event that the allotted node does not have data ready to transmit at the time of the CFP, and may be useful, for example, with respect to an application having an unpredictable and\/or variable bit rate (VBR).","A longer CFP may, however, be useful with respect to an application having a predictable channel bandwidth, such as a constant bit rate (CBR) application.","AMAC may be implemented to permit reservation of a CFP having one of multiple selectable fixed durations.","Alternatively, or additionally, AMAC may be implemented to permit reservation of a CFP a duration that is variable within a range.","Alternatively, or additionally, AMAC may be implemented to permit reservation selectable numbers of a fixed and relatively short CFP, within a given epoch. For example, a single CFP may be reserved for a VBR application, whereas one or more CFPs may be reserved for a CBR application, depending upon the predicted bit rate. Permitting reservation of a selectable number of CFPs within an epoch effectively permits reservation of a variable-duration CFP.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0098","num":"0107"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","802","804","802","802"]},"AMAC may be implemented to permit users to assign a node a relatively short CFP timeslot that is sufficient to send and receive RTS and CTS control packets. Reserving such short time period guarantees the node assigned this short period an opportunity to transmit a packet of any size, up to the maximum transmit unit allowed by the physical layer, at least once every AMAC epoch interval without risk of collisions.","As an example, a maximum size of a data payload plus all protocol headers allowed to be transmitted by a physical layer may be 2312 octets, such as specified in the IEEE 802.11b standard. Periodic epoch intervals may be 1 second. The duration of CFP  may be just sufficient to transmit a 20-octet RTS packet and receive a 14-octet CTS packet. This will ensure or guarantee an allotted node will be able to transmit a packet with any size up to maximum allowed 2312 octets every second. In other words, a throughput of (2.312\u00d78=18.496) 18.5 Kbps is guaranteed at the expense of dedicating approximately ((20+14)\u00d78=272) 275 bps. The entire transmission of the allotted node is protected from collisions because the RTS and CTS messages inform all other nodes within range of the transmitting and receiving radios, of the full duration required to transmit the 2312-octet data packet, as well as an ACK response packet.","With this approach, only 275 bits\/second of overall channel capacity is at risk of idleness when a node reserves a short-duration CFP as described above, since other nodes may contend to the channel during CP  when the allotted channel of CFP  does not have data to send.","Moreover, if the allotted node has less than the maximum data to transmit (e.g., less than 2312 octets), the other nodes may contend for any remaining or unused portion of CP , such as with conventional CSMA\/CA.","Continuing with the example above, to reserve more than 18.5 kbps, a node may reserve two dedicated short CFPs to transmit up to 37 kbps, with a guaranteed 0.5 second maximum access delay.","AMAC may be implemented to support efficient and fair allocation of channel resources with quality of service (QoS) support in terms of ability to guarantee minimum throughput and\/or a maximum access delay for a specific device or node without incurring significant cost when this device is not temporarily unable to utilize channel resources allocated exclusively to the device.","AMAC may be implemented to support fine-grain adaptive channel access control on a packet-per-packet basis with minimal cost when a node does not utilize channel resources allocated for its exclusive use because, when a node is not able to fully utilize its dedicated channel resources, other nodes sharing the common channel may capitalize on an opportunity to reclaim the unutilized portion of the spectrum resources at relatively fine granularity.","AMAC may be implemented to permit a node to reserve specific CFP bandwidth to satisfy a predictable constant bit rate produced by an application.","AMAC may be implemented to permit reservation of a fixed and relatively short CFP, as illustrated in , with full integration of TDM and CSMA\/CA access.","2.6. Adaptive Collision Avoidance for Broadcast Packets","Flooding and broadcast traffic play an important role in many packet networks, particularly Internet Protocol (IP) packet networks.","For example, an Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), defined in a Request for Comment 826, published in November, 1982 by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETP), is a telecommunications protocol to map between IP and MAC addresses. ARP depends on broadcast messages to resolve a specific IP address to a MAC address of a neighboring node.","A network may include mobile forwarding nodes, such as a multi-hop MANET network or other highly dynamic multi-hop wireless topology. In order to properly forward packets in such a network, an IP route discovery protocol may be used to discover multi-hop paths and\/or repair disconnected paths. Multi-hop IP route discovery protocols may flood a network with route-request messages and\/or may broadcast to advertise link states to neighboring nodes.","It is not trivial, however, for a broadcasting node to ensure that a transmitted packet has reached all potential destinations within its radio range. For example, a packet transmitted using an omni-directional antenna may be received by one or more receivers, but may experience collisions and interference at other receivers depending on distances and\/or noise levels at different locations surrounding the transmitting and receiving nodes. A transmitting node may not be able to sense channel quality at receiving nodes from its current location, and may not be able to assume that the same signal quality applies multiple locations within range of its transmitted signal. A transmitting node thus cannot assume that a transmitted packet has been received at any particular node.","All receivers could be required to transmit acknowledgments of receipt a broadcast packet. This could, however, lead to numerous acknowledgments being sent over the channel, which could result in high incidents of collisions. Even if such collisions are avoided, multiple acknowledgments may nevertheless overload the channel and resources of the packet broadcaster.","A protocol may re-broadcast a message at long intervals to increase the probability that the broadcast message reaches receivers within range. Re-broadcasting of a message may, however, reduce available bandwidth for other nodes that contend for transmission on the shared wireless channel, which may reduce efficient utilization of channel bandwidth.","To minimize applications delays, a MAC design should facilitate ARP broadcasting and broadcasting of route discovery packets without delay. A MAC design should also increase the probability of successful reception of broadcast route discovery and address resolutions packets by receivers within range, such as in a TCP\/IP MANET environment.","A conventional CSMA\/CA MAC may permit rapid transmissions of broadcast traffic. In a multi-hop wireless environment, however, a conventional CSMA\/CA MAC may not provide any protection from collisions for broadcast traffic. In such a network, even under light channel loads, broadcast traffic packets may be vulnerable to hidden nodes collisions, and it may not be feasible to rely upon RTS\/CTS exchanges to protect against hidden nodes collisions. Under heavy load conditions, all traffic may be vulnerable to collisions, and it may not be feasible to detect collisions of broadcast traffic. As a result, conventional TCP\/IP MANET networks may spend excessive amounts of time and channel bandwidth attempting to discover and repair routes, even when a current path between a source and destinations has not changed, such as when a segment of a current path experiences a heavy load.","AMAC may include adaptive broadcast collision protection (ABCP), which may balance rapid transmission of broadcast packets with reduction of probability of collisions for broadcast packets.","With ABCP, each node may measure or estimate a congestion level within a range of the corresponding node. Channel congestion may be determined with respect to aggregate duration of channel CSMA\/CA idle time relative to total CSMA\/CA access\/busy duration, within a periodic epoch interval.","A channel may be considered idle for a period of time when the period of time does not overlap with a CFP or the duration of a packet transmitted or received by any node within range of the measuring node.","Each node may track channel non-idle, or busy times when the node receives a RTS, CTS, or data packet transmitted within range of the node. A duration field in a header of the transmitted data packet may be used to determine when the channel will be idle.","A node may consider the channel congested when a level of interfering signal exceeds a physical layer receiver sensitivity threshold. Each node may maintain a moving window of time within an epoch, and may estimate a ratio of channel busy time to overall epoch interval within the window of time, and the channel may be considered congested when the ratio reaches or exceeds a BroadcastInCFP_RatioThreshold.","When the channel is considered congested by a node that has at least one CFP allocated within the epoch, the node may be precluded from transmitting broadcast packets from an upper layer except during the corresponding allocated CFP(s). Transmission preclusion may reduce the probability of declaring multi-hop routes stale by a network layer protocol. When a route actually fails, due to mobility and\/or other factors, transmission preclusion may increase the probability of discovering an alternate route before impacting upper layers timers at transport layer protocols, such as TCP timers where unacceptable performance and potential failures by end user applications often occur.","A value of the DefaultBroadcastInCFP_RatioThreshold may be configurable, such as to define multiple levels of congestion.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0123","num":"0132"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":"900"},"Method  is described below as performed by a node, referred to herein as a local or measuring node.

Adaptive Collision Avoidance for Unicast Packets","A convention wireless contention-based MAC, such as IEEE 802.11 CSMA\/CA, performs poorly under heavy load conditions and induces undesirable cross-layer interactions when used in multi-hop environments. For example, many CSMA\/CA MACs employ an exponential back-off scheme for congestion avoidance and collisions recovery. In this standard CSMA\/CA congestion avoidance approach, when a node attempts to send a packet to a neighboring node using the CSMA\/CA access method the transmitting node considers its attempt a failure if it does not receive an RTS or an ACK response from the intended receiving node in a certain time period. When this occurs, the transmitting node assumes that its packet experienced collision at the receiving node from interfering signals or competing nodes transmissions. In IEEE 802.11 specification, a transmitter is allowed to attempt to retransmit a packet up to seven times using CSMA\/CA access. However, with each successive retransmission attempt the transmitter is required to double the size of the Contention Window (CW) used to select the random-back-off period duration where the medium should remain idle before transmitting the packet. IEEE 802.11 standard sets the initial CW size to  with maximum allowed CW size of 256.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0165","num":"0194"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":"1200"},"After a 7th retransmission attempt fails, the next upper layer, network, is informed that packet transmission to the neighboring node has failed. Typically this event will cause the routing protocols at the network layer to assume that a change in topology has occurred due to potential link failure, or as a result of node mobility. This causes the routing protocol to initiate a route discovery process, which floods the network with route-request broadcast messages.","In many occasions, however, the route discovery process may not be necessary because the network topology did not change. Rather, the transmission failure was caused by excessive collisions; high collisions incidents typically occur as transmission load increases from multiple competing nodes sharing a common wireless channel.","Under these conditions, any initiation of unnecessary route-discovery process will exacerbate the channel congestion condition already experienced by competing nodes. Worst yet, under heavy congestion levels, the routing protocols most likely will fail to discover a path for the failed destination. In the mean time, upper layer protocols such as TCP, or any other application specific protocol, with support for flow control and guaranteed packet delivery will rapidly reduce its data rate, initiate data packet retransmission, and may eventually suffer from a connection time-out. This causes severe performance degradation for the end-user applications, and potentially mission failure.","In contrast, AMAC may include an adaptive collision avoidance scheme for unicast packets, which may be implemented with respect to unicast re-transmissions from a node that is assigned at least one CFP. AMAC may provide that, when the node does not receive an expected acknowledgement of a unicast packet transmission, the node may re-transmit the packet during subsequent CPs and\/or CFPs, up to a first threshold number of times. The first threshold is denoted herein as UnicastInCFPlimit. Thereafter, the node may re-transmit the packet only during allocated CFPs. Subsequent re-transmissions during allocated CFPs, or a total number of re-transmissions, may be limited to a second threshold number, denoted herein as MaxUnicastAttemptsAllowed.","This may protect subsequent retransmissions of the packet from potential collisions, and may permit the node to more-gracefully adapt to transient congestion events.

NS2 includes capability to handle mobile nodes, and includes support for experiment scripting enabling fine control over experiment scenarios. The NS2 script interface allows scheduling of traffic start and stop times, placement and movements of nodes over time and space. The NS2 script interface also allows configuration of a network and the nodes in terms of used application, transport, routing and MAC protocols. The NS2 includes packets tracing and logging infrastructure, allowing detailed examination of network behaviors on a packet per packet basis.

Xu, et al., \u201cTCP Behavior across Multihop Wireless Networks and the Wired Internet,\u201d Proceedings of the 5th ACM Internal Workshop on Wireless Mobile Multimedia.","Several studies using experiments and network simulations indicate that TCP flows with fewer hops between source and destination tend to starve TCP flows with longer paths when paths of these, long and short, TCP flows intersect and compete for common channel resources in a multi-hop wireless network.

Xu, et al., discusses the fundamental causes of these TCP unfairness problems and observes that the causes of these issues are rooted in design decisions made at the MAC layer, including hidden nodes and exposed node problems, and adverse interactions between MAC congestion avoidance and TCP flow control mechanisms.","K. Xu, et al., identifies challenges of attempting to adjust TCP timers and control flow configuration when TCP flows traverse a network with wired and multi-hop wireless segments. Wired IP network segments need efficient support for long round trip delay, while multi-hop wireless segments need TCP settings that assume a short round trip delay to avoid channel capture and unfair distribution of bandwidth among competing flows. Solving these TCP protocol performance issues is critical for many applications. TCP is used by almost all internet applications that rely on guaranteed packet delivery service. Examples of higher layer applications protocols that rely on TCP reliable transport protocol include SIP for IP telephony signaling for VOIP call setup, HTTP protocol for web browsing, FTP file transfer service, mail services, and SOA applications protocols for distributed computing.","Traffic monitoring and analysis studies show that 90% of bytes transferred in the internet are moved by TCP protocol flows, as described in M.

These CFPs were equally spaced with a contention period between them. The IEEE 802.11 standard MAC does not support contention-free access in the ad-hoc mode, so all nodes are required to use contention access for all packet transmissions.","3.3. Characterization of Cross-Layer Interactions in Multi-Hop Wireless Ad-Hoc Networks on TCP Performance","In order to characterize the performance of TCP protocol in multi-hop wireless network, experiments were conducted using the AMAC protocol NS2 model  in order to better understand the potential cross-layer interactions between the various settings of AMAC methods as well as the various configurations parameters that can be set for the TCP\/IP upper layers protocols and their impact performance of TCP protocol.","Potential sources of interactions that may impact overall TCP flows throughput in multi-hop wireless mobile ad-hoc networks were examined. For example, interactions with upper layer protocols such as the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), routing protocols, were examined, and throughput performance was examined when various standard versions of TCP protocol are used. Unfortunately, exhaustive analysis and characterization of these interactions involves a very large set of settings at various levels of the protocol stack.","There is substantial number of configurable parameters that can be set for AMAC and TCP\/IP upper layer protocols. Several key configuration parameters inherent to AMAC protocol were identified and considered with respect to impact performance, such as the duration of the epoch interval, and duration of CFPs assigned to intermediate forwarding nodes for multi-hop TCP flow. These values influence the amount of bandwidth dedicated to the TCP flow, and frequency of transmit opportunity allowed to each node on the path of the TCP flow.","Other AMAC parameters impacting broadcast traffic, such as forcing broadcast messages to occur only during CFP periods for nodes that have at least one dedicated CFP, may impact responsiveness of address-resolution and route-discovery protocols positively during heavy congestion periods, or may have an adverse impact during low network load periods.","Other cross-layer interactions configurations for upper layer TCP\/IP protocols that may be evaluated include the type of MANET routing method used at layer , reactive or proactive routing, and the specific MANET routing protocol employed, which may include, for example, Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV), Destination-Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV).","Other factors that may be evaluated include the size of packet used for TCP flow, the size of packets queues at each network node, the version and type of TCP protocol (e.g., TCP, Taho, Reno, new Reno), and various configuration for the maximum TCP window size. Combination of one or more of these configurations may prove to be a critical factor in performance of TCP in multi-hop network.","The substantial number of possible configurations makes it unfeasible to conduct exhaustive factorial tests for all possible combinations of all possible configurations, and analysis and study results from such an undertaking. Instead, Design of Experiments (DOE) techniques were applied to reduce the number of experiments. DOE screening-design methods identified more-critical cross-layer configuration factors influencing the throughput of TCP flows in multi-hop ad-hoc networks. The DOE screening-design experiments revealed that the top cross-layer configurations parameters with most significant impact on TCP throughout are three independent factors. They include the epoch interval duration, the average size of TCP packets, and the duration of CFPs assigned to nodes on the TCP flow multi-hop path.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0251","num":"0280"},"figref":"FIG. 21","b":"2100"},"The DOE screening-design experiments results show that increasing packet size and CFP duration increase TCP flow throughput across the multi-hop wireless network, independent of any other setting. The results also show that decreasing duration of epoch interval increases the TCP throughput.","These results seem logical since an increase in duration of CFPs assigned to TCP flow, and\/or a decrease in epoch interval duration should increase the dedicated bandwidth assigned to multi-hop TCP flow, which should increase the throughput of this TCP flow.","The positive impact of TCP packet size can be explained by the fact that large packets incur lower header overhead-to-payload ratio. Moreover, longer packets use less RTS\/CTS exchanges to transmit the same amount of payload data, relative to shorter packets. As a result, and assuming that longer packets will not experience high incidents of collisions, larger packets consume less inter-packet channel overhead in terms of time required for medium to remain idle before next transmission is allowed.","Inherent adaptive congestion avoidance capabilities of AMAC permits integration of contention and contention-free access, which provides excellent protection from collisions for packets. Standard CSMA\/CA MAC approaches permit use of longer packets even in high network load conditions. A pure CSMA\/CA contention access MAC will favor shorter packet sizes, particularly during high network loads, resulting in high per-packet and high inter-packet overheads.","3.4. Short CFP Impact on TCP Traffic Throughput and Spectrum Efficiency","Insight from the DOE screening-design analysis was used to evaluate the response of CFP duration, in terms of actual TCP rate, over an 8 hops path. The evaluation involved measuring the spectrum-efficiency metric of AMAC protocol in terms of the actual TCP bit rate received at a destination, relative to the reserved bit rate allocated for multi-hop TCP flow. The reserved bit rate is determined as a function of the duration of CFP allocated to each node in the multi-hop path between the source and destination nodes of the main TCP flow.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0257","num":"0286"},"figref":"FIG. 22","b":"2200"},"Graph  includes an overlay plot  of the TCP throughput and the spectrum efficiency measures for the main TCP flow that passes over an 8 hop path with packet size set to 2000 bytes, and 1 second epoch interval. Plot  that shows TCP throughput in the left-hand axes, measured in terms of actual received bit rate (in bps) at destination as a function of CFPs durations. As such, plot  shows TCP throughput in (bps) measured against the reserved or dedicated bandwidth (bps) assigned to all nodes on the path of the TCP flow.","Graph  also includes a plot  that reflects the reserved\/allocated-bandwidth spectrum efficiency metric for the TCP flow. The data in plot  came from several experiments where in which the duration of CFPs allocated to nodes in the multi-hop path of the TCP flow was varied. The actual average throughput in each measurement is computed by accumulating all bits received at the destination of the main TCP flow over the test interval. Plot  for the TCP throughput increases as the dedicated bandwidth assigned to TCP, from the shared channel capacity, is increased. Plot  shows the spectrum-efficiency of AMAC protocol when used to transmit TCP flows in multi-hop wireless network. Plot  reveals that any minor TCP flow throughput gains attained as a result of increasing the dedicated bandwidth (i.e., CFP duration allocated to TCP flow), will be attained at significant spectrum-efficiency cost.","In fact, plot  shows that very short CFPs yield the best spectrum efficiency results. This may be attributed to full integration of contention-free access (CFA) and contention-access (CA) features of AMAC, in which a node with dedicated CFPs may start CFA transmission during one of its allocated CFPs, and the node is allowed to continue and complete its packet transmission during the immediately-subsequent CP. The CFA packet transmission is protected from collisions, even from hidden nodes collision, when the node is able to transmit RTS and receive CTS during its CFP.","As such, the most efficient CFP duration setting for spectrum utilization is where CFP duration equals minimum duration required to allow completing exchange of RTS and CTS control packets. This corresponds to the minimum duration required to send RTS, wait for SIFS, and receive CTS. An unused CFP (e.g., where an allocated node does not have data to transmit at the time of CFP), having a short-duration, incurs less spectrum penalty compared to longer CFP. Moreover, when short CFPs are utilized, other nodes sharing the same channel will have opportunity to use a longer CPs to transmit any pending packets. Whereas other nodes are be precluded from sending during the full duration of long CFPs, resulting in spectrum resource waste.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0262","num":"0291"},"figref":"FIG. 23","b":["2300","2302","2304","2306","2308"]},"The DOE screening-design analysis revealed that a shorter AMAC epoch interval yields the maximum response in terms of improving TCP flow throughput in multi-hop wireless networks. This is understandable, because reducing the duration of AMAC epoch interval is another means of increasing allocated bandwidth for nodes that own CFPs. Specifically, the dedicated bandwidth for a CFP owner equals:\n\n(CFP duration\/Epoch Duration)*(channel rate).\n","For example, assuming that AMAC epoch interval is set to 1 second, the dedicated bit rate allocated to a node that owns a CFP may be doubled by doubling the duration of the CFP that occurs once a second, or using the same CFP duration within a half second AMAC epoch interval. Based on this observation, it is expected that a multi-hop wireless network using AMAC would show similar response in terms of absolute magnitude with respect to configuration of duration of CFP and AMAC epoch interval. However, actual DOE screening-design experiments results showed that a multi-hop wireless system AMAC is more responsive to changes in epoch interval duration than to changes in CFP duration for multi-hop TCP flow throughput. Several experiments were conducted to study and analyze this observed variance of these two approaches that can be used allocate a node with an identical fixed amount of the channel bandwidth.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0265","num":"0294"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"Actual Data"]},{"entry":["No. of CFPs","CFP","Reserved","Actual TCP","Rate\/Reserved"]},{"entry":["per Second","Duration","Data Rate","Data Rate","Data Rate"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"49pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1","2 ms","2000 bps","12584 bps","6.29"]},{"entry":["2","1 ms","2000 bps","32104 bps","16.01"]},{"entry":["1","3 ms","3000 bps","15456 bps","5.15"]},{"entry":["3","1 ms","3000 bps","50192 bps","16.73"]},{"entry":["1","20 ms\u2002","20,000 bps\u2002\u2009","24520 bps","1.23"]},{"entry":["1","40 ms\u2002","40,000 bps\u2002\u2009","41064 bps","1.03"]},{"entry":["1","50 ms\u2002","50,000 bps\u2002\u2009","47360 bps","0.95"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Table 1 shows TCP throughput and efficiency response to reserved rates allocated with single CFP and multiple CFPs per node.","Table 1 lists actual measured TCP rate per second and the spectrum-efficiency metrics as a function dedicated rate assigned to the multi-hop TCP flow and how this rate was allocated. The first two rows contrast the actual rate and spectrum-efficiency when the actual dedicated\/reserved rate for TCP flow using CFP is set to approximately 2000 bps.","The first row shows experiment outcome when allocated one CFP was allocated to every node along an 8 hops TCP flow path, where the CFP had a 2 ms duration, occurring once every epoch interval of 1 second. This effectively reserved approximately 2000 bps for the main 8-hops TCP flow when the overall shared channel rate is set to 1 Mbps.","The second row shows results when two CFPs with 1 ms duration were allocated to each node along the 8 hops path of the TCP flow. This effectively reserved approximately 2000 bps for the 8-hops TCP flow when channel rate is 1 Mbps. Even though identical amounts of bandwidth are allocated to the multi-hop TCP flow, the results of the experiments show profound difference in actual TCP rate and spectrum efficiency depending on the method used to allocate the dedicated bandwidth. Assigning two CFP with 1 ms duration yields significant improvements in throughput and spectrum utilization efficiency for multi-hop TCP flow when compared with assigning a single 2 ms CFP.","Rows three and four in Table 1 show significant improvement in performance when each node along the path of the multi-hop TCP flow are assigned three 1 ms CFPs at every epoch interval when compared to assigning a single 3 ms CFP to each node for the same epoch interval duration. This different may be attributed to cross-layer interactions between MAC layer congestion avoidance mechanisms and TCP protocol response to network round-trip delay.","As explained earlier, AMAC employs an adaptive congestion avoidance mechanism to handle transient network congestion events, in which packets are allowed to be transmitted as soon as possible when the medium is deemed idle during CP, or during one of the CFP owned by the packet transmitter. A node that owns one or more CFP is allowed to retransmit a packet during a CP for a limited amount of time, and then it is forced to withhold all subsequent retransmission attempts to be conducted only during any of the node's CFPs. This congestion avoidance approach will force any AMAC node to revert from a node capable of supporting an integrated contention and Contention free access methods, to a node limited to pseudo Time-division Multiplexing (TDM) mode use during heavy network load periods. TDM systems can introduce significant additive delay when used in multi-hop network, as nodes are forced to wait for arrival of its time-slot to transmit a packet to next hop at every intermediate node in a multi-hop paths resulting in an additive end-to-end packet forwarding delay.","Assigning multiple CFPs with short duration to a node guarantees a node multiple opportunities to transmit a packet within a fixed SBTT interval; which will reduce the end-end additive delay that packets may experience if these packets are forced to be transmitted only during long CFPs that occurs once every epoch interval when any parts of the network experience significant network load.","In addition, AMAC will exhibit very short end-to-end delay when network load is low at various times and locations across the duration of the TCP session and the multi-hop paths it is forced to use.","Additionally, guaranteed transmission opportunities recurring at higher rates along the multi-hop path allow TCP acknowledgments packets to arrive at the source faster which will result in rapid increase in packet flow in the forward direction.","As such, use of short and frequently reoccurring CFPs configuration is recommended for TCP traffic; our experiments results and our observations show that this recommended configuration should result in significant increase in multi-hop TCP flow throughput; as well as significant increase in spectrum utilization efficiency as the probability of fully and partially unutilized CFPs well be reduced due to increase in TCP flow rate when round-trip-delay is limited as a byproduct of TCP protocol inherent control mechanisms. Further, as discussed earlier, shorter CFP reduces potential for wastage of reserved bandwidth when any CFP cannot be fully utilized by its owner whenever there are no sufficient data available for transmission when the CFP arrives.","3.5. AMAC Fairness and Scalability Performance for UDP Traffic","Several NS2 experiments were designed to evaluate the fairness and scalability performance for an AMAC system when large number nodes sharing a common channel transmit UDP traffic flows.

In our experiment delay Jitter is computed in terms of inter-packet arrival variance.","The experiments compare AMAC performance against the standard IEEE 802.11 CSMA\/CA protocol performance in DCF mode.

AMAC Spectrum Efficiency for Bursty Traffic","Several experiments were performed in order to evaluate the AMAC protocol performance and its cross-layer interactions when used in multi-hop wireless deployments to support best effort bursty traffic that needs to cross multi-hop path with high incidents of congestions, hidden node and exposed node incidents. In these experiments, the AMAC NS2 simulation model allowed us to track throughput and spectrum efficiency metrics when traffic arrival rate, packet sizes, and traffic burst size were not static.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0284","num":"0313"},"figref":"FIG. 26"},"An experiment was designed where a multi-hop UDP flow connected to a data source with a random exponential inter-packet arrival times, and where packet sizes changes every 5 seconds using a uniform random distribution value ranging between 1000 and 2000 octets.

These adjacent nodes are used to compete for the channel with the main UDP flow; these competing nodes were used to setup a single hop TCP session to create a heavy congestion zone at every other hop along the multi-hop path used by our main UDP flow.

Using these NS2 experiment scripts, the main multi-hop UDP session started after 500 seconds and the competing TCP flows after 510 seconds. The flows were allowed to generate packets until the 1000 seconds experiment duration elapse. The average bit rate at the destination of the multi-hop UDP flow was computed, and then spectrum efficiency was measured by dividing the actual bit rate received at the destination by the dedicated bit rate of the CFP allocated for each node in the 8-hop path.","A curve  reveals that use of shortest CFP duration yields best spectrum efficiency performance for applications with bursty best effort traffic. In addition, a curve  shows also that assigning more bandwidth when traffic is bursty does not yield higher throughput. In fact, the throughput remains constant as we increase the dedicated bandwidth for the main UDP flow. We believe that the main UDP session was not able to leverage the additional capacity that were made available, as we increased the duration of the CFP assigned to each node in the multi-hop path, due to inability to leverage dedicated bit rate when UDP packets are short or not ready due to dynamic inter-packet arrival rate, infeasibility to rely on contention periods when competing with TCP with short path that will capture the channel during CP. These results show the difficulty in assigning proper amount of bandwidth when multi-hop network is established using any TDM based MAC and where nodes are expected to generate bursty traffic with unpredictable inter-packets arrival times, and variable packet sizes. Assigning the maximum expected bit rate will result in very poor utilization of spectrum. Use of AMAC technology with short CFP duration configuration provides significant improvements over pure TDMA when these bursty traffic need to be supported in multi-hop wireless deployments. This shows that AMAC technology offers significant flexibility over TDMA based MAC systems.","Methods and systems are disclosed herein with the aid of functional building blocks illustrating the functions, features, and relationships thereof.
