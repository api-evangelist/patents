The current technology of fuel cells, however, has not made a significant impact on the mainstream market due to cost, size, and the lack of an immediate need to replace current power sources, such as batteries and gasoline- or diesel-powered internal combustion engines. The long-term need to find alternative power sources has become increasingly evident, however. For example, the byproducts of gasoline- and diesel-powered internal combustion engines are environmentally harmful. In contrast, the byproducts of fuel cells are clean, and in some cases, comprise only water.","Further, with portable electronic devices, such as cell phones, laptops, and handheld personal organizers becoming smaller, the need for smaller power sources, such as micro fuel cells, becomes evident. Present fuel cell technology, however, typically requires large fuel cell stacks comprising high-cost flat proton exchange membranes (PEMs).","Additionally, consumer products require power sources that operate for an extended period of time without the need for recharging. Micro fuel cells typically provide a longer lasting energy output with one cartridge of fuel. For example, the chemical fuels used in micro fuel cells promise to power devices up to ten times as long as batteries on a single charge. Further, once the energy source becomes low, the energy level can be restored by merely replacing the fuel cartridge.","Most fuel cells employ a copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) and a perfluorinated monomer comprising sulfonic acid groups, such as perfluorosulfonyl fluoride ethoxy propyl vinyl ether (PSEPVE). One such copolymer is available as NAFION\u00ae (E. I. duPont de Nemours and Co., Wilmington, Del., United States of America), or a similar commercially available material. These materials often are provided as a membrane in final form, e.g., a non-thermoplastic form having a flat rectangular or square geometry, for subsequent use. If the membrane is flat and smooth, i.e., non-patterned, the catalyst layer also must be flat. Further, such membranes typically must be of at least a certain minimum thickness to be handleable. Additionally, the power density or conductivity is usually directly proportional to the membrane thickness; that is, the thicker the membrane, the lower the power density.","Additionally, Lu et al., 49, 821-828 (2003) have described silicon-based materials for use in a micro direct methanol fuel cell. Silicon-based micro direct fuel cells are rigid, brittle devices that typically are expensive and time consuming to manufacture. Also, incorporating actuating valves in silicon-based materials is difficult or impossible due to the rigid nature of the material. Further, the silicon-based micro direct methanol fuel cell described by Lu et al. has a ratio of active area versus macroscopic area equal to about one.","Also, in currently available fuel cell technologies it is imperative to have good contact between the electrode, proton exchange membrane (PEM), and catalyst. High power densities rely on conformal contact between the electrode, the catalyst, and the PEM. Much research has been invested in developing new PEMs and new catalysts, but little has been investigated in terms of a new catalyst ink composition. Conventional catalyst inks or tie layers typically consist of a catalyst such as platinum, an electrode material such as carbon black, and a dispersion of NAFION\u00ae, water, and alcohol.","Further, PEMs currently available in the art consist of one equivalent weight (EW), which gives rise to a trade-off between power density and methanol permeability.","Thus, there is a need in the art for an improved electrochemical cell, in particular a micro fuel cell that is capable of providing power to small, portable electronic devices, as well as a need for improved electrochemical cell components.","The presently disclosed subject matter describes liquid materials for use in an electrochemical cell, such a fuel cell, a chlor-alkali cell, a battery, and the like.

Liquid Precursor Materials","The presently disclosed subject matter describes liquid, pourable precursor materials that are processible, i.e., can be formed into different shapes or can conform to different shapes, and can be used to prepare a high surface area PEM. In some embodiments, as provided in more detail herein below, the liquid precursor materials can be patterned by a patterned substrate, e.g., a mold, and treated (such as but not limited to cured into solids) to form a patterned PEM.","As used herein, the term \u201c100% solids liquid precursor material\u201d refers to a liquid polymeric precursor material in which essentially all of the components are polymerized when treated, e.g., cured. Thus, in some embodiments, a \u201c100% solids liquid precursor material\u201d is essentially free of non-polymerizable materials. This property of a \u201c100% solids liquid precursor material\u201d distinguishes this material from a solution or dispersion of a liquid precursor material known in the art, in which the liquid material can comprise between about 80% by weight to about 98% by weight of solvent or other non-polymerizable material. For example, one perfluorinated liquid composition commonly used in the art to prepare ion exchange membranes comprises from about 2% by weight to about 18% by weight of the polymeric material and about 82% by weight to about 98% by weight of solvent, which is non-polymerizable. See U.S. Pat. No. 4,433,082 to Grot, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Accordingly, in some embodiments, the 100% solids liquid material comprises from about 70% by weight to about 75% by weight of polymerizable material. In some embodiments, the 100% solids liquid material comprises from about 75% by weight to about 80% by weight of polymerizable material. In some embodiments, the 100% solids liquid material comprises from about 80% by weight to about 85% by weight of polymerizable material. In some embodiments, the 100% solids liquid material comprises from about 85% by weight to about 90% by weight of polymerizable material. In some embodiments, the 100% solids liquid material comprises from about 90% by weight to about 95% by weight of polymerizable material. In some embodiments, the 100% solids liquid material comprises from about 95% by weight to about 98% by weight of polymerizable material. In some embodiments, the 100% solids liquid material comprises from about 98% by weight to about 100% by weight of polymerizable material. Thus, in some embodiments, the 100% solids liquid material comprises from about 70% by weight to about 100% by weight of polymerizable material.","Further, in some embodiments, the liquid precursor material comprises a fluorinated system. In some embodiments, the fluorinated system comprises a perfluoropolyether (PFPE) material. In some embodiments, the PFPE material comprises a vinyl-functionalized material, including, but not limited to, a vinyl methacrylate.","In some embodiments, the liquid precursor material comprises species, including vinyl acids, such as perfluoro-2-(2-fluorosulfonylethoxy) propyl vinyl ether (PSEPVE), that enhance proton conductivity. As used herein, the term \u201cproton conductive material\u201d refers to a material within which a proton can be transported. For example, in some embodiments, a proton is transported from an anode through a proton conductive material to a cathode. Proton conductivity can be measured, for example, by alternating current (AC) impedance methods known in the art, and is typically reported in units of Siemens\/cm (S\/cm). Such proton conductive materials typically have a proton conductivity of greater than about 0.01 S\/cm.","In some embodiments, the liquid precursor material comprises other species that regulate the physical properties of the material, including modulus, permeability of methanol and other liquids, wetting, tensile strength, toughness, flexibility, and thermal properties, among others.

The term \u201coligomer\u201d refers to a molecule of intermediate relative molecular mass, the structure of which comprises a small plurality of constitutional units derived from molecules of lower relative molecular mass. The term \u201cmacromonomer\u201d refers to a macromolecule or polymer that comprises a reactive end group which enables the macromonomer to act as a monomer and contribute a monomeric unit to a chain of the final macromolecule or polymer.

In some embodiments, the curing process comprises a process selected from the group consisting of a thermal process, a photochemical process, and an irradiation process. In some embodiments, the irradiation process comprises irradiating the liquid precursor material with radiation, wherein the radiation is selected from the group consisting of gamma rays and an electron beam. In some embodiments, the chemical modification process comprises a crosslinking process. Methods for the radiolysis of fluoropolymers, including perfluoropolyether materials, are provided in J. S. Forsvthe, et al., 25, 101-136 (2000), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Further, Published PCT International Application WO 99\/61141 to Mao et al. describes a method of making crosslinked polymers suitable for use in ion conductive membranes, such as a proton exchange membrane, by (a) crosslinking a polymer having pendant acid halide groups with a crosslinker which bonds to two or more acid halide groups, or (b) crosslinking a polymer having pendant amide groups with a crosslinker which bonds to two or more amide groups. Also, Buchi et al., 142(9), 3004 (1995), discloses proton exchange membranes made by sulfonating a crosslinked polyolefin-polystyrene copolymer, which is crosslinked during polymerization by addition of divinyl benzene. U.S. Pat. No. 5,438,082 to Helmer-Metzmann et al. discloses a method of crosslinking a sulfonated aromatic polyether ketone with a crosslinker comprising an amine functional group. Further, U.S. Pat. No. 5,468,574 to Ehrenberq et al. and Published PCT International Patent Application No. WO 97\/19,480 to Graham et al. disclose that certain sulfonated polymers will form direct bonds between sulfonate groups upon heating; however, this method appears to sacrifice sulfonic acid groups thereby resulting in the loss of acidity in the membrane. The above-mentioned patents, publications, and published patent applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","Thus, in some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter provides a polymeric electrolyte comprising a 100% solids liquid precursor material as defined hereinabove, wherein the 100% solids liquid precursor material comprises from about 70% by weight to about 100% by weight polymerizable materials.","In some embodiments, the presently disclosed polymeric electrolyte has an equivalent weight, wherein the equivalent weight is selected from the group consisting of an equivalent weight less than about 1500 and greater than about 1000, an equivalent weight less than about 1000 and greater than about 800, an equivalent weight less than about 800 and greater than about 500, and an equivalent weight below about 500.","Further, in some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter provides an electrochemical cell comprising the polymeric electrolyte prepared from a 100% solids liquid precursor. In some embodiments, the electrochemical cell is selected from the group consisting of a fuel cell, a chlor-alkali cell, and a battery.","Further, NAFION\u00ae and other PEM materials perform best when relative humidity values are high, for example above about 90%. Incorporation of an alcohol into a NAFION\u00ae-like material makes the material more hydrophilic, which can result in good conductivity at lower relative humidities and\/or reduced water loss at higher temperatures. An example is provided in Scheme 11, which provides a method for polymerizing components of a NAFION\u00ae-like material with vinyl acetate. Simple hydrolysis reactions convert the acetate to the alcohol while obtaining a sulfonic acid group on the proton-conducting compound. Post fluorination on the material can provide chemical and thermal stability of a perfluorinated material.","Another limitation of NAFION\u00ae is its low acid content. The acid content of NAFION\u00ae can not be much higher than is currently available in commercial grades since increasing the acid content (lowering the equivalent weight) by increasing the fraction of PSEPVE incorporated into the TFE\/PSEPVE copolymer leads to molecular weight reduction because of the propensity of fluorinated vinyl ethers to undergo \u03b2-scission reactions during polymerization. See Romack, T. J., and DeSimone. J. M., 28, 8429-8431 (1995), which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. Thus, as the acid content of NAFION\u00ae is increased, the molecular weight of the polymer decreases and the mechanical properties are compromised. Such a linear, low molecular weight, high acid-containing NAFION\u00ae-like material has poor film forming qualities and becomes water soluble, an unacceptable property. This limitation in the reaction chemistry used to make NAFION\u00ae limits commercial suppliers to selling grades of NAFION\u00ae that do not contain a high enough acid content necessary for very high proton conductivity. Indeed, the most widely studied commercial grade of NAFION\u00ae has an equivalent weight of 1100 with a proton conductivity of only 0.083 S\/cm at room temperature under fully hydrated conditions. See Mauritz. K. A. and Moore. R. B., 104, 4535-4585 (2004), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The presently disclosed materials address these deficiencies and generate new PEMs that have much higher conductivities, are more thermally stable, more selective, more mechanically robust, and incorporate a modular design that will allow for independent control of membrane properties.","Without being bound to any one particular theory, it is believed that the high conductivity in the presently disclosed materials is due to a fundamentally different proton conduction mechanism than is operative in NAFION\u00ae. According to most reports, see, e. g., Mauritz, K. A. and Moore, R. B., 104, 45354585 (2004), the morphology of NAFION\u00ae can be considered as isolated clusters of acid groups embedded in a Teflon-like matrix. Protons can hop from acid group to acid group within the clusters, but in order for a proton to macroscopically transport across the PEM, it must migrate in the form of a hydronium ion through hydrophilic channels from one acid cluster to the next. That is, in order for NAFION\u00ae to be highly proton conductive, the presence of a threshold amount of water is a requirement. This requirement for NAFION\u00ae to be hydrated in order for it to be highly proton conductive, see Mauritz, K. A. and Moore. R. B., 104, 4535-4585 (2004), presents a real implementation barrier for the use of NAFION\u00ae-based fuel cells at temperatures above the boiling point of water. Again, without being bound to any one particular theory, it is believed that the very high acid contents achievable in the presently disclosed liquid precursors to cross-linked PEMs results in a continuum of acid groups that are within proton hopping distances of each other. As such, protons can macroscopically transport through the film without the required water content associated with commercial grades of NAFION\u00ae or any other emerging PEM material that has equivalent weights>550.","In sum, the presently disclosed materials can be used in traditional electrochemical cell applications, such as automotive applications, as well as portable power, for example, for electronic devices. In some embodiments, the presently disclosed materials exhibit an improved mechanical stability at elevated temperatures. In some embodiments, the presently disclosed materials exhibit a decreased permeability for alkyl alcohols, such as methanol. In some embodiments, the presently disclosed materials provide an increased electrochemical cell performance at lower relative humidity and an increase in the hydrophilicity of the proton exchange membrane.","II.

Method for Preparing a Polymeric Electrolyte Comprising a Gradient of Equivalent Weights","Further, the synthetic methods of the liquid precursor materials disclosed herein can be varied to produce a gradient of compositions to tailor the properties and to improve the performance of the presently disclosed PEMs. Current PEMs typically comprise materials having one equivalent weight (EW), a property that results in a trade-off between power density and methanol permeability. For example, NAFION\u00ae-based high equivalent weight PEMs are less permeable to methanol. Such materials, however, exhibit a relatively low conductivity. Low EW PEMs give higher conductivity values relative to those with higher EW materials of comparable components, but allow for high methanol permeability, which results in a drastic decrease in power density.","The presently disclosed subject matter provides a PEM having a gradient of equivalent weights. With a gradient of EWs as disclosed herein, optimum performance in both areas (methanol permeability and conductivity) can be achieved. For example, the use of a material with a higher EW at the anode provides a PEM with a low methanol permeability, whereas inclusion of materials having a lower EW throughout the cross section of the PEM provides for a higher power density.","Referring now to , the preparation of a proton exchange membrane  with a plurality of liquid materials  is disclosed.

As used herein the term \u201cequivalent weight\u201d refers to the mass of an acidic material that contains one equivalent of acid functional groups. Thus, the equivalent weight of a polymeric electrolyte as disclosed herein is the number of acidic group equivalents in the polymeric electrolyte divided by the weight of the polymeric electrolyte. Further, as used herein, the term \u201cdifferent equivalent weight\u201d refers to an equivalent weight, e.g., EWthat varies about 50 g\/mol from another equivalent weight, e.g., EW. For example, an equivalent weight of about 800 would be considered to be different from an equivalent weight of about 750.","Referring again to , the liquid material closest in proximity to the anode , i.e., layer , has a higher EW as compared to liquid materials through .
