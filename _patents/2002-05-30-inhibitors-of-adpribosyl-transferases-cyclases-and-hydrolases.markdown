{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION","EXAMPLE","EXAMPLE SUMMARY"],"p":["This invention was made with government support under NIH Grant Nos. GM19335 and AI34342. As such, the United States government has certain rights in this invention.","(1) Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to inhibitors of ADP-ribosyl transferases, cyclases and hydrolases, and NAD-dependent deacetylases, including CD38. More specifically, the invention relates to improved inhibitors of those enzymes, where the inhibitors are designed according to the mechanism of the enzymes' action.","(2) Description of the Related Art","References Cited\n\n","CD38 is a membrane anchored homodimeric ectoenzyme common to a variety of immune cells (Jackson and Bell, 1990) and other tissues (Fernandez et al., 1998) including pancreas (Kato et al., 1995) kidney (Khoo and Chang, 2000) and brain (Mizuguchi et al., 1995). CD38 is homologous to BST-1 (Kaisho et al., 1994; Itoh et al., 1994), bone stromal cell antigen, and invertebrate ADP-ribosyl cyclases (Lee and Aarhus, 1991; States et al., 1992) and catalyzes the formation of cyclic-ADP-ribose (cADPR, Lee et al., 1994) from NAD (Scheme 1, Rusinke and Lee, 1989). cADPR is a potent second messenger that directly activates Carelease inside of cells via an IPindependent mechanism (Lee, 2001; Lee, 1995; Clapper et al., 1987) thought to be mediated by ryanodine receptors (Lee, 2001). Recent evidence indicates that cADPR and CD38 plays a crucial role in the human immune response by activation of the cell-mediated neutrophil response to bacterial infection (Partida-Sanchez et al., 2001) and associated inflammatory physiology (Id.; Normark et al., 2001). ADP-ribosyl-cyclase and cADPR signaling has also been demonstrated in plants as mediator of the abscisic acid activated stress response (Wu et al., 1997). \n","Not surprisingly, the ADP-ribosyl cyclases have been targets for inhibitor design (Sleath et al., 1991; Muller-Steffner et al., 1992; Bethelier et al., 1998; Wall et al., 1998; Sauve et al., 2000). Also, analogs of cADPR with antagonistic (Sato et al., 1999a; Sato et al., 1999b; Hara-Yokoyama et al., 2001; Walseth and Lee, 1993), or agonistic (Sethi et al., 1997; Walseth et al., 1993; Ashamu et al., 1997; Galione et al., 1997; Wong et al., 1999; Lee and Aarhus, 1998; Baily et al., 1996) properties have been reported. Most of the inhibitors and cADPR analogs are phosphorylated compounds (Lee, 2001), and have practical limitations affecting their use in whole cell or whole tissue investigations, because of the difficulty of passing charges across cell membranes (Id.). Although altered inhibitor structure to nucleosides could potentially make compounds more cell permeant, no reports of nucleoside-based CD38 or ADP-ribosyl-cyclase inhibitors have appeared.","In prior work, the mononucleotide ara-F-NMN was shown to be a potent inhibitor of CD38 with a Kvalue of 61 nM (Sauve et al., 2000). This Kis similar to the dinucleotide inhibitor ara-F-NAD (Sleath et al., 1991), where a Kvalue of 169 nM was reported (Muller-Steffner et al., 1992).","In other work, mechanism-based inhibitors of ADP-ribosyl transferases, cyclases and hydrolases, and NAD-dependent deacetylases were found to have several advantages to the above nucleotide-based inhibitors (U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/038,760, incorporated by reference in its entirety). Those inhibitors react rapidly to form a covalent intermediate that cannot cyclize and that are relatively stable to hydrolysis, thereby trapping the enzyme in a catalytically-inactive form. Further development of these mechanism-based inhibitors to provide highly stabile, potent inhibitors of ADP-ribosyl transferases, cyclases and hydrolases, and NAD-dependent deacetylases is desirable.","Accordingly, the inventors have discovered that providing an electron-contributing moiety to the leaving group of the mechanism-based inhibitors described in U.S. patent applicaton Ser. No. 10\/038,760 (the '760 application) greatly stabilizes the compounds to hydrolysis. The resulting improved inhibitors provide greater potential for therapeutic benefits, and provides improved reagents for studying ADP-ribosyl transferases, cyclases and hydrolases, and NAD-dependent deacetylases, including CD38.","Thus, in some embodiments, the present invention is directed to compounds represented by the formula: \n\n","In other embodiments, the invention is directed to methods for inhibiting an ADP-ribosyl transferase, ADP-ribosyl cyclase, ADP-ribosyl hydrolase or an NAD-dependent deacetylase enzyme. The methods comprise contacting the enzyme with an amount of the above compound of claim  effective to inhibit the enzyme.","Additionally, the invention is directed to methods for treating a disease or condition associated with an ADP-ribosyl transferase, ADP-ribosyl cyclase, ADP-ribosyl hydrolase, or NAD-dependent deacetylase enzyme in a subject in need of treatment thereof. These methods comprise administering to the subject the above-described inhibitor compound in an amount effective to treat the disease or condition.","The present invention provides improvements to the mechanism-based inhibitors of ADP-ribosyl cyclases, ADP-ribosyl hydrolases, ADP-ribosyl transferases, and NAD-dependent deacetylases first disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/038,760 (the '760 application). The improvements are based on the discovery that the stability of the inhibitors can be improved by substituting the leaving group of the inhibitors with an electron-contributing moiety. Without being limited to any particular mechanism for the improved stability, it is believed that the electron-contributing moiety improves stability of the inhibitors by causing a decrease in the hydrolysis of the leaving group from the rest of the inhibitor.","Thus, in one aspect, the present invention provides compounds having the formula: \n\nIn these embodiments, A is a nitrogen-, oxygen-, or sulfur-linked aryl, alkyl, cyclic, or heterocyclic group. The A moieties thus described have leaving group characteristics. In embodiments encompassed by the present invention, A is further substituted with an electron contributing moiety. Additionally, B and C are hydrogen, or either B or C is a halogen, amino, or thiol group and the other of B or C is hydrogen; and D is a primary alcohol, a hydrogen, or an oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, or sulfur linked to phosphate, a phosphoryl group, a pyrophosphoryl group, or adenosine monophosphate through a phosphodiester or carbon-, nitrogen-, or sulfur-substituted phosphodiester bridge, or to adenosine diphosphate through a phosphodiester or carbon-, nitrogen-, or sulfur-substituted pyrophosphodiester bridge.\n","Preferably, A is a substituted N-linked aryl or heterocyclic group, an O-linked aryl or heterocyclic group having the formula \u2014O\u2014Y, or an S-linked aryl or heterocyclic group having the formula \u2014O\u2014Y; both B and C are hydrogen, or either B or C is a halogen, amino, or thiol group and the other of B or C is hydrogen; and D is a primary alcohol or hydrogen. Nonlimiting preferred examples of A are set forth in Table 1, where each R is H or an electron-contributing moiety and Z is an alkyl, aryl, hydroxyl, OZ\u2032 where Z\u2032 is an alkyl or aryl, amino, NHZ\u2032 where Z\u2032 is an alkyl or aryl, or NHZ\u2032Z\u2033 where Z\u2032 and Z\u2033 are independently an alkyl or aryl.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0078"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"right"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00005","num":"00005"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00005","he":"24.89mm","wi":"26.92mm","file":"US07022680-20060404-C00005.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}},"i."]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":[{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00006","num":"00006"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00006","he":"24.89mm","wi":"21.93mm","file":"US07022680-20060404-C00006.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}},"ii."]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":[{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00007","num":"00007"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00007","he":"24.89mm","wi":"21.93mm","file":"US07022680-20060404-C00007.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}},"iii."]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":[{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00008","num":"00008"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00008","he":"24.89mm","wi":"16.93mm","file":"US07022680-20060404-C00008.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}},"iv."]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":[{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00009","num":"00009"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00009","he":"24.89mm","wi":"12.28mm","file":"US07022680-20060404-C00009.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}},"v."]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":[{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00010","num":"00010"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00010","he":"24.89mm","wi":"18.71mm","file":"US07022680-20060404-C00010.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}},"vi."]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":[{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00011","num":"00011"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00011","he":"22.27mm","wi":"21.25mm","file":"US07022680-20060404-C00011.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}},"vii."]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":[{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00012","num":"00012"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00012","he":"20.24mm","wi":"26.75mm","file":"US07022680-20060404-C00012.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}},"viii."]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"More preferably, A is a substituted nicotinamide group (Table 1, i, where Z is H), a substituted pyrazolo group (Table 1, vii), or a substituted 3-carboxamid-imidazolo group (Table 1, viii, where Z is H). Additionally, preferably, both B and C are hydrogen, or either B or C is a halogen, amino, or thiol group and the other of B or C is hydrogen; and D is a primary alcohol or hydrogen.","Without being bound to any particular mechanism, it is believed that the electron-contributing moiety on A stabilizes the compounds of the invention such that they are less susceptible to hydrolysis from the rest of the compound. For example, the compound \u03b2-1\u2032-5-methyl-nicotinamide-2\u2032-deoxyribose (established as an effective inhibitor of CD38 in the Example) was compared with \u03b2-1\u2032-nicotinamide-2\u2032-deoxyribose in its ability to resist solution hydrolysis. The measured rate constant for solution hydrolysis (10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, 25\u00b0 C.) of \u03b2-1\u2032-nicotinamide-2\u2032-deoxyribose was 9.6\u00d710swhereas the rate of solution hydrolysis of \u03b2-1\u2032-5-methyl-nicotinamide-2\u2032-deoxyribose was measured at 1.5\u00d710s, demonstrating that the methyl group on the nicotinamide-2\u2032-deoxyriboside caused a decrease in the rate of hydrolysis by a factor of 6. This difference in chemical stability means that \u03b2-1\u2032-nicotinamide-2\u2032-deoxyribose is 50% depleted from solution in 2 hours, whereas \u03b2-1\u2032-5-methyl-nicotinamide-2\u2032-deoxyribose is not hydrolyzed by 50% until 12 hours. This improved chemical stability improves the value of the compound, since it is available for action for longer periods of time in biological systems due to resistance to hydrolytic breakdown.","The skilled artisan could envision many electron-contributing moieties that would be expected to serve this stabilizing function. Nonlimiting examples of suitable electron contributing moieties are methyl, ethyl, O-methyl, amino, NMe, hydroxyl, CMe, aryl and alkyl groups. Preferably, the electron-contributing moiety is a methyl, ethyl, O-methyl, amino group. In the most preferred embodiments, the electron-contributing moiety is a methyl group.","It is also preferred that, in addition to the electron-contributing moiety, the A group also comprises a carboxamid (CONH) group, as in nicotinamide, as it is believed that the carboxamid group improves the ability of the compound to be inhibitory to ADP-ribosyl cyclases, ADP-ribosyl hydrolases, ADP-ribosyl transferases, and\/or NAD-dependent deacetylases, such as CD38.","In some embodiments, A has two or more electron contributing moieties.","Some preferred examples of the compounds of the invention are provided as compounds I, II, and III below. \n\nwherein Z is an alkyl, aryl, hydroxyl, OZ\u2032 where Z\u2032 is an alkyl or aryl, amino, NHZ\u2032 where Z\u2032 is an alkyl or aryl, or NHZ\u2032Z\u2033 where Z\u2032 and Z\u2033 are independently an alkyl or aryl; E and F are independently H, CH, OCH, CHCH, NH, OH, NHCOH, NHCOCH, N(CH), C(CH), an aryl or a C3\u2013C10 alkyl, preferably provided that, when either of E or F is H, the other of E or F is not H; \n\nwherein G, J or K is CONHZ, Z is an alkyl, aryl, hydroxyl, OZ\u2032 where Z\u2032 is an alkyl or aryl, amino, NHZ\u2032 where Z\u2032 is an alkyl or aryl, or NHZ\u2032Z\u2033 where Z\u2032 and Z\u2033 are independently an alkyl or aryl, and the other two of G, J and K is independently CH, OCH, CHCH, NH, OH, NHCOH, NHCOCH; \n\nwherein Z is an alkyl, aryl, hydroxyl, OZ\u2032 where Z\u2032 is an alkyl or aryl, amino, NHZ\u2032 where Z\u2032 is an alkyl or aryl, or NHZ\u2032Z\u2033 where Z\u2032 and Z\u2033 are independently an alkyl or aryl; and L is CH, OCH, CHCH, NH, OH, NHCOH, NHCOCH.\n","In more preferred embodiments, the compound is formula I above, wherein E and F are independently H, CH, OCH, or OH, preferably provided that, when either of E or F is H, the other of E or F is not H.","In even more preferred embodiments, the compound is \u03b2-1\u2032-5-methyl-nicotinamide-2\u2032-deoxyribose, \u03b2-D-1\u2032-5-methyl-nicotinamide-2\u2032-deoxyribofuranoside, \u03b2-1\u2032-4,5-dimethyl-nicotinamide-2\u2032-deoxyribose or \u03b2-D-1\u2032-4,5-dimethyl-nicotinamide-2\u2032-deoxyribofuranoside.","In the most preferred embodiment, the compound is \u03b2-1\u2032-5-methyl-nicotinamide-2\u2032-deoxyribose.","Preferably, the compounds of the present invention are inhibitors of ADP-ribosyl cyclases, ADP-ribosyl hydrolases, ADP-ribosyl transferases, and\/or NAD-dependent deacetylases, such as CD38. See Example.","Even though it is preferred that the compounds are inhibitors of ADP-ribosyl cyclases, ADP-ribosyl hydrolases, ADP-ribosyl transferases, and\/or NAD-dependent deacetylases, the forms of the compounds that are not inhibitors are also useful, for example as a negative control in studies of the effectiveness of the inhibitor for therapeutic purposes.","Methods for determining the inhibitory activity of any particular compound are routine. Inhibitory activity of the compounds disclosed herein can be determined by standard assays known in the art. For example, the enzyme may be incubated with the inhibitor and a substrate of the enzyme, and absorbance then may be monitored, as described below. Additionally, the enzyme may be incubated with a radioactive inhibitor, and radiochemical measurements of reaction rates may be taken, as described below. Slow-onset inhibitor binding may be determined using methods such as those described in Merkler et al., 1990.","Molecules of the novel class of mechanism-based inhibitors disclosed herein accomplish mechanism-based trapping at the catalytic site of their target enzymes. The inhibitor is designed to react rapidly to form a covalent intermediate that cannot cyclize and that is relatively stable to hydrolysis, thereby trapping the enzyme in a catalytically-inactive form. For example, as elaborated in the Example, the novel inhibitor \u03b2-D-1\u2032-5-methyl-nicotinamide-2\u2032-deoxyribose acts as a reversible competitive inhibitor (K=4.0 \u03bcM) of CD38, and is followed by slow-onset inactivation of the enzyme. Inactivated enzyme is covalently modified by the deoxyriboside. Active CD38 is slowly regenerated by hydrolysis in the absence of added substrates, and is rapidly regenerated in the presence of excess nicotinamide. These properties of inhibitor action give rise to an effective inhibition constant of 12.5 nM. This novel class of mechanism based inhibitors has potential for the regulation of cyclic ADP-ribose levels through CD38, and provides new tools for investigating the various pathways in which ADP-ribosyl transferases, cyclases, and hydrolases, and NAD-dependent deacetylases have been implicated.","The compounds of the present invention are useful both in free form and in the form of salts. The term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salts\u201d is intended to apply to non-toxic salts derived from inorganic or organic acids and includes, for example, salts derived from the following acids: hydrochloric, sulfuric, phosphoric, acetic, lactic, fumaric, succinic, tartaric, gluconic, citric, methanesulfonic, and p-toluenesulfonic acids.","Also provided are compounds that are the tautomers, pharmaceutically-acceptable salts, esters, and pro-drugs of the inhibitor compounds disclosed herein.","The biological availability of the compounds of the invention can be enhanced by conversion into a pro-drug form. Such a pro-drug can have improved lipophilicity relative to the unconverted compound, and this can result in enhanced membrane permeability. One particularly useful form of pro-drug is an ester derivative. Its utility relies upon the action of one or more of the ubiquitous intracellular lipases to catalyse the hydrolysis of ester groups, to release the active compound at or near its site of action. In one form of pro-drug, one or more hydroxy groups in the compound can be O-acylated, to make an acylate derivative.","Pro-drug forms of a 5-phosphate ester derivative of compounds of the compounds of the present invention can also be made. These may be particularly useful, since the anionic nature of the 5-phosphate may limit its ability to cross cellular membranes. Conveniently, such a 5-phosphate derivative can be converted to an uncharged bis(acyloxymethyl) ester derivative. The utility of such a pro-drug relies upon the action of one or more of the ubiquitous intracellular lipases to catalyse the hydrolysis of ester groups, releasing a molecule of formaldehyde and a compound of the present invention at or near its site of action. Specific examples of the utility of, and general methods for making, such acyloxymethyl ester pro-drug forms of phosphorylated carbohydrate derivatives have been described (Kang et al., 1998; Jiang et al., 1998; Li et al., 1997; Kruppa et al., 1997).","In another aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition, comprising a pharmaceutically effective amount of an inhibitor compound of the first aspect of the invention. The inhibitor compound may be chosen from any of those described above. Preferably, the pharmaceutical composition comprises an inhibitor compound chosen from the preferred compounds described above.","In the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention, the pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier must be \u201cacceptable\u201d in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the composition, and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. Examples of acceptable pharmaceutical carriers include carboxymethyl cellulose, crystalline cellulose, glycerin, gum arabic, lactose, magnesium stearate, methyl cellulose, powders, saline, sodium alginate, sucrose, starch, talc, and water, among others. Formulations of the pharmaceutical composition may be conveniently presented in unit dosage.","The formulations of the present invention may be prepared by methods well-known in the pharmaceutical art. For example, the inhibitor compound may be brought into association with a carrier or diluent, as a suspension or solution. Optionally, one or more accessory ingredients (e.g., buffers, flavoring agents, surface active agents, and the like) also may be added. The choice of carrier will depend upon the route of administration. The pharmaceutical composition would be useful for administering the inhibitor composition of the present invention to a subject to treat a disease or condition associated with an ADP-ribosyl transferase, ADP-ribosyl cyclase, ADP-ribosyl hydrolase, or NAD-dependent deacetylase enzyme, including any of those described above. The inhibitor compound is provided in an amount that is effective to treat a disease or condition associated with an ADP-ribosyl transferase, ADP-ribosyl cyclase, ADP-ribosyl hydrolase, or NAD-dependent deacetylase enzyme in the subject. That amount may be readily determined by the skilled artisan, as described above.","According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for inhibiting an ADP-ribosyl transferase, ADP-ribosyl cyclase, ADP-ribosyl hydrolase, or NAD-dependent deacetylase enzyme. As used herein, \u201cADP-ribosyl transferase\u201d refers to those enzymes which catalyze the transfer of ADP-ribose (adenosine 5\u2033-diphospho-5\u2032-\u03b1-D-ribose) from NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) to acceptor groups that are chemically reactive as nucleophiles, as well as enzymes that share catalytic site homology with such enzymes. The acceptor groups include the nucleophilic groups of proteins, nucleic acids, sugars, and lipids. Biologically reactive nucleophiles also include other metabolites containing carboxyl groups, amino groups, guanidinium groups, thiol groups, and nitrogens of aromatic or aliphatic compounds, as well as other groups chemically recognized as having nucleophilic character. The ADP-ribosyl transferase family of enzymes produces ADP-ribosylated proteins, ADP-ribosylated nucleic acids, ADP-ribosylated sugars, sugar polymers in homo- or hetero-polymeric forms, glycoproteins, ADP-ribosylated lipids, and ADP-ribosylated compounds of cellular metabolism. Compounds of cellular metabolism include carboxylic acids, sugars, amino acids, lipids, nucleotides, nucleosides, vitamins, and intermediates in the biochemical pathways that synthesize these compounds of cellular metabolism.","As used herein, \u201cADP-ribosyl cyclase\u201d includes those enzymes that catalyze the conversion of NAD to ADP-ribose (adenosine 5\u2033-diphospho-5\u2032-\u03b1-D-ribose), in which reaction a chemical bond between carbon 1\u2032 of the \u03b1-D-ribose group of NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) is transferred to any nucleophilic acceptor group within the same ADP-ribose molecule, thereby forming a cyclic ring system not existing in the parent molecule of NAD. Also included are enzymes that share catalytic site homology with such ADP-ribosyl cyclase enzymes. Nucleophilic acceptor groups include nitrogen and oxygen groups of the parent NAD molecule (e.g., the structure of cyclic-ADP-ribose, in which the carbon 1\u2032 of the \u03b1-D-ribose group of NAD is cyclized to nitrogen 1\u2032 of the adenine ring to form a new cyclic ring).","Additionally, as used herein, \u201cADP-ribosyl hydrolase\u201d refers to those enzymes that catalyze the transfer of ADP-ribose (adenosine 5\u2033-diphospho-5\u2032-\u03b1-D-ribose) from NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) in the formation of ADP-ribose or cyclic-ADP-ribose. \u201cADP-ribosyl hydrolase\u201d, as used herein, also includes enzymes that catalyze the removal of ADP-ribose, in a hydrolytic reaction, from the ADP-ribosylated groups that are chemically reactive as nucleophiles, defined above. Also included are enzymes that share catalytic site homology with such ADP-ribosyl hydrolase enzymes. ADP-ribosylated groups that are chemically reactive as nucleophiles include the groups of ADP-ribosylated-proteins, ADP-ribosylated-nucleic acids, ADP-ribosylated-sugars, and ADP-ribosylated-lipids from the covalent ADP-ribose. Biologically reactive groups removed from ADP-ribose by hydrolysis may also include biological metabolites containing ADP-ribosylated-carboxyl groups, ADP-ribosylated-amino groups, ADP-ribosylated-guanidinium groups, ADP-ribosylated-thiol groups, ADP-ribosylated-nitrogens of aromatic or aliphatic compounds, and other ADP-ribosylated groups chemically recognized as having nucleophilic character. This family of hydrolases regenerates proteins from ADP-ribosylated proteins, nucleic acids from ADP-ribosylated nucleic acids, sugars from ADP-ribosylated sugars, sugar polymers in homo- or hetero-polymeric forms from their ADP-ribosylated states, and glycoproteins from ADP-ribosylated glycoproteins, lipids from ADP-ribosylated lipids, and removes ADP-ribose from ADP-ribosylated compounds of cellular metabolism. Compounds of cellular metabolism include carboxylic acids, sugars, amino acids, lipids, nucleotides, nucleosides, vitamins, and intermediates in the biochemical pathways that synthesize these biological metabolites.","Examples of ADP-ribosyl transferases, cyclases, and hydrolases, and NAD-dependent deacetylases include, without limitation, NAD-dependent deacetylases involved in the regulation of gene expression (e.g., SIR family enzymes and their homologues, human CD38, the human ADP-ribosyl cyclase, invertebrate and plant ADP-ribosyl cyclases [e.g., ADP ribosyl-cyclase], and human bone stromal cell antigen [humBST1]). Preferably, the enzyme of the present invention is CD38.","The method for inhibiting an ADP-ribosyl transferase, ADP-ribosyl cyclase, ADP-ribosyl hydrolase, or NAD-dependent deacetylase comprises contacting an ADP-ribosyl transferase, ADP-ribosyl cyclase, ADP-ribosyl hydrolase, or NAD-dependent deacetylase enzyme with one of the previously described inhibitor compounds or their pharmaceutically-acceptable salts in an amount effective to inhibit the enzyme. The ADP-ribosyl transferase, ADP-ribosyl cyclase, ADP-ribosyl hydrolase, or NAD-dependent deacetylase enzyme may include any of those described above (e.g., ADP-ribosyl-transferases involved in the regulation of gene expression (e.g., SIR family enzymes and their homologues), human CD38, the human ADP-ribosyl cyclase, invertebrate and plant ADP-ribosyl cyclases (e.g., ADP ribosyl-cyclase), and human bone stromal cell antigen (humBST1)). In a preferred embodiment, the enzyme is CD38. Preferably, the inhibitor is one of the preferred inhibitors previously described, in a pharmaceutical composition.","As used herein, an \u201camount effective to inhibit the enzyme\u201d refers to an amount that disables, disrupts, or inactivates the function of the enzyme.

Here we establish that mechanism-based inhibitors can be produced by chemical stabilization of this intermediate. The compounds nicotinamide-2\u2032-deoxyriboside (1), 5-methyl-nicotinamide-2\u2032-deoxyriboside (2) and pyridyl-2\u2032-deoxyriboside (3) () were synthesized and evaluated as inhibitors for human CD38. The nicotinamide derivatives 1 and 2 were inhibitors of the enzyme as determined by competitive behavior in CD38 catalyzed conversion of nicotinamide guanine dinucleotide (NGD) to cyclic-GDP-ribose. The Kvalues for competitive inhibition were 1.2 \u03bcM and 4.0 \u03bcM for 1 and 2 respectively. Slow-onset characteristics of reaction progress curves indicated a second higher affinity state of these two inhibitors. Inhibitor off-rates were slow with rate constants kof 1.5\u00d710sfor 1 and 2.5\u00d710sfor 2. Apparent dissociation constants Kfor 1 and 2 were calculated to be 4.5 and 12.5 nM respectively. The similar values for kare consistent with the hydrolysis of common enzymatic intermediates formed by the reaction of 1 and 2 with the enzyme. Both form covalently attached deoxy-ribose groups to the catalytic site nucleophile. Chemical evidence for this intermediate is the ability of nicotinamide to rescue enzyme activity after inactivation by either 1 or 2. A covalent intermediate is also indicated by the ability of CD38 to catalyze base exchange, as observed by converion of 2 to 1 in the presence of nicotinamide. The deoxynucleosides 1 and 2 demonstrate that the chemical determinants for mechanism-based inhibition of CD38 can be satisfied by nucleosides that lack the 5\u2032-phosphate, the adenylate group and the 2\u2032-hydroxyl moiety. In addition, these compounds reveal the mechanism of CD38 catalysis to proceed by the formation of a covalent intermediate during normal catalytic turnover with faster substrates. The covalent 2\u2032-deoxynucleoside inactivators of CD38 are powerful inhibitors by acting as good substrates for formation of the covalent intermediate but are poor leaving groups from the intermediate complex because hydrolytic assistance of the 2\u2032-hydroxyl group is lacking. The removal of the adenylate nucleophile required for the cyclization reaction provides slow hydrolysis as the only exit from the covalent complex.","Methods","Reagents for chemical synthesis were obtained from commercial vendors and were used as received.

A similar reaction containing 40 \u03bcM NGD at several concentrations of 2 was also performed (). Initial rates of reaction showed inhibition of CD38 cyclase activity by 2 with a Kof 4.0\u00b10.5 \u03bcM. Reaction mixtures containing 3, the \u03b1 isomer of 1, or the \u03b1 isomer of 2 did not inhibit CD38 conversion of NGD to cGDPR even at millimolar concentrations of these compounds (data not shown). \n","Slow Phase Inhibition. Reaction progress curves of CD38 activity in reaction mixtures containing the inhibitors 1 and 2 showed not only initial rate inhibition but a second phase of slow-onset inhibition indicated by slopes declining monotonically over time as seen in  and . This slow phase was not due to substrate depletion and was attributable to a kinetic process leading to progressive inhibition of the enzyme. The \u201cslow-onset\u201d absorbance curves could be fit using the equation A=vt+(v\u2212v)(1\u2212exp(\u2212kt))\/k+Awhere Ais absorbance, vis initial velocity, vis final velocity, t is time in s, k is the rate of the slow onset process and Ais absorbance of the sample at initial time. These fits are shown by the solid lines in  and . The rate constant for the slow phase could be obtained from the average value of k determined from the separate fits. The value of k for 1 was determined to be 0.0042\u00b10.001 sand the value of k for 2 was determined to be 0.0083\u00b10.002 s. The parameter k is defined as kin Scheme 5. \n","Recovery from Inhibition. To fully characterize the inhibition of 1 and 2 against CD38, determinations of the inhibitor off-rates were needed. The inhibitor off-rate provides the final parameter in the equation k\/k*K=Kwhich is valid for the kinetic scheme of slow-onset inhibition shown in Scheme 5. This rate was obtained by a recovery protocol in which inhibited CD38 enzyme (by either 1 or 2) was added to a 200 \u03bcM solution of NGD. The solution 295 nm absorbance is monitored spectrophotometrically to assay conversion of NGD to cGDPR as a consequence of regain of CD38 catlytic activity. Typical curves obtained are shown in . The top curve shows product formation a control reaction using uninhibited CD38 and the bottom curve shows slow recovery of activity of inhibited enzyme versus time. The absorbance curves with the same equation used for slow-onset: A=vt+(v\u2212v)(1\u2212exp(\u2212kt))\/k+Awhere Ais absorbance, vis initial velocity, vis final velocity, t is time in s, k is the rate of the recovery rate constant and Ais the absorbance of the sample at initial time. The rate constant for the recovery phase was obtained from the average value of k determined from the separate fits. The value of kfor 1 was determined to be 1.5\u00d710sand for 2 was determined to be 2.5\u00d710S.","Calculation of Total Inhibition. Inhibition of CD38 by compounds 1 and 2 could be fully described by the equation k\/k*K=Kfor the reactions described by Scheme 5; where Kis the effective dissociation constant between free CD38 and the fully inhibited complex. This equation is valid for slow onset behavior inhibitors and also mechanistic based inactivators of enzymes where a slow recovery of the enzyme from chemical inactivation is present. Using the kinetic parameters in Table 2 the value for Kis 4.5 nM for inhibitor 1. Similarly, a value for Kof 12.5 nM was calculated for inhibitor 2.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0090","num":"0140"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 2"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Linetic and equilibrium parameters for inhibitors 1 and 2."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Parameter","1","2"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["K","1.2 \u03bcM","\u20024.0 \u03bcM"]},{"entry":["k","4.2 \u00d7 10s","8.3 \u00d7 10s"]},{"entry":["k","1.5 \u00d7 10s","2.5 \u00d7 10s"]},{"entry":["K","4.5 nM","12.5 nM"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}},"br":{},"sub":["i(total) ","i(total)","off","on","i"]},"Nature of Inhibition in Slow Phase: Rescue by Base Addition. Our prior investigations of the nature of inhibition of CD38 by ara-F-NMN showed it to be governed by both competitive and slow-onset characteristics (Sauve et al., 2000). The slow onset behavior was shown to be a consequence of covalent trapping of the catalytic nucleophile (Glu226) by the ara-F-sugar with nicotinamide leaving group departure. By analogy, the slow-onset inhibition of deoxy-nucleosides 1 and 2 is proposed to proceed via deoxyribose sugar transfer to the catalytic nucleophile. To test this hypothesis, additional chemical methods were used to examine the scheme of inactivation shown in Scheme 6. \n","According to Scheme 6, recovery of enzymatic activity occurs via slow hydrolysis of the covalent intermediate to form deoxyribose and free enzyme. If the covalent intermediate is the normal catalytic reaction path, the enzyme catalytic activity should also be recovered from inhibition by reaction with a substrate nucleophile, such as nicotinamide (Scheme 7). The rate and equilibrium of the reaction will establish the thermodynamic equilibrium of these species. For favorable equilibria, addition of product pyridine bases should permit base-exchange reactions that will rapidly regenerate active enzyme. \n","Rescue of activity by substrate nucleophiles has been used as a test of the covalent mechanism in the ara-F-NMN inactivation of CD38, with rescue by nicotinamide (Sauve et al., 2000), and has been observed in the covalent inactivation of adenosine nucleoside transferase (36) and other covalently inactivated glycosyl transferases (Withers, 2000). Here, the rescue experiment involved preincubation of CD38 with the inhibitor 2 followed by reaction of enzyme with a 300 \u03bcM solution of NGD containing different concentrations of nicotinamide as a regenerating base. A stopped flow, two syringe fitted spectrophotometer was used to perform the experiments. The fluorescence of cGDPR was measured as a function of time to generate curves that contain an exponential and a linear phase prior to substrate exhaustion. These curves were fit to the equation F=vt+(v\u2212v)(1\u2212exp (\u2212kt))\/k+Fas previously defined. The rate constant kwas plotted against the nicotinamide concentration to obtain a saturation curve with an apparent Kvalue for nicotinamide of 2.4 mM and a maximum rate of 0.023 s(). The limiting value of kas nicotinamide concentration is increased indicates equilibrium binding of nicotinamide at the active site prior to chemical reaction. Therefore, the Krepresents an accurate measurement of Kfor nicotinamide for the covalent form of the enzyme. Similar saturation curves have been reported for the rescue behavior of adenine on 2\u2032-fluoro-adenosine inactivation of adenosine nucleoside transferase (Porter et al., 1995) and for nicotinamide rescue of CD38 from ara-F-NMN inactivation (Sauve et al., 2000).","Base exchange reaction. The nicotinamide rescue of CD38 enzymatic activity inhibited by 2 completes a catalytic cycle that is proposed to effect base exchange of 2 to form 1. The rescue reaction is the second-half of the normal reaction cycle of the base-exchange reaction catalyzed by CD38, and inactivation of CD38 by 2 is the first half. This hypothesis was tested by incubation of 75 \u03bcM 2, with varying concentrations of nicotinamide in the presence of 1 \u03bcM CD38 and the reactions monitored by HPLC.  shows that CD38 catalyzes the conversion of 2 to 1 under these conditions. The peak at 8 minutes elutes identically with authentic 1. The rates of these reactions could be monitored by multiple autosampler driven injections and the rates of conversion plotted against nicotinamide concentration. The points were fit using the Michaelis-Menten equation () to obtain a Kof 0.92 mM for nicotinamide and a kof 0.007 s. The observed kvalue is within experimental error of the rate of inactivation (k, 0.008 s, Scheme 5) of CD38 by 2 measured at the same temperature. This result establishes that the rate of intermediate formation is rate-limiting in the catalytic cycle of Scheme 7. The greater than two-fold lower Kfor steady state base exchange (0.92 mM) versus the apparent Kfor nicotinamide rescue (2.4 mM) suggests that sub-maximal base binding to the nicotinamide binding pocket during steady state conditions is sufficient to maintain the maximum turnover rate. This notion is supported by the rate constant for formation of the covalent intermediate (k=0.008 s) and the rate constant for the base reaction step (k=0.023 s) measured independently.","Titration of Enzyme with [2\u2032-H]Inhibitor. CD38 inactivation was accomplished using a radiolabeled inhibitor to assess inhibitor interactions with the enzyme independent from inhibition of the catalytic activity. This method allows the determination of the stoichiometry of covalent labeling, and detects cooperativity at multiple sites. The labeling characteristics of CD38 show that it is labeled by 1 in a process governed by a single rate constant with a value of k0.01 sat 25\u00b0 C. () within reasonable agreement with the rate constant for inactivation in kinetic assays of inhibition (k=0.0042 sat 19\u00b0 C.). The extent of labeling does not change after the first 20 minutes of incubation time, which indicates that there is no non-specific labeling of the enzyme by the inhibitor. According to specific activity measurements and protein concentration, the labeling is 1:1 versus CD38 monomer concentration. This result is similar to what was observed with CD38 inhibition by ara-F-NMN (Sauve et al., 2000).","Discussion","Deoxyriboside nicotinamide derivatives bind to the catalytic sites of CD38 with higher binding affinity than the natural substrate, NAD. 1 has a binding constant of 1.2 \u03bcM and 2 has a binding constant of 4 \u03bcM. In comparison the Kfor dinucleotide and mononucleotide substrates is 150 \u03bcM for NMN (Sauve et al., 1998) 15 \u03bcM for NAD and 2.5 \u03bcM for NGD. Based on these comparisons, it is apparent that truncation of structure does not necessarily weaken binding. Inhibition of CD38 by the deoxynucleoside compounds 1 and 2 is not only competitive, but is characterized by a second kinetic phase of inhibition marked by enhanced affinity of the inhibitor for the enzyme with rates of onset of 0.004 sfor 1 and 0.008 sfor 2. Recovery of the enzyme from the second phase of binding is quite slow, on the order of 2\u00d710sat 19 \u00b0 C., and was similar within experimental error for both 1 and 2. By use of the equation for slow onset inhibitors, Kk\/k=K, the enhanced binding leads to inhibition values of 4.5 nM for inhibition of CD38 by 1 and 12.5 nM by 2. These inhibition constants are lower than any known CD38 inhibitors and confirm that highly abbreviated structures can rapidly and potently inhibit ADP-ribosyl cyclase enzymes. The magnitude of the rate constants for inactivation (k) show that tight inhibition can be achieved within minutes at physiological temperatures.","The nature of the slow-phase process leading to formation of the tight complex in Scheme 5 is proposed to be the covalent modification of the enzyme by inhibitor via attachment of the deoxyribose sugar to the enzyme catalytic nucleophile as shown in Scheme 6. A previous example of covalent modification of CD38 revealed that the inhibitor ara-F-NMN forms a stable ara-F-ribose-5-phosphate ester with Glu226 (Sauve et al., 2000). MS studies confirmed the identity of this acid as the catalytic nucleophile. This residue is universally conserved across all ADP-ribosyl cyclase sequences, and has been mutagenized with ablation of catalytic activity for CD38 (Munshi et al., 1999). The covalent modification was shown to be reversible, and nicotinamide additions to the trapped enzyme recover catalytic activity and reform ara-F-NMN. Moreover, CD38 catalyzes base exchange using ara-F-NMN as a substrate.","Similar behaviors were observed for inhibited CD38 treated with the deoxy-inhibitors 1 and 2. For instance, when fully inhibited CD38 enzyme (by either 1 or 2) was treated with millimolar concentrations of nicotinamide, recovery of catalytic activity was observed, with a rate of recovery dependent on nicotinamide concentration. The recovery rate reached a saturable maximum versus nicotinamide concentration. Rate saturation for recovery has also been observed in previous studies of covalent intermediates and the apparent Kappears to reflect the binding affinity of the rescue nucleophile within the active site. This value was found to be 17 mM for ara-F-NMN rescue by nicotinamide (Sauve et al., 2000), and the 2.4 mM value for rescue from the deoxyribose intermediate indicates that nicotinamide binding is tighter in the covalent complex formed by deoxy-ribose modification of CD38.","Scheme 7 shows inactivation and recovery as two mechanistic steps in a catalytic cycle that leads to inhibitor base exchange. Incubations of 2 with nicotinamide confirmed that CD38 catalyzes base exchange to form 1 and 5-methyl-nicotinamide. HPLC analysis was used to monitor the kinetics of base exchange because 1 is readily separated from 2 and base exchange is fairly slow. The Kof nicotinamide for base exchange is 0.92 mM and the kis 0.007 sat 19\u00b0 C. The value of Kfor base exchange (0.92 mM) is significantly lower than the value for the apparent Kfor base rescue (2.4 mM) of CD38 activity from inhibition by 2. However, the rate of rescue saturates at 0.024 s, suggesting the lower Kfor exchange takes its origin from chemistry of covalent modification of the enzyme being rate limiting in the catalytic cycle, and because full site binding by base is unnecessary to maintain the steady state rate in the second reaction of base exchange. Thus, the rate of turnover of base exchange matches the rate of slow-phase inhibitor inactivation by 2, which has the value 0.008 s.","Radiochemical titrations of enzyme with [2\u2032-H]-1 confirm that labeling reaches maximum with a rate constant of 0.01 sand extended incubations do not increase radiochemical labeling. The extent of labeling is consistent with a ratio of inhibitor to subunit of 1:1. These measurements confirm that covalent modification is a specific process and is due to the covalent modification of the catalytic nucleophile responsible for catalysis with faster substrates.","The effectiveness of deoxy-nucleosides as trapping agents for CD38 is in contrast to chemical stability profiles. 2\u2032-Deoxy derivatives are intrinsically more labile to uncatalyzed solvolysis reactions than the corresponding ribose derivatives, and even more unstable than 2\u2032-fluorine substituted derivatives (Oppenhemer and Handlon, 1992). Trapping of covalent intermediates on nucleoside and glycosyl transferase enzymes has been successful in a number of cases by the introduction of 2\u2032-fluorine (Sauve et al., 2000; Porter et al., 1995; Withers, 2000), because of the electronic destabilization of the cationic charge that builds up at the anomeric carbon in transition states common to nucleoside and glycosyl transfer reactions. The increase in energy of these transition states retards breakdown of trapped intermediates (Withers, 2000). In examination of the rate of turnover of NMN versus ara-F-NMN on CD38 it was intriguing to note the ratio of the rates of turnover of CD38 covalent intermediates was on the order of 10at 37\u00b0 C. (Sauve et al., 2000; Withers, 2000) which did not match the ratio of their uncatalyzed solvolysis rates, which was measured to be 30:1 at the same temperature (Oppenhemer and Handlon, 1992). This suggested that slow turnover of fluorine substituted intermediates by CD38 took most of its origin from removal of the 2\u2032-OH group and not from an electronic effect contributed by fluorine.","The results of this study strongly corroborate this viewpoint. In this case removal of the 2\u2032-OH and replacement with a hydrogen atom in conjunction with removal of the 5\u2032-phosphate group leads to efficient formation of the covalent intermediate but inefficient hydrolytic turnover of this species, leading to effective trapping and inhibition of the enzyme. The role of the 2\u2032-OH in catalysis is suggested by the proximity it normally has to the Glu226 leaving group which departs the sugar in intermediate breakdown. Both share the alpha face of the sugar and proton transfer to the Glu residue during catalytic turnover may be mediated in part by the 2\u2032-OH. The proposed protonation state of the catalytic Glu during catalysis is indicated in Scheme 6. Although this rationale deserves additional investigation a strong Glu \u22122\u2032OH interaction has been proposed as a part of NAD glycohydrolase function (Oppenhemer and Handlon, 1992) and has recently been revealed crystallographically in the enzyme BST-1 (Yamamoto-Katayama et al., 2002).","Trapping efficiency can also improve from the lack of the ADP group in inhibitors 1 and 2. The nucleoside structure lacks the adenylate of the normal NAD substrate thus precluding the normal cyclization pathway inherent to dinucleotide substrates. The absence of a reasonable nucleophile for an escape from the intermediate complex via the intramolecular route leaves hydrolysis as the only remaining escape pathway.","In conclusion, deoxynucleosides are effective mechanism based inhibitors of CD38 through formation of a covalent intermediate that has been identified as part of the normal reaction coordinate of CD38 catalysis. A variety of techniques establish that this inactivation is specific to a single reactive moiety on the enzyme, which is catalytically competent to support the base exchange mechanism inherent to CD38 catalysis with faster substrates. These compounds lack phosphate groups, have nanomolar binding affinity for CD38 enzymes, inactivate within minutes at room temperature and have slow recovery rates, suggesting that these derivatives may be effective probes of CD38 biochemical action in cells and tissues.","In view of the above, it will be seen that the several advantages of the invention are achieved and other advantages attained.","As various changes could be made in the above methods and compositions without departing from the scope of the invention, it is intended that all matter contained in the above description and shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense.","All references cited in this specification are hereby incorporated by reference.
