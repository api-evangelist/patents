title: Infrared camera deployed by grenade launcher
abstract: A projectile in a cartridge designed to be launched from a grenade launcher. The projectile is adapted to be secured to the housing of the cartridge. The projectile includes a camera contained in the projectile body and connected thereto by a cord, and a transmitter contained in the projectile body and connected to the camera. In addition, the projectile includes elements for pinning the front part of the projectile body to a target, and elements for separating the front part of the projectile body from the back part of the projectile body and expelling the camera from the projectile body when the projectile is pinned to the target so that the camera is freely suspended from the projectile by the cord and can rotate in a wind through 180 degrees to observe its surroundings and transmit images thereof.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, sold, imported, and\/or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America.","This invention relates in general to surveillance systems, and more particularly, to surveillance camera systems.","In the past, cameras have been located at remote sites for surveillance purposes. Sometimes it is difficult to locate the camera at the site because the site is inaccessible.","It is therefore an object of this invention to locate a surveillance camera at a remote site for surveillance purposes.","This and other objects of the invention are achieved in one aspect by a projectile in a cartridge designed to be launched from a grenade launcher. The projectile is adapted to be secured to the housing of the cartridge. The projectile includes a camera contained in the projectile body and connected thereto by a cord, and a transmitter contained in the projectile body and connected to the camera. In addition, the projectile includes means for pinning the front part of the projectile body to a target, and means for separating the front part of the projectile body from the back part of the projectile body and expelling the camera from the projectile body when the projectile is pinned to the target so that the camera is freely suspended from the projectile by the cord and can rotate in a wind through 180 degrees to observe its surroundings and transmit images thereof.","Another aspect of the invention involves a surveillance method comprising the steps of disposing a camera and a transmitter inside a projectile, connecting the camera to the projectile by a cord, launching the projectile, pinning the projectile to a target, separating the front part of the projectile body from the back part of the projectile body, expelling the camera from the projectile body so that the camera is freely suspended from the projectile by the cord and can rotate in a wind through 180 degrees to observe its surroundings, and transmitting images of the surroundings.","The invention allows the camera to hang freely regardless of the angle of impact of the projectile. There is no operator control.","Referring to the Figures, wherein like reference numerals designate like or corresponding parts, and more particularly to , there is schematically illustrated a cartridge incorporating the projectile of the present invention. The cartridge is designed to be launched from the M203 or other model(s) 40-mm Grenade Launcher. Since such cartridges are known in the art of kinetic energy projectiles it will be described only insofar as necessary to set forth the cooperative relationship of the present invention.","The cartridge comprises three major components: a projectile , a housing  connected to the projectile, and a propulsion system  disposed in an opening in the housing. The housing  serves to retain the projectile  and the propulsion system  as well as prevent gas leakage into the breech area of the grenade launcher. The propulsion system  includes a propellant charge  and a free volume  for the accumulation of combustion gases, in addition to means of venting these gases into the grenade launcher chamber. The projectile  is secured to the housing by an interference fit. This causes a lip on the mouth of the housing  to engage an undercut in the projectile  body.","In operation, the cartridge is loaded into a grenade launcher attached to a rifle or stand-alone launcher device. The primer is struck by the grenade launcher firing-pin which initiates the primer compound and subsequently the charge . As the propellant burns, the pressure increases in the grenade launcher chamber and the projectile  unseats from the housing . The projectile then accelerates down the barrel of the grenade launcher projectile  unseats from the housing . The projectile then accelerates down the barrel of the grenade launcher while engaging the bore rifling, which transmits spin torque to the projectile . After firing, the grenade launcher breech can be opened, the spent housing extracted, and a fresh cartridge inserted.","Since the present invention is deemed to reside in the projectile , further description of the other elements of the cartridge, which are well known to those skilled in the art, is considered superfluous.","The projectile  includes a projectile body having a front part  and a back part . The back part  of the projectile body is adapted to be secured to the housing . The front part  of the projectile body contains an infrared camera  which is connected to the projectile body by a cord . The back part  of the projectile body contains a video transmitter  which is connected to the camera , and a battery  which is connected to the camera and to the transmitter. Both the infrared camera  and the transmitter  may be cameras that are commercially available. In addition, the projectile body includes means for pinning the front part  of the projectile body to a target , and means for separating the front part  of the projectile body from the back part  of the projectile target , so that the camera is freely suspended from the projectile by the cord  and can rotate in a wind through 180 degrees to observe its surroundings and transmit images thereof.","While the pinning means may take a variety of forms, conveniently it may take the form of a nail , a main charge  and a squib  for firing the nail, and an accelerometer  connected to the squib.","While the separating and expelling means may likewise take a variety of forms, conveniently it may take the form of a wall  having a plurality of pressure ducts  which separates the main charge  and the squib  from the camera , and a breakable link  which connects the front part  of the projectile body to the back part  of the projectile body.","In operation, when the front part  of the projectile body impacts the target , the accelerometer  senses the impact and activates the squib  to set off the main charge  so that the nail  shoots forward and pins the projectile to the target. The gases from the explosion of the main charge  forcibly expand through the pressure ducts  cushioning the payload's impact causing the link  to break and separate the front part  and back part  of the projectile. The infrared camera  drops out of the  to break and separate the front part  and back part  of the projectile. The infrared camera  drops out of the projectile, as shown in , and hangs freely by the cord . The camera  may be balanced so that it assumes a specific tilt angle. The design allows the wind to freely rotate the camera  through 180 degrees. The video transmitter  may then send images from the camera  to a remote surveillance receiver.","It is obvious that many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as described."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["These and other objects of the invention will become readily apparent in light of the Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment and the attached drawings wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
