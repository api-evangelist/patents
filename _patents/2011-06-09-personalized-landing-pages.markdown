{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Advertisers and other such entities spend a significant amount of resources to provide online advertisements and other supplemental content to specific users. Textual advertising, which is a commonly used type of online advertising, includes the practice of placing \u201csponsored links\u201d on search result pages provided by web search engines. The sponsored links placed on a page are often based on search query terms provided by the user. Display advertising is another commonly used type of online advertising. There are numerous ways in which digital display advertising is used. For example, display advertising may include placing a digital advertisement on one or more web pages, where the subject matter of the advertisement is relevant to at least some portion of the content currently presented on the web page. Retargeting display advertising is yet another type of digital display advertising where, for example, a user is presented with a graphical or rich media advertisement based on the user's browsing and\/or purchasing history. For example, if, when browsing an online retailer web site, a user navigates to a detail web page for a particular item but does not actually purchase the item, the user may later be presented with an advertisement for that same item. Other types of digital display advertising include brand-oriented and performance advertising which are targeted to users with a particular set of demographics or behavioral characteristics that make showing an advertisement to a user desirable.","Oftentimes sponsored links and display advertisements, regardless of whether they are placed via textual, contextual, targeted, or other types of advertising techniques, include graphic or rich media and text describing the product or service being advertised. Further, in some cases, sponsored links and display advertisements may include hyperlinks to a webpage, mobile site and the like, where the user may purchase the product and\/or obtain more information about the advertised products or services. The web pages that the user is navigated to in response to interacting with the sponsored link or display advertisement is commonly referred to as a \u201clanding page.\u201d For example, if a display advertisement is provided for a product, the landing page the user is directed to may be sponsored by the product manufacturer or brand, merchant, vendor, an online retailer, etc. where the user can purchase or obtain more information about the product. If the user purchases the product as a result of interacting with the display advertisement, the display advertisement is said to have resulted in a \u201cconversion.\u201d Thus, personalizing a landing page may be able to influence conversion rates positively.","Same numbers are used throughout the disclosure and figures to reference like components and features, but such repetition of number is for purposes of simplicity of explanation and understanding, and should not be viewed as a limitation on the various embodiments.","In the following description, various embodiments will be described. For purposes of explanation, specific configurations and details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments. However, it will also be apparent to one skilled in the art that the embodiments may be practiced without the specific details, and that variations and other aspects not explicitly disclosed herein are contemplated within the scope of the various embodiments. Furthermore, well-known features may be omitted or simplified in order not to obscure the embodiment being described.","Various embodiments are described herein for generating a personalized landing page based on a combination of information known about the individual user viewing the landing page and the entity sponsoring the landing page. Information known about a user may include, but is not limited to, online (mobile, web, etc.) browsing history, purchasing history (online and offline), personal preferences, interests, attributes, social graphs and other demographic data. Personalizing a landing page may include, for example, identifying and displaying content in the landing page that may be of particular interest to the user.","It will be helpful to have a brief example of generating a personalized landing page. In one example, a user interacts with a display advertisement presented on a web page that features a particular product (e.g., Acme's newly released L57 laptop computer) or brand (e.g., Acme's newest family of laptop computers). Upon interacting with the display advertisement, the user is navigated to a landing page that displays, among other things (or by itself), Acme's L57 laptop computer. Information known about the user (e.g., online browsing history, purchasing history, social graph, preferences, etc.) and the entity associated with the display advertisement (Acme) may be used to personalize the landing page that the user is navigated to. Based on this information, products that are likely of interest to the user (and appropriate for the advertiser) are identified and displayed in a personalized landing page.","If, for example, the display advertisement is sponsored by Acme (or an entity on behalf of Acme), the landing page the user is navigated to may contain only Acme brand imagery, products or services. For example, the landing page may contain brand imagery provided by Acme related to the specific Acme product displayed in the display advertisement (L57 laptop computer) and\/or any other number of Acme products (e.g., top-selling Acme products, Acme products related to digital SLRs, promotional Acme products, etc.). The Acme products contained in the landing page may be influenced by information known about the user that previously interacted with the display ad. For example, the top-selling Acme products contained in the landing page may be within a certain price point that, based on the user information, is inferred the user is most likely to purchase an Acme product. As another example, it may be possible to determine, based on the user information, that the user recently purchased an Acme television. Thus, Acme products that compliment a television (e.g., Acme remote control, Acme wall mount, etc.) may be selected for display in the landing page even though these products are not directly related to the L57 laptop featured in the display ad.","In another instance, if the display advertisement is sponsored by, for example, an online retailer (e.g., \u201cElectronic Warehouse\u201d) that sells Acme brand products among other brands, the \u201cElectronics Warehouse\u201d landing page the user is navigated to may contain the Acme product featured in the display advertisement as well as products offered by \u201cElectronics Warehouse\u201d associated with brands other than Acme (including competitors of Acme). Again, any information known about the user or community of \u201csimilar\u201d users may be used to determine products for display in the landing page that may be of interest to the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","102"]},"The network  may include any appropriate network, including an intranet, the Internet, a cellular network, a local area network, a wide area network, a wireless data network, or any other such network or combination thereof. Components utilized for such a system may depend at least in part upon the type of network and\/or environment selected. Protocols and components for communicating via such a network are well known and will not be discussed herein in detail. Communication over the network may be enabled by wired or wireless connections, and combinations thereof. In this example, the network  includes the Internet, as the environment includes a Web server  for receiving requests and serving content in response thereto, although for other networks an alternative device serving a similar purpose could be utilized as would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.","The illustrative environment  includes at least one application server  and a data store . It should be understood that there may be several application servers, layers, or other elements, processes, or components, which may be chained or otherwise configured, which may interact to perform tasks such as obtaining data from an appropriate data store. As used herein the term \u201cdata store\u201d refers to any device or combination of devices capable of storing, accessing, and\/or retrieving data, which may include any combination and number of data servers, databases, data storage devices, and data storage media, in any standard, distributed, or clustered environment.","The application server  may include any appropriate hardware and software for integrating with the data store as needed to execute aspects of one or more applications for the client device , and may even handle a majority of the data access and business logic for an application. The application server  provides access control services in cooperation with the data store , and is able to generate content such as text, graphics, audio, and\/or video to be transferred to the user, which may be served to the user by the Web server  in the form of HTML, XML, or another appropriate structured language in this example.","The handling of all requests and responses, as well as the delivery of content between the client device  and the application server , may be handled by the Web server . It should be understood that the Web and application servers ,  are not required and are merely example components, as structured code discussed herein may be executed on any appropriate device or host machine as discussed elsewhere herein. Further, the environment  may be architected in such a way that a test automation framework may be provided as a service to which a user or application may subscribe. A test automation framework may be provided as an implementation of any of the various testing patterns discussed herein, although various other implementations may be utilized as well, as discussed or suggested herein.","The environment  may also include a development and\/or testing side, which includes a user device  allowing a user such as a developer, data administrator, or tester to access the system. The user device  may be any appropriate device or machine, such as is described above with respect to the client device . The environment  may also include a development server , which functions similar to the application server  but typically runs code during development and testing before the code is deployed and executed on the production side and becomes accessible to outside users, for example. In some embodiments, an application server may function as a development server, and separate production and testing storage may not be utilized.","The data store  may include several separate data tables, databases, or other data storage mechanisms and media for storing data relating to a particular aspect. For example, the data store  illustrated includes mechanisms for storing production data  and user information , which may be utilized to serve content for the production side. The data store  also is shown to include a mechanism for storing testing data , which may be utilized with the user information for the testing side. It should be understood that there may be many other aspects that are stored in the data store , such as for page image information and access right information, which may be stored in any of the above listed mechanisms as appropriate or in additional mechanisms in the data store .","The data store  is operable, through logic associated therewith, to receive instructions from the application server  or development server , and obtain, update, or otherwise process data in response thereto. In one example, a user might submit a search request for a certain type of item. In this case, the data store  might access the user information  to verify the identity of the user, and may access the catalog detail information to obtain information about items of that type. The information then may be returned to the user, such as in a results listing on a Web page that the user is able to view via a browser on the user device . Information for a particular item of interest may be viewed in a dedicated page or window of the browser.","Each server typically will include an operating system that provides executable program instructions for the general administration and operation of that server, and typically will include a computer-readable medium storing instructions that, when executed by a processor of the server, allow the server to perform its intended functions. Suitable implementations for the operating system and general functionality of the servers are known or commercially available, and are readily implemented by persons having ordinary skill in the art, particularly in light of the disclosure herein.","The environment  in one embodiment is a distributed computing environment utilizing several computer systems and components that are interconnected via communication links, using one or more computer networks or direct connections. However, it will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that such a system could operate equally well in a system having fewer or a greater number of components than are illustrated in . Thus, the depiction of the environment  in  should be taken as being illustrative in nature, and not limiting to the scope of the disclosure.","The environment  of  may include additional components and\/or other arrangements, such as those illustrated in system  of . In this example, the system  includes a landing page manager  that responds to landing page requests that are generated when users interact with a display advertisement presented in electronic interfaces such as web sites, search engines, applications, etc. According to the illustrated embodiment, the landing page manager  includes a user information module , an advertiser information module , an advertisement component module , a template management module , and a landing page personalization module . The landing page manager  reads and\/or writes data to a templates data store , an advertisement component data store , a user information data store , an advertiser information data store , and a product information data store . The data stores , , , , and  may, in some embodiments, be implemented as part of the landing page manager  while in other embodiments of the present invention, the data stores , , , , and  are implemented separately from the landing page manager . For discussion purposes only, the technology disclosed herein will be described in reference to users interacting with a display advertisement.","According to an embodiment, the user information module  obtains user information and optionally provides the obtained user information to the user information data store . User information may be obtained using various techniques. For example, user information may be obtained from a log or database of recorded online browsing history, purchasing history (online and offline), search history, demographic information, social graph (e.g., network of friends, relatives, work associates, etc.), selected advertisements and the like.","According to some embodiments, user information may be expressly provided by a user. For example, a web site may enable a user to create and manage a user profile that certain information. Such information and preferences may be incorporated into the user information data store . Information expressly provided by a user may include, for example, demographic information, such as age, gender, or income, location information (e.g., address), phone numbers, interests, memberships in social networks, favorite brands and the like. In an embodiment, the interface may include a user interface, such as web page, that allows user information to be manually entered by a user or by an operator. In an embodiment, the interface may comprise an electronic interface, such as an application programming interface, for electronically interfacing with the user information data store  from an executable program to add information to the user information data store  or access information stored in the user information data store .","According to some embodiments, an entity associated with a landing page (e.g., advertiser, brand, merchant, retailer, vendor, etc.) may provide information, such as brand imagery, logos and the like associated with the brand and\/or advertising campaign that the advertiser would like to convey through a landing page. For example, an advertiser may provide information about its top-selling products, newest products, and products within a certain price range. Further, advertisers may provide information that indicates which of its products complement each other. Thus, when a product is featured in a display advertisement, products complimenting the featured product (whether of the same brand or not) can be presented on the landing page in addition to the product featured in the display advertisement. For example, if the display advertisement features a particular digital camera, the advertiser may wish for the landing page to present products that compliment the digital camera such as camera cases, batteries, external flashes, a \u201ccomparable\u201d digital camera (of the same brand or a different brand) and the like.","An advertiser may be any entity sponsoring or associated with a display advertisement for itself or on behalf of another entity (e.g., brand, manufacturer, etc.). Information module  may provide an interface or API for an advertiser to provide information such as brand imagery, logos and the like to the advertiser information data stores , . In an embodiment, the interface may include a user interface, such as web page, that allows this information to be manually entered by an advertiser or by an operator. In an embodiment, the interface may comprise an electronic interface, such as an application programming interface, for electronically interfacing with the advertiser to add information to the advertiser and product information data stores ,  or access information stored in the advertiser and product information data stores , . Product information store  may, in some embodiments, also contain product similarity data (e.g., users who viewed\/purchased item A also viewed\/purchased items B, C, D, etc.) whether the same or a different brand than item A.","The advertisement component module  obtains advertisement components and corresponding attribute information. Further, the advertisement component module  categorizes and stores the advertisement components and corresponding attribute information in the advertisement component data store . For example, the advertisement component module  may categorize advertisement components as being components that appeal to certain segments of users. Advertisement components and, thus, the advertisement component data store  may include advertising content such as brand imagery, logos, text, images, video content, animated content or games, rich media or any other type of advertising content. The advertisement component module  may obtain advertising components from third parties, such as advertisers, brands, manufacturers, etc. of products and services, and may contain \u201chouse\u201d or stock content used to supplement or enhance advertising content provided by the advertisement provider.","According to an embodiment, advertisement components stored in the advertisement component data store  may be categorized based on the attributes of the individual advertisement components. These attributes may include, but are not limited to, the product type or service type for advertisement components that are directed to specific products or services, the predominant colors featured in the advertising components, the size of the advertisement components, and the media type of the advertisement component. These attributes may be used to select advertisement components for personalizing landing pages for users.","The template module  may generate and\/or obtain a landing page template from another source used for personalizing landing pages and stores the landing page templates in the templates data store . According to an embodiment, a landing page template includes at least one placement that, upon rendering the landing page, shows or contains content (e.g., advertisement, search results, product listing, etc.) in the landing page. An example landing page template  is illustrated in ","The landing page personalization module , according to one embodiment, is configured to personalize landing pages using advertisement creatives (e.g., images, videos, games, etc.) from advertisement components data store  (or other sources) based on any combination of information obtained from the user information data store , the advertiser data store  and product information data store , further in view of the selected display advertisement. For example, the landing page personalization module  processes a request for a landing page, such as from a web server requesting a landing page in response to a user interacting with a display advertisement. The landing page personalization module , among other things, obtains a landing page template from the templates data store , selects from the advertisement component data store  (or other source) advertisement creatives related to the product featured in the display advertisement, and associates each advertisement creative with a placement (shown in ) of the selected template. It should be appreciated that, in some embodiments, the advertisement creatives are selected and provided by the advertiser\/brand associated with the landing page. For example, the landing page personalization module  may request advertisement tags from the ad server and associate each ad tag with a placement. When the landing page personalization module  is rendering a landing page, the advertisement tags are used to \u201ccall\u201d an ad server to retrieve the creatives for display on the landing page.","Further, the landing page personalization module  may access user information (of the user that selected the display ad, if the user can be identified) and the advertiser's information (of advertiser(s) associated with the landing page), and select advertisement components based on any combination of the user, advertiser and product information. According to some embodiments, the landing page personalization module  accesses the user information in the user information data store  via the user information module . In other embodiments, the landing page personalization module  may access user information data store  directly to retrieve user information. Further, according to some embodiments, the landing page personalization module  may access the advertiser information in the advertiser information data store  via the advertiser information module , while in other embodiments, the landing page personalization module  may access advertiser information data store  directly to retrieve advertiser information.","According to an embodiment, the landing page personalization module  is further configured to optimize a landing page based on user responses to previously displayed landing pages. For example, to optimize a landing page, the landing page personalization module  may utilize a user's browsing and\/or purchasing histories, such as by recording the advertisements that have been presented to the user and any responses to such advertisements. Such responses include, but are not limited to, whether the user purchased the products featured in a display ad, viewed a detail page about the product featured in the display ad, added the product featured in the display ad to an online shopping cart, read or provided consumer reviews about the product featured in the display ad or viewed\/purchased products similar to the product featured in the display ad (whether of the same brand or not). The landing page personalization module  may also utilize user behavior information aggregated across a community of users. By aggregating user information across a plurality of users, the landing page personalization module  can learn how to best present advertisements in a landing page to optimize interaction with the advertisements.","With reference to , the example landing page template  includes a brand information placement , a main or prominent placement , a first set of secondary placements -and a second set of secondary placements -. It should be appreciated that the configuration of placements shown in is exemplary only and is not intended to limit the scope of the technology described herein. As with any conventional web page, a landing page may also have a background that may have customizable color schemes, font sizes and styles, icons, graphics, etc. In an embodiment, the landing page personalization module  selects a background for the landing page based on attributes and preferences of a user, the advertiser or brand featured in the landing page some combination thereof. The template  may designate the type of content that may be shown in one or more of the placements. As one example, the template  may designate that the main placement  show an advertisement (or information) associated with the product or service featured in the display advertisement selected by a user. As another example, landing page template  may designate that one or more placements contain a static image, rich media, etc.","Using the example provided above whereby a landing page features items associated with a single brand (e.g., Acme), the template may designate that the secondary placements  show products and\/or advertisements offered only by the same brand. For example, secondary placements  may show only Acme's products that are similar to, or that complement, the product(s) shown in placement  (e.g., Acme's top selling products, Acme's newest products, etc.). According to an embodiment, the advertiser sponsoring the landing page may specify the advertising content of placements . For example, instructions that indicate which advertisement components are directed to which products may be located in the advertiser and product information data stores , . However, it should be appreciated that the landing page personalization module  could select the advertising content for placements . Placements  may be populated with, among other things, advertisements that may be of interest to the user based on available user information. In an embodiment, the landing page personalization module  may access the user information data store  to determine which advertisements of the advertisement component data store  may appeal to the user or to a segment of users who have similar traits or behaviors. For example, the landing page personalization module  may identify the consumer segments to which the user belongs, and then access the advertisement component data store  to identify advertisements that may appeal to users of those consumer segments.","Continuing with the Acme example provided above, illustrates an example personalized landing page  that may be presented in response to a user interacting with a display advertisement featuring Acme's L57 laptop computer. The landing page illustrated in is an example of a landing page sponsored by Acme itself or, for example, an online retailer on behalf of Acme. Either way, the landing page will contain content associated with a single brand of products\u2014Acme's brand. Throughout this application, the terms \u201cadvertisement,\u201d \u201cad,\u201d \u201ccontent,\u201d \u201ccreative\u201d and the like may be used interchangeably to describe a piece of content, whether static, rich media, etc. In the example, the placement  may contain Acme's brand and image information, logos and the like. The placement  shows an advertisement featuring the L57 laptop computer featured in the previously selected display advertisement. The placements -show various advertisements directed to other Acme brand laptops. For example, the Acme brand laptops shown in placements -may be Acme's top selling laptops, newly released laptops, laptops with configurations similar to the L57 shown in placement , laptops with a higher price point than the L57 (upsell opportunity) and the like. The laptops shown in placements  may be further refined by a price range that the user is likely to find acceptable based on data contained in the user information store  (or other sources). Placements -may also contain content other than laptops and are not required to each contain the same type of content.","The placements -shown in , in this example, show advertisements of other Acme items. For example, the products shown in the placements  of include Acme toy computers (), Acme digital cameras (), Acme desktop computers (), and Acme printers (). Each of the items shown in one of the placements  may be selected for the landing page, in part, based on information known about the user. For example, the toy computer shown in placement may have been selected based in part on the user's purchase history indicating that the user has recently purchased a children's toy. The digital camera shown in placement may have been selected based in part on the user's browsing history indicating that the user recently viewed a digital camera online. The desktop computer shown in placement and the printer shown in placement may have been selected based on knowledge that consumers categorized in a consumer segment similar to the user (e.g., small business owner) often buy desktop computers and printers at the same time. Other types of information may be used to personalize the displayed items. For example, attributes of the item that was featured in the display advertisement may be used to identify items for display in a landing page.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["350","350","308","308","326","308","350","350","350","308","308","312","316","350"],"i":["a","d","a ","a","b","d","a","e ","a","d"]},"As illustrated in , laptop  (Acme L57 laptop) may be highlighted to distinguish it from the other items shown in placements -. Such highlighting may include enclosing the item in a box or using bold, large or uniquely colored font, etc. As discussed above, the items shown in placements -,  and  may be identified based in part on user information, community information, attributes associated with the Acme L57 laptop computer or any combination thereof. As such, in addition to displaying items selected based on the user's information (placements ), items designated by the advertiser (placements ), and the item that was featured in the display advertisement (placement ), the landing page  shown in also shows search-result items (computers -). It should be appreciated that, in some embodiments, the search-result items shown in placements -contain only items associated with a single brand. In other embodiments the placements -may contain items associated with different brands.","It should be appreciated that the landing page template  shown in is merely an example and that a landing page template (or the page itself) may have any number of placements and configurations. For example, if user information is not available, then the landing page template may only include one set of placements for showing advertisement creatives directed to the item featured in the display advertisement and another set of placements for advertisement creatives selected by the advertiser and are similar to the item featured in the display advertisement (e.g., recommend items that the community is purchasing or viewing, recommend items that users who selected the display ad (or purchased the item featured in the display ad) also purchased\/viewed, etc.), within a certain price range and the like. Further for example, if the advertiser has not provided enough advertising creatives for items that it would like to promote, the landing page template may only include one set of placements for advertisement creatives directed to the subject matter of a display advertisement.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","410"]},"At , any user information associated with the user that interacted with the display ad and information associated with the advertiser associated with the landing page is obtained. In an embodiment, each user, display ad and advertiser may be associated with a unique identifier. In this instance, information related to the user that selected the display advertisement and the advertiser that sponsored the display advertisement may be located and obtained using these unique identifiers. It should be appreciated that users may also be identified by using various methods, such as using the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the user's computer system or via a login identifier that the user has used to access content on a content provider's website, an HTTP cookie or other means. Further, it should be appreciated that advertisers may also be identified by using various other methods, such as using the hyperlink of the sponsored link or advertisement that was selected by the user to request a landing page.","User information may also be obtained from third parties, such as social networks, microblogging sites and the like, that can provide additional information about the user as well as information about others that are connected to the user in some manner (e.g., friends of a user, users in the same community, etc.). For example, social networks may provide information about brands and products that are of interest to the user or the user's friends. If the user or the user's friends self-identity with or express an interest in a particular brand or product, then a landing page may be personalized with advertising content for that brand or product. The landing page may be personalized with advertising content for products that the user's friends have purchased or products for which the user's friends have written favorable reviews. For example, if five of the user's friends have purchased a particular product, then a landing page may be personalized with information about that product and an indication that five of the user's friends have purchased that product. The landing page may include the names of the user's friends that have purchased the product and comments those friends have made about the product.","It should also be appreciated that, if the user information data store  does not contain any specific behavior or demographic information associated with a particular user, information associated with other users having similar attributes or behaviors could be used to select content for display on the landing page. For example, the user information of users located in the same or similar geographic location as the current user may be used. In this case, an IP address, GPS location information and the like may be used to determine a geographic location of the current user. Demographic information (e.g., age, income, gender, etc.) may inferred of the current user by identifying browsing habits or behavioral information based on search habits or patterns, products reviewed and the like that the current user may have in common with others. It is also within the scope of the technology described herein to select content for display on the landing page based on information provided by the advertiser sponsoring the landing page (or another entity) without any knowledge of user information. For example, the advertiser may designate one or more default advertisements to be presented in all landing pages it sponsors.","At , content designated by the advertiser to promote the product or service featured in the display advertisement (or other source document) is identified. In some instances, the landing page personalization module  obtains the content from the advertisement components data store  for display in the landing page based on the display advertisement selected by the user. In other instances, the landing page personalization module  receives the content from the advertiser.","At block , supplemental advertising content is identified for display in the landing page. Supplemental advertising content may be any content promoting a product or service other than the item featured in the display advertisement initially selected by the user. Continuing with the example provided in , supplemental advertising content shown in the landing page  includes the advertiser's most popular products or services, products or services that are within a certain price range, newly released products or services, products or services that complement or are related to the \u201cprimary\u201d product(s) shown on the landing page or products or services that are most relevant to the user (contained in placements , ). According to an embodiment, the advertiser associated with the landing page  designates the supplemental advertising content that is to be presented on the landing page along with the creative to promote the product that was featured in display advertisement. It should be appreciated, however, that the landing page manager  could designate the supplemental advertising content on behalf of the advertiser (e.g., retailer on behalf of the brand). Further, it should be appreciated that the step indicated at block  is optional and that supplemental advertising content may not be shown at all on the landing page.","As discussed above, a landing page may show content based on information known about the user that selected the display advertisement (or information known about \u201csimilar\u201d users). In this instance, at block , the landing page personalization manager  may utilize information contained in any combination of the user information data store , the advertisement components data store  and the product information store  to identify content that may be of interest to the user and\/or any segments to which the user belongs (e.g., new parent, early adopter, etc.).","As indicated at block , a landing page template is selected (e.g., landing page template  shown in ). Features of the landing page template (e.g., background, font size, etc.) may also be personalized for the user. For example, using information known about the user, the color of the background of a landing page, font sizes and styles and the like may be customized to appeal to the user. In some instances, selecting a landing page template may occur after the advertising content has been identified, at block . This way, the number of placements in the landing page is known prior to identifying advertising content available to show in the landing page.","At block , the landing page is generated by associating a creative with each of the placements of the selected landing page template. In some cases, advertising content is ranked or weighted and the top ranked content is associated with each placement accordingly. For example, advertising content directly related to the product featured in the selected display advertisement may be rendered in a first placement of the template (e.g., placement  in ). Advertising content directed to products or services offered by the advertiser\/brand that are related to the product displayed in placement  may be rendered in a second set of placements of the template (e.g., placements  shown in ). As discussed above, the content may be directed to, by way of example only: (1) products offered by the advertiser or brand (these terms are used interchangeable throughout) that are similar, or complementary to, the \u201cprimary\u201d product shown in the landing page; (2) the advertiser's top selling products; (3) the advertiser's newest products; and\/or (4) products offered by the advertiser that are within a particular price range. In some embodiments, content selected based in part on information known about the user may be rendered in a third set of placements of the template (e.g., placements  in ). A set of placements is not limited to any certain type of content. For example, placements  may contain a combination of different types of advertising based on items attributes and user information. According to an embodiment, the advertising content rendered in the various placements in the landing page may be rank-ordered based on relevance to the item that was featured in the sponsored link or display advertisement, based on relevance to user information known about the user, etc. Further, for example, if the landing page template cannot accommodate all of the relevant advertising content (e.g., ten creatives for the landing page were identified, but the landing page template contains only three placements), then the landing page personalization manager  may select which advertisements to show in the landing page based on the ranked order.","Also for example, the advertiser sponsoring the landing page (for itself or on behalf of a brand) may select the creative to show in the landing page in real-time (or near real-time). For example, in the instance whereby an advertisement tag has been associated with a placement in the landing page, the personalization module  may make a \u201ccall\u201d to an ad server (based on the ad tag) to retrieve to the actual advertisement content for display on the landing page. The response provided by the ad server to the call from the personalization module may be based on user information (e.g, IP address, purchase history, browsing history, etc.), contextual information (e.g., type of page display ad was shown) and the like. At , the personalized landing page is provided for display to the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":"500"},"At block , referral information is received. The referral information may be received in any number of ways. Continuing with the \u201cElectronics Warehouse\u201d advertisement example provided in , referral information may be received from the search engine in response to the user interacting with the \u201cElectronics Warehouse\u201d display advertisement. In one embodiment, the search engine may provide the landing page manager  with a referrer URL.","At block , the query string in the referrer URL is parsed to obtain, among other things, the query text provided by the user. In some instances, identifying query text in the referrer URL string may include identifying a domain of the search engine that passed the referrer URL and applying a set of extraction rules applicable to the domain to identify the query text. At block , items provided by the online retailer that are relevant to these query text are identified. For example, the online retailer may use the query text to identify items contained in its inventory or catalog (brick and mortar or online) that are relevant to the keywords.","At block , advertising content associated with at least some of the identified items (block ) is determined. Using the example template  shown in , suppose the \u201cElectronics Warehouse\u201d display advertisement that the user interacted with featured a certain brand of laptop computer sold by \u201cElectronics Warehouse\u201d (based on the user's query \u201claptop computer\u201d). According to an embodiment, advertising content associated with the laptop computer featured in the display advertisement may be shown in placement . As discussed above, additional items provided by the online retailer (that are relevant to the query text \u201claptop computer\u201d) are identified (block ). Because the template  shown in includes nine additional placements, the online retailer may select up to nine additional pieces of content for display in the landing page. These nine additional piece of content may include, for example, creatives such as advertising (e.g., advertisement featuring 20% off another brand of laptop computers offered by the online retailer), item placements of laptop computers (e.g., more\/less expensive laptop computers offered by the same or different brand), item placements of related products\/services (e.g., laptop bags, laptop batteries) or any combination thereof. As discussed above, the content provided in the landing page may be associated with the brand featured in the display advertisement, a combination of different brands, a single brand different than the brand featured in the display advertisement and the like","In some embodiments, content selected for the landing page is based in part on information known about the user. This could be accomplished according to one or more of the examples provided above with reference to block  of . For example, the landing page personalization manager  may access the user's information in the data store  (e.g., preferred brands, viewing history, purchase history, segments associated with, etc.) and select or filter the relevant items (block ) based on this user information. Again continuing with the example template shown in , the online retailer, based on the user information, may select content for display in the landing page for items that were not initially ranked in the top nine items (e.g., initially ranked without user information). By way of example only, suppose the user information indicates that the user prefers a certain brand of laptop computer that is different than the brand featured in the display advertisement and the initial ranking of laptop computers for display in the landing page did not include a laptop computer of the user's preferred brand. In this case, the online retailer may select content (e.g., advertisement, item information, etc.) associated with one or more laptops of the user's preferred brand for display in the landing page. At block , the web page associated with the selected search result is personalized with relevant advertising content and presented to the user.","The various embodiments described herein may be implemented in a wide variety of operating environments, which in some cases may include one or more user computers, computing devices, or processing devices which may be utilized to operate any of a number of applications.
