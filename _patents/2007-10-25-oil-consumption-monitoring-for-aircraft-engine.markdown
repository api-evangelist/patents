title: Oil consumption monitoring for aircraft engine
abstract: A system and method for accurately calculating the oil quantity and oil consumption rate of an aircraft engine detects the level of oil in an oil tank, calculates the oil quantity in the oil tank by compensating for the acceleration of the aircraft, as well as changes in the pitch, yaw and roll of the aircraft. The oil consumption rate of the aircraft is also calculated by calculating the oil quantity at different times, and dividing the difference in oil quantity by the difference in times. The percentage change in oil consumption of the aircraft engine is also calculated. The oil quantity and oil consumption rate can be reported during and after the aircraft's flight.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The U.S. Government may have certain rights in this invention pursuant to Contract No. N00019-02-C-3003 awarded by the United States Navy.","Automatic oil consumption monitoring is desirable for aircraft engines so that the status of oil consumption before, during and after an aircraft flight can be monitored. Traditionally, oil consumption by aircraft engines has been monitored using an Oil Level Sensor (OLS) to estimate the level of oil remaining in the oil tank. This method of monitoring oil consumption is problematic because, during an aircraft flight, the oil level inside of the oil tank can vary significantly due to changes in acceleration and orientation of the aircraft. Thus, simply monitoring the oil level in the oil tank may not be an accurate measurement of oil consumption by the aircraft engine. In some cases, inaccurate measurement of oil consumption and oil level can result in a false alarm to a pilot or maintenance person by incorrectly indicating an oil leak during a flight, resulting in an unnecessary abort of the mission.","Therefore, there is a need for a more accurate method to estimate the amount of oil in the oil tank of an aircraft while in the air, and thereby more accurately determine the oil consumption of the aircraft engine.","The invention is a system and method to accurately determine the oil consumption of an aircraft engine. The invention accurately determines the Oil Quantity (OQ) remaining in the oil tank by sensing the level of oil in the oil tank and then compensating that measurement for the oil tank geometry, the acceleration of the aircraft, and the orientation of the aircraft. The Oil Consumption Rate (OCR) is calculated using multiple OQs determined at different times and dividing the difference in those oil quantities by the difference in time. The percentage change in the Oil Consumption Rate (\u0394OCR %) is calculated by dividing the difference between the actual and nominal OCR over a period of time by the nominal OCR over that period of time.","The invention calculates the oil quantity and the percentage of change in the oil consumption rate of an aircraft engine. Use of the invention helps to detect oil leaks promptly, and also helps to detect high oil consumption and\/or low oil quantity during and after an aircraft flight. Internal oil leaks can be detected automatically, and by tracking the Oil Consumption Rate, the amount of time remaining before an oil tank becomes empty during an aircraft flight can be predicted. This allows the pilot enough time to take action if an oil leak is detected during the flight of an aircraft. In addition, proper calculation of the oil quantity and oil consumption rate is useful for maintenance purposes, because it helps to accurately calculate the amount of time before routine oil service is necessary. Finally, leak detection utilizing the invention has a low rate of false alarms because aircraft acceleration and orientation are considered in estimating the oil quantity and oil consumption rate.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","106","108","110"],"sub":["x","y ","z","2"]},"The aircraft's acceleration is obtained in the form of the vector (A, Aand A). Aircraft acceleration is measured in distance per secondand is acquired at least once per second. The aircraft's angular rate is obtained as the vector ({dot over (\u03b8)}, {dot over (\u03c6)}, {dot over (\u03c8)}), which corresponds to the rates of change in the roll, pitch and yaw of the aircraft.  shows the definitions of roll, pitch and yaw and corresponding angles \u03b8, \u03c6 and \u03c8. The aircraft's angular rates of change in roll, pitch and yaw are measured in radians per second and are acquired at least once per second. Oil level, indicating the height of the oil in the oil tank is measured in inches and is collected at least once per second. The engine power setting (N) is measured in revolutions per minute (rpm) and is acquired at least once per second. All input variables mentioned above are measured as time sequences and indexed by k.","Oil consumption monitor  receives these inputs, and produces an appropriate output. Outputs may include warnings such as \u201cOIL LEAK\u201d signal  or \u201cLOW OIL LEVEL\u201d output  or \u201cFUEL LEAK\u201d output . Oil consumption monitor  may also calculate and output the Oil Quantity  in the tank of the aircraft or the percentage change in the oil consumption rate (\u0394OCR %)  of the aircraft. Outputs , , ,  and  are exemplary. The number and nature of the outputs of oil consumption monitor  will vary under different circumstances, depending on the status of the engine and the output desired by the users.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["200","102","202","204"]},"After data has been obtained in step , the process moves on to question box , where the aircraft's quasi-static state is verified. This step is taken to avoid inaccurate oil quantity estimates during rapid aircraft maneuver or the inability of the OLS to sense the oil level in situations such as extreme acceleration, deceleration or attitude. The extreme attitude may include, but is not limited to, straight up\/down or upside down flight. To satisfy a quasi static state, the aircraft acceleration (A, A, A) and angular rate ({dot over (\u03b8)}, {dot over (\u03c6)}, {dot over (\u03c8)}) have to be within a certain range. If the aircraft's quasi-static state is verified, the process proceeds to ; if not, the process ends at end box .","Question box  determines whether the oil level is within the range of the oil level sensor. With the previous quasi-static state check passed, the OLS should be able to sense the oil level in the tank, if the oil quantity in the oil tank is in operational range. If this is the case, the process moves on to next step . If the oil level is not within the sensor range, then a new validation check is performed at step , which determines if the oil level is below the minimum oil level limit.","If the validation check at step  reveals that the oil level is indeed below the minimum oil level limit, a persistency check at step  is performed. Step  determines whether the oil level is persistently below the minimum oil level limit for a given period of time. If so, then the process generates a \u2018Low OL\u2019 Health Report. Code (HRC) at step . If the validation check at step  reveals that the oil level is not below the minimum oil level limit (it must be beyond the maximum oil level limit in this case), or the persistent check in step  fails, the process stops for the current data input and ends at end box .","If the oil level is within sensor range at step , the process moves on to box , where the process calculates the acceleration for the oil tank. The acceleration at oil tank is a composition of the aircraft acceleration and the centripetal acceleration introduced by the aircraft's rotation along pitch, roll, and yaw. Calculation of acceleration of the oil tank may also include compensation for the difference between the aircraft coordinate system and the oil tank coordinate system. Taking into account the relationship between the aircraft coordinate system and the oil tank coordinate system results in a more accurate calculation of oil quantity, because it compensates for the difference between the location of the oil tank and the device that provides the aircraft's acceleration and attitude data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 4","sub":["A","A","A","O","O","O","x","y","z","y "]},"Calculation of the acceleration, which is a vector a={a, a, a}, is calculated using the following equation:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mo":"\u2003","mrow":{"mo":"{","mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["a","x"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["A","x"]},"mo":["+","+"],"mrow":[{"msup":{"mover":{"mi":"\u03b8","mo":"."},"mn":"2"},"mo":"\u00b7","msub":{"mi":["O","x"]}},{"msup":{"mover":{"mi":"\u03c8","mo":"."},"mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mi":["O","x"]}}]},{"msub":{"mi":["A","x"]},"mo":"+","mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msup":[{"mover":{"mi":"\u03b8","mo":"."},"mn":"2"},{"mover":{"mi":"\u03c8","mo":"."},"mn":"2"}],"mo":"+"}},"mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mi":["O","x"]}}}],"mo":"="}}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["a","y"]},{"mi":["A","y"]}],"mo":"="}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["a","z"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["A","z"]},"mo":["-","-"],"mrow":[{"msup":{"mover":{"mi":"\u03b8","mo":"."},"mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mi":["O","z"]}},{"msup":{"mover":{"mi":"\u03d5","mo":"."},"mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mi":["O","z"]}}]},{"msub":{"mi":["A","z"]},"mo":"-","mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msup":[{"mover":{"mi":"\u03b8","mo":"."},"mn":"2"},{"mover":{"mi":"\u03d5","mo":"."},"mn":"2"}],"mo":"+"}},"mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mi":["O","z"]}}}],"mo":"="}}}}]}}}}}},"After calculating the acceleration, the process moves on to step  of , in which the oil quantity (OQ) is calculated.

The first option is to use a Conversion Table that specifies the oil quantity for each given combination of the oil level, pitch angle and roll angle. Utilizing this option, the Conversion Table is searched for the nearest match in oil level, pitch angle, and roll angle readings, and then the oil quantity is determined by the given oil quantity provided in the Conversion Table. Interpolation may be performed if there is no exact match for given oil level, pitch angle and roll angle. The second option is to establish an approximation function \u0192 to represent the OQ as function of the oil level, pitch angle and roll angle. In either option, the data used to establish \u0192 may be collected through experiments or generated from the digital model used to design the shape of the oil tank.","After calculating the oil quantity, the process moves on to step  of , which filters out the effect of oil moving around in the oil tank, commonly referred to as \u2018sloshing\u2019. A low pass filter is applied to the oil quantity in order to eliminate the effect of oil sloshing, in the form of:\n\nOQ=\u03bc*OQ+(1\u2212\u03bc)*OQ, 0<\u03bc<1\n\nwhere OQis the current oil quantity estimate, OQis the previous oil quantity estimation, and \u03bcis an adjustable factor that determines how smoothly the filter effect should be applied.\n","After filtering the oil sloshing effect, the process moves on to step , which begins a low oil quantity check.
