abstract: A method and system for N-way synchronization of computer databases. Synchronization of computer databases is structured into three rounds, namely an agenda round, a query round and a report round. In the agenda round, a synchronization agent software module inquires of a common synchronization engine for updates to the agent's database and provides information as to the level of information in the agent's database. During a query round, a common synchronization engine may request information from databases with new information and distribute that database information to databases needing the new information during a report round. Multiple agents, each representing an associated database may participate a synchronization. In addition, various special purpose agents may also receive, provide and otherwise operate on synchronization information.

No. 60\/377,713, filed May 2, 2002, entitled \u201cSystem and Method for Synchronizing Computer Databases,\u201d which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Embodiments of the present invention relate to database design. More particularly, embodiments of the present invention provide a method and apparatus for N-way synchronization of computer databases.","A database is generally a collection of related information stored in computer readable form. Databases are ubiquitous in modern life. Mobile phones often contain databases of recently and frequently called numbers. The world wide web is comprised of countless databases. Hand held computers are in large part valuable because of the databases they contain. In fact, the databases contained in most computers are far more valuable than the computer hardware itself.","In order to use this valuable information, people must have access to the information. This is frequently accomplished using different types of computers for different situations. For example, a salesman may create a spreadsheet containing pricing information on a desktop computer, and desire to access that information via a small hand held computer while at a customer's premises.","It is often difficult, expensive or impractical to actually access the same database from both types of computers, especially if one is operated in a mobile environment. To overcome this difficulty, a process of synchronizing databases was developed.","Synchronizing a database is generally a process by which a plurality of copies of a database is maintained such that the information in all copies is the same, or synchronized. The copies need not be bit for bit identical. A synchronization process can accommodate different file structure, operating system and data media requirements. The copies are frequently on different computer systems, but it is sometimes desirable to maintain separate, synchronized databases on the same computer system. Synchronization allows updates (\u201cmutations\u201d) e.g., additions, deletions and\/or changes made to one copy of a database, for example a copy on a hand held computer, to be reflected to all copies.","Prior art synchronization systems use a \u201cdouble headed\u201d conduit program to synchronize information. As an unfortunate result, such prior art conduit programs must manage all aspects of synchronization, data retrieval and data storage between two databases, for example on a desktop computer and a hand held computer. Data retrieval and data storage may be particularly difficult in situations involving different types of computers, e.g., hand held versus desktop, which are running different operating systems, e.g., Palm OS versus Microsoft Windows, and which store information in different media, e.g., byte-addressable random access memory versus 512-byte record based rotating magnetic media. In addition, a conduit designed to synchronize a database on a hand held computer and, for example, a PC, must manage the communication between the two computers.","It is frequently necessary or desirable to synchronize more than two databases. For example, a hand held computer user may desire to synchronize calendar data between his hand held computer, a personal calendar on a desk top computer and a group calendar on a server. Under the prior art, using double ended conduit programs, the synchronization of more than two databases typically requires multiple synchronization sessions. For example, what might be required is a first synchronization session to synchronize databases A and B, followed by a second synchronization session to synchronize databases A and C, etc. Further, in general a separate \u201cdouble ended\u201d conduit program would be required for each synchronization to account for any structural differences between, for example, databases B and C.","As an unfortunate consequence of such limitations of the prior art, a commercially feasible method of synchronizing multiple databases is not available. In addition, because prior art conduit programs are constructed to synchronize between two specific databases, the introduction of a new type of database typically requires the creation of not just one, but an entire set of new conduit programs to synchronize with all of the other types of databases. Such factors strongly discourage the introduction of new databases, limiting the art and utility of computer databases and hand held computers.","Accordingly, it would be advantageous to provide a method and system for N-way synchronization of computer databases. A further need exists for a method of synchronizing information among databases residing on different computers. A still further need exists for a method and system to enable special purpose agents or databases to participate in a synchronization session.","Embodiments of the present invention provide a method and system for N-way synchronization of computer databases. Further embodiments provide a method of synchronizing information among databases residing on different computers. Yet other embodiments provide a method and system to enable special purpose agents and\/or databases to participate in a synchronization session.","A method and system for N-way synchronization of computer databases is disclosed. In one embodiment, synchronization of computer databases is structured into three rounds, namely an agenda round, a query round and a report round. Agents are software modules associated with databases that are used to aid in synchronization. In the agenda round, a synchronization agent software module inquiries of a common synchronization manager for updates to the agent's database and provides information as to the level of information in the agent's database. During a query round, a common synchronization manager may request information from agents and distribute that information to databases needing the new information during a report round. Multiple agents, each representing an associated database may participate in a synchronization. In addition, various special purpose agents may also receive, provide and otherwise operate on synchronization information. In this novel mater, multiple databases, e.g., \u201cN,\u201d residing on a plurality of computer systems may be synchronized in a structured manner in a single synchronization session.","In another embodiment of the present invention, an agent booster augments the capabilities of a database in order to facilitate synchronization of the database.","Another embodiment of the present invention provides a method of synchronizing databases between two computers that is optimized for use of a communications channel.","In the following detailed description of the present invention, N-way synchronization of computer databases, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be recognized by one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details or with equivalents thereof. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, components, and circuits have not been described in detail as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the present invention.","Some portions of the detailed descriptions which follow (e.g., processes  and ) are presented in terms of procedures, steps, logic blocks, processing, and other symbolic representations of operations on data bits that can be performed on computer memory. These descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. A procedure, computer executed step, logic block, process, etc., is here, and generally, conceived to be a self-consistent sequence of steps or instructions leading to a desired result. The steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated in a computer system. It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, or the like.","It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the following discussions, it is appreciated that throughout the present invention, discussions utilizing terms such as \u201cindexing\u201d or \u201cprocessing\u201d or \u201ccomputing\u201d or \u201ctranslating\u201d or \u201ccalculating\u201d or \u201cdetermining\u201d or \u201cscrolling\u201d or \u201cdisplaying\u201d or \u201crecognizing\u201d or \u201cgenerating\u201d or \u201cdemarking\u201d or \u201ctransferring\u201d or \u201csynchronizing\u201d or \u201caccessing\u201d or \u201cretrieving\u201d or \u201cconveying\u201d or \u201csending\u201d or the like, refer to the action and processes of a computer system, or similar electronic computing device, that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical (electronic) quantities within the computer system's registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage, transmission or display devices.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,000,000, issued on Dec. 7, 1999 entitled \u201cExtendible Method and Apparatus for Synchronizing Multiple Files on Two Different Computer Systems\u201d and assigned to the assignee of the present invention is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Embodiments of the present invention are described in the context of a hand held computer system interacting with a desktop computer. However, it is appreciated that the present invention may be utilized in other types of computer systems, including embedded and distributed systems, where it may be necessary or desirable to synchronize the contents of computer readable information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","50"]},"Hand held computer system  is connected to desktop computer  through a communication link . Communication link  is often an asynchronous serial data link, for example RS-232. However, numerous wired and wireless communication links, including for example, infrared light, Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11 and universal serial bus (USB) are well suited to embodiments of the present invention. Communication link  allows the two computer systems to transfer information. In the example of , hand held computer system  is running a calendar (or date book) application program  and the desk top computer system  is running a complimentary calendar program . It is desirable for information entered into one program on one computer system, for example into calendar program  running on hand held computer , to be shared with another complimentary calendar program, for example calendar program  running on desk top computer system .","Synchronization is generally a process by which a plurality of copies of a database are maintained such that the information in all copies is the same, or synchronized. The copies need not be bit for bit identical. A synchronization process can accommodate different file structure, operating system and data media requirements. The copies are frequently on different computer systems, but it is sometimes desirable to maintain separate, synchronized databases on the same computer system. Synchronization allows modifications or updates (\u201cmutations\u201d) of information, for example, additions, deletions and\/or changes made to one copy of a database, for example a copy on a hand held computer, to be reflected to all copies.","These database copies are generally known as \u201cendpoints.\u201d In some literature the term \u201cfarpoint\u201d is used synonymously. An endpoint is generally a source or destination of records (individual data items) to be synchronized, e.g., a database, a communication channel, a device, etc. For example, it is commonplace to synchronize a desktop calendar system database with a calendar database on a hand held computer. In this example, the calendar database on the desktop computer is an endpoint, and the handheld calendar database is another endpoint. Endpoints are generally data structures in permanent, or semi-permanent computer memory, such as battery powered RAM in a hand held computer or magnetic media within a desktop computer. Endpoints may, however, be temporary, for example a buffer in a wireless data protocol stack.","Synchronization systems, including that described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,000,000, use a \u201cdouble headed\u201d conduit program to synchronize information between two endpoints. A double headed or two-ended conduit program manages all aspects of synchronization, data retrieval and data storage between two endpoints. In addition, two ended conduits are typically constructed to synchronize between two specific endpoints. For example, a conduit may synchronize between a contact list (phone book) database on a hand held computer and a contact list database on a desktop computer. If an application developer desires to synchronize with a third endpoint, e.g., synchronize the desktop contact list with an email application on the desktop computer (e.g., to share email addresses), under the prior art it would be necessary to construct a new and separate conduit to synchronize these two (second and third) databases (endpoints).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"]},"Desktop computer system  includes a plurality of synchronization (\u201csync\u201d) agents , ,  and , a hand held synchronization agent , endpoints , ,  and , and common synchronization manager . It is to be appreciated that the terms \u201cagent,\u201d \u201cengine\u201d and \u201cmanager\u201d as used herein refer to software modules designed to perform actions and methods described herein.","From the perspective of desktop computer system , hand held computer  comprises a single endpoint . It is appreciated that data stored in hand held computer  may be in a plurality of separate data structures.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, each synchronization agent communicates with a single endpoint. It is to be appreciated that a synchronization agent may communicate with other software modules, e.g., a synchronization manager software module, which generally do not represent a dataset nor are referred to as endpoints. For example, synchronization agent  communicates with endpoint , which is a contact list database. Likewise, hand held synchronization agent  communicates with hand held computer  as a single endpoint . It is appreciated that a wide variety of physical transport media are well suited to linking desk top computer system  with hand held computer , according to an embodiment of the present invention. Links may include, for example, asynchronous serial connections, universal serial bus (USB), ethernet, IEEE 802.11, Bluetooth, telephone lines and wide area wireless connections, e.g., CDPD, Mobitex and the like.","To perform a synchronization of data, for example, contact list data between a contact list database on desk top computer  and a phonebook database on hand held computer , common synchronization manager  is initiated. Common synchronization manager  requests information from synchronization agent  and hand held synchronization agent . A uniform communication protocol may be used between common synchronization manager  and the agents. Synchronization agent  accesses endpoint  that contains contact list data. Hand held synchronization agent  accesses hand held computer .","Synchronization agent  and hand held synchronization agent  provide requested information to common synchronization manager  that then provides the information to common synchronization engine . Generally on a record by record basis, common synchronization engine  will determine if the data in either endpoint, e.g., hand held endpoint  or endpoint  needs to be updated. If, for example, the contact information in hand held endpoint  has been updated, common synchronization engine  will send the updates to common synchronization manager  for forwarding to synchronization agent . Synchronization agent  will update the information in endpoint .","It is to be appreciated that synchronization may occur between any two or more synchronization agents, and that synchronization does not require hand held computer , according to an embodiment of the present invention. For example, an e-mail application may utilize e-mail database . Synchronization agent  may participate in the synchronization session described above in order to receive any updates to e-mail addresses entered into hand held endpoint  or contact list data . Alternatively, synchronization agent  may participate with synchronization agent  in a separate synchronization session and receive updates in this manner.","For example, assume that an e-mail address is changed on hand held computer . As previously described, hand held endpoint may synchronize with contact list database , via their associated single ended synchronization agents (, ) and common synchronization manager . At the end of that synchronization session, contact list data  is synchronized with the phone book database of hand held computer . In a subsequent synchronization session, without the participation of hand held computer , e-mail database  may be synchronized with contact list database . As a result of this second synchronization, e-mail database  receives the e-mail address previously updated on hand held computer .","It is to be appreciated that a synchronization manager need not be a single module residing on a single computing system, rather it may be distributed into multiple modules on one or more computing systems in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. One method of distributing a synchronization manager across multiple systems is to use a synchronization manager on one system as an endpoint of a synchronization agent coupled to a sync manager on another system.","There are numerous advantages of a single ended synchronization agent when compared to the prior art. First, a single ended synchronization agent need only \u201cunderstand\u201d the data formatting and storage requirements of a single database. In contrast, the prior art double ended synchronization conduits were required to implement the data formatting and storage requirements of both databases, which were typically radically different, residing, for example, on different types of computers. Second, the single ended synchronization agent does not perform the critical reconciliation of data that is fundamental to synchronization. A common synchronization engine (e.g., common synchronization engine ) performs this task. Further, most single ended synchronization software modules will not have to communicate with, or process data on a hand held computer. It is anticipated that manufacturers of hand held computers will provide a synchronization agent for these purposes. Even when there is no initial need to synchronize with other databases, the original developer of an application can facilitate later third-party enhancements by providing an initial (single ended) sync agent. In addition, a desirable feature of single ended synchronization agents is their modularity. As a result of such modularity, new data sources can be added independently, and no two agents access the same data source (endpoint) resulting in simplified change tracking.","With one common synchronization engine, all synchronization and reconciliation logic, including possible multiple methodologies, are common to all synchronization processing. Centralizing this function enables a single group of highly skilled practitioners to develop and maintain this critical software. In the prior art conduits, every conduit developer had to implement all synchronization logic and methodologies, resulting in widely divergent implementations of varying quality. In the prior art these numerous implementations often led to incompatibilities and malfunctions, resulting in poor user experiences and costly service calls. Such disruptions in synchronization may reflect poorly on hand held computer manufacturers, even though their provided hardware and software was not at fault.","A single ended synchronization agent moves data between its associated endpoint and a common synchronization manager. In order to accomplish this task, the synchronization agent is able to perform at least two functions. First, the synchronization agent is able to associate an object within the synchronization engine with a corresponding object in the agent's endpoint, and associate an object within the agent's endpoint with a corresponding object in the synchronization engine. These objects will typically be records of a database, for example contact list information for an individual.","Identification of objects is a rich field in the database arts, and it is to be appreciated that many methods of identifying objects are well suited to embodiments of the present invention. Objects may be identified with a global unique identifier, GUID. Objects in the endpoint generally may be identified in an application-dependent manner. It may be possible to use the endpoint's identifiers directly as GUIDs, but if the endpoint uses an incompatible system of identification, then a mapping should be maintained by the synchronization agent in order to match corresponding objects. The synchronization infrastructure may provide a persistent GUID mapping application programming interface, API, for synchronization agents to use.","A second function that is to be performed by a single ended synchronization agent is to deliver to a synchronization engine all data in the endpoint (e.g., database) that has changed since the last time a synchronization engine requested this same type of changed data. It is appreciated that a wide variety of methods may be used to identify objects that have changed in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. For example, one or more \u201cdirty\u201d bits may be set to indicate changes to an object and may be cleared after the object has been synchronized.","A \u201cpedigree\u201d is generally a record of change(s) of a database object, and may be used to indicate if an object has changed since a synchronization session. Co-pending, commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/159,461, filed May 31, 2002, discloses a novel pedigree system that is well suited to embodiments of the present invention, and is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Depending on the pedigree capabilities of the endpoint, at least four classes of synchronization agents are possible. An \u201cignorant\u201d synchronization agent has no concept of pedigree in its endpoint dataset. It is also unable to determine what data has changed in its endpoint since the last synchronization. An ignorant synchronization agent can only provide the full dataset during a query. A \u201csimple\u201d synchronization agent has no concept of pedigree in its endpoint dataset. It uses a local cache that contains a view of the endpoint dataset at the time of the last sync. A simple synchronization agent uses this cache to determine the delta between the data in the Sync Engine and in its endpoint dataset. It provides this delta during a query. A \u201cnormal\u201d synchronization agent uses a simple scheme to indicate a changed record in its endpoint, for example, like a dirty bit. This type of synchronization agent can provide a delta without using a cache, but cannot determine what has changed since an arbitrary sync session. A \u201csmart\u201d synchronization agent uses a rich pedigree scheme in its endpoint dataset and can produce a delta for any sync session.","In order to simplify the interface between a common synchronization manager and synchronization agents, it may be convenient to design the interface so that the common synchronization manager can only communicate with a \u201csmart\u201d synchronization agent that \u201cunderstands\u201d a particular pedigree system and a particular record identification system. In order to communicate and synchronize with databases that do not implement a chosen pedigree and\/or record identification system, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention it may be necessary to utilize an agent \u201cbooster.\u201d","An agent booster may be constructed through the use of \u201cpromoting\u201d application programming interfaces (APIs). The following example of \u201cboosting\u201d the capabilities of an agent\/database illustrates some relative shortcomings of some types of databases and how an agent booster may overcome such deficiencies.","Consider a very common type of database, a computer spread sheet e.g., endpoint (spreadsheet)  of , such as may be operated on by the \u201cExcel\u201d program, commercially available from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash. Excel databases (spreadsheets) are quite capable in terms of identifying individual data records, e.g., rows of the spreadsheet. However, typical spreadsheets have no concept of change. For the purposes of synchronization, this lack of a change history is a severe shortcoming, and aligns this type of database with \u201cignorant\u201d agents\/databases.","An agent \u201cbooster,\u201d for example agent booster  of , adds capabilities to the underlying database, such that the combination of the database plus the agent booster are more suitable to synchronization, and compatible with the common synchronization manager interface. In this exemplary case, an agent booster may implement a persistent cache that records the state of the database after a synchronization session. When called to participate in a subsequent synchronization session, the agent booster can compare the present state of the database with the cached version of the database to produce the information changed since the last synchronization. Preferably, an agent booster is able to interact with the database at a relatively low communications cost, since an agent booster will typically exchange more information with a database than is normally required in exchanges between an agent and a synchronization engine.","In this manner, the agent booster may determine differences (e.g., deletions, additions or changes to database records) in the database (farpoint) between a prior synchronization session and the present time, thereby promoting a formerly \u201cignorant\u201d agent to a \u201csimple\u201d agent. By further maintaining a synchronization clock and a pedigree, the agent booster may report coverage and respond to agenda and query synchronization rounds, thereby promoting a \u201csimple\u201d agent to a \u201csmart\u201d agent. As a result, the agent booster has upgraded the capabilities of the database as seen by a synchronization engine, and the combination is capable of rich synchronization. An agent booster may communicate directly with an endpoint, for example agent booster  communicating directly with endpoint , or an agent booster may communicate with a less capable agent, for example sync agent , that communicates with an associated endpoint. It is appreciated that no changes need be made to the operation or storage formats of the underlying database, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. It is anticipated that standard booster agents will be made available so that software developers may write agents to interface with ignorant, simple or normal data sources, and use such standard boosters to promote such agents.","Databases with greater pedigree capabilities than \u201cignorant\u201d agents\/databases may also be \u201cboosted\u201d or upgraded. For example, a \u201csimple\u201d agent as described previously, may implement a local cache of its farpoint as described above. A booster for a simple agent may only be required to maintain a synchronization clock and\/or pedigree to implement the correct interface to a smart agent. Similarly, a \u201cnormal\u201d agent may have a limited capacity to identify changed records from previous synchronization sessions. A booster for this type of agent can maintain a synchronization clock and pedigree, then apply coverage to the change history maintained by the normal agent and its database\/farpoint.","In order to describe some of the functions and methods used in embodiments of the present invention, the interchange of data between agents during a synchronization session is often modeled as a \u201ctea party.\u201d The analogy is extended to include \u201cinviting\u201d synchronization agents to attend the parties. The parties usually have a \u201ctheme\u201d which is generally understood to be a description of the type of information being synchronized, for example calendar information. Synchronizing multiple data types will typically involve scheduling multiple parties with differing themes, inviting agents interested in those themes and the like.","An agent (single ended synchronization agent program) is a software entity that wants to attend one or more tea parties and is prepared to behave appropriately. Every tea party has a \u201cTea Party Theme,\u201d for example, that indicates the type of information to be synchronized. Agents attend tea parties because they are interested in the theme of the tea party. For example, the agent is associated with (represents) a database that includes the particular type of data.","The purpose of a Tea Party is to potentially exchange information between databases. The agents at a tea party exchange information. A Tea Party happens in three rounds, namely the Agenda Round, Query Round, and Report Round.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 3A"},"The Tea Party Scheduler  has a list  of Tea Parties and which agents wish to attend. For example, the first tea party on list  is labeled \u201ccalendar,\u201d and has a hand held agent and a desk top calendar agent as attendees. The Tea Party Scheduler operates by taking the first Tea Party on its list, in this case tea party  and giving it (sending the information) to the Tea Party Manager A software that operates the Tea Party. The tea party scheduler  and tea party manager A are components of the synchronization manager  described previously in .","A tea party consists of three rounds, an agenda round, a query round and a report round. The agenda round, e.g., agenda , determines what information will be exchanged during the party. This information is gathered during the query round and distributed to agents in the report round, e.g., report . The Tea Party Agenda  is a detailed list of questions assembled at the beginning of a Tea Party. It is used to later query agents. The Tea Party Report , produced during the Query Round, is the assembled answers to the questions on the agenda.","During the Agenda round of the tea party, the tea party manager presents each attending agent, e.g., hand held agent  and desktop calendar agent , with a questionnaire that contains two questions: \u201cWhat questions do you have for the Agents at this party?\u201d and \u201cWhat kind of questions do you feel qualified to answer?\u201d These questions typically are answered by statements of coverage. For example, \u201cI am able to answer questions (provide information) up to a given coverage, and need information beyond that coverage.\u201d","In a Query round of a tea party, the tea party manager may present an attending agent with a custom questionnaire that contains one or more questions received from one or more other agents during the agenda round of the party. The tea party manager will only present a custom questionnaire to an agent if its response during the agenda round indicated expertise sufficient to answer all or part of the enclosed questions. The tea party manager presents the agents' Query questionnaire responses to the synchronization engine. The synchronization engine then synchronizes these responses. Generally, a synchronization engine will store all received answers in a cache, which may be temporary or permanent.","The tea party manager presents each attending agent with a custom report containing answers to the questions posed by the agents (during the agenda round) in the query round. The tea party manager compiles this report by presenting each agent's agenda questions to the synchronization engine. The synchronization engine consults the local data cache it constructed during the query round to determine the available answers.","The Tea Party Manager gets a description of a Tea Party from the Tea Party Scheduler  software module. The Tea Party Manager then conducts the Tea Party according to the proper Tea Party Procedure.","To initiate a tea party, the Tea Party Manager contacts each synchronization agent. Each agent responds by indicating whether or not they are willing to attend the Tea Party. If no agents want to attend the party, then the party is cancelled.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 3B","b":"370"},"In step , a tea party is scheduled. Tea parties can be scheduled for many reasons, e.g., in response to a question received during a previous tea party or in response to a specific event, for example a single from a synchronization cradle.","In step , agents are invited to the tea party. In step , agents that have indicated a desire to attend the tea party are asked questions as to what questions the agents have for other participants in the tea party, and as to what information the agents can supply. These questions form an agenda for the tea party. As discussed above, the questions take the form of \u201cWhat does a specific agent know?\u201d and \u201cWhat does a specific agent want to know?\u201d These questions typically are answered by statements of coverage. For example, a specific agent is able to answer questions (provide information) up to a given coverage, and it requests information beyond that coverage.","In step , the questions on the tea party agenda are asked of the agents attending the tea party, and available answers are received.","In step , the answers received in step  are distributed to the agents of the tea party. In an optimization, the answers may be directed to only the agent asking a question calling for a particular answer.","In step , an agent receiving database information updates its associated database.","In addition to agents that synchronize with common databases, for example a calendar or phonebook databases, there may be a number of more specialized agents participating in a synchronization session. These agents are designed to perform special functions, and generally typical application programs do not access their endpoints. In some cases, prior art implementations of such functions required specialized two-ended conduits and specialized databases or endpoints on at least one side of the conduit. In contrast, as described previously, the present single ended synchronization agents communicate with a single database, for example a special database. Unlike the prior art two ended conduits, such agents are not burdened by the complexities of interacting with a second database.","One such specialized synchronization agent is backup agent  of . Such an agent may save data to disks, for example floppy disks or compact discs represented by removable media device  of , in a form that is partitionable and restorable. Partitionable implies that each dataset should be backed up to a separate disk file. This is to enable data transfer between users by distributing the file. This file should be restorable for any user.","A second type of specialized synchronization agent is restore agent  of . A restore agent can be complimentary to a backup agent.","Another specialized synchronization agent is a \u201chandheld agent,\u201d for example hand held synchronization agent  of . The hand held agent may participate in multiple synchronization sessions for a variety of types of data. As a participant in various synchronization sessions, the handheld agent moves data from a handheld computer to the synchronization engine, and moves information from the synchronization engine to the hand held computer. Because the hand held agent synchronizes all of the handheld-based data with the common synchronization manager, most developers of hand held applications may not have to write handheld code when developing single ended synchronization agents. Developers may only need to create code for moving data between the synchronization engine and their endpoint. In contrast, with the prior art double ended conduits, since one endpoint was a hand held database, developers of hand held applications were required to create a complete conduit.","Yet another special synchronization agent is device information agent  of . A device information agent collects the (primarily user selectable) preferences and features of the handheld computer so that they may be accessed later. It may store this data in a disk-based persistent store (not shown) on a desktop computer, and allows access to that information through a set of applications programming interfaces, APIs. It is to be appreciated that device information agent  communicates with hand held computer  through common synchronization manager  and hand held synchronization agent .","Install agent  of  is a specialized single ended synchronization agent to install code and data onto a hand held computer. Programs and the like may be downloaded, for example, from internet websites onto desk top computer system , transferred and loaded onto hand held computer  via install agent . It is to be appreciated that install agent  communicates with hand held computer  through common synchronization manager  and hand held synchronization agent .","A novel special type of synchronization agent is a caching agent, for example caching agent  of . Such an agent acts as an intermediary between a temporary working memory used by the Synchronization Engine (used for reconciliation during synchronization sessions) and a data structure in long term memory, for example a file on rotating magnetic media (not shown). Saving information to a long-term memory gives persistence to the results of sync parties.","During a synchronization session, all of the agents associated with a data type typically attend that particular synchronization party. However, in practice a number of situations may arise in which all agents associated with a data type are not available. For example, a handheld computer may not be connected to a desktop computer, a central synchronization server may not be online, or a wireless connection may be dropped. Thus, because not all of the endpoints may be present, the corresponding agents may not be able to attend the party. These absent agents are of course not able to process the deltas for the current synchronization session, and later will have to \u201ccatch up.\u201d The data in the persistent cache allows these \u201ctardy\u201d agents to do just that.","For example, database \u201cS\u201d is maintained on a remote server. Database \u201cD\u201d is maintained on removable media on a desktop computer. Database \u201cH\u201d is maintained on a hand held computer. The hand held computer and the desktop computer may be connected together to synchronize their common databases at a point in time during which the desktop computer is unable to communicate with the server. The desktop computer and the hand held computer complete their synchronization such that database \u201cD\u201d and database \u201cH\u201d are synchronized. At a later time when database \u201cD\u201d has been removed from the desktop computer, the desktop computer and the server are able to communicate. Due to the persistent store and a caching agent, database \u201cS\u201d can be synchronized, even though neither database \u201cD\u201d nor database \u201cH\u201d are available.","The Caching Agent will attend all sync parties whose theme implies the reconciliation of data. The agent will read from the persistent store during the query round and will write out a new file during the report round. A caching agent attends, as guest, Tea Parties with themes organized around databases for which it is configured to provide caching. During the Agenda Round it asks \u201cWhat's new with this database that I don't know?\u201d and lists itself as an expert on the data it has in its cache. During the Query Round it will receive queries for data that it has in its cache. During the Report Round it will receive updates to add to its cache.","A way is provided for a set of coordinating agents to request that information from their databases not be cached. This is for agent developers that do not want to have a disk-based representation of the data, e.g., for security reasons.","A role of a common synchronization engine is to detect and reconcile conflicts, for example records from two or more endpoints that have been modified, such that the reconciliation action will result in a \u201cconflicted\u201d state. Preferably, the conflict should be resolved in the application program that uses the database (e.g., on the handheld computer or on the desktop) since that application is capable of displaying the data to a user. Consequently, identified conflicts may not be resolved during the synchronization session. The resolution may be indefinitely postponed and the conflicted state may be retained.","A specialized conflict resolution agent  of  may resolve conflicts according to a set of user-modifiable rules. Such an agent should only resolve conflicts for a dataset when there is no other possibility for resolution.","Another specialized synchronization agent is a \u201cnotifier,\u201d or notification agent (not shown). This agent notifies application programs that \u201ctheir\u201d data, e.g., data in a database that the application program manipulates, is undergoing synchronization and should not be changed. A notification agent is typically called prior to and after a synchronization session.","It is to be appreciated that many of the typical functions of a synchronization system, e.g., backup, restore, install and application notification, are performed by specialized agents, according to an embodiment of the present invention. Consequently a synchronization system employing the present synchronization agents can be modular and extensible. This capacity differs significantly from the prior art, which generally is not extensible, or relies on a plurality of different mechanisms to achieve similar extensibility.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0086"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":"300"},"In optional step , an agent program retrieves information from its database that has changed since a last synchronization session.","In step  a synchronization engine program accesses first coverage information for a first database and second coverage information of a second database.","In step  a synchronization manager asks the synchronization engine the questions received from the first agent (representing the first database). This identifies or determines newer data elements.","In step  a synchronization manager program sends the unknown information to the unknowing agent program. Optionally, a synchronization manager program may detect that two or more agents have modified, non-equivalent information for the same record that is unknown to other agents. In this situation, the synchronization manager program may identify such information records as being in conflict prior to providing the new records to all (other than the providing) agents.","In optional step , an agent program conveys the (new) information to its endpoint.","In this novel manner, single ended agent programs in cooperation with a common synchronization manager and engine are able to synchronize databases. There are numerous advantages of this method over the prior art, including that the agent programs do not implement synchronization logic and agent programs are required to understand only a single database. These aspects of the novel single ended agent programs greatly simplify the design, construction and maintenance of this software when compared with the prior art. Such improvements in this field may result in greater deployment of higher quality synchronization systems than is currently present in the industry.","In order to more fully describe aspects of the present invention, portions of the application programming interface used by single ended synchronization agents are hereby provided. More specifically, a set of software functions that perform various synchronization tasks are defined. Also explained are some of the structures and parameters needed to correctly call these functions. It is appreciated that other implementations of such functions are well suited to embodiments of the present invention.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, single ended synchronization agents define an interface with a Synchronization Manager (\u201cSync Manager\u201d) and a Synchronization Engine. A Synchronization Manager uses this interface to coordinate, or schedule a synchronization session.","The interface can be viewed as notifications sent by the Synchronization Manager to the agent, however each of these notifications is accomplished by calling a corresponding entry point within the agent. The Synchronization Engine reconciles the data using an internal memory-based cache.","Preferably, the interfaces use handles to access data structures. APIs provide access information given a handle to that data structure. This method abstracts the data in a language-independent manner.","Agents are dynamically loaded by the Sync Manager and are executed by calling into their entry points. Note the difference between a synchronization agent as a dynamically loadable module, and an instance of that module during execution. There is typically only one copy of a particular Agent on the desktop computer, and that copy (the module) is loaded by the Sync Manager. During a synchronization session however, instances of a particular agent may execute many times. For example, an Agent Module may wish to attend multiple synchronization parties, and thus an instance of that Agent will be run for each session. It is also possible to have multiple instances of the same Agent Module attend the same party. This is recommended for Agents whose far point is a standards-based protocol that may be used by different applications. The following two entry points are called by the Sync Manager to interrogate an Agent Module to determine the number of instances and the synchronization sessions they attend.","AgentModuleGetInfo( )","This entry point is called by the Sync Manager to get global information relating to the Agent Module. This information is its unique ID, its persistence, and its version.","AgentGetInfo( )","This entry point is called by the Sync Manager to get instance-specific information from the Agent Module. Each time the Sync Manager calls this entry point, the Agent Module returns information about a specific instance of the Agent. This information includes a unique instance ID, a displayable instance name, and the theme where this Agent may attend.","SyncSessionBegin( )","This entry point is called by the Synchronization Manager after a request is made to begin a synchronization party.","SyncSessionPreSync( )","This entry point is called by the Sync Manager after SyncSessionBegin( ) has completed and before any themes are placed on the scheduling queue.","SyncPartyInvite( )","This entry point is called by the Sync Manager when it processes the next theme on the queue.

This entry point is called before any syncing is done.","SyncPartyAgenda( )","Each agent in the sync session is asked for its level of expertise and its area of interest. A level of expertise is the set of data questions an agent can answer. Later (SyncPartyQuery( )), the Sync Manager may ask this agent these questions. \u201cArea of interest\u201d is the set of data questions the agent requires an answer to. Later (SyncPartyReport( )), the Sync Manager may present the agent a set of answers.","SyncPartyQuery( )","During the agenda round agents indicated what questions they can answer. Agents also stated what information they require. For each question and answer correspondence, an appropriate agent is called and asked a set of questions it can answer. The synchronization manager gives the agent's answers to the synchronization engine. The synchronization engine uses the answers to compute the set of questions that remain to be answered. The questions then become the new agenda. The synchronization manager then poses these questions to the next agent capable of answering them.","SyncPartyReport( )","For each agent that asked a question, the report entry point is called with the answer.","SyncPartyEnd( )","This entry point is called into each agent attending a sync session when all of the synchronization rounds are finished.","SyncSession PostSync( )","This entry point is called by the Sync Manager when all of the themes in the queue have been processed.

Only that agent's entry point will be called.","During a synchronization session the synchronization engine will call the agents to inform them as to the state of the synchronization session and to give the agents an opportunity to direct and participate in synchronization parties.","A \u201ctheme handle\u201d is a handle (name) to the synchronization theme, or type of data being synchronized. This is an abstract data structure maintained by the Sync Manager. The agent can use a set of \u201cTheme APIs\u201d to access information about the theme.","There are two contexts in which themes are presented. The first is when an application makes a call into the Sync Manager to initiate a synchronization session. That application will pass in a theme. The theme indicates why the sync is being initiated, e.g., it could be a sync for a specific database (creator ID) or a manufacturer-defined theme created to handle special synchronization sessions. The theme is the theme of the entire synchronization session.","The other context in which a theme is presented is during the synchronization parties. In this context, the theme defines the purpose of the party. The theme for a party context is only valid for the duration of the party.","\u201cSynchronization Context\u201d is an abstract data structure maintained by the Sync Manager. The Sync Context encapsulates state information that enables information sharing and re-entrancy.

When a parameter is true (non-zero), the Sync Manager will call this entry point again, in order to get information about the next Agent Instance. When there are no more instances to talk about, the Agent Module sets this to false (zero.) Note that in most cases, there is only a single Agent Instance per Agent Module. The Sync Manager presets this parameter to false (zero), so an Agent Module need not modify it except in the case that there are additional instances.","SyncSessionBegin( )","This is the first notification sent out by the Sync Manager.

In the agenda round, an agent inquires of a common synchronization manager for updates to the agent's database.

Likewise, the agent also informs the common synchronization manager of the agent's \u201cexpertise,\u201d for example the information contained within the database. It is frequently the case that the inquiry and expertise contain the same information. For example, a database may generally be able to provide information to a certain level, and request any updates beyond that level. It is to be appreciated, however, that the inquiry and expertise may not contain the same information. For example, an agent representing a database contained on read only media (e.g., a CD-ROM), may describe expertise while making no inquiries, since its database is incapable of storing new information. A data logging agent, for example a program used to make a permanent copy of financial transactions, may appear as \u201cwrite-only\u201d memory.

The device pro-actively uploads coverage and delta information. Consequently, during a subsequent agenda round, the remote agent already has the required coverage and does not have to contact the remove device to retrieve it. Similarly, during the query round, the remote agent already has the device's delta information, and once again does not have to contact the device to retrieve it. This saves two rounds of communication as compared to a standard processing sequence.","In the second case the query is sent to the remote device but not actually answered by the remote agent in the (first) query round. It may therefore contain questions that were subsequently answered by other agents. Also the coverage of the remote agent is anticipated. If the remote device has alternative synchronization pathways then it might be more up to date than anticipated and receive information it already has. Further, if there is more than one remote agent, the limitation to one up one down may be effectively broken by having several sequential tea parties.","The third case avoids querying the remote agent for unwanted information at the expense of having a second upload. Unlike the second case, it avoids degenerating into multiple uploads and downloads via cascading tea parties. Like the second case it anticipates the prior coverage of the remote device. If the remote device has alternative synchronization pathways then it might be more up to date than indicated. Other agents may be queried to provide this unnecessary information. Sending it to the remote device can be avoided in the third case by the remote agent filtering it out, a task normally provide by the tea party manager.","The third case is the only case of the three in which the trip delay (latency) of communicating with a remote device is added into the total synchronization time. The first case avoids this because the remote device is the starting cause for synchronization. The second case avoids this by not starting a second tea party until the remote data is available.","The preferred embodiment of the present invention, N-way synchronization of computer databases, is thus described. While the present invention has been described in particular embodiments, it should be appreciated that the present invention should not be construed as limited by such embodiments, but rather construed according to the below claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 3A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 3B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
