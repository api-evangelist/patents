Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to measuring features and conditions of boreholes of wellbores in the oil and gas industry. More particularly, the present invention relates to a system for taking measurement of a diameter of the borehole after drilling and underreaming the borehole. The present invention also relates to a system for taking measurement of a diameter of the borehole simultaneous with drilling and underreaming the borehole. Additionally, the present invention relates to a method of verifying the diameter of a borehole during and after drilling and underreaming.","2. Description of Related Art Including Information Disclosed Under 37 CFR 1.97 and 37 CFR 1.98.","Drilling is part of a process for extracting a natural resource, such as ground water, natural gas, and petroleum, or for exploring the nature of the material underground. A well or borehole can be created by use of a drilling rig to rotate a drill string, which has a drill bit attached at its end in order to bore into the ground to a desired depth. Drill collars and drill pipe sections add length, weight and support along the drill string as the borehole deepens, and different types of drill bits cut into all types of rock formations and soil combinations. Drilling fluid or drilling mud pumps through the inside of the string, out of the drill bit by nozzles or jets, and up the annulus to the surface, in order to create the proper physical and hydrostatic conditions to safely drill the well. Additionally, the rock cuttings are removed from the borehole in the drilling mud circulation flowing to the surface.","After drilling a section of hole, steel casings, which are slightly smaller in diameter than the borehole diameter, are placed in the hole. Cement can be injected in the annular space between the outside of the casings and the borehole. The casing system strengthens the integrity of the new section of the borehole to allow for deeper drilling and other benefits. A series of smaller and smaller drill bits with corresponding smaller steel casing systems are used for drilling, such that a completed well includes holes within holes. In the prior art technology, the diameter of the borehole decreases as each section of the casing systems are put in place.","However, the latest developments in drilling require deeper and deeper wells, even super deep wells from holes five to six miles below the surface. The continuing reliance upon fossil fuels, in particular oil and gas, has pushed the drilling and exploration industry to explore ultra deep waters (water depths more than 2000 m) with super deep wells drilled to depths over more than 7500 m. The temperature, distance, and pressure conditions of super deep wells require a vast amount of resources to extract oil and gas. The newly extreme depths cannot be reached with the prior art technology because the decreasing size of the diameter of the borehole set a limit on the depth of drilling.","The industry response to form super deep boreholes has been reaming or under-reaming, which enlarges the diameter of the borehole by removing a layer of the already stressed and disturbed material caused by the drill bit. Reaming has been known in metalworking and machining to affect mechanical properties for a good surface finish. Applied in the field of wellbore drilling, an underreamer is an activated cutting tool on the drill string to enlarge the borehole. The typical underreamer has a set of retractable and extendible parallel straight or helical cutting edges along the length of a cylindrical body and is placed higher than the drill bit along the drill string. The cutting edges have an angle and with a slight undercut below the cutting edges for making initial contact with the sides of the borehole.","The adaptation of underreamers has lead to even greater challenges in the oil and gas industry. Controlling the drill bit and the drill string in the borehole has always required special attention. Measurement While Drilling (MWD) and Logging While Drilling (LWD) systems collect real-time data, which is data viewed while drilling, and memory stored data, which is data viewed after the bit run. The data helps to ensure the proper direction and conditions of the drilling and record formation properties. MWD systems measure and record readings, such as natural gamma ray, borehole pressure, temperature, resistivity, formation density, etc., and the data can be transmitted as fast as real-time via mud pulser telemetry, wired drill pipe or other means. Stabilizers added on the drill string are mechanical solutions to reduce drill string vibrations, improve directional hole accuracy, and improve drilling efficiency. At the newly extreme distances and depths achieved with reamers, it becomes even more important for accurate monitoring because of the costs and resources invested, and it has become even more challenging with the underreamer positioned in the drill string. The underreamer is a separate cutting tool, so the drilling diameter of the drill bit and the larger final diameter, after the underreamer, are different. The prior art does not provide for the final confirmation of borehole diameter, after the underreamer and while drilling.","For measuring the borehole diameter, the present typical system is a wireline mechanical caliper tool, which collects a caliper log of the tracked measurements of the size and shape of a borehole, after drilling the hole section has been completed and after the drill string and drill bit have been removed from the well. The borehole diameter is an extremely vital piece of information for super deep wells because the borehole must be a particular size in order to fit the proper casing system. The extreme depths required cannot be achieved, if the boreholes become too small for the casings. The extending stacking of the casings cannot be supported or selected correctly if the borehole dimensions are too small. The wireline mechanical caliper tool verifies the borehole diameter as it is opened and withdrawn from the bottom of the hole; two or more articulated arms push against the walls of the borehole, taking hole diameter measurements. This prior art wireline mechanical caliper tool requires complete stoppage of the drilling operation and withdrawal of all drilling equipment from the borehole. As such, the wireline mechanical caliper tool and the method of using the caliper tool are very significant in terms of rig time and efficiency for the well.","In the past, various patents have been issued in the field of borehole diameter measurement. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,168,507, issued to Downton on Jan. 30, 2007, and published as 20030209365, discloses an invention to recalibrate downhole sensors. A first set of inexpensive and small sensors are located in the drill string adjacent to the bit, and a second set of more accurate sensors is located in a more protected location higher in the drill string away from the drill bit. As drilling progresses, the second set collects data to calibrate an offset of the first set of sensors. The invention discloses the placements of sensors away from the drill bit for better accuracy to measure for gas influx into the borehole.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,200,705, issued to Clark, et al. on Apr. 6, 1993, teaches a system for determining a dip characteristic of formations surrounding a borehole and a method of using a transducer array having longitudinally spaced transducers. The electrodes are located on the stabilizer blades to detect electric current from the coil antennas on a drill collar above the stabilizers. The electrodes on the stabilizer blades function as a sensor for electric current.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,130,950, issued to Orban, et al. on Jul. 14, 1992, describes an ultrasonic measurement apparatus. This patent is one of several similar patents relating to measuring characteristics in boreholes. The '950 patent clearly discloses the placement of a sensor in a stabilizer, even though no reamer is shown.  shows a stabilizer  with a sensor . This prior art only measures the pilot hole.","United States Patent Application Publication No. 20080110253, published by Stephenson, et al. on May 15, 2008, discloses an invention for downhole measurement of substances in formations while drilling. The method includes waiting for substance that is dissolved in the drilling fluid to be in equilibrium with any of the substance in the earth formation cuttings and measuring the substance dissolved in the drilling fluid downhole.  shows a sensor  placed away from the drill bit  and above the stabilizer .","U.S. Pat. No. 7,434,631, issued to Krueger, et al. on Oct. 14, 2008, teaches an apparatus and method of controlling motion and vibration of an NMR sensor in a drilling BHA. The sensor is disposed in the drilling assembly for making a measurement of a formation parameter of interest. A non-rotating stabilizer is disposed in the drilling assembly proximate the sensor. The non-rotating stabilizer is adapted to reduce motion of the sensor below a predetermined level during the measurement. This invention embodies the prior art with the sensor locked in a single non-rotating position on the drill string, so the errors in readings occur.","UK Patent Application, GB 2460096, published on Nov. 18, 2009, by Wajid, discloses an underreamer and caliper tool having means for determining bore diameter. In this publication, the tool integrates the enlargement of the borehole and measurement of the borehole diameter. The tool body attaches to the drill string and has expansion elements housing the caliper. The expansion elements are the cutting tool after the drill bit, and sensors measure borehole diameter during or after the underreaming. The specialized expansion elements with real-time data allow for control of the underreaming process.","At present, there is no LWD (Logging While Drilling) equipment available, that is dedicated to measurement during drilling and underreaming, i.e. MWD (Measurement While Drilling) systems, to determine the final well-bore diameter of any hole section that has been drilled. Many companies claim to be able to provide \u2018Real Time Well-Bore Diameter Measurements\u2019, but in reality, such data is apparently an \u2018inferred\u2019 reading, or a \u2018pseudo\u2019 caliper reading, such that the accuracy is questionable. The problem seems to be associated with a number of factors: the changing composition of the drilling mud affects the reading, the borehole is irregularly shaped, and the position of the bottom hole assembly and the sensors are not usually equidistant to the borehole wall, such that the reading depends upon the position of the sensor.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a system and method for measuring features and conditions of a borehole. Diameter of a borehole is one such condition of the borehole to be measured by the present invention. Other features and conditions of MWD tools may be adapted into the system and method of the present invention.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a system and method for verification of a borehole. In particular, the system measures the \u201cfinal\u201d diameter of a borehole, which is a borehole after drilling and after underreaming.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a system and method for verification of a borehole during drilling and underreaming in real time. In particular, the system measures the real time \u201cfinal\u201d diameter of a borehole, which is a borehole during drilling and underreaming.","It is another object of the present invention to eliminate the need for separate caliper measurements of the final borehole.","It is still another object of the present invention to provide a system and method for verification of a final borehole compatible with existing technology.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a system and method for verification of a final borehole for any drilling and\/or expansion operation of a wellbore.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a system and method for verification of a borehole with calibration means. In particular, the calibration means includes both a downhole and surface system for calibration of the sensor readings.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide a system and method for verification of a borehole before and after underreaming.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a system and method for verification of a borehole with improved accuracy of final borehole measurements.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a system and method for verification of a borehole to monitor the efficiency of the underreamer.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a system and method for verification of a borehole, which stabilizes the drill string while measuring the final borehole diameter.","It is still another object of the present invention to provide a system and method for verification of a final borehole in a cost effective and efficient manner.","These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from a reading of the attached specification and appended claims.","The present invention is a system and method for measuring conditions of a borehole, in particular for verifying a final diameter of a section of a borehole. The system of the present invention comprises a drill string, an underreaming means, and a tool body with a sensor. The drill string has a bottom hole assembly with a drill bit at a terminal end thereof and a circulation means for the drilling mud. The underreaming means or underreamer is attached to the drill string above the drill bit and has a passage for flow of the drilling mud. There are cutting edges on the underreaming means so as to enlarge a diameter of the borehole after being drilled by the drill bit of the bottom hole assembly. The tool body also attaches to the drill string, and the sensor detects the downhole conditions, such as the diameter of the borehole. The tool body is mounted above the underreaming means and has a diameter smaller than the underreaming means. The tool body is rotatably and axially aligned with the drill string, so that flow of the drilling mud is within the drill string, through the inside of the tool body, and then outside of an outer shell body of the tool body and up to the surface. The tool body can also have a plurality of stabilizer blades for drill string stabilization.","The sensor means can be comprised of an ultrasonic transducer with adjustable signal amplitude so as to measure diameter of the borehole. The sensor means has at least one fixed position, the fixed position being located on the outer shell body or on the stabilizer blades. The tool body has regular components for the communication and storage of the sensor data and communicates or connects to the sensor means. Additionally, there is a means for communicating information from the downhole location to a surface location. Any known transmission method, such as downhole to surface telemetry sub, mud pulsar or wireless connection link to third party pulsar, or wired pipe, can be used.","The system of the present invention may also include a means for calibrating the sensor on the tool body. When the circulation means for the drilling mud reaches the surface location, there is a return mud flow line. The means for calibrating interacts with this return mud flow line or with the mud through the drill string. The calibrating means for the sensor is comprised of transducers on an interior of the tool body in fluid connection to the circulation system of the drilling mud through the drill string and\/or on a surface location in fluid connection with the circulation system of the drilling mud. A first ultrasonic transducer on the interior can be in the passage of mud flow inside or outside of the tool body, and a second ultrasonic transducer on the surface can be in the mud flow line at the surface location. A processor for comparing data from the first and second transducers allows adjustment of the sensor readings for more accurate data and therefore improved drilling efficiency. In particular, the first ultrasonic transducer is positioned in the passage for flow with a fixed gap spacing slot with a known diameter, transmitting a reading across the known diameter during drilling so as to record ultrasonic travel time across the known diameter. If the travel time for a known distance through the mud flow changes, then the sensor reading to the borehole wall should be similarly calibrated according to this change. The second ultrasonic transducer can be a surface calibration block with known dimensions in the return mud flow line, transmitting a signal reading across the calibration block, comparing properties of the drilling mud at the surface location and at the tool body. Similar to the first ultrasonic transducer, the calibration block has a gate with a fixed distance. The travel time for this fixed distance is monitored through the return mud flow. If the travel time for the fixed distance through the mud flow changes, then the sensor reading to the borehole wall should be similarly calibrated according to this change. The second ultrasonic transducer can be a back-up calibration means and requires time adjustment for the readings and the timing of the mud flow downhole and the return mud flow at the surface. The transducers for the sensor can be similar to the transducers for the calibrator.","The system of the present invention may also include an auxiliary tool body attached to the drill string. The auxiliary tool body has an auxiliary sensor means for detecting downhole conditions, which functions analogous to the sensor means on the tool body. The auxiliary tool body is mounted between the underreaming means and the bottom hole assembly with the drill bit, such that the readings of the auxiliary sensor are from a different downhole location than the sensor means of the tool body. The auxiliary sensor can also be correspondingly adjusted by the calibrating means in a similar manner.","The method for verification of a borehole, in particular for measuring a final diameter of a borehole, corresponds to using the system of the present invention. First, a pilot borehole is drilled using a drill string having a bottom hole assembly with a drill bit at a terminal end thereof and a circulation system for drilling mud. Next, a reamed borehole is drilled using an underreamer attached to the same drill string above the drill bit. The underreamer has cutting edges so as to enlarge a diameter of the pilot borehole to the reamed borehole. Finally, the diameter of the reamed borehole is measured by the sensor on the tool body of the present invention, above the underreamer. The method includes the use of the sensor on the tool body or on stabilizer blades on the tool body.","Communicating real-time information from a downhole location to surface location is another step in the method of the present invention. The step uses known technology, such as a downhole to surface telemetry sub, mud pulsar or wireless connection link to third party pulsar, or wired pipe. Another possible step of the method of the present invention is calibrating of the sensor, which takes the measurement of the reamed borehole. The step of calibrating involves adjustment by monitored drilling mud flow properties at a downhole location and\/or at a surface location. Still another step of the method of the present invention is attaching an auxiliary tool body with an auxiliary sensor to the drill string. The auxiliary tool body and auxiliary sensor detect downhole conditions, such as hole diameter, between the underreamer and the bottom hole assembly with the drill bit. The calibrating and auxiliary sensor allow for real-time monitoring with increased accuracy and precision.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIGS. 2A and 2B"],"b":["1","2","3","10","3","10","10","12","14","16","12","18","20","12","22","24","14","12","20","26","28","14","22","30","24","14","14","32","26","20","18"]},"The tool body  has a means for attachment  to the drill string , as shown in , the exploded schematic view of the system  of the present invention.

Accordingly, the tool body  has an application programming interface  housed inside the inner housing . The sensor means  can be comprised of an ultrasonic transducer  with adjustable signal amplitude so as to measure diameter of the reamed borehole . The ultrasonic transducer  can be comprised of a piezo-electric material.

The means for communicating  can be any known downhole to surface telemetry sub, mud pulsar or wireless connection link to third party pulsar, or wired pipe. The communication enables real-time data to be presented for monitoring. In this manner, it will be possible to determine the efficiency of the underreaming without stopping drilling operations and without withdrawing the drill string  for a prior art mechanical wireline caliper measurement. The data can be presented as shown in , wherein the horizontal axis shows diameter and the vertical axis shows depth. The planned drill bit diameter  and the planned underreamer diameter  are supposed to be set, but they are subject to wear in such conditions, and underreamers are subject to malfunction so that they may not fully extend when activated.  shows how the system  and method of the present invention tracks the reamed borehole diameter  as the underreaming means  becomes worn or becomes retracted. The system  also tracks the drilled pilot hole diameter . The minimum hole size  required for successful operation, i.e. fitting a casing into the hole and cementing in place is also shown. As an example, if the borehole must measure a minimum of 13.5 inches to properly allow for casings to be placed correctly, then the present system  provides this accurate measurement and assurance. The prior art cannot provide the same accuracy while drilling and relies more upon an algorithmic solution for the pilot hole diameter and speculated reamed borehole diameter. The system  eliminates the risk of boreholes that are too narrow to allow continued drilling and further operations that require a certain borehole size, which are essential to reach super deep resources and to establish super deep production of oil and gas.","Another feature of the system  of the present invention is shown in , , , , and .

The readings of travel time across the known diameter and through the drilling mud  can be continuously monitored. If the reading for this known diameter through the mud flow changes, then the sensor  reading to the borehole wall should be calibrated according to this change. For example, the travel time is 60 \u03bcsec to travel across and back from a 2.0 inch gap in continuous monitoring mode. If the travel time increases to 65 \u03bcsec to travel the same distance, then there is interference from the drilling mud . The sensor means  should be calibrated so that the travel time for the unknown diameter distance from sensor to borehole wall is interpreted correctly. If the travel time for the unknown distance is 60 \u03bcsec, then the unknown distance is less than 2.0 inches because of the calibration adjustment from the first ultrasonic transducer .","The second ultrasonic transducer  can be a surface calibration block , as shown in , with known dimensions in the mud flow line , transmitting a reading across the calibration block. Different from the transducers  of the sensor means , but still similar to the first ultrasonic transducer , the calibration block  has a gate  with a fixed distance. The travel time for this fixed distance is monitored through the mud flow. If the readings of travel time for the fixed distance through the mud flow change, then the sensor  reading to the borehole wall should be similarly calibrated according to this change. The second ultrasonic transducer  as the calibration block  is a back-up calibration means and requires time adjustment for the readings and the timing of the mud flow  downhole and the mud flow  at the surface. So, the system  of the present invention can at least provide adjustments for drilling mud  based upon the surface location, as a backup for adjustments based on both the surface location and the downhole location, for the sensor means  at the downhole location.","Another embodiment of the system  of the present invention includes an auxiliary tool body  with a means for attachment  to the drill string  and an auxiliary sensor means  for detecting downhole conditions, such as borehole diameter. As shown in , the auxiliary tool body  is mounted between the underreaming means  and the bottom hole assembly  with the drill bit , and the auxiliary tool body  similarly has a diameter smaller than the underreaming means  and the drill bit . The auxiliary tool body  can have analogous features to the tool body , such that the auxiliary tool body  is virtually identical, except for placement in the drill string . Thus,  shows an auxiliary tool body  having an auxiliary sensor means  for detecting downhole conditions, a plurality of auxiliary stabilizer blades , and an auxiliary means for communicating  information from a downhole location to surface location. The maximum diameter of the stabilizer blades  on the auxiliary tool body  is still smaller than a diameter of the underreaming means  and the drill bit , and the stabilizer blades  are non-cutting protrusions aligned with the drill string . The auxiliary tool body  is another stabilizer positioned below the underreamer  on the side with the prior art LWD tools.  shows the placement of the auxiliary tool body .","The auxiliary tool body  further includes a corresponding auxiliary sensor means , which can be comprised of an ultrasonic transducer  with adjustable signal amplitude so as to measure diameter of the borehole. The auxiliary sensor means  can be comprised of piezo-electric material. The auxiliary sensor means  can also be fixed in position on the outer shell body  of the auxiliary tool body  or on the stabilizer blades . The corresponding downhole-surface communication means, inner housing, power supply, etc. are similarly housed in the auxiliary tool body . The readings of the auxiliary tool body  provide pilot borehole readings similar to the prior art. In combination with the features of the present invention, the system  provides even more accuracy and advance notice of irregularities for the underreamer . For example, the operation of the underreamer  can anticipate a slower or faster drilling rate based upon the readings of the auxiliary tool body , which detect diameter deviations possibly due to rock formation or mud variations. The auxiliary tool body  can also contribute readings for the calibration means  in monitoring drilling mud  variations.","The method for verification of a borehole, in particular for measuring a final diameter of a borehole, includes the step of drilling a pilot portion of the borehole  using a drill string  having a bottom hole assembly  with a drill bit  at a terminal end thereof and a circulation system  for drilling mud . The circulation system  flows drilling mud  through the drill string  and back up to a surface location. Next, the method includes drilling a reamed borehole  using an underreamer  attached to the drill string  above the drill bit . The underreamer  has a passage for flow of the drilling mud  and cutting edges  so as to enlarge a diameter of the pilot borehole to the reamed borehole. The method further includes measuring a diameter of the reamed borehole by a sensor  on a tool body  attached to the drill string  and mounted above the underreamer . Communicating real-time information from a downhole location to surface location is another step of the method of the present invention. Known downhole to surface telemetry sub, mud pulsar or wireless connection link to third party pulsar, or wired pipe transmit the sensor readings for use during drilling. The method of the present invention provides a more accurate final borehole verification because the measurement is taken after all cutting of the borehole has been completed, unlike the prior art LWD tools.","The method for verification of a borehole may also specifically incorporate measuring from an ultrasonic transducer, sometimes piezo-electric, with adjustable signal amplitude as the sensor , wherein the sensor  is fixed in position. This fixed position can be located on the outer shell body  or on said stabilizer blades . Sensors at any one of these locations can provide the data for the present invention. More than one location may have a sensor, so that more data is used to make the measurements even more precise. Each location has particular advantages. For example, the sensor placement on the stabilizer blades  increases accuracy of the reading because of proximity to the borehole wall and reduced drilling mud interference with the ultrasonic signal passing through the drilling mud. The transducers  of the sensor means  must be able to interact with the borehole wall in placement on the tool body  in order to take a measurement for verification.","Another step of the method of the present invention is calibrating the sensor  of the tool body  by a means for calibrating  comprised of transducers , on an interior  of the tool body  in fluid connection to the circulation system  of the drilling mud  through the drill string  and\/or on a surface location  in fluid connection with the circulation system  of the drilling mud  in the mud flow line  at the surface. Thus, the means for calibrating  can include a first ultrasonic transducer  in the passage  for flow of the tool body  and a second ultrasonic transducer , which can be a calibration block , in the mud flow line  at the surface location. The passage  forms a flow path for the drilling mud  through the tool body . Data processed from the first and second transducers  and  allow adjustment of the data from the sensor  during drilling. The calibration corrects deviations caused by changes in drilling mud  properties, such that the final verification of the reamed borehole diameter is more precise and accurate. Specifically, the first ultrasonic transducer  is positioned in the passage for flow with a known diameter, transmitting a continuous reading across the known diameter during drilling so as to record travel time across the known diameter. Similarly, the second ultrasonic transducer  is a surface calibration block  with known dimensions placed in the mud flow line , transmitting a continuous reading across the calibration block. Any change in the continuous readings at either or both transducers  means that ultrasonic readings are being affected by changes in the drilling mud , such that the sensor  requires adjustment for a more accurate reading. Either transducer  can be used to adjust the readings of the transducers  of the sensor means , so the calibration block  can be a back up for the means for calibrating  downhole, that is, first transducer  in the passage , if there is a disruption in downhole communication means.","Still another step of the method for verification of a borehole includes attaching an auxiliary tool body  with an auxiliary sensor  to the drill string . The auxiliary sensor  detects downhole conditions, such as borehole diameter, as an LWD tool on the bottom hole assembly . The auxiliary tool body  is mounted between the underreamer  and the bottom hole assembly  with the drill bit , such that the auxiliary sensor  functions analogous to other prior art LWD tools, measuring the pilot borehole conditions. Similar to the tool body , measurement with the auxiliary tool body  includes the auxiliary tool body  having a diameter smaller than the underreamer  and drill bit  and a plurality of stabilizer blades . The auxiliary sensor  makes the same adjustments for fixed placement, such as on the stabilizer blades , communicates to the surface location, and is calibrated as the tool body . The auxiliary sensor means  may also contribute drilling mud  data for the calibration means . The additional sensor data provides additional precision and accuracy for analysis of the real-time data because the pilot borehole data is based upon actual real-time data, instead of the actual bit diameter of the drill bit. While drilling is proceeding, the real-time hole diameter signal information can be transmitted from down-hole, to the surface, by traditional methods i.e. telemetry sub (or mud pulsar or wireless connection link to third party pulsar), or through wired pipe (inteli-pipe), so as to provide real time hole diameter information, while drilling; named DBD (Drilling Bore-Hole Data). The method of the present invention constantly assesses the impact of wear on the drilling tools to prevent miscalculations that may cause inefficiency during the drilling process.","The system and method for verification of a borehole of the present invention improves the determination of the \u201cfinal\u201d diameter of a borehole, which is a borehole after drilling and after underreaming in real time. The present invention takes an actual measurement, which is more accurate than the measurements, which currently may use algorithmic calculations. The present invention has real-time capability, in addition to stored memory, so that adjustments in the drilling program can be made before excessive expenses are incurred. Also, the drilling operation does not have to stop in order to run a wireline mechanical caliper through the borehole for a hole diameter log. Furthermore, the system of the present invention is compatible with existing technology and can be applied to any expansion operation of a wellbore. It is conceivable that reamer technology may advance with cutting edges and adjustable diameters, and the present invention can be integrated in any version of an underreamer and bottom hole assembly.","The system and method for verification of a borehole with calibration means is another important innovation. A down-hole and surface calibration block allows changes in the drilling fluid, which is flowing down through the drill string and up the annulus, to be monitored, and the travel-time (echo signal or attenuation) over an unknown distance (sensor to bore-hole wall) can be automatically corrected to allow for any changes in the drilling fluid (mud) properties, by using the downhole calibration sensor and\/or the calibration block sensor at the surface to make corrections to the changes in attenuation or time of flight of the stand-off (gap between sensor and bore-hole wall) due to changes in the drilling mud. The placement of the tool body is also a stabilizer for the drill string itself as well. As a stabilizer, no actual drilling and reaming action is performed, which reduces risk of damage and disruption to the invention.","Another unique feature of this application, is that for comparison, the sensor and auxiliary sensor in the bottom hole assembly provide data from above and below reaming, thereby enabling a comparison between lower and upper signal readings. A longer travel time (echo signal), through the mud column in the annulus, with the ultrasonic sensor, would indicate that the reamed hole is larger than the pilot hole, which has been drilled with the smaller diameter drill bit and will have a faster travel time (echo signal) indicating a smaller gap between the sensor and the borehole wall.","Another advantage of the real time data of the present invention is that the system is dedicated to focusing on the final diameter of the borehole, and will be calibrated to the correct drilling mud properties. So, a more accurate reading of the annulus spacing between the sensors and the final (reamed) borehole wall will be achieved. The sensors will operate and emit a continuous signal, thereby recording hole diameter information continuously, i.e. while the BHA (Bottom Hole Assembly) is rotating and moving down (i.e. while drilling), or whether moving up or down (i.e. while off bottom or tripping), or stationary (i.e. while circulating).","The system provides more accuracy and precision before and after underreaming, which monitors how well the underreamer functions. To enable this greater accuracy, the auxiliary tool body with auxiliary sensor can be run below the reamer, in the pilot hole, which allows a comparison between the pilot hole ultrasonic signal below the reamer and the reamed hole ultrasonic signal in the larger diameter reamed hole. These ultrasonic signal readings will be tracked against time and drilled depth, for comparison, and the data will give indications of whether the reamer is cutting a correct gauge hole size, or whether the underreamer or reamer has failed to activate, so the \u2018pilot hole\u2019 and \u2018reamed hole\u2019 ultrasonic signals will be the same, showing that the borehole diameters are the same. The data may also show whether the underreaming means temporarily opened and then closed unexpectedly. As illustrated in , the \u2018pilot hole\u2019 ultrasonic signals  and \u2018reamed hole\u2019 ultrasonic signals  would initially start off reading different borehole diameters and would gradually or suddenly converge, indicating that the hole was not being reamed correctly. If the \u2018reamed hole\u2019 ultrasonic readings gradually began to converge with the \u2018pilot hole\u2019 readings, then it would indicate that the reamer was wearing and the hole was becoming \u2018tapered\u2019.","As such, the system and method of the present invention provide a cost effective and efficient alternative to the prior art technology.","The foregoing disclosure and description of the invention is illustrative and explanatory thereof. Various changes in the details of the illustrated construction can be made without departing from the true spirit of the invention."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A and 2B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 7"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
