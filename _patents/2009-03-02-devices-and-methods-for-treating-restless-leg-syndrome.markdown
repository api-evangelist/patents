title: Devices and methods for treating restless leg syndrome
abstract: An exemplary system for generating a counter-stimulation in a patient suffering from RLS includes a device configured and arranged to generate a counter-stimulation in a patient suffering from RLS, the counter-stimulation of an amplitude, intensity, and time duration lower than that which would wake the patient and higher than that sufficient to relieve RLS, or sufficient to relieve RLS symptoms and allow the patient to return to sleep, a controller configured and arranged to drive the counter-stimulation generation device, the controller being in communication with the counter-stimulation device, and a base configured and arranged to hold the counter-stimulation generation device adjacent to a patient, the counter-stimulation device attached to the base. An exemplary method of treating RLS includes selecting a patient experiencing RLS, and stimulating a portion of the patient at an amplitude, intensity, and duration sufficient to act as a counter-stimulation to RLS.

Field of Endeavor","The present invention relates to devices, systems, and processes useful to treat Restless Leg Syndrome.","2. Brief Description of the Related Art","In 1685 Thomas Willis, an 17th century English physician, published the first description of what we now term \u201crestless legs syndrome\u201d (\u201cRLS\u201d).(1,2) He characterized patients with this disorder as, \u201cWherefore to some, when being a bed they betake themselves to sleep, presently in the Arms and Legs Leapings and Contractions of the Tendons, and so great a Restlessness and Tossing of their Members ensure, that the diseased are no more able to sleep, than if they were in a Place of greatest Torture.\u201d In 1945, Karl Axel Ekbom coined the term \u201crestless legs syndrome\u201d and suggested a neurological instead of a psychiatric origin to the disorder.(3) Ekbom focused attention on the abnormal sensory component of the disease.","With development of \u201cSleep Labs\u201d in the 1970's, the sleep-robbing nature of RLS was objectively characterized.(4) In 1990 the American Sleep Disorders Association defined RLS as (i) disagreeable touch sensations seemingly originating in the legs, that (ii) come upon some nights and not other nights, and that (iii) are relieved almost immediately upon standing or walking. In 1999, a task force of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine summarized the then current understanding of RLS.(5) Diagnostic criteria were further expanded in 1995 and 2004 by international groups to include episodes occurring during the daytime when drowsy.(6,7)","Disagreeable touch sensations were cataloged as \u201ccreepy-crawly, ants crawling, jittery, pulling, worms moving, soda bubbles in veins, electric shock, pain, the gotta moves, burning, jimmy legs, hebbie jeebies, tearing, throbbing, tight feeling, grabbing, Elvis legs, itching bones, crazy legs, and fidgets.\u201d(7) With symptom descriptions as bizarre as these, it is no wonder that early investigators lumped patients with RLS in with patients with psychiatric hysterical (conversion) disorders. However, clinical responses to various categories of (8) drugs and to iron therapy and the presence of at least two genetically identifiable phenotypes all argue in favor of a physical and not a psychological origin to RLS.(9)","RLS is a common disorder: prevalence of symptoms 5 or more nights per month were reported in 3% of individuals 18-29 years, 10% in 30-79 years, and 19% in those 80 or older.(10) Age adjusted prevalence in this study was 10%. In a similar study, prevalence was 11.5% with half of those reporting RLS symptoms causing moderate to very severe discomfort.(11) Others have described a rise in prevalence with age but have set peak prevalence at 70-79 years with a slight drop off in people 80 years and older.(12) Whatever the peak prevalence of RLS, it is more common in older individuals than younger and it severely affects emotional well-being in the elderly.(13,14)","A study of 23,000 individuals conducted in France, Germany, Spain, and the UK concluded that 11.1% of the general population have RLS and that in 50% of patients RLS symptoms significantly disrupted everyday activities and personal relationships.(15) A companion study of over 15,000 individuals determined that 5% of the population had RLS attacks at least twice weekly.(16) RLS is now sufficiently common that in the 2007 issue of Time Magazine it was featured in \u201cThe Year in Medicine from A to Z\u201d.(17) Although quite common, RLS is not commonly recognized by primary-care physicians even when a diagnostic description is given by the patient to his doctor.(18) However, when primary-care physicians are made aware of RLS, they can identify RLS in a high proportion of patients.(19,20)","RLS can be early in onset (before the age of 45) with slow progression of symptoms and run in families, or it can come on later in life, involving one member of a family with rapid development of severe symptoms.(12,21-24)","Because RLS is common, it has been observed in association with a wide variety of other disorders and diseases. Some have interpreted these associations as causal links. Such causal interpretations need to be viewed with great caution. The list includes metabolic and hormonal abnormalities, pregnancy, peripheral neuropathies, spinal and brainstem lesions, decreased serum magnesium and folate levels, anemia, rheumatoid arthritis, amyloidosis, carcinoma, musculoskeletal disease, anxiety, depression, multiple sclerosis, cognitive defects, hypertension, blood donors, heart disease, reduced libido, social isolation, gastroesophageal reflux, migraine headache, chronic lung disease, caffeine use, varicose veins, sleep apnea, gastric surgery, drug withdrawal, hypothyroidism, acute intermittent porphyria, arborizing telangiectasia, cholesterol microemboli, diabetes, periodic limb movement disorder in sleep (PLMS), somatoform pain disorder, being Caucasian, and more.(2,25-40,40-45)","However, by 2007, only two published studies of patients selected from the general population accurately measured the association of RLS with other disorders.(46,47) These two studies found that diabetes, reduced renal function, and anemia are significantly associated but make only a small contribution to the overall prevalence of RLS. Even in the older age groups where the RLS is most prevalent, secondary disorders and diseases increase RLS prevalence by only 10-20%.","Unlike these two general population studies, many small associative studies have identified patients with specific disorders or diseases and then compared RLS prevalence in these selected populations with the general population or with controls. In a review of 16 publications focused on patients with end-stage renal disease on dialysis published between 1991-2005, 15 (93.8%) of the 16 studies demonstrated higher prevalence rates in these dialysis patients than in the general population.(36) In one study, 84% of patients with end-stage renal disease had RLS. To support this association, it has been observed that in some patients, symptoms of RLS dramatically decrease following renal transplantation.(48) Like RLS in others, in dialysis patients RLS leads to poor sleep and thereby to a low quality of life.(49) Patients with RLS suffer from daytime sleepiness, depression, poor concentration, and even fear of long-distance travel during which their legs may become restless while awake.(9)","In a publication examining RLS and pregnancy, four studies demonstrated prevalence rates higher than the general population, while one showed rates no different that those observed in the general population.(36) Others have reported an association of RLS with pregnancy.(50) This association is further supported by the observation that the frequency of RLS attacks drops dramatically following childbirth.(51,52) Goodman et al. present a very convincing reverse \u201cS\u201d shaped-curve showing a dramatic decrease in RLS episodes following delivery.(53) In another study of pregnant women, an association was observed between RLS and parity.(47) Women who had given birth to three or more children had a three times greater risk of having RLS compared to nulliparous women or to men.","Iron deficiency has been associated with RLS since 1945, although the connection between the two disorders is not clear-cut.(3,36,54) Correction of peripheral anemia does not always decrease RLS symptoms. Furthermore, most patients with RLS are not anemic. When studied by magnetic resonance imaging, iron abnormalities associated with RLS were observed in the substantia nigra of the brainstem.(55) Decreased serum ferritin (below 50 ng\/mL) and cerebral spinal fluid ferritin levels have been associated with RLS.(2) Patients with RLS appear to have a decreased ability to transport iron into the central nervous system through the blood brain barrier.(56)","A wide variety of peripheral neuropathies have been connected with RLS including cryoglobulinemia, Charcot-Marie-Tooth ataxia type 2, diabetic, and amyloid types.(57-60)","To prospectively evaluate the concomitant occurrence of RLS and varicose veins in a population seeking treatment for varicose veins, and to assess the therapeutic response of RLS to sclerotherapy, 1397 patients with varicose veins were screened for RLS symptoms by questionnaire and interview. RLS symptoms were present in 312 (22%) of the 1,397 patients. Sclerotherapy with sodium tetradecyl sulphate was performed on 113 RLS patients. 111 (98.2%) of 113 treated patients reported initial relief from RLS symptoms. Follow-up showed recurrence rates of 8% and 28% at 1 and 2 years, respectively.(61)","And finally, RLS has been associated with the phenomenon of periodic leg movements in sleep (PLMS).(30) In 1953, Symonds described an involuntary clonic-like movement of the lower extremities that occurred during sleep, often waking the patient over and over again at night.(62) In 1965, Lugaresi et al. documented the presence of PLMS in patients with RLS.(63) In a polysomnographic study of 133 individuals with RLS, Montplaisir et al. observed PLMS in 80.2% of these individuals using a one-night's sleep PLMS index score of greater than 5 (one of the many definition of abnormal PLMS).(64) However, PLMS has also been observed in association with other forms of insomnia such as narcolepsy, rapid-eye-movement sleep disorder, and obstructive sleep apnea.(7) It has also been observed in normals.(7) Because RLMS is associated with many diseases and disorders and with normals, patients with RLS comprise only a fraction of patients with PLMS. At best the diagnosis of RLMS is \u201csupportive\u201d of the diagnosis of RLM; it is not diagnostic.","If RLS is caused by one of these associated disorder or disease, and if correction of the associated disorder or disease can stop the symptoms of RLS, then treatment is straight forward: treat the associated disorder or disease. Except for pregnancy and some forms of anemia, these associative disorders or diseases are not generally amenable to treatment. For most of these patients, palliation of RLS symptoms is the only treatment available.","On the other hand, in the vast majority of patients suffering from RLS, there is no associated disorder or diseases of the legs.(26) That is, in most individuals, RLS is idiopathic or primary in nature.(65) Their affected limbs are no different than limbs of people without RLS. Skin, muscles, bones, nerves, arterial or venous circulation, spinal reflexes, electromyography, nerve conduction studies, and imaging examination are all normal in patients with primary RLS.(12,52)","In patients with primary RLS, the anatomic site of origin of RLS appears to be in the central nervous system above the level of the spinal cord and below the level of the cerebral cortex.(12) The site of origin may be at the subcortical level, perhaps at the level of the thalamus and cerebellum.(66)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"Whether secondary or primary, central to RLS is the nighttime onset of disagreeable somatic sensations that appear to originate in a leg or in legs. Of our five senses, touch is the most heterogeneous in character. Touch encompasses the sensation of pain and temperature, pressure and crude touch, fine or discriminatory touch, and vibratory sensation. A variety of specialized microscopic receptors or mechanical-electrical transducers are present in skin, subcutaneous tissues, muscles, tendons and ligaments, joints, and periosteum and interosseous membranes to distinguish different types of touch sensations, as shown in . These specialized transducers or filters include Pacinian corpuscles which are encapsulated, onion-like nerve coverings that sense deep pressure and vibrations in the 250-350 Hz range; Meissner's corpuscles which are oval structures surrounding nerve and located between dermal papillae and which detect pressure and low frequency vibration in the 30-50 Hz range; Merkel's discs which are spherical collection of cells that identify static pressure and respond to low frequency vibrations in the 5-15 HZ range; Ruffini's corpuscles which are elongated structures in the dermis that detect skin stretching and the sense of slipping; Golgi tendon organs, joint receptors, and muscle spindles that identify stretching, and free nerve endings that sense temperature and pain.(67)","Three distinct somatic sensory neuronal pathways exist for the legs. Each pathway begins in the leg and ends with a neuronal signals reaching the cerebral cortex and, hence, consciousness.","Pathway No. 1: When painful stimuli or changes in temperature excite the leg, they cause sensory nerves in skin to fire. These primary neurons then synapse in the ipsilateral dorsal horn of the spine with secondary neurons of the contralateral lateral spinothalamic tract. These lateral spinothalamic nerves then course up the spine reaching the thalamus on the opposite side of the stimulus. In the thalamus, these axons synapse with tertiary neurons that exit the thalamus and ascent in the internal capsule and terminate in the postcentral or sensory gyrus of the cerebral cortex.","Pathway No. 2: Pressure and crude touch nerves follow a similar pathway with the addition of fibers from the primary neuron for several spinal segments in the ipsilateral dorsal white matter column.","Pathway No. 3: Neurons that transmit the senses of fine or discriminatory touch, proprioception, and vibratory touch follow a different pathway to the thalamus. For the legs, the primary sensory neurons ascend in the ipsilateral fasciculus gracilis of the dorsal column of the spine to the ipsilateral nucleus gracilis in the medulla. In the nucleus gracilis these primary neurons synapse with secondary neurons which then cross the midline to ascend in the contralateral medial lemniscus to the thalamus. Tertiary neurons then ascend to the postcentral or sensory cortex, just as with other touch sensations. Since this wide variety of somatic leg sensation all reach the thalamus, it makes sense that the unpleasant leg sensations in patients with RLS are very diverse in character.","For patients with primary or secondary RLS, the terribly unpleasant touch sensations of RLS that often start during sleep are mapped to their leg or legs (and, much less commonly, to their arm or arms). Since most patients are not actually being subjected to bizarre touch sensations in the affected extremity, the sensations are, in effect, somatic hallucinations. That is, these sensations are perceived to originate in a limb in which no corresponding stimulus is present. For example, at the time some patients with RLS report that a leg feels as though worms are crawling in it, no worms are actually present to explain the sensations experienced. The phantom limb syndrome in amputees is a similar phenomena, where somatic sensations in the brain are mapped by the individual to a limb that is not present. They are not usually referred to as \u201challucinations,\u201d but they are.","A partial explanation for the hallucinations that begin during periods of sleepiness and drowsiness or during sleep in patients with RLS may be found in the neuronal circuit that exists between the thalamus and the sensory cortex, referred to as the \u201cthalamocortical loop.\u201d(67) Only two stable membrane potential states exist for thalamocortical neurons. During wakefulness, these neurons fire tonically which allows them to transmit information from peripheral somatic stimuli to the cortex or conscious brain (see Pathways 1-3 above). During sleep, and perhaps during times of sleepiness or drowsiness, the thalamocortical neurons enter an oscillatory state, become synchronized with the cortex, and disconnect the cortex from the outside world. When disconnected, the conscious brain gets its peripheral somatic sensory input not from peripheral somatic sensory neurons but from the thalamus and its varied inputs. The somatosensory brain is no longer looking at the external world; it is focused internally.","The primacy of sensory abnormalities in RLS\u2014as opposed to movement abnormalities\u2014was emphasized in a recent study published by pulmonary physicians (as opposed to sleep physicians) who noted that \u201cThe endorsement of twitching or frequent body movements in the current study was so frequent as to render it a nonspecific finding. We cannot draw any conclusions based on this reported symptom in this study, other than to suggest that asking about body twitching may not be useful in the clinical evaluation of patients.\u201d(37) The same authors noted that a consistent diagnosis of RLS could be obtained using a definition of RLS that requires \u201c . . . uncomfortable leg sensations a few nights a week or more that are worse at night.\u201d Abnormal brain somatosensory processing in RLS patients has been described.(68)","Prior to waking, the unpleasant sensations of RLS lead to leg movements seemingly as an unconscious attempt to diminish the amplitude of the disturbing sensations. Dysfunctional leg movements and their antecedent unpleasant sensations wake the patient who then seeks relief by doing something, commonly getting out of bed and standing or walking. However, even though standing and walking diminish unpleasant limb sensations, they do so at the expense of sleep. Over half of patients with RLS report waking with symptoms 3 or more times per night on nights they experience attacks.(15) Loss of sleep is the ultimate price paid by the patients who suffer from RLS. RLS patients with severe symptoms have the least amount of sleep of any sleep disorder with the exception of sleep-loss associated with mania.(66) The sleep-loss of RLS leads to a generalized decrease in quality of life similar to other forms of insomnia, such as sleep apnea.(15,69) RLS victims are more likely than normals to be late to work, miss work, make errors at work, and miss social events because of sleepiness.(37)","Two drugs are currently labeled by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of RLS: Mirapex\u00ae (pramipexole dihydrochloride), a nonergot dopamine agonist, and Requip\u00ae (ropinirole hydrochloride), a nonergot dopamine agonist. Both agents have a higher binding affinity with Ddopamine receptor subtypes than for Dfor Dreceptors. In two separate blinded studies of ropinirole, very large placebo affects were observed, suggesting that just the process of focusing attention on patients with RLS helps them considerably.(70,71) Off-label drug prescription for RLS is widespread. Many drugs, including iron preparations, benzodiazepines, opiates, and anticonvulsants have been used to treat RLS.(8) Some dopaminergic agents, such as the combination of levodopa\/carbidopa, have caused long-term side effects which include worsening or augmentation of RLS symptoms.(9) Drugs that influence the central nervous system commonly effect more than one region of the brain, making drugs less than desirable as a first line of treatment for RLS. McCrink et al. studied 16,202 individuals, 7% of which had RLS. They documented that health-related quality of life was actually diminished in RLS patients who used prescription medications to treat RLS symptoms.(72)","As previously noted, if correction of a patient's secondary disorder or disease can correct RLS, that disorder or disease should be treated. However, most patients with RLS have no secondary disease or disorder to correct or the secondary disorder or disease is not treatable.","To relieve the unpleasant tactile sensations of RLS, patients resort to all sorts of movements and stimulations of the legs including \u201c . . . walking about, stomping the feet, rubbing, squeezing or stroking the legs; taking hot showers or baths; or applying ointment, hot packs, or wraps to the legs.\u201d(73) As stated by Jones and Derodra, \u201cThe relief of symptoms produced by movement or rubbing may be due to the afferent sensory input effect.\u201d(25) Patients are spontaneously applying an overwhelming or swamping sensory input to serve as a \u201ccounterstimulation\u201d to the unpleasant sensations of RLS. Once up and doing something, RLS symptoms usually subside. However, the process of getting up and walking interrupts sleep. And interrupted sleep, over the long haul, leads to decreased wakeful functioning and diminished quality-of-life.","A simple device that could provide a pleasant sensation to overwhelm or swamp the unpleasant sensations of RLS, without fully waking the patient, might be a more desirable first line treatment of RLS than drugs. Counterstimulation is a known medical therapy. To treat auditory hallucinations, personal stereo music has been applied as a counterstimulation to overwhelm or swamp auditory hallucinations.(74) Similarly, to treat a wide variety of chronic pain syndromes, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation has been applied as a counterstimulation to overwhelm or swamp pain.(75)","If a counterstimulus could be applied to a RLS patient at the onset of an attack while the patient were in bed, and the counterstimulus could be applied with minimal waking of the patient, sleep efficiency might be improved. As shown by , which illustrates a flow chart showing grades of severity of RLS and types of treatments based upon severity, adapted from Chaudhuri, many patients with mild forms for RLS spontaneously apply a counterstimuli of one sort or another to allow themselves to go back to sleep.(9)","If the RLS patient's self-treatment proves ineffective or if it requires a degree of wakefulness incompatible with a good night's sleep, then a device that applied a counterstimulus without robbing sleep might be useful.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"]},"A commercially available boot which diffusely applies pressure to the foot and calf has been disclosed on the world wide web (club-cleo.com\/cleo-active-leggings-reflexology.html) and offered as a means of treating RLS.

Most of those that do seek treatment are adequately treated by teaching improved sleep hygiene. A few patients may only be amenable to treatment by dopamine, as the symptoms are so severe that counter stimulation of the patient does not relieve or prevent the symptoms. Thus, those falling in a middle group, who do not benefit from sleep hygiene training and for which neuro-active drugs are an extreme treatment, can particularly benefit from additional therapeutic options.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0096","num":"0169"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"top level RLS treatment matrix"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["RLS",{},{},{}]},{"entry":["symptoms","Mild Symptoms","Mild to Severe","Severe"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Patient","May be undiagnosed","Sleep is occasionally","Sleep is"]},{"entry":["experience","and untreated.","interrupted and patient","nearly"]},{"entry":[{},{},"seeks medical attention","continuously"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"interrupted"]},{"entry":["Treatment","Sleep hygiene may","Counter stimulation to","Pharmacologic"]},{"entry":["required","be sufficient therapy","prevent the sensory","treatment"]},{"entry":[{},{},"seizure provides","after failure"]},{"entry":[{},{},"adequate relief","of lesser"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"therapies"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Referring back to , an exemplary process of diagnosing and treating RLS is illustrated. With reference to Table 1 and , the determination that an RLS-sufferer has mild symptoms, , indicates that sleep hygiene may be sufficient therapy for the patient. When a determination is made that the patient's RLS is severe, , then other treatment options, such as pharmacologic treatment after the failure of lesser therapies, is indicated. In between, when a determination has been made that the patient's RLS is, thus, mild to severe, , counter-stimulation, to prevent the sensory seizure, can provide adequate relief to the patient, and is indicated. Particularly advantageous, however, are aspects of the present invention in which the counter stimulation of the patient is conducted within a stimulation window, with a level of stimulation high enough that it acts to counter the \u2018hallucination\u2019 discussed above, while being below a level which will awaken the patient.","Turning now to , an exemplary embodiment of a device  is illustrated by which stimulation can be applied to the patient's foot only, but can be applied to the bottom, top, side, or any combination thereof. With reference to , another exemplary embodiment of a device  is illustrated by which stimulation can be applied to the patient's calf only, to the shin, or in combination. With reference to , yet another exemplary embodiment of a device  is illustrated by which stimulation can be effected to the patient's thigh only, by applying stimulation to the front, back, side, or in any combination thereof.","For example, combined stimulation can be applied to the patient's foot and calf, as illustrated in , either in a stimulation sequence or in unison. With reference to , the counter-stimulation can take the form of the application of motion to part of the patient's body, e.g., a torsion device  can be used to flex the patient's ankle, which may flex unilaterally or bilaterally. In this exemplary device , the device is driven to produce the flexing of muscles and the sensation of motion to the patient's brain. The exemplary device  can include a portion  which, similar to the device , is shoe-shaped so that it follows the contours of the patient's foot, a hinge or pivot  to which the shoe-shaped portion , and an ankle cuff  also attached to the pivot. Not illustrated in  is a motor, linear actuator, or the like which is connected to the shoe-shaped portion  and selectively moves the portion  relative to the patient's calf. With reference to , an embodiment is illustrated which exemplifies a combined counter-stimulation, in which stimulation of all three areas (foot, lower leg, thigh) simultaneously, or any two in combination, is utilized. , which illustrates a cross-sectional view at line A-A in , illustrates that the stimulation can be performed around the full circumference of the thigh or lower leg; , which also illustrates a cross-sectional view at line A-A in , illustrates how stimulation can performed over only a portion of the circumference of the thigh or lower leg; the invention is not limited to application of counter-stimulation to the calf, as the illustration of  is merely exemplary.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0100","num":"0173"},"figref":["FIGS. 13 and 14","FIG. 13","FIG. 14"],"b":["140","142","140","142"]},"Further embodiments embodying principles of the invention involve the application of mechanical point pressure to the patient as a counter stimulation to RLS. With reference to , an exemplary device  includes a single (or array of) pneumatic cylinders, electric solenoids, inflatable balloons, or similar mechanical point pressure applicators  which can be used to apply a controlled counter-stimulation to a portion of the patient's body, here the bottoms of the patient's legs being illustrated by example; a pillow block  can optionally be provided for comfort, elevation, and to house the mechanisms and controls which activate the point pressure applicators. Similarly, with reference to , an exemplary device  includes a single (or array of) pneumatic cylinders, electric solenoids, inflatable balloons, or similar mechanical point pressure applicators  which can be used to apply a controlled counter-stimulation to a top portion of the patient's body; a blanket or pad  can optionally be draped over the patient's legs for comfort, and to mount the devices.","For embodiments employing pneumatic point pressure application, with reference to , one or more inflatable balloons  can be used for local pressure stimulation. Advantageously a cuff is not used, because a cuff is prone to cause blood movement, a treatment associated with venous disorders, which is too strong of a counter-stimulation for most patients to not be awoken. The focal pressure applied to the patient, according to principles of the invention, is sufficient to provide sensory input, but not so much as to move blood in the patient's venous systems and particularly advantageously does not wake the patient.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0103","num":"0176"},"figref":"FIG. 19","b":["180","182","184","186"]},"With reference to , yet another embodiment , complying with principles of the invention, also relies on the mechanical-touch principle to provide counter-stimulation to RLS. Soft or hard rollers  are used to drag or \u201croll\u201d on the patient's skin, in a manner similar to the rollers described with reference to . A blanket or pad  can be provided on top of the patient's legs, both for comfort and to mount the devices.","With reference to , electromechanical or pneumatic cylinders  embodying principles of the invention are illustrated for providing counter-stimulation to RLS. An electrical solenoid  can be positioned to provide local pressure stimulation, and can be electrically powered, e.g., 12\/24 VDC or 120 VAC, as at , to provide a pressure timing mechanism to control an \u201con\u201d pressure cycle and an \u201coff\u201d rest cycle. The pressure can be adjusted to drive the voltage applied to the solenoid. Additionally, the maximum and minimal travel distances of the pad\/rod , and frequency, can be made variable. The cylinder or cylinders  can be mounted to a wrap or other support , similar to such structures described elsewhere herein, with the pressure pad  directed toward the patient.","With reference to , air pressure can be supplied to provide hydraulic pressure on a \u201cpancake\u201d cylinder  to minimize the profile of the device. A controller (not illustrated) is provided to increase pressure to create more force on the cylinder rod, decrease pressure to reduce the force on cylinder rod, can ramp or the fluctuate pressure to create a \u201cmassage\u201d, and\/or can adjust the frequency and\/or amplitude to make the stimulation more vibratory.","With reference to , which are illustrations of cross-sectional views similar to prior figures, a touch and roll embodiment is illustrated. As illustrated in , circumferentially-applied counter-stimulation utilizes powered rollers , which may be solid or foam, and which drag on the skin or roll along the skin. Optionally, the surfaces of the rollers can be provided with an extra texture, e.g., dimples, for additional sensation. With reference to , localized transmission of a counter-stimulation for treating RLS can be applied by a powered roller, e.g., on one side of the foot, lower leg, or thigh, which likewise drags on the skin or rolls along the skin.","According to yet further principles of the invention, counter-stimulation for treatment of RLS can be produced by stretching the patient's muscle(s). With reference to an exemplary embodiment illustrated in , a device  is provided, such as an air bladder, pneumatic cylinder, or a simple mechanical lift , which causes the thigh muscles  to flex as the patient's knee is lifted. Similarly, the calf  is flexed as the patient's knee is lifted. The flexion of either or both of these muscles provides a counter-stimulation to RLS. With reference to , an exemplary device includes an air bladder or pneumatic cylinder  which can be positioned under the lower legs and feet of the patient; movement up causes the thigh muscles to flex and stretch, thus providing a counter-stimulation. With reference to , a footboard  is provided which, upon actuation of an appropriate mechanism to push the upstanding portion  of the footboard, flexes and stretches the patient's calf muscles, providing a counter-stimulation to RLS. By way of non-limiting example, the footboard  can include a relatively stationary platform  and a force transmission member  connecting the platform to the upstanding portion  at a pivot ; moving the member , e.g., by motor or the like (not illustrated) moves the portion  and flexes the patient's foot, causing a counter-stimulation.","According to yet further principles of the invention, counter-stimulation for treatment of RLS can be produced by mechanical vibration. With reference to an exemplary embodiment illustrated in , an electrical motor  provided with an eccentric weight  mounted to the motor shaft  can be provided which, upon actuation, rotates the weight and thus vibrates either a local region of the patient's body or, e.g., the entire leg of the patient to create a counter-stimulation to RLS. Another exemplary embodiment includes a pneumatic cylinder or electric solenoid which is driven to cause such a vibration, or a piezo-electric vibrator or speaker. With reference to and , the mechanical vibratory device(s)  can be positioned on top of the patient (), as with other embodiments described herein, with one or more electrical motors provided with an eccentric weight, pneumatic cylinder or electric solenoid , and\/or a piezo-electric vibrator or speaker .","With respect to using vibration as a counter-stimulation for RLS, the vibration can be provided with variable frequency and amplitude, from 1 cycle\/minute to 1000 cycles\/second. By way of non-limiting example, numerous devices can be utilized to create the vibration, including, but not limited to, a piezo-chip, a loudspeaker, a motor with eccentric weight, an electrical solenoid; and can be electrically driven (120 VAC, 12 VDC, 24 DC battery powered, rechargeable, etc.), and\/or can be driven by a pneumatic cylinder. As illustrated in , a series of vibrators  can be provided which wrap around the patient's leg or be applied to the leg, and can be turned on, run for a predetermined period of time, and turned off after a specified time.  illustrates an exemplary embodiment in which the vibrator  is localized, rather than being provided as a series of vibrators.","According to yet further principles of the invention, counter-stimulation for treatment of RLS can be produced by electrical nerve stimulation, muscle stimulation, or both. With reference to , an exemplary embodiment  includes a series of sensors and\/or electrodes  which are activated for muscle stimulation, nerve stimulation, or both. When activated for muscle stimulation, the voltage and frequency of the electrical energy applied to the patient is sufficient to cause muscular contraction, which provides the counter-stimulation to RLS; when activated for nerve stimulation, the electrical energy applied to the patient is sufficient to cause a patient's nerve to be stimulated. For either or both of these purposes, the electrodes and\/or sensors are driven by a controller , which controls the application of voltage or current to the electrodes , and which may be a simple timer, a complex controller, or other such device. With reference to the exemplary embodiments illustrated in , multi-circuit (circuits , ; electrodes A, B of each circuit) stimulation can be applied circumferentially around the, e.g., leg of the patient, axially, e.g., up and down along the length of the patient's leg, or both, using sets of electrodes . Alternatively, single circuit (A, B) stimulation can be applied laterally and\/or axially, as suggested in .","According to yet further principles of the invention, counter-stimulation for treatment of RLS can be produced by the application of temperature changes, e.g., hot, cold, and\/or alternating hot and cold, to the patient. With reference to an exemplary embodiment  illustrated in , a resistance heating element , Peltier device , and\/or a bladder  containing heating or chilling fluid is positioned on the skin surface, below the patient, and an associated (and unillustrated) control device controls application of heat and\/or cold to the patient's skin. In FIG. 's embodiment , the heat transfer device , ,  is positioned on top of the patient, mounted to a blanket or the like. , which are illustrations of cross-sectional views similar to other figures herein, show series of Peltier  devices to heat, cool, and\/or alternate hot\/cold to the patient around a circumference of a, e.g., limb, or a single device can be provided. Optionally, a series of fluid bladders  can be provided for holding and\/or circulating hot or cold fluid, e.g., water. Alternately, a series of resistive heating pads  can be provided.","According to further principles of the invention, counter-stimulation for treatment of RLS can be produced by application of a chemical to the patient's skin. With reference to , an exemplary embodiment  includes localized ports  or a porous membrane  positioned on the patient's skin, to dispense a preselected chemical, thus causing sensory stimulation. With reference to , one or more chemicals can be input to a bladder  or diffuser, and provided in either a pulsatile or continuous flow. A bladder\/diffuser, when used, can dispense a chemical such as Bengay\u2122, capsaicin, or DMSO, which provides an exotherm on dissolving into the skin. As indicated in these figures, the chemical application can be completely circumferential, or locally, non-circumferentially applied, where the bladder acts as a manifold for the chemical.","According to further principles of the invention, counter-stimulation for treatment of RLS can be produced by application of magnetic fields to a portion of the patient. With reference to an exemplary embodiment  illustrated in , one or more electromagnets  are positioned close enough to the patient for the magnetic field to produce a counter-stimulation. A controller, not illustrated, is provided to control the operation of the electromagnets, that is, to turn them on and off, alternate the current direction, rotating fixed pole magnets within a housing, or combinations thereof. Electromagnets, rotating fixed pole magnets, or either of these could be sequenced to give some vibration or touch sensation, if desired. As illustrated in the cross-sectional views of , electromagnets  can be positioned either circumferentially around a portion of the patient's body, or only on one side. In general terms, however, magnets can be provided which are: electromagnets which are turned on and off to pulse a localized magnetic field; rotating, fixed pole magnets which are rotated in a housing; and\/or a magnetic button or malleable magnetic rod.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0115","num":"0188"},"figref":["FIGS. 48 and 49","FIGS. 50 and 51","FIGS. 52 and 53","FIGS. 54 and 55"],"b":["350","352","358","356","354","360","362","364","370","372","374","380","382","384"]},"The sensory input drivers described herein are connected to a controller (not illustrated) which includes logic, either in one or more electronic circuits, or in a set of logical instructions which are provided in a memory, and with a processor which can access the memory and execute the set of instructions based on the signals received from the sensory input drivers, to drive one or more of the devices described herein to create a counter-stimulus for RLS.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0117","num":"0190"},"figref":"FIGS. 56 and 57","b":["390","394","392","396"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0118","num":"0191"},"figref":"FIGS. 58 and 59","b":["410","414","419","412","418","416","418"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0119","num":"0192"},"figref":"FIG. 60","b":["400","406","402","404","408","406","408","402","404","400","406"]},"In general terms, mechanical vibration used as a counter-stimulation to RLS advantageously is in a range of frequencies between about 50 Hz to 10 per minute, with amplitudes which can be frequency-dependent, ranging from about 0.002 inches to about 0.75 inch in amplitude. While other frequencies and amplitudes can be used, these ranges are preferred. Determining the best combination of frequency and amplitude of the mechanical vibration for a particular patient can be easily performed by simple trial and error.","In general terms, temperature cycling used as a counter-stimulation to RLS advantageously is in a range for heating the pad or sensor from the ambient skin temperature up to about 106\u00b0 F., although temperatures up to 120\u00b0 F. can also be beneficial. For cooling, the pad\/sensor is at a temperature from about ambient skin temperature down to 62\u00b0 F., although a temperature as low as 52\u00b0 F. can also be beneficial. One exemplary cycle could include the following: from ambient temperature, heat to skin to a target temperature (e.g., 106\u00b0 F.) within 2-20 seconds; hold the temperature at the target temperature for 2-20 seconds; and then cool, either passively or actively, down to ambient temperature; and rest for between 2 seconds and one minute. Another exemplary cycle could include the following: from ambient temperature, cool to skin to a target temperature (e.g., 62\u00b0 F.) within 2-20 seconds; hold the temperature at the target temperature for 2-20 seconds; and then heat, either passively or actively, up to ambient temperature; and rest for between 2 seconds and one minute. The total cycle time can be between about 6 second to 90 seconds for ramping up the temperature, maintaining temperature, and ramping down, with a \u201crest\u201d period of 2 seconds to one minute.","In general terms, tissue massaging used as a counter-stimulation to RLS advantageously is effected with a contact surface against the skin of the patient which is domed, e.g., hemispherical, with an outer diameter between about 0.5 inch and 1.0 inch, and with a linear motion into the patient's skin of between 0.01 inches and 1.5 inches. While this motion can be controlled with a stepper motor to control motion and flexibility of the design, other devices can also be used. The deflection time of, e.g., the jack illustrated in , should be from 0.5 seconds to 5 seconds, with a hold time of between about 1 and 10 seconds, a relaxation deflection time of 0.5 to 5 seconds, and a rest time of 1 to 30 seconds.","More timing functions, particularly for continuous, low-amplitude vibration, and starting and stopping the vibration for varied periods of time, is also beneficial. By way of a non-limiting example, a timing relay can be used to cycle vibrating motors on and off, with timing cycles ranging from 1 second to 180 seconds on, and \u201coff times\u201d ranging from several seconds to 3 minutes. Typical, however, times for use are 30 seconds on, with a 5 to 10 second off period. The relay cycles in this manner for 5 minutes to relieve symptoms, although up to 20 minutes of cycling can be used to alleviate RLS symptoms completely through the night.","Whether vibration, heat, cold, or massage, a range of operation from 5 minutes to 30 minutes should be sufficient to act as a counter-stimulation for many patients. At the end of cycling, a ramp down in intensity of the stimulation may also be beneficial, so as not to waken or alarm the patient due to sudden stoppage which might reawaken the patient if they have fallen back asleep. The counter-stimulating vibration may be applied to the patient when the patient is awake, at a level which allows the patient to fall asleep, and insufficient to prevent the patient from falling asleep.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0125","num":"0198"},"figref":"FIG. 61"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0126","num":"0199"},"figref":"FIGS. 62 and 63","b":["420","420","420","420"]},"Turning back to the drawing figures, the exemplary device  includes a front shell  and a rear shell , one or both formed of a relatively stiff, preferably polymeric material, e.g., polyethylene or polypropylene; when only one of the shells is formed of the stiff material, the other can be formed of a flexible material, or can be not included at all in the device.

The shells , , when two shells are provided, are held together and to the patient by at least one, and preferably a pair of bands , , positioned at the top and bottom of the shell(s). The band can be simple elastic bands, or are more preferably adjustable, e.g., including hook-and-loop-pile type or other fastener systems (e.g., Velcro), so that the device  can be adjusted to the patient.","At least one, and advantageously several counter-stimulation devices  are attached or mounted to the shells , . The counter-stimulation devices  can take any of the forms described herein. In one embodiment, the counter-stimulation device  is one that produces mechanical vibrations, and can either be in contact with the patient's skin through the inside surface of the shells , , or can also vibrate the entire shell , , to produce counter-stimulation. The embodiment illustrated in  includes devices  on both the front  and rear  shells, and the upper and lower portions thereof; more or fewer devices  can be provided as needed for any particular patient in order to create an adequate counter-stimulation vibration. The controllers and energy sources which drive the devices  are not illustrated so as to not obscure aspects of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0129","num":"0202"},"figref":["FIGS. 64 and 65","FIGS. 62 and 63"],"b":["450","442","452","442"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0130","num":"0203"},"figref":"FIGS. 66-70","b":["460","460","460","474","462","462","474","460","464","480","474","476","478","466","470","468","472","466","474","462","468","476","478","466","460","474"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0131","num":"0204"},"figref":"FIGS. 71-73","b":["490","490","492","494","494","504","496","492","498","502","504"]},"For some patients, effective counters-stimulation to RLS symptoms include mechanical stimulus at low frequencies, for which a rotating motor with an eccentric weight may not provide adequate relief. For such patients, the present invention also includes a solenoid, a geared mechanical actuator, or a cam lobe that are rotated or otherwise actuated to produce a low frequency, e.g., 1 to 20 Hz. Additionally, a brushless motor may be a requirement for the medical devices described herein, as the RF emissions for the brushes and the motor moving within its own magnetic field may be dangerous for patients with pacemakers or implantable defribrillators, were a motor with brushes used. Also, the smaller controllers and drive circuitry are sensitive to induced noise, so extreme filtering or shielding would be required to produce an adequately safe device for this purpose.","In a highly simplified form, systems embodying principles of the present invention include a simple on\/off button or switch (not illustrated) which can be actuated by the patient when desired to generate a counter-stimulation to RLS symptoms. When actuated, the button simply communicates a signal to the controller to begin generating the counter-stimulation. More complex embodiments include sensors in addition to or instead of an on\/off button, which sensors are mounted in positions relative to the patient to sense conditions indicative of RLS symptoms, and to communicate signals to the controller that the generation of counter-stimulation is indicated. As such sensors are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, a detailed description thereof will not be presented herein so as to not obscure aspects of the invention.","While the invention has been described in detail with reference to exemplary embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes can be made, and equivalents employed, without departing from the scope of the invention.
