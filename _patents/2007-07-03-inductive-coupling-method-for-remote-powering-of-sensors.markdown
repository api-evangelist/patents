For proper sensing and detection, the arrays or grids of sensors are mounted on the external side of the hulls of the vessels. The sensors are embedded in an acoustic polymer material and are generally several inches above the hull. Current on-hull sensor arrays are powered from the interior of the vessel. Power connections to the inboard side of a vessel typically include large, heavy and expensive wiring harnesses.","The wiring harnesses can add significant weight to the vessel and each power connection from the harness to a sensor requires a penetration through the hull. The wiring harnesses and penetrations can add significantly to the costs of the vessel. Additionally, each penetration provides a source of possible leakage and may decrease the overall structural integrity of the hull.","What are therefore needed are methods and systems for delivering power to the sensors without the use of wired connections. Such methods and systems may save significant amounts of weight and costs in overall acoustic detection array systems by reducing or removing large, heavy cable harnesses currently used to deliver power to the outboard sensors.","Reliability may also be improved by not requiring a physical connection through the hull in order for a sensor to receive power.","One such method would involve the use of coils and inductive coupling to power sensors. In the prior art there are examples of the use of this technology on a very limited scale. U.S. Pat. No. 6,535,133 to Gohara et al, for \u201cVehicle slide door power supply apparatus and method of supplying power to vehicle slide door\u201d (issued Mar. 18, 2003) teaches a power supply apparatus for supplying electric power from a vehicle body to a slide door slidable mounted on the vehicle body of a vehicle, the power supply apparatus comprising a primary coil provided to the vehicle body; a secondary coil provided to the slide door, wherein the primary and secondary coils can be brought into proximity to each other upon closing of the slide door to effect a mutual induction operation so as to supply the electric power; a temperature sensor provided in a vicinity of the primary coil; a primary coil control device which is connected to the temperature sensor, and stops excitation of the primary coil in accordance with the temperature of the primary coil or the vicinity of the primary coil detected by the temperature sensor, so as to interrupt a supply of the electric power to the slide door; a slide door-contained battery for supplying electric power to a load driver driving and controlling at least one load on the slide door at least when the slide door is opened or when the supply of the electric power to the slide door is interrupted; and charging means for charging the slide door-contained battery with the electric power supplied to the slide door through the secondary coil.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,535,133 is a very relevant example of prior art in that it discloses a method for using two very closely spaced coils of approximately equal size for power delivery over the short gap that exists in a closed automotive sliding door. The invention requires the two coils to be very close together in order to operate. In addition, it is merely a one-to-one power delivery method and is used to keep a door-mounted battery charged.","What is needed is an inductive coupling method on a much larger scale that can employ a single large planar primary coil inductively coupling electrical energy to a number of smaller co-planar sensor coils above it, where the distance between the plane of the primary coil and the plane of the sensor coils remains constant.","It is a general purpose and object to provide methods and means of delivering power to a number of remote sensors that do not require a physical connection between the source of power and the sensors. A further object is to reduce costs and weight by replacing large, heavy, cable harnesses currently used for delivering power. A still further object is to improve reliability and structural integrity by eliminating through-hull physical connections for on-hull sensor grids.","These objects are accomplished by providing means and methods utilizing inductive coupling between a powered primary coil and a plurality of sensor coils to bias the active circuitry of the sensors. In some embodiments, the primary coil may be a wire coil. In other embodiments, the primary coil may be a planar coil pattern etched onto a printed circuit board.","In one embodiment, a system for remotely powering sensors includes a primary coil connected to a power source, a plurality of sensor coils spaced apart from the primary coil, and sensor circuitry at each one of the plurality of sensor coils, which together with the sensor coil form a sensor unit, wherein a current in the primary coil inductively couples to the plurality of sensor coils to induce a corresponding current in each one of the plurality of sensor coils such that the current activates the sensor circuitry to power each sensor unit.","The primary coil is adapted for mounting on the exterior side of a closed vessel hull as are the sensor coils. The primary coil must be on the same side of the hull as the sensors. Otherwise, the hull will shield the sensor coils from the magnetic field produced y the primary soil. The primary coil must not be in contact with the hull. The sensor units may be disposed between a first acoustic layer exteriorly adjacent the vessel hull and a second acoustic layer disposed exteriorly to the first acoustic layer. The first acoustic layer is referred to as the inner layer and is bonded to the hull with a polymer adhesive. The second acoustic layer is referred to as the outer layer and is bonded to the inner layer. The primary coil and\/or the sensor coils can be formed of a planar coil of wire, or may be etched onto a printed circuit board. The separation between the primary coil and the sensor coils may be as much as several inches. There is no minimum spacing requirement.","In one aspect, the method includes forming the primary coil and\/or the sensor coils from a coil of wire, or etching at least one of the primary coil and the sensor coils unto a printed circuit board.","Referring to , there is shown a schematic diagram of a system  for remote powering of sensors . For purposes of illustration and without limitation, system  is described herein with relation to remote sensors mounted on an exterior surface of a closed vessel hull . However, it can be understood that system  can be applicable to other configurations where multiple sensors are to be powered without having a direct power connection thereto. For the embodiment shown in , sensors  are embedded between two layers (, ) of acoustic polymer material, denoted as the inner layer  and outer layers . The inner acoustic polymer layer  is bonded to the hull with a bonding layer of adhesive  disposed over the exterior of the closed vessel hull . Each of the sensors  includes a pickup coil consisting of a number of turns of wire and sensor circuitry electrically connected to pickup coil . Each of the sensors  are coplanar in a single plane that serves as an isolated sensing layer of a multi-sensor arrangement.","Planar power coil  consists of a number of turns of wire . The plane of planar power coil  is parallel to the plane of the sensors . In a preferred embodiment, planar power coil  is larger than the pickup coils by at least a 5:1 ratio of diameter, but the invention is not limited to such a ration as such. Planar power coil  is a fixed distance from the pick up coils on an order of several inches. Power source  provides power to power coil  through connecting wires . For purposes of illustration, in keeping with the exemplary closed vessel hull configuration and without limitation, the primary power coil  is adapted for mounting on the exterior side of a closed vessel hull. The power coil  must be on the same side of the hull as the sensors .","Otherwise, the hull will shield the sensor coils from the magnetic field produced y the power coil . The power coil  must not be in electrical contact with the hull and is preferably located between the inner layer  and the hull. The connecting wires  carry an AC current at a frequency somewhere in the range of 100-500 kHz from power source  to power coil . The system  operates in a continuous wave mode.","As is known in the art, running a current of electricity in a wire coil such as power coil  produces a magnetic field that, near the center of the power coil , is normal to the plane of power coil . The magnetic field induces an AC current to flow in each of the pickup coils that are present at each sensor  location. The AC current is then rectified using standard circuit components of sensor circuitry , e.g., diodes, capacitors and the like, and is made available as DC power for sensor  to operate.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["18","12"],"i":"a.

This represents an increase of only 4.8%.","However, despite this modest increase, the systems and methods described herein provide advantages over existing systems for powering sensors. The use of inductive coupling provides power to the sensors without a physical connection to the sensors. Accordingly, wiring requirements for the sensors are reduced and\/or eliminated. Additionally, in the case of a vessel where the sensors are on the exterior of the hull, penetrations through the hull are not required, resulting in increased structural integrity of the hull and decreased risk of leakage. Further, the inductive coupling system described herein uses a single large coil to provide power to a plurality of sensors. The use of a large coil provides for increased separation between the power coil and the sensor coils.","What has thus been described is a system for remotely powering a plurality of sensor coils by inductively coupling the sensor coils to a single, primary coil so as to bias the active circuitry of the sensors. The primary and sensor coils can have a separation on the order of inches, embedded in the acoustic layers or at their interfaces.","Obviously, many modifications and variations of the present invention may become apparent in light of the above teachings. For example, the system can be configured to suit not only applications in vessels, as described herein, but may be adapted for operation in land and air vehicles, or other applications requiring remote sensor powering.
