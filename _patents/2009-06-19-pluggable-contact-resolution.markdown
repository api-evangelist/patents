title: Pluggable contact resolution
abstract: Methods, devices, and systems are provided for taking a pluggable extension and applying it to a unique set of a user population to handle their preferred and user-centric alerting relationships. More particularly, the pluggable extension allows a user to have their personalized contact resolution algorithm applied by a server to calls initiated by them or directed toward. The contact resolution algorithm is pluggable to any server and does not need to be built into the server itself. Moreover, multiple users can refer to and use the same pluggable contact resolution algorithm.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention relates generally to communications and more specifically to portable user-centric contact resolution mechanisms.","Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is an open signaling protocol for establishing many kinds of real-time communication sessions. Examples of the types of communication sessions that may be established using SIP include voice, video, and\/or instant messaging. These communication sessions may be carried out on any type of communication device such as a personal computer, laptop computer, Personal Digital One key feature of SIP is its ability to use an end-user's Address of Record (AOR) as a single unifying public address for all communications. Thus, in a world of SIP-enhanced communications, a user's AOR becomes their single address that links the user to all of the communication devices associated with the user. Using this AOR, a caller can reach any one of the user's communication devices, also referred to as User Agents (UAs) without having to know each of the unique device addresses or phone numbers.","One of several steps that are performed during the establishment of a SIP session is contact resolution which determines which devices registered to a given user will alert on any given call. In traditional systems, contact resolution policies (decisions made regarding what device to ring, how to ring it, etc.) for a user were built into the PBX and operated only for provisioned telephone sets. Thus, a user's choices for contact resolution policies were PBX release and telephone device specific. This is not very desirable in SIP since the underlying IP network becomes a general purpose attachment mechanism for any number of SIP communications devices registered by the user. It is the SIP user who decides which of his or her devices are registered, attached, enabled, and to what purpose each of these devices will be used. In SIP, contact resolution is conventionally done in the location server, but like a PBX, it is often undesirable to re-deploy the location server to be able to offer new contact resolution behavior. It is therefore desirable for a user to have access to contact resolution policies that can be easily provided on their behalf by systems\/network administrators without requiring a modification of the specific PBX or communications feature servers or location servers of the network in general.","Embodiments of the present invention provide mechanisms which enable contact resolution policies or algorithms for a user and particularly a SIP user. Many enterprises allow SIP users to register their preferences for each device or network element at a location server as a simple q-value. In SIP, the role of a location server is to arbitrate sending a SIP request to each registered contact according to user policy. This is conventionally done by evaluating the q-value within a static algorithm implementing a user policy. Several commonly used policies include sequential forking (contacting each device in turn), parallel forking (contacting all devices at the same time and allowing the device which responds first to win the contact), and load balancing. Embodiments of the present invention allow a network administrator to \u201chot deploy\u201d a new algorithm choice to the users of the network, and to allow a user to select and optionally personalize any deployed contact resolution policies or algorithms available in the enterprise network. More specifically, embodiments of the present invention provide the mechanisms that allow a user to find and utilize a pluggable contact resolution algorithm (serial forking, parallel forking, smart load balancing, vary rings based on caller identity, etc.) which has been properly deployed in a network. Often times the pluggable contact resolution algorithm is deployed by an administrator or some other user with administrator permissions. However, embodiments of the present invention are not so limited and non-administrative users may also be allowed to develop and deploy pluggable contact resolution algorithms for personal use and\/or for use by other users. Any user which elects to employ a pluggable contact resolution algorithm may also be allowed to refine and customize such contact resolution algorithms when adopted.","An extension module containing the contact resolution algorithm is used in connection with a table entry showing which Contact Resolution Algorithm (CRA) to use (i.e., which extension module should be referenced) when an inbound contact is received for that user.","An extension module is like a SIP servlet in that an extension module is a self-contained jar file that can be deployed and undeployed individually. A SIP servlet is very similar to other types of servlets in that they enhance the interface in which they are loaded to support SIP functions. An example of another type of servlet is an http servlet which is a Java application that runs in a web server or application server and provides server-side processing, typically to access a database or perform e-commerce processing. It is a Java-based replacement for CGI scripts, Active Server Pages (ASPs) and proprietary plug-ins written in C and C++. Servlets are similar to the CGI concept but, instead of using a separate process, messages are passed to a class that runs within a virtual machine inside the server.","Many servlets are written in a particular programming language (e.g., Java) which allows them to be portable between servers and operating systems. While Java is one example of a programming language that can be used to create a servlet or an extension module, one skilled in the art will appreciate that embodiments of the present invention are not so limited. More specifically, embodiments of the present invention contemplate the creation of an extension module in any type of programming language which allows the extension module to be portable between servers and\/or operating systems. Embodiments of the present invention also contemplate an extension module that is capable of running inside a virtual machine on a server (e.g., an enterprise server and particularly a SIP server).","Unlike SIP servlets, however, extension modules are hot deployable. They allow runtime upgrades with no service loss. In accordance with at least some embodiments of the present invention, an extension module may be used in a SIP dialog adaptation to modify the form of contact resolution a particular user gets when an incoming contact is received. More specifically, individual dialog adaptation logic can be implemented as an extension module rather than as servlets for each adaptor. In addition to the hot swap availability of the extension module, use of the extension module allows easier management and common dialog adaptation logic to be shared. Another difference between an extension module and traditional SIP servlets is that unlike SIP servlets which assume only the SIP servlet interface, an extension module may define many interfaces to expose its services.","Furthermore, and in accordance with at least some embodiments of the present invention, an extension module is used to expose services that can be accessed by servlets, an application router, and\/or other SIP applications. In some embodiments, an extension module is bound to a unique short ID defined during deployment (usually defined by a system administrator). The extension module may also define the interface that exposes its services. An extension API may facilitate the retrieval of an extension module, when required, via its short ID. Since extension modules are deployable self-contained jars, configuration information for an extension module is contained in the jar files along with the class files that implement the extension module. Configuration information can be defined in a deployment XML file in the same manner as servlets.","In operation, each remote party is associated with an inbound and outbound dialog adaptation logic implemented as a service host extension module. Any service that requires dialog adaptation (such as contact resolution) will invoke an adaptation module via its extension module identifier (i.e., the unique short ID assigned to the extension module).","This extension module is used in addition to table entry that shows which CRA to use when a contact resolution request is received. In accordance with at least some embodiments of the present invention, the table contains user-related provisioned and dynamic data. Within the table a user may be allowed to define their personal association with a deployed CRA that they want to have applied whenever a contact is received for them. More specifically, the table for a particular user would include the identifier of an extension module that will apply a particular CRA. There may be user centric data associated with this extension that can be configured and re-configured by the user as desired through a separate web interface for setting user options. More specifically, once the user data configuration or re-configuration has occurred in the table, a validation check of the active CRA can occur during registration or re-registration by knowledgeable endpoints.","When a request for contact resolution is received, the extension module is invoked. Thus, the contact resolution is pluggable and does not need to be built into the SIP Location server itself. Moreover, multiple users can reference the same extension module and apply the same or similar CRA with their own personalized user settings.","In accordance with at least some embodiments of the present invention a communication method is provided that generally comprises:","receiving, at a first server, a contact resolution request addressed to a first user;","identifying contact resolution preferences for the first user;","determining that the contact resolution preferences for the first user utilize an extension module as a part of contact resolution; and","invoking, by the first server, the extension module applying the user preference options to the extension module for that request.","The term \u201ccomputer-readable medium\u201d as used herein refers to any tangible storage and\/or transmission medium that participates in providing instructions to a processor for execution. Such a medium may take many forms, including but not limited to, non-volatile media, volatile media, and transmission media. Non-volatile media includes, for example, NVRAM, or magnetic or optical disks. Volatile media includes dynamic memory, such as main memory. Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, or any other magnetic medium, magneto-optical medium, a CD-ROM, any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, any other physical medium with patterns of holes, RAM, PROM, EPROM, FLASH-EPROM, solid state medium like a memory card, any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave as described hereinafter, or any other medium from which a computer can read. A digital file attachment to e-mail or other self-contained information archive or set of archives is considered a distribution medium equivalent to a tangible storage medium. When the computer-readable media is configured as a database, it is to be understood that the database may be any type of database, such as relational, hierarchical, object-oriented, and\/or the like. Accordingly, the invention is considered to include a tangible storage medium or distribution medium and prior art-recognized equivalents and successor media, in which the software implementations of the present invention are stored.","The terms \u201cdetermine,\u201d \u201ccalculate\u201d and \u201ccompute,\u201d and variations thereof, as used herein, are used interchangeably and include any type of methodology, process, mathematical operation or technique.","The term \u201cmodule\u201d, \u201cagent\u201d, or \u201ctool\u201d as used herein refers to any known or later developed hardware, software, firmware, artificial intelligence, fuzzy logic, or combination of hardware and software that is capable of performing the functionality associated with that element. Also, while the invention is described in terms of exemplary embodiments, it should be appreciated that individual aspects of the invention can be separately claimed.","The preceding is a simplified summary of embodiments of the invention to provide an understanding of some aspects of the invention. This summary is neither an extensive nor exhaustive overview of the invention and its various embodiments. It is intended neither to identify key or critical elements of the invention nor to delineate the scope of the invention but to present selected concepts of the invention in a simplified form as an introduction to the more detailed description presented below. As will be appreciated, other embodiments of the invention are possible utilizing, alone or in combination, one or more of the features set forth above or described in detail below.","The invention will be illustrated below in conjunction with an exemplary communication system. Although well suited for use with, e.g., a system using a server(s) and\/or database(s), the invention is not limited to use with any particular type of communication system or configuration of system elements. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the disclosed techniques may be used in any communication application in which it is desirable to allow users to personalize their contact resolution algorithms, particularly in a SIP environment.","The exemplary systems and methods of this invention will also be described in relation to analysis software, modules, and associated analysis hardware. However, to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention, the following description omits well-known structures, components and devices that may be shown in block diagram form, are well known, or are otherwise summarized.","For purposes of explanation, numerous details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It should be appreciated, however, that the present invention may be practiced in a variety of ways beyond the specific details set forth herein.","With reference initially to , an exemplary communication system  will be described in accordance with at least some embodiments of the present invention. More specifically, the communication system  includes a communication network  adapted to interconnect one or more communication devices  with a user registration server .","The communication network  may be any type of known communication medium or collection of communication mediums and may use any type of protocols to transport messages between endpoints. The communication network  may include wired and\/or wireless communication technologies. The Internet is an example of the communication network  that constitutes and IP network consisting of many computers and other communication devices located all over the world, which are connected through many telephone systems and other means. Other examples of the communication network  include, without limitation, a standard Plain Old Telephone System (POTS), an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), a Local Area Network (LAN), a Wide Area Network (WAN), a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) network, any type of enterprise network, and any other type of packet-switched or circuit-switched network known in the art. In addition, it can be appreciated that the communication network  need not be limited to any one network type, and instead may be comprised of a number of different networks and\/or network types.","The communication devices  may be any type of known communication or processing device such as a personal computer, laptop, Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), cellular phone, smart phone, telephone, analog phone, DCP phone, or combinations thereof. A single communication device  may be controlled by or be associated with a single user or may be adapted for use by many users (e.g., an enterprise communication device that allows any enterprise user to utilize the communication device upon presentation of a valid user name and password).","Each of the communication devices  may be associated with the same user. In other words, the communication devices  may belong to a single user and may correspond to different types of communication devices. As one example, the user may have four communication devices  each of which correspond to a personal phone, a work phone, a personal computer, and an email retrieval device, respectively, of a single user. Alternatively, each of the communication devices  may be owned and operated by (e.g., associated with) a different user.","In general, the communication device  may be adapted to support video, audio, text, and\/or data communications with other communication devices . The type of medium used by the communication device  to communicate with other communication devices  may depend upon the communication applications available on the communication device .","The user registration server  is adapted to receive and store user preferences for multiple users operating one or more communication devices . More particularly, a user may be allowed to log in to the user registration server  and define certain preferences (i.e., user preferences) that they want to have applied to any communication session in which the user engages. These user preferences may be defined globally for the user (e.g., a single set of user preferences may be applied consistently at any network and to any communication device associated with that user). Alternatively, a user may be allowed to define different user preferences for different networks or use-cases (e.g., a user may have different home preferences and work preferences). A user may also be allowed to define different user preferences for each of their communication devices . As an example, a user may define a first set of contact resolution preferences (e.g., a first CRA) for their mobile communication device , a second different set of contact resolution preferences (e.g., a second CRA) for their work communication device, and a third different set of contact resolution preferences (e.g., a third CRA) for their home communication device. All of these different user preferences may be stored in connection with a single set of user preferences  on the user registration server . For example, it may be useful to chain or form a similar hierarchy of CRAs where, for example, some subset of devices for the user are handled using parallel forking and others are handled using sequential forking. In such an embodiment, there may be some higher level coordinator handling the chaining between CRAs. Also, on a per-device basis, the algorithm could be sensitive to things like time of day, day of week, state of the device, etc. to alter the contact resolution behavior specific for a device.","Alternatively, a single set of contact resolution preferences (i.e., a single CRA) may be used to resolve contacts for the user between all of the communication devices  associated with that user. In other words, a single CRA may be employed to determine whether a particular communication device  should be alerted, when a particular communication device  should be alerted, and how a particular communication device  should be alerted. Examples of such CRAs that may be employed in accordance with at least some embodiments of the present invention are described in further detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/241,368 to Brunson et al., the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.","In accordance with at least some embodiments of the present invention, a user may be allowed to update and\/or change their user preferences  at the user registration server  via their communication device . In other words, a user may connect with the user registration server  to provision their user preferences , usually via some sort of web user options interface. In accordance with at least some embodiments of the present invention, a pluggable CRA may be adapted to support a web options interface for users to set their user preferences . These user options may be stored in a local data storage facility, such as an enterprise database, and\/or as user preferences  in the user registration server . These preferences  may then be distributed to one or more network devices which will invoke the user's preferences  during the contact resolution phase of call processing.","In accordance with at least some embodiments of the present invention, the user preferences  include parameters defining a preferred CRA (for one or multiple communication devices ). When a user updates their user preferences , the changes in user preferences may be distributed throughout a network to any device that will apply such preferences. There are typically a very small number of devices in the network (e.g., two or three) that actually need to know a user's CRA choice. However, embodiments of the present invention are not so limited and the changes in user preferences  may be distributed to any number of network devices. These preferences may be stored in a user-provisioned table as will be discussed in further detail herein.","Embodiments of the present invention contemplate situations where a new CRA may be deployed in a network while the network is running without adversely affecting the operation of the network (i.e., the administrator can add a hot pluggable CRA to the network in the form of an extension module). In other words, a network administrator is allowed to add new CRAs to a network or a single network device which can be applied by that device to subsequently received contacts. In accordance with at least some embodiments of the present invention, when such a CRA is added to the network, one or more users in the network may be notified of the update. In response to this notification the user may be allowed to alter their user preferences  (either directly by responding to the notification or indirectly by separately accessing the user registration server ) to apply the newly added CRA. Again, the user may be allowed to access and update their user preferences  via any type of known or yet to be developed web options interface. Details of such a process will be discussed in further detail below.","As an alternative, or in addition, to allowing a user to update their user preferences , a network administrator may also be allowed to update user preferences . Accordingly, the alteration of user preferences  to invoke a newly added CRA may be executed by the user and\/or a network administrator.","Furthermore, the user preferences  may be write-secured with a password or similar type of authentication credential. Thus, as an example, without providing the appropriate password as user name a user or administrator may not be allowed to alter user preferences . Other alternatives limiting a user and\/or administrator's ability to update the user preferences  are also envisioned and may vary depending upon network security requirements.","With reference now to , an exemplary SIP communication system  will be described in accordance with at least some embodiments of the present invention. The system  may include a communication network  connecting one or more calling devices  (which may or may not correspond to a user's communication device ) with a call routing mechanism .","The communication network  may be the same as the communication network  or may be different. For example, both networks ,  may correspond to an enterprise network. Alternatively, the communication network  may correspond to the Internet whereas the communication network  corresponds to an enterprise network or a SIP-enabled network.","Regardless of the configuration of the communication network , a caller is allowed to initiate a contact via a calling device to a callee. In accordance with at least some of the embodiments of the present invention, the callee may correspond to a SIP user that has multiple SIP devices -N associated therewith. As can be appreciated by one skilled in the art, one or more of the SIP devices -N may also correspond to one of the user's communication devices  depicted in .","When a caller initiates a contact that is directed toward the callee, a contact resolution request is sent to a call routing mechanism , such as a location server, that is adapted to perform contact resolution based on the callee's contact resolution preferences. The callee's preferences may be defined in a user-provisioned table , which may or may not be the same as the callee's user preferences . Accordingly, the call routing mechanism  may be the same as the user registration server . Alternatively, updates to user preferences  at the user registration server  may be forwarded to the call routing mechanism  where they are incorporated in the user-provisioned table . In accordance with at least some embodiments of the present invention, the user-provisioned table  includes a listing of user AORs that are mapped to each user's contact resolution preferences. These preferences may include a pointer that identifies a particular CRA that will be applied to incoming contacts addressed to that user.","Accordingly, in addition to comprising a user-provisioned table , the call routing mechanism  may further comprise a dynamic table , one or more old CRAs , and one or more extension modules  (or new CRAs). The old CRAs  comprise any type of CRA that was residing on the call routing mechanism  prior to an upgrade of the call routing mechanism  (i.e., prior to deployment of an extension module  on the call routing mechanism ).","The extension module  may comprise a new CRA that can be applied by any user if that user updates the user-provisioned table  to point to and invoke the extension module. More specifically, when the extension module  is deployed it may be assigned a unique ID. If a user desires to employ the CRA associated with the extension module , then the user updates their information in the user-provisioned table  to include the unique ID of the extension module. Therefore, when a contact resolution request for a contact addressed to the user is received at the call routing mechanism , the call routing mechanism  is capable of referencing the user-provisioned table , determining that the user wants to invoke the CRA of the extension module  rather than an old CRA , and then use the extension module  to process the received contact resolution request.","During processing, the CRA of the extension module  may need to determine which SIP devices  are eligible to have the contact routed thereto. This determination may be based on whether or not the user has registered a particular SIP device  with the call routing mechanism . In other words, some contact routing decisions may be based on whether or not a SIP device  is on and registered with the call routing mechanism . This dynamic registration information related to the activity of SIP devices  may be stored in the dynamic table . Thus, during processing the CRA of the extension module  may be adapted to refer to the dynamic table  to determine where the contact should be routed.","The information in the dynamic table  is not always based on whether a SIP device  is registered with the call routing mechanism , although it may be based in part on such considerations. Rather, the information in the dynamic table  may alter based on detected presence activity of a particular user, time of day, day of week, call processing load, and other dynamic parameters that might be considered by any CRA (i.e., either an old CRA  or a new CRA). In accordance with at least some embodiments of the present invention, the information in the dynamic table  may be responsive to changes in state of SIP devices  (e.g., whether a SIP device  is currently involved in a SIP session or not, what type communication medium is currently being used by the SIP device, etc.). These changes may be reported to the call routing mechanism  by the SIP device  via any type of known signaling or SIP message. As one example, the SIP devices  may update their state information with the call routing mechanism  by sending a NOTIFY or PUBLISH message to the call routing mechanism .","Additionally, the dynamic table  may be responsive to other parameters such as the presence state of another user or another user's device. Thus, a CRA algorithm for a specific user might contain logic which allows devices of other users to be included in the set of devices that participate in the CRA algorithm as targets for INVITE Requests for the specific user. In other words, a CRA algorithm may decide to alert a second user's device when trying to reach a first different user. As one example, a first user may define their CRA algorithm so as to alert a second user's device between a particular time on a particular day (e.g., to reach me try alerting the second user's work phone between 2 and 3 on Friday). This may be done if the first user knows they will be meeting with the second user at that particular time. Furthermore, such information may be automatically retrieved from a user's electronic schedule that is stored in a calendar application or the like.","Referring now to , an exemplary method of updating user contact resolution preferences will be described in accordance with at least some embodiments of the present invention. The method is initiated when a new extension module  is deployed on a network device, such as a call routing mechanism  (step ). In accordance with at least some embodiments of the present invention, the extension module  is hot deployable, which means that the code of the extension module  can be added to the network device while the network device is running and while the network device is connected to other network devices. Accordingly, no device downtime is required to deploy an extension module  on the network device. This is particularly useful in very large networks because if deployment of a new CRA required network downtime, either the entire network operation could be adversely affected by the downtime of one network device or it would take a very long time to update all network devices, thereby extending the amount of network downtime and increasing productivity losses. Embodiments of the present invention avoid such negative effects. As can be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the deployment of a new CRA is usually executed by a network administrator, but may also be executed by a non-administrative user.","The method continues by notifying one or more users of the newly deployed extension module  (step ). This notification may occur automatically by virtue of the fact that the new extension module  was deployed. Alternatively, the notification may be initiated by a network administrator after the new extension module  is deployed. Furthermore, the extent of user notification (i.e., the number of users notified of the update) may vary depending upon network security concerns, whether or not the users have subscribed to receive such notifications, and the like. Furthermore, the notifications may come in an electronic format (e.g., via email, SMS message, Instant Message (IM), etc.) or may come in a paper format.","Upon receiving notification that a new extension module  has been deployed, a user may then update their preferences  to include utilization of the newly deployed extension module , and particularly the CRA of the new extension module  (step ). This update may be initiated by responding directly to the notification or the user may update their preferences  by separately communicating with the user registration server  via a web options interface.","Updating the user preferences  causes the user-provisioned table  in the call routing mechanism  to also be updated (step ). More specifically, when a user updates their contact resolution preferences, an entry in the user-provisioned table  for that particular user is also updated to reflect the new preferences. Even more specifically, the entry in the user-provisioned table may include an identifier of the newly added extension module . This identifier may be automatically entered in the table  if the user responded directly to the notification or the user may be required to enter the identifier manually when updating their user preferences . Once the user-provisioned table  has been updated any subsequently received contact addressed to that user will invoke the newly added extension module .","As can be appreciated by one skilled in the art, steps  and  may be combined into a single step, particularly if the user updates the user-provisioned table  directly rather than going through an intermediary user registration server . However, in larger networks having many call routing mechanisms , it may be desirable to have a single registration server  as a single point of update for a user. In such a configuration the single registration server  may act as the interface with users regarding their preferences and then the registration server  may notify the other call routing mechanisms  in the network of any changes to a user's preferences.","With reference now to , an exemplary method of processing an incoming contact resolution request will be described in accordance with at least some embodiments of the present invention. The method begins when a contact resolution request is received at the call routing mechanism  (step ). The contact resolution request may include an identifier of the callee. This information may be contained within one or more headers of the contact resolution request. Particularly where the contact resolution request is associated with a SIP INVITE message, the message and the contact resolution request may comprise the identification of the callee via an AOR in a SIP header. As can be appreciated, however, the incoming contact resolution request does not necessarily need to be in the form of a SIP message. Rather, the incoming contact resolution request may correspond to a regular inbound call placed by an analog phone or the like that is identifying a particular communication device rather than a particular user by the user's AOR. The call routing mechanism  may alternatively determine that the inbound contact resolution request is for a particular user by virtue of the fact that one of the user's communication devices has been identified by the contact and that identification information has been included in the contact resolution request.","Upon identifying the callee, the method continues with the call routing mechanism  referencing the user-provisioned table  to identify the contact resolution preferences for the user (step ). More specifically, the call routing mechanism  is adapted to identify the AOR of the user in the table  and determine which CRA is to be invoked for that user (step ). The CRA may be identified by a unique ID that is associated with the CRA. In accordance with at least some embodiments of the present invention, the identified CRA may correspond to a CRA that was newly added to the call routing mechanism  via an extension module .","Upon obtaining the identifier of the CRA (or more particularly the unique ID of the extension module ), the call routing mechanism  invokes the identified CRA and passes the contact to that CRA (step ). Once the CRA receives the contact the CRA will refer to the dynamic table  (if necessary) to determine which SIP device(s)  are eligible to have a contact routed thereto and how to alert such device(s) of the contact. The eligibility of a SIP device  may depend on the rules defined in the CRA being invoked as well as whether or not the SIP device  is registered with the call routing mechanism . The rules of the CRA may define that one SIP device  is initially alerted and if the user does not answer the contact at that SIP device , then another SIP device  may be alerted (serial forking). Alternatively, the rules of the CRA may define that two or more of the SIP devices  should be alerted at the same time and the device which responds to the alerting first will win the contact (parallel forking). Other types of CRAs may also be included in the extension module  and embodiments of the present invention are not necessarily limited to the CRA examples discussed herein.","While the above-described flowcharts have been discussed in relation to a particular sequence of events, it should be appreciated that changes to this sequence can occur without materially effecting the operation of the invention. Additionally, the exact sequence of events need not occur as set forth in the exemplary embodiments. The exemplary techniques illustrated herein are not limited to the specifically illustrated embodiments but can also be utilized with the other exemplary embodiments and each described feature is individually and separately claimable.","The systems, methods and protocols of this invention can be implemented on a special purpose computer in addition to or in place of the described communication equipment, a programmed microprocessor or microcontroller and peripheral integrated circuit element(s), an ASIC or other integrated circuit, a digital signal processor, a hard-wired electronic or logic circuit such as discrete element circuit, a programmable logic device such as PLD, PLA, FPGA, PAL, a communications device, such as a server, personal computer, any comparable means, or the like.
