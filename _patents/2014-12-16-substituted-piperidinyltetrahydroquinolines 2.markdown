EXAMPLES OF PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS"],"p":["This application is a U.S. national phase application of International Patent Application No. PCT\/EP2014\/077865, filed Dec. 16, 2014 and titled SUBSTITUTED PIPERIDINYL-TETRAHYDROQUINOLINES, which claims priority to both European Patent Application No. 13198388.4, filed Dec. 19, 2013 and titled SUBSTITUTED PIPERIDINYL-TETRAHYDROQUINOLINES, and European Patent Application No. 14192878.8, filed Nov. 12, 2014 and titled SUBSTITUTED PIPERIDINYL-TETRAHYDROQUINOLINES, the contents of all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","The invention relates to novel substituted piperidinyltetrahydroquinolines, to processes for their preparation, to their use in a method for the treatment and\/or prophylaxis of diseases and to their use for preparing medicaments for the treatment and\/or prophylaxis of diseases, in particular of cardiovascular disorders, diabetic microangiopathies, diabetic ulcers on the extremities, in particular for promoting wound healing of diabetic foot ulcers, diabetic heart failure, diabetic coronary microvascular heart disorders, peripheral and cardiac vascular disorders, thromboembolic disorders and ischaemias, peripheral circulatory disturbances, Raynaud's phenomenon, CREST syndrome, microcirculatory disturbances, intermittent claudication, and peripheral and autonomous neuropathies.","Adrenoreceptor cc receptors (\u03b1-ARs) belong to the family of the G-protein-coupled receptors. They bind to the pertussis toxin-sensitive inhibitory G protein Gand Gand reduce adenylate cyclase activity. They are involved in the mediation of diverse physiological effects in various tissues following stimulation by endogenous katecholamines (adrenaline, noradrenaline) which are either released by synapses or reach their site of action via the blood. \u03b1-AR play an important physiological role, mainly for the cardiovascular system, but also in the central nervous system. Biochemical, physiological and pharmacological studies have shown that, in addition to various \u03b1-AR subtypes, there are three \u03b1-AR subtypes (\u03b1, \u03b1and \u03b1) in many target cells and tissues of cardiovascular relevance, which makes them attractive target proteins for therapeutic interventions. However, the elucidation of the precise physiological task of the receptor subtypes remains difficult because of a lack of highly selective ligands and\/or antagonists of the respective \u03b1-AR (Gyires et al., \u03b1-Adrenoceptor subtypes-mediated physiological, pharmacological actions, Neurochemistry International 55, 447-453, 2009; Tan and Limbird, The \u03b1-Adrenergic Receptors: Adrenergic Receptors in the 21st Century\/Receptors, 2005, 241-265).","Cardiovascular changes such as, for example, the regulation of the contractility of the heart are regulated, firstly, by the central modulation of the sympathetic efferent nerves. Furthermore, the sympathetic efferent system also regulates direct effects on smooth muscle cells and the endothelial cells of the vessels. Thus, the sympathetic system is involved in the regulation of the output performance of the heart, but also in the control of local perfusion of various vascular beds. This is also controlled via \u03b1-ARs involved in the regulation of the peripheral resistance. Thus, blood vessels are innervated by sympathetic nerve fibres which are located in the adventitia and whose endings are provided with varicosities for the release of noradrenalin. Released noradrenalin modulates, via the \u03b1-AR in endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells, the respective local vascular tone.","In addition to the effects on the sympathetic efferent nerves, the peripheral cardiovascular function are also regulated by pre- and postsynaptic \u03b1-AR. Smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells express different \u03b1-AR subtypes. The activation of \u03b1, \u03b1and \u03b1receptors on smooth muscle cells leads to contraction with resulting vasoconstriction (Kanagy, Clinical Science 109:431-437, 2005). However, the distribution of the respective receptor subtypes varies in the different vascular beds, between the species and between different vessel sizes. Thus, \u03b1-AR appear to be expressed virtually exclusively in large arteries, whereas \u03b1-AR contribute more to the vascular tone in small arteries and veins. AR\u03b1appear to play a role in salt-induced hypertension (Gyires et al., \u03b1-Adrenoceptor subtypes-mediated physiological, pharmacological actions, Neurochemistry International 55, 447-453, 2009). The role of AR\u03b1on haemodynamics is not yet completely understood; however, AR\u03b1receptors appear to mediate venous vasoconstriction. They are also involved in cold-induced enhancement of adrenoceptor-induced vasoconstriction (Chotani et al., Silent \u03b1adrenergic receptors enable cold-induced vasoconstriction in cutaneous arteries. Am J Physiol 278:H1075-H1083, 2000; Gyires et al., \u03b1-Adrenoceptor subtypes-mediated physiological, pharmacological actions, Neurochemistry International 55, 447-453, 2009). Cold and other factors (e.g. tissue proteins, estrogen) regulate the functional coupling of AR\u03b1to intracellular signal pathways (Chotani et al., Distinct cAMP signaling pathways differentially regulate \u03b1adrenenoxceptor expression: role in serum induction in human arteriolar smooth muscle cells. Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol 288: H69-H76, 2005). For this reason, it appears to make sense to investigate selective inhibitors of AR-\u03b1subtypes for their perfusion-modulating effect on different vascular beds under different pathophysiological conditions.","Under pathophysiological conditions, the adrenergic system may be activated, which can lead, for example, to hypertension, heart failure, increased platelet activation, endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, thromboses, peripheral circulatory disturbances, stroke and sexual dysfunction. Thus, for example, the pathophysiology of Raynaud's syndrome and scleroderma is substantially unclear, but is associated with a changed adrenergic activity. Thus, patients suffering from spastic Raynaud's syndrome show, for example, a significantly elevated expression of AR\u03b1recptoren on their platelets. This may be connected with the vasospastic attacks observed in these patients (Keenan and Porter, \u03b1-Adrenergic receptors in platelets from patients with Raynaud's syndrome, Surgery, V94(2), 1983).","By virtue of the expected high efficiency and low level of side effects, a possible treatment for such disorders targeting a modulation of the activated adrenergic system in organisms is a promising approach. In particular in diabetics, who frequently have elevated catecholamine levels, peripheral circulatory disturbances (microangiopathies) such as diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy or else pronounced wound healing disorders (diabetic foot ulcers) play a large role. In peripheral occlusive disease, diabetes is one of the most important comorbidities and also plays a crucial role in the progression of the disease (micro- and macroangiopathy). Higher expression of the adrenoreceptor \u03b1receptors associated with elevated catecholamine levels may be involved in these pathophysiological processes in diabetics.","In 2011 there were 350 million diabetics world-wide (\u22486.6% of the population), and this number is expected to double until 2028. Diabetic foot ulcers are the most frequent cause of hospitalisations of diabetics. The risk of a diabetic to develop diabetic foot ulcer in his or her lifetime is 15-25%, 15% of all diabetic foot ulcers lead to amputation. World-wide, 40-70% of all non-traumatic amputations are carried out on diabetics. Risk factors for diabetic foot ulcers are traumata, poor metabolic control, sensory, motoric and autonomous polyneuropathy, inappropriate footwear, infections and peripheral arterial disorders. The treatment of diabetic foot ulcers requires interdisciplinary teams and employs a multifactor approach: weight loss, revascularisation (in the case of peripheral arterial occlusive disease, PAOD), improvements in metabolic control, wound excision, dressings, dalteparin, Regranex (PDGF) and amputation. The treatment costs per diabetic foot ulcer (without amputation) are 7,000-10,000 USD. 33% of all diabetic foot ulcers do not heal within 2 years, and there is a high relapse rate (34% within the first year, 61% over 3 years).","Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide novel selective adrenoreceptor \u03b1receptor antagonists for the treatment and\/or prophylaxis of diseases such as, for example, cardiovascular disorders, in humans and animals.","It is another object of the present invention to provide novel selective adrenoreceptor \u03b1receptor antagonists for the treatment and\/or prophylaxis of peripheal circulatory disturbances (microangiopathies) such as, for example, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic nephropathy and wound healing disorders (diabetic foot ulcers).","WO 2005\/042517, WO 2003\/020716, WO 2002\/081449 and WO 2000\/066559 describe structurally similar bipiperidinyl derivatives as inhibitors of the CCR5 receptor, inter alfa for the treatment of HIV. WO 2005\/077369 describes structurally similar bipiperidinyl derivatives as inhibitors of the CCR3 receptor, inter alfa for the treatment of asthma.

Particular isotopic variants of a compound according to the invention, especially those in which one or more radioactive isotopes have been incorporated, may be beneficial, for example, for the examination of the mechanism of action or of the active compound distribution in the body; due to comparatively easy preparability and detectability, especially compounds labelled with H or C isotopes are suitable for this purpose. In addition, the incorporation of isotopes, for example of deuterium, can lead to particular therapeutic benefits as a consequence of greater metabolic stability of the compound, for example to an extension of the half-life in the body or to a reduction in the active dose required; such modifications of the compounds according to the invention may therefore in some cases also constitute a preferred embodiment of the present invention.

Anesthesia is initiated by slow i.v. administration of 25 mg\/kg sodium thiopental (Trapanal) and 0.15 mg\/kg alcuronium chloride (Alloferin\u00ae) and maintained during the experiment by means of a continuous infusion of 0.04 mg\/kg*h fentanyl (Fentanyl\u00ae), 0.25 mg\/kg*h droperidol (Dihydrobenzperidol) and 15 \u03bcg\/kg\/h alcuronium chloride (Alloferin\u00ae). After intubation, the animals are ventilated by the ventilator at a constant respiratory volume such that an end-tidal COconcentration of about 5% is achieved. Ventilation is performed with room air, enriched with about 30% oxygen (normoxia). To measure the haemodynamic parameters, a liquid-filled catheter is implanted into the femoral artery for measuring blood pressure. A Swan-Ganz\u00ae catheter having two lumens is introduced in a flow-directed manner via the jugular vein into the pulmonary artery (distal lumen for measuring the pressure in the pulmonary artery, proximal lumen for measuring the central vein pressure). Using a temperature sensor at the tip of the catheter, the continuous cardiac output (CCO) is determined. Blood flow is measured at various vascular beds such as the coronary artery, the carotid artery or the femoral artery by placing flow probes (Transonic Flowprobe) at the vessels in question. The pressure in the left ventricle is measured after introduction of a microtip catheter (Millar\u00ae Instruments) via the carotid artery into the left ventricle, and the dP\/dt ratio as a measure of contractility is derived therefrom. Substances are administered i.v. via the femoral vein or intraduodenally as cumulative dose\/activity curve (bole or continuous infusion). The haemodynamic signals are recorded and evaluated by means of pressure transducers\/amplifiers and PONEMAH\u00ae as data aquisition software.","To induce heart failure, a pacemaker is implanted into the dogs under sterile conditions. After induction of anesthesia with pentobarbital-Na (15 to 30 mg kg-1 i.v.) followed by intubation and subsequent ventilation (room air; Sulla 808, Dr\u00e4ger\u00ae, Germany), anesthesia is maintained by continuous infusion of pentobarbital (1-5 mg kg-1 h-1) and fentanyl (10-40 \u03bcg kgh).

Rodent models of depression: forced swimming and tail suspension behavioral despair tests in rats and mice. Curr. Protoc. Neurosci. 2001; Chapter 8:Unit 8.10A, 1-10) and De Vry et al. (De Vry J, Maurel S, Schreiber R, de Beun R, Jentzsch K R. Comparison of hypericum extracts with imipramine and fluoxetine in animal models of depression and alcoholism. Eur. Neuropsychopharmacology 1999; 9:461-468). In two sessions (training and test) at an interval of 24 h, the rats are forced to swim in a narrow cylinder filled with water from which there is no escape. The training session (duration 15 min) is carried out before the treatment with substance without recording the behaviour in order to familiarize the rats with the 5-minute test session 24 h later. During both sessions, the rats are individually placed into the cylinders filled with water, which are optically separated from one another. After the session, the rats are removed from the water and dried. About 24, 5 and 1 h prior to the test session, the rats are treated with test substance or vehicle solution; the first administration takes place immediately after the training session. 3 substance administrations prior to the test session lead to more stable pharmacological results than a single administration. The test sessions are recorded electronically using a surveillance video camera and, after storage, analyzed off-line using a computer. For each animal, the behaviour is analyzed by 3-4 independent observers who score the total time of immobility in seconds over the 5-minute test session.","Passive behaviour or immobility is defined as a rat which drifts in the water in an upright position and makes only small movements to keep the head over the water or to maintain its body in a balanced stable position. In contrast, active behaviour is characterized by active swimming movements, e.g. forceful movements of front or hind legs and\/or tail, climbing or diving.","For each animal and treatment group, the mean of the duration of immobility determined by the observers is calculated. Differences in the duration of immobility between the groups are examined statistically by ANOVA or a suitable non-parametric test with p<0.05 as significance level.","B-2l) Radiotelemetric Measurement of Blood Pressure and Heart Rate of Conscious Rats","A commercially available telemetry system from Data Sciences International DSI, USA, was employed for the measurements on conscious rats described below. The system consists of 3 main components: (1) implantable transmitters (Physiotel\u00ae telemetry transmitter), (2) receivers (Physiotel\u00ae receiver), which are linked via a multiplexer (DSI Data Exchange Matrix) to a (3) data acquisition computer. The telemetry system makes it possible to continuously record blood pressure, heart rate and body motion of conscious animals in their usual habitat.","The studies were conducted on adult female Wistar rats with a body weight of >200 g. After transmitter implantation, the experimental animals were housed singly in type III Makrolon\u00ae cages. They had free access to standard feed and water. The day\/night rhythm in the test laboratory was set by changing the illumination of the room.","Transmitter Implantation:","The telemetry transmitters used (PA-C40, DSI) were surgically implanted under aseptic conditions in the experimental animals at least 14 days before the first experimental use.","For the implantation, the fasted animals were anaesthetized with isoflurane (IsoFlo\u00ae, Abbott, initiation 5%, maintenance 2%) and shaved and disinfected over a large area of their abdomens. After the abdominal cavity had been opened along the linea alba, the liquid-filled measuring catheter of the system was inserted into the descending aorta in the cranial direction above the bifurcation and fixed with tissue glue (VetBond\u2122, 3M). The transmitter housing was fixed intraperitoneally to the abdominal wall muscle, and the wound is closed layer by layer. Post-operatively, an antibiotic (Ursocyclin\u00ae 10%, 60 mg\/kg s.c., 0.06 ml\/100 g body weight, Serumwerk Bernburg AG, Germany) for infection prophylaxis and an analgesic (Rimadyl\u00ae, 4 mg\/kg s.c., Pfizer, Germany) were administered.","Substances and Solutions:","Unless stated otherwise, the substances to be studied were administered orally to a group of animals in each case (n=6). In accordance with an administration volume of 2 ml\/kg of body weight, the test substances were dissolved in suitable solvent mixtures. A solvent-treated group of animals (placebo\/vehicle=diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, Transcutol, 2 ml\/kg p.o.) was used as control.","Test Procedure:","The telemetry measuring system is configured for 24 animals.","Each of the instrumented rats living in the system was assigned a separate receiving antenna (RPC-1 Receiver, DSI). The implanted transmitters were activated externally via an installed magnetic switch and were switched to transmission during the pre-run of the experiment. The signals emitted were detected online by a data acquisition system (Dataquest\u2122 A.R.T. for Windows, DSI) and processed accordingly.","In the standard procedure, the following were measured for 10-second periods in each case: (1) systolic blood pressure (SBP), (2) diastolic blood pressure (DBP), (3) mean arterial pressure (MAP) and (4) heart rate (HR) and (5) activity (ACT). These parameters were measured over 24 hours after administration.","The acquisition of measurements was repeated under computer control at 5-minute intervals. The source data obtained as absolute values were corrected in the diagram with the currently measured barometric pressure (Ambient Pressure Reference Monitor, APR-1, DSI).","Evaluation:","After the end of the experiment, the acquired individual data were sorted using the analysis software (Dataquest\u2122 A.R.T. 4.1 Analysis). The blank value was taken to be the mean of the pre-run (i.e. before substance administration) (4 absolute values) and this was compared to the absolute value of the measurement, giving the deviation in %. The data were smoothed over a presettable period by determination of the means (15 minute mean).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0396","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0106","list-style":"none"},"li":"K.
