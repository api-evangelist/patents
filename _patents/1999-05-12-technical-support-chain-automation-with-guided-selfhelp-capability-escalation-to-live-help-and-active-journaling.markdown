title: Technical support chain automation with guided self-help capability, escalation to live help, and active journaling
abstract: A method for automated technical support in a computer network having a client machine, and at least one server from which live help is available. The method begins initiates a guided self-help session in response to entry by a user of a problem area and description. During the self-help session, the user is provided with an option to escalate to live help. If the user exercises that option, the system automatically provides a support engineer at the server with a data stream summarizing the self-help session. During the live help, the support engineer may then repeat a portion of the user's self-help session, view information generated during that session, and/or execute certain actions with respect to the user's machine, all from the engineer's desktop. An active journal is maintained for each problem incident, and active journals may be used by other analysts to facilitate problem resolutions for new incidents.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a continuation-in-part of prior copending application Ser. No. 09\/215,873, filed Dec. 18, 1998 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,615,240.","This application contains subject matter that is protected by copyright.","1. Technical Field","The present invention relates generally to automated customer support and service in a distributed computing environment and more particularly to a method of reducing a number of \u201clive\u201d support calls by providing intelligent, guided self-help in such an environment.","2. Description of the Related Art","Technical support services and programs are designed to diagnose and solve hardware or software problems that users and\/or customers encounter as they use computers. As businesses continue to move on-line, distributed computing environments become more complex and, thus, more difficult to troubleshoot. Indeed, entire businesses now desire to connect their critical business systems directly to employees, customers, vendors and other important constituencies. To this end, many internal or external business network applications are now being connected to the Internet's World Wide Web to make the information accessible from anywhere using conventional browser software.","Traditional technical support centers place their emphasis on internal tracking and productivity tools, such as problem tracking systems. Such \u201cback end\u201d systems exist internally to the support organization and are usually transparent to the customer. Although back-end systems aid internal efficiency, they do little for the actual problem resolution process itself. Problem resolution is typically left to telephony-based technologies such as agent-based automatic call distribution (ACD) support centers and intelligent voice response (IVR) devices.","Such techniques attempt to diagnose and address problems on a remote node without actually having the technician travel to that node. The most common method of technical support is still a telephone conversation with tech support personnel. Other known techniques involve a network \u201clogin\u201d to the remote node so that the conditions may be evaluated from the technical support center's viewpoint. The network connection may be used to run a diagnostic program on the remote node, or \u201cself-help\u201d fix-it programs may be downloaded to the remote note and executed there.","With the explosive growth of the Internet, yet another approach has become quite popular. This approach involves having the user access a Web server with support content in the form of support notes or FAQs. The user attempts to use this information to \u201cself service\u201d his or her own problem. On its face, this strategy appears sensible as, theoretically, an effective self-service strategy would let users solve problems for themselves (e.g., through a Web browser), with the result of lower call volumes and better service. Unfortunately, however, using the Web as a publishing medium has not resulted in the desired benefits. Indeed, call avoidance has often evolved into \u201ccustomer avoidance\u201d. In particular, most normal users do not want to be \u201cdetectives\u201d who have to make a set of guesses about the precise search strings that will get them to the right support solutions. Further, it is quite frustrating for users who cannot solve their problems (by self-service) to then be forced to go through the tedious exercise of later repeating to a support engineer information concerning their self-service attempts. The result is that end users often feel like their vendor is trying to push them away, with the inevitable result that this unintended result may actually occur.","Indeed, studies have shown that, even when a user knows an answer exists to his or her problem, he or she will be able to find the answer only 40% of the time. Further, many \u201canswers\u201d have very complex diagnoses and resolutions that are well beyond the capabilities of most computer users.","The present invention addresses this problem.","It is a primary object of this invention to provide dynamic, guided self-help in a technical support chain automation system. \u201cGuided\u201d support means the system guides the user to find an answer to his or her technical support question or problem. The approach is \u201cdynamic\u201d because the system preferably refines its suggestions as more data and information is gathered from either the user, the user's system, or from a content database.","It is another primary object of this invention to provide intelligent self-help wherein the system, as opposed to the user, develops the appropriate search strategies to enable the user to be guided to an appropriate subset of relevant support notes. Preferably, these strategies are developed automatically during a self-help session by having the system capture the live context of the user's computer.","It is still another object of this invention to provide an active self-help mechanism by which a user can automate time-consuming self-diagnosis and self-repair tasks. For example, with the present invention, the automated technical support system can automatically check a user's computer to determine whether a specific hardware or software conflict exists and then automatically resolve that conflict, e.g., from a support note.","Yet another object of this invention is to simplify the support process in the situation where the self-help has not succeeded satisfactorily and escalation to a support center is necessary. In this situation, the invention provides a mechanism for transferring (from the user's system to the support center server) information about all user attempts to solve the problem. Thus, when the support problem escalates, the past history of the user's attempts to rectify the problem is immediately visible to the support engineer to provide a valuable head-start in diagnosis and repair, without forcing the user to repeat any steps.","These and other objects of this invention are provided in a method, system and computer program product for automated technical support in a computer network having a client machine and at least one technical support server. When the user desires technical support, a technical support interface is launched. The user is then prompted to select a general problem area. In response to a user query, the system automatically serves a self-help home page (or template) to the user's interface. Preferably, the interface has a Web browser navigation metaphor to provide the user with a comfortable and intuitive interaction with the self-help system.","According to the invention, the self-help home page includes a search field that is populated automatically with a system-supplied, self-help search string. This function obviates the user having to make a set of guesses about the precise search string or strings that will direct the user to the right support solution(s). The search string is a value that, when fed into the technical support server's search engine, should produce relevant hits. In the preferred embodiment, the search string is generated dynamically through the use of a diagnostic map that executes on the client machine when the self-help session is initiated. The diagnostic map examines the client system (including the existing applications, registry information and the like) and communicates with the technical support server to derive the search string as a background task. Diagnostic maps are programmable, reusable objects that allow technical support engineers (SEs) and others to write custom tools for diagnosing problems.","If the user elects to execute a search (or, alternatively, a diagnostic map initiates a search automatically), a search results template is returned. If the search returns relevant results, the results template includes a link to a support note. Upon selection of the link, the user is navigated to an \u201cactivated\u201d page. The activated page provides the user an option to automatically diagnose the problem (if necessary) and\/or the option to fix the problem (if it has been adequately diagnosed and a fix is available). After the user selects the appropriate option, the system returns an active self service results page reporting on the result of the user's action.","Thus, according to an aspect of the present invention, guided self-help is facilitated through use of so-called \u201cactive content\u201d pages. Active content is Web-based content (i.e., content viewable by a Web browser) that has one or more diagnostic maps initiated when certain actions are taken (e.g., selecting a link, clicking a button, or the like). In an illustrative embodiment, a given diagnostic map is associated with a page via a URL, although any convenient mechanism may be used to associate a page and a map. When that URL results from selecting a link or button on the Web page, a Web server supporting the support chain automation system has extensions that recognize it as a map (rather than, for example, a reference to another Web page). The active content functionality of the invention enables the user to determine if a particular technical problem described by an external page applies to the user's actual system. This provides a robust self-service capability.","At customizable points during the self-help navigation, the user is given the option to escalate to live-help (e.g. an SE located at the technical support server). When the user selects this option, information about the user's self service efforts is provided to the technical support server automatically so that the user does not need to repeat or otherwise describe to the SE those actions that have already been considered or tried.","When the guided support is complete, whether successful in the first instance or through escalation to live-help, the information about the incident is passed on to the technical support server for reporting and analysis purposes.","During a live help session, the support engineer may access and review the same self-help pages reviewed by the user during the self-help session. The support engineer may also repeat, against the user's machine, all or part of the self-help session to facilitate diagnosis and repair of the technical problem. In this manner, the SE can use the self-help functionality to find a diagnostic map, run a diagnostic map, or point a user to a resource (e.g., a URL) that, upon activation, executes a diagnostic map. Thus, according to this aspect of the invention, the same self-help content (or portions thereof) used to guide the user during the guided self-help session are used at the support center to guide the support technician to a solution from within the context of the technician's desktop.","According to the present invention, an active journal is maintained for each problem incident, and active journals may be used by other analysts to facilitate problem resolutions for newly-reported incidents.","Self service is automatic, context-based, intelligent and captures diagnostic information for further use by the technical support center if necessary. The invention also automates self-diagnosis and self-repair.","The foregoing has outlined some of the more pertinent objects and features of the present invention. These objects should be construed to be merely illustrative of some of the more prominent features and applications of the invention. Many other beneficial results can be attained by applying the disclosed invention in a different manner or modifying the invention as will be described. Accordingly, other objects and a fuller understanding of the invention may be had by referring to the following Detailed Description.","The present invention is implemented conveniently in an Internet or Web-based computer network, although this is not a requirement. Thus, by way of background, a representative Web client\/Web server is illustrated in . In particular, a client machine  is connected to a Web server platform  via a communication channel .","As will be described, the invention assumes that a user of the client machine  has experienced a problem and desires automated technical support. According to the invention, the user may attempt to solve the problem through a guided \u201cself-help\u201d process as will be described, or he or she may seek \u201clive-help\u201d from a technical support engineer (SE) located at the server platform (or at some other server), or the user may first attempt self-help and then escalate to live-help as needed.","For illustrative purposes, channel  is the public Internet, an intranet, an extranet or any other known network connection. Web server platform  is one of a plurality of servers which are accessible by clients, one of which is illustrated by machine . A representative client machine may include a Web browser , which is a known software tool used to access the servers of the network. The Web server platform supports files in the form of hypertext documents, graphics and other data type objects. The network path to a server (or to a file on the server) is identified by a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), and is well-known.","A representative Web Server platform  comprises a Compaq\u00ae computer  running the Windows NT Operating System  and a Web server program , such as Netscape Enterprise Server Version 3.51, that supports interface extensions. The platform  also includes a display supporting a graphical user interface (GUI)  for management and administration, and an Application Programming Interface (API)  to enable application developers to extend and\/or customize the core functionality thereof through software programs such as servlets, CGI scripts, helper programs and plug-ins.","A representative Web client is a personal computer that is x86-, PowerPC\u00ae- or RISC-based, that includes an operating system such as Microsoft Windows '95 or NT, as well as a browser, such as Netscape Communicator (any version) or Internet Explorer (any version), having native support for application plug-ins. The Web client machine is connectable to the Web server(s) via the Internet, an intranet or some other computer network. The Web client browser typically includes a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which provides a convenient runtime environment for programs written as Java applications or applets.","Although not required, the self-help functionality of the present invention is preferably implemented as a Java application or applet (i.e. a set of Java program instructions or code) that is dynamically downloaded to the user's machine for execution. Of course, the inventive self-help application (whether implemented in Java or otherwise) may simply reside on the user's machine. Some of the functionality described herein may be implemented on a server (e.g., as a servlet) and then delivered to the client as needed.","Although the Web client is typically a personal computer, this is not a requirement. The Web client may be any generalized information appliance having a processor, an operating system, optionally a browser application, and a means to connect the device to a computer network from which data may be retrieved. Such appliances include, without limitation, a handheld or palmtop device (e.g., running Windows CE 2.0 or higher), a diskless or so-called \u201cnetwork computer\u201d, a set-top computer terminal, or the like.","Although numerous system architectures may be used to implement the inventive technique, one such architecture is illustrated in . This architecture is implemented, for example, in a corporate enterprise environment (such as an intranet), wherein a plurality of client machines (desktops)  interface with a support center  located at a server node through a network . The clients are the desktop machines used by the community of application end users. These are the users who use applications, encounter problems, and seek help. Typically, client machines  are separated from the network  via a firewall . Each client machine may include conventional browser software as discussed above. The server node may have associated therewith a set of one or more support engineer (SE) desktops  at which technical support personnel reside.","Under certain circumstances as will be described, a user of a given client machine may undertake to solve a particular problem normally requiring technical support through a self-help (or self-service) process. Typically, such technical support and service is provided in an automated manner, without necessarily connecting the user\/customer to a support engineer via an audio or on-line link. In this environment, given interactions between a user (and, in particular, the user's computer) and an SE may occur without the user's actual knowledge or without any direct communication.","The diagnostic center  preferably comprises a number of functional components that are now described. The center includes one or more routing servers , and each routing server's primary responsibility is to route a given data set to a best-equipped support engineer to handle the call if live-help is required. To this end, information in the data set preferably is matched up against help desk \u201crules\u201d to determine which group or person should handle the problem. Preferably, the routing server  attempts to assign data sets to a most appropriate message queue  (and thus, indirectly, to a most appropriate support engineer). Given support engineers preferably belong to a set of \u201cgroups,\u201d with each having an associated message queue  of assigned data sets. A given support engineer obtains ownership of a given data set from his or her respective queue until the session is complete or the call is reassigned to some other group. A work queue manager  is responsible for managing the message queues .","In addition to performing routing, communications, and data packaging services, the diagnostic center also supports the server portion of the automated support application. The server portion comprises a database server (e.g., a commercially available relational database management system (RDBMS))  and an application server . A representative RDBMS is available from Oracle, Microsoft or others. The application server  provides a set of services to keep the support engineer desktops up-to-date as well as to provide general services to the application back-end. A given server also has (or has access to) a search engine  to facilitate searching for known technical support solutions.","Thus, the diagnostic center routes incoming calls (that require live help) to the best call group queue, provides services to the SE desktops, provides services to the support center management console , and interfaces to third party products\/systems that store configuration data and track results. The management console is a mission control for support center activities. Preferably, the console  has both data display and system configuration capabilities. The data displays are both real-time and historic views into the call center metrics, and the configuration dialogs are used to set operational characteristics of the server. A convenient browser-based or other user interface may be used for this purpose.","A block diagram of the \u201cclient\u201d piece of the automated technical support chain automation system is illustrated in . The client piece executes on the client machine  (on which the technical problem has arisen) to perform an initial diagnosis in response to a given occurrence (e.g., a PANIC), to facilitate user self-help (as will be described), to submit the diagnosis to the diagnostic center, and to collaborate with the server components in the center to perform further tests, preferably in an iterative manner, and, if possible, to make repairs. One such iterative distributed problem solving technique is described in Ser. No. 09\/073,464, titled \u201cMethod, System and Computer Program Product For Iterative Distributed Problem Solving,\u201d assigned to the assignee of this invention. That application is incorporated herein by reference.","The major client components include a session manager , a diagnostic engine  and a graphical user interface (GUI) . The session manager  takes the initial diagnosis (using a diagnostic map), submits it to the server, tracks open problems, and coordinates the flow of information between the client and the support center. The diagnostic engine is a core piece of code that diagnoses problems and collects data as defined by the diagnostic map(s). It cooperates with a data set builder  to create data sets, and it works together with the session manager  to forward such data sets to the diagnostic center. The client side GUI  may be a simple display icon on the user's desktop that is activated when required by the user seeking technical support. The client GUI  may also be used to provide dialog boxes or the like to enable the user to monitor and\/or interact during a connection with an SE when live help is required.","In the system illustrated in , all communications are made conveniently over TCP networks, but such communications are not dependent on persistent TCP connections. Instead, a single logical session may span multiple TCP connections. A communications subsystem preferably interfaces the client and diagnostic center, managing the input and output queues, and providing basic network location services. In addition, the system may include a security subsystem as network communications should be secure. Thus, for example, a given data set is preferably sealed to restrict access to the data to those having proper credentials. All operations performed on the client machine preferably must first pass security conditions to ensure that only support engineers authorized by the client may inspect or change the client.","A simplified flowchart showing the inventive self-help technique is illustrated in . In the illustrative example to follow, it is assumed that the user has tried, unsuccessfully, to launch a Microsoft Word application and, instead, he or she has received an error message (e.g., \u201cwwint132.dll error\u201d). The display of this error message has prompted the user to request technical support.","Several of the steps described and illustrated are provided by way of background or context and should not be taken to limit the invention. The routine begins at step . At step , a test is run to determine whether the user requires automated technical support. If not, the routine cycles. If, however, the user has indicated his or her request for technical support (e.g., by double clicking an icon in a UI support tray), the routine continues at step  to launch the client program code and its associated server interface (sometimes referred to herein as the Motive Assistant\u2122).","This operation brings up a technical support interface such as illustrated in . As can be seen, the interface preferably includes a listbox that includes a list of possible \u201cproblem areas\u201d that may be selected by the user for a New Service Request. At step , the user selects a problem area. At this point, the user may be prompted to provide a brief summary of the problem encountered. This is step . An illustrative dialog screen for this step is shown in . Thus, in steps  and , a problem area and description are entered by the user. These steps may be combined. In the illustrative example, the user is having difficulty starting a Microsoft Word application. At step , the user submits the New Service Request with the appropriate information.","A test is then performed at step  to determine if the self-help function is enabled. If not, the routine branches to step  to provide the current problem to the live-help system (namely, an SE). If, however, the self-help function is enabled, the routine continues at step . At this time, the user's default Web browser is launched. A Web browser navigation metaphor preferably is used to provide the user with a comfortable and intuitive interaction with the self-help system, although the self-help UI may be system-configurable. At step , a test is performed to determine whether the user's browser has launched. If the outcome of the test at step  is negative, the routine skips the self-help process and (at step ) makes the default interface visible for connecting to live-help.","If, however, the outcome of the test at step  is positive, the routine continues at step  to test whether the user's identity has been established by the automated technical support system. If not, the routine continues at step  to obtain the user's contact information to store such information in a registry. Thereafter, or if the outcome of the test at step  is positive, the routine continues at step .","In particular, an HTTP request is then made to the automated technical support server. Based on the contact information (as well as other basic parameters such as OS type, values entered by the user in problem submission fields, and the like) passed, the routine then continues at step  to serve a self-help home page to the user's default browser. A representative self-help home page, based on the Microsoft Word example previously described, is illustrated in . According to a feature of the present invention, the home page includes a search field  that is populated automatically, namely, by the system itself, by a self-help search string . The home page is displayed as a starting point to enable the user to attempt to solve the problem at hand. As can be seen, the home page may include Alerts and Late Breaking Information, a link to a Current Category that the problem is associated with, and a set of SubCategories, each with appropriate links. The home page may also include links  to so-called \u201cactive content\u201d for the Current Category comprising FAQs, Release Notes, Support Notes, and the like. These links help the user search the existing knowledge base.","Thus, according to an aspect of the present invention, guided self-help is facilitated through use of so-called \u201cactive content\u201d pages. Active content is Web-based content (i.e., content viewable by a Web browser) that has one or more diagnostic maps initiated when certain actions are taken (e.g., selecting a link, clicking a button, or the like). In an illustrative embodiment, a given diagnostic map is associated with a page via a URL, although any convenient mechanism may be used to associate a page and a map. When that URL results from selecting a link or button on the Web page, a Web server supporting the support chain automation system has special extensions that recognize it as a map (rather than, for example, a reference to another Web page). The active content functionality of the invention enables the user to determine if a particular technical problem described by an external page applies to the user's actual system.","Generalizing, regular HTML-based content is sometimes referred to herein as basic content. It may include FAQs, problem\/resolution notes, alerts, how to notes, update notes, as well as other types of support information. \u201cActive content\u201d refers generally to basic content that has been activated with an \u201cactivator\u201d. An activator is an object that adds intelligence to the basic content. An illustrative activator is a diagnostic map. Active content may also be thought of as basic content that has been activated by attaching one or more diagnostic maps to such content.","Thus, there may be several different types (e.g., FAQ, Alert, Note, etc.) of active content. According to the invention, existing Web site information and Web site look and feel may be incorporated into the technical support server by editing a set of default active content related templates, one for each type. Active content may link to other Web-based content via URLs to provide full function multimedia support notes, \u201chow to\u201d information, and the like.","As noted above and as illustrated in , the page is based on the Web browser metaphor and is template-based for ease of configuration. In particular, the diagnostic center may modify the look and feel of the self-help system to match a given theme, layout or motif.","The search string  is a value that, when fed into the technical support server's search engine , should produce relevant hits, namely, information for solving the technical problem. In the preferred embodiment, the search string is generated dynamically through the use of a diagnostic map that executes on the client machine. The diagnostic map examines the client system (including the existing applications, registry information and the like) and communicates with the technical support server to derive the search string as a background task, namely, without user input. According to the invention, a given diagnostic map is a programmable, reusable object that allows a technical support engineer (SE) or the others to write custom tools for diagnosing problems.","Although not illustrated in , it should be appreciated that, in some instances, execution of a diagnostic map run during the self-help process produces a self-help answer (\u201cyou have problem x\u201d) or a self-help URL (or series of URLs) that the user should probably investigate. It should also be noted that the notion of a diagnostic map preferably is not surfaced directly to the user. During the execution of a given map, however, the user may be asked if he or she desires to check for a particular problem, apply a patch, or the like.","Returning to , at step , the user interacts with the self-help page by navigating the default browser. In this illustrative example, the user launches the search that has been proposed by the system. Alternatively, the system may launch the search automatically for the user. At step , the routine returns a results template page that, in this example, identifies a Support Note link. A representative results template page is shown in . IN this example, the page identifies a Support Note that describes the user's problem (namely, the inability to start Microsoft Word) and the associated error message that prompted the user to initiate the session in the first instance.","Based on the clear relevance of the Support Note, the user selects the link. This is step . Upon activation of the link, the routine continues at step  to navigate the browser to a so-called \u201cactivated page\u201d as illustrated in . A page is said to be activated because it may include active content. As illustrated, the activated page provides the user an option to further diagnose the problem, by selecting a Diagnose button, and\/or the option to apply a fix to the problem, by selecting a Fix button. Each of these options has associated therewith additional explanatory text to facilitate the user's selection. At step , a test is performed to determine whether the user has selected the Diagnose or Fix button.","The routine branches to step  if the user selects Diagnose to execute another diagnostic map. At step , the routine then returns and populates a self-help results page such as illustrated in . This page includes appropriate text identifying whether or not the user's system does, in fact, have the problem identified. It may also include related links and information as illustrated. The user may then navigate to the related links and other information.","Alternatively, the routine branches to step  if the user selects Fix and executes the required fix. At step , the routine returns a self-help results page populated with information confirming the action. Given the previous Microsoft Word example, the self-help results page returned is illustrated in . This page, likewise, may include related links and information.","The self-help results page (in either case) may include a link to live-help. Thus, at step , the routine tests to determine whether live-help is requested. If so, the routine branches to step  and establishes a live SE connection; otherwise, the routine continues processing the self-help function. This completes the processing.","The technical support system may interact with the user's local machine to execute diagnostic maps using a \u201cmini Web server\u201d process running on the client. Thus, for example, the execute map step , among others, may be implemented in this manner. One preferred method for executing a map locally from the client browser begins by sending a special URL to the local mini Web server. The local process authenticates the user, breaks apart the URL to determine which map to run, checks to see if the map is present (and, if not, downloads the map from the system server), \u201cexecutes\u201d the instructions of the map, collects the resulting XML, and then parses the XML looking for self-service tags to be used for further navigation purposes. Thus, for example, the tags enable the user to navigate to a page that describes the problem or to how to fix the problem. This process is also used to generate the system-supplied search string.","Summarizing, the dynamic search string is built up when the diagnostic map is initially run on the user's system. This string is then fed into the server's search engine, and more relevant search \u201chits\u201d may result (or, as in the above example, a self-help answer is found). Some of these hits may, in turn, cause other diagnostic maps to run and, in this manner, the user narrows in on the desired solution. Thus, the present invention provides the ability to run a diagnostic map from the client browser during the self-help session, thereby greatly enhancing the user's likelihood of quickly finding the necessary technical solution.","One of ordinary skill will appreciate that by having the system itself create an \u201cexpert\u201d search string, the present invention leverages the skill of the original author of the diagnostic map and takes full advantage of the knowledge about the user's then-existing configuration. This provides a local context to the search that provides much more efficient and accurate results, thereby increasing the likelihood of a prompt and successful self-help session.","A diagnostic map run during self-help preferably produces an Extensible Markup Language (XML) metaframe, with sections of the XML filled in with new map APIs:\n\n","SelfServiceAnswer\u2014this is the answer that the map obtained. For example, \u201cyou have problem x\u201d;","SelfServiceURL\u2014this is a URL (or series of URL's) that the user should probably investigate;","SelfHelpServiceString\u2014this is a value that, when fed into the search engine, should produce relevant hits. As noted above, the home page template preferably is used to display these results. However, if no SelfServiceAnswer is present in the map results, and only one of the other self-help fields is present, the template step is skipped. For example, if only the SelfHelpSearchString is present, the results of the search will be presented to the end user.","Because the diagnostic map(s) are run from a Web browser, the results are provided as either HTML or as a redirected URL. Preferably, a status bar shows progress while the map is running and, as noted above, a map can optionally interact with the user via map dialog application programming interfaces (APIs).","The present invention has significant advantages. Rather than forcing an end user to be a detective and to enter a series of search strings while attempting to find a solution, the inventive functionality captures the live context of the user's running system and dynamically guides the user to the appropriate subset of relevant active content. Using one or more diagnostic maps, the system performs an electronic diagnosis of the user's system and facilitates further automated technical support. Thus, for example, the inventive functionality may be used to determine automatically whether a support center alert is applicable to the user's individual system, to provide a user with steps and individualized suggestions for accomplishing a specific task (e.g., customized to the user's operating system, version of software, or the like), to perform a sequence of suggestions automatically if the user so chooses, or to perform automatically electronic repairs, or any other set of tasks that would resolve the user's problem. In this manner, the automated technical support functionality electronically and automatically performs the start-to-finish sequence of tasks in a support procedure that was previously performed manually and repetitively.","The self-help function described above provides numerous further advantages. As can be seen, existing Web information can easily be incorporated via links inside the self-help templates. This includes any Web-based content, including multimedia how-to information, and other knowledge bases. Further, at customizable points during the self-help navigation, the user is given the option to escalate to live-help. When this election is made, the default browser is taken down and the default interface obtains focus for live help. In this case, the default browser already has the relevant problem information and, thus, the correct diagnostic map can be run directly. In particular, the problem is sent to the automated technical support server with the original problem description and the self-help map output (which is preferably formatted as XML).","In addition, when the guided support is complete, whether successful (through self-help) or via escalation to live help, the information about the incident is passed on to the server for reporting and analysis purposes. In this self-help case, the server preferably stores this information where it can be batch processed into the remainder of the diagnostic center at regular intervals.","Preferably, the client side code manages the guided support experience such that the user is provided a consistent and logical user interface as illustrated above. After using self-help and not having been able to resolve the problem, the user may request live help via the client side code. As noted above, when live help is requested, the incident is sent to the server at this time to be routed to a SE queue. All self-help related information is preferably made available to the router for use in making a routing decision.","Moreover, upon opening an incident report, the telemetry data provided by the client side code summarizes all the self-help actions the user took, including all search strings and those actually traversed. This information is provided preferably in a guided support display group on the analyst's desktop. A representative interface illustrating the information is provided in . The system thus automatically provides all relevant self-help information to the SE and makes that information available for display on the SE's desktop. As a result, the user is not forced to repeat to the SE all of his or her self-help actions.","According to another feature of the present invention, during a live help session, the SE may actually access and review the same self-help pages reviewed by the user during the self-help session. The engineer then may also repeat, against the user's machine, all or part of the self-help session to facilitate diagnosis and repair of the technical problem. In this manner, the SE can use the self-help functionality to find a diagnostic map, run a diagnostic map, or point a user to a resource (e.g., a URL) that, upon activation, executes a diagnostic map. Thus, the same self-help content (or portions thereof) used to guide the user during the guided self-help session may be used at the support center to guide the support technician to a solution from within the context of the technician's desktop. This greatly simplifies and reduces the complexity and burden of the live help session.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0092","num":"0094"},"figref":["FIGS. 13\u201320","FIG. 13","FIG. 13"],"b":["121","123","122","124","126","128","125"]},"Turning to  in particular, the Telemetry Explorer panel  shows all of the maps that have been run as part of the particular incident being displayed and the telemetry that was collected. The information preferably is categorized and shown in a tree structure for quick navigation. As noted above, telemetry is the diagnostic information collected by the map run on the end user's system. To view the telemetry, the support analyst opens the Telemetry Explorer tab  from the default desktop. The left panel  shows a hierarchical view of groups, or categories, of information in the telemetry (indicated by folder icons). The top-level of the tree identifies the Incident, the second level identifies the map(s) run (in this case, Windows 95 OS), and the third level identifies the Map Results (namely, the telemetry generated upon execution of the given map). Thus, these categories are defined in the map by display groups or individual commands that return collections of data. Clicking on the +\/\u2212 boxes expands or collapses the category. Selecting an item in the left panel displays the contents or details of that item in the right panel. The Incident information is grouped into several categories, namely: incident information , including incident ID, queue, host name of machine on which the map executed, and a summary statement and description of the problem entered by the user, and incident state , including current status of the incident, support analyst assigned, priority and severity level, and the dates when the incident was created, last modified and closed (if applicable). Although not shown, the screen expands, for example, to display customer information such as the end user's name, company name, email address, and the like.","Preferably, the map results are grouped according to the structure of the map executed. For example, the map may define display groups that might include all the installed hardware information in one group and all the installed applications in another group. Telemetry is preferably displayed in the right panel by clicking on a given map in the hierarchy, as indicated in . When additional maps are run for an incident, the new telemetry preferably appears after the previous map.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0095","num":"0097"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 15","FIG. 16"],"b":["124","140","140","142"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0096","num":"0098"},"figref":"FIG. 17","b":["126","146","148","150","152"]},"The Message Center panel  is illustrated in . The Message Center allows the system analyst to send active messages to the end user and view active messages sent by the end user. The Message Center thus displays what has been said by the user, and what has been said in response by the system analyst. As the dialog proceeds, the information is recorded.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0098","num":"0100"},"figref":["FIG. 19","FIG. 19"],"b":["160","162"]},"Preferably, a systems analyst can manually add entries to the active journal by adding a note, clicking a note, adding telemetry references, and adding a reference to an active page. In particular, the analyst adds a note preferably by clicking in the comment box of an empty entry at the bottom of the journal. The box then prompts the analyst for an entry. The analyst then clicks anywhere outside of the box to commit the entry, which will also show the time, date, and author. An existing note field is edited by clicking the existing note field. Telemetry references may be added by dragging a selected item from the Telemetry Explorer to the journal. The system analyst may then be prompted to add a note for the entry. A reference is added to the active page by locating the page in the Content Browser, and then clicking the Add to Journal toolbar button. The analyst may also be prompted to add a note for the entry at this time.","Journal entries may be modified or deleted. In addition, the system analyst can use the journal to navigate within the incident. For example, if a telemetry item is in the journal, he or she can click it to position the Telemetry Explorer to that telemetry. Likewise, if the analyst clicks on a journal entry associated with a content page, the Content Browser appears displaying that page.","Further, depending on how the site has published content, links back to journal entries may be created on content pages whenever a support analyst adds a content entry in a journal. These journal links may appear under a given heading. Moreover, a system analyst may backtrack from the pages displayed to examine what problems and troubleshooting processes have been related to the page in the past. When the analyst then clicks a journal link, a window appears to show the journal content.","When an incident is resolved by a system analyst, it is marked as resolved. Closed or \u201cresolved\u201d incidents may be reviewed using a History Browser , as illustrated in . When the History Browser is selected, e.g., from a menu, it displays a list of the resolved incidents. That list includes a display area  that lists the incidents that have been resolved, and a problem synopsis , which displays summary information on an incident selected by the analyst. The system analyst may use the History Browser to identify other incidents that have been resolved. Each such incident may have an active journal associated therewith, as described above.","Thus, by selecting an incident previously resolved by a first analyst, a second analyst can use the first analyst's journal to attempt to resolve an incident currently facing the second analyst. The active journal entries created by the first analyst (or perhaps others) will typically be quite useful. The overall result of this process of sharing information is a significant decrease in time for addressing a given incident, thereby enhancing operational efficiencies for the overall support organization.","Thus, in the preferred embodiment, when an analyst clicks on a journal link in a content page, the journal may be popped up in another dialog box. The analyst can then browse around the journal entries. If the analyst then clicks on the one of these entries, the system tries to find related data in the current (i.e., the working) incident. For example, if the analyst clicks on a \u201cmap results\u201d entry in the journal, the system will try to find the results of that map in the current incident's telemetry. If that map has not been run for this incident, the support analyst is prompted to run the map. Likewise, if the analyst clicks on a piece of telemetry data that was copied to the Journal, the system will try to find the data in the current incident's telemetry. Again, if such data is not found, the system will prompt the analyst to run the map.","The active journal provides numerous advantages. Foremost, a system analyst may leverage the work of other analysts that have already been exposed to and dealt with a given incident. The journal, in effect, becomes a guide for solving the problem in the future. Moreover, because the journal will often include specific information that was used successfully in the past (e.g., a given map), another system analyst already has information in the journal that either may solve the current incident or, at the very least, provide the analyst with a significant headstart in finding the desired solution. Using the journal, a given system analyst (e.g., an administrator) can associate a note (or some other content) with the journal, which may then be accessed by other analysts as the need arises. As has been described an illustrated, the journal itself is then useful as a navigation tool, or a vehicle for running maps, to drive the system analyst to the desired solution. During a live help session, conversations between the user and the system analyst are recorded, which can also be of assistance when viewed by other analysts. Further, the journal allows information from one incident to be manipulated (e.g., through a drag and drop interface operation), stored in the journal, and then made available for analysis and review by another analyst during another user's session. Of course, given the interactive nature of the journaling function, a given analyst may readily identify that other analysts have used a specific journal to address a given problem. This, in of itself, may lead to a faster response time.","As has been illustrated, preferably there is one active journal for each incident that shows that history of the incident. The journal automatically records the problem statement, support analyst assignment history, and map execution. During resolution of a given incident, the system analyst may add specific references to telemetry and other content. By adding these references to the journal of an incident, other support analysts can use this information when they view this incident in the History Browser.","The present invention facilitates leveraging of common information across all links in the automated technical support chain. This dramatically improves the efficiency of \u201cback-end\u201d processes in the support chain. For example, if a customer is unable to solve a problem through self-help, the automated support chain passes the specific information about the user's attempts to solve his or her problem along with the diagnostic state of the computer into the support center. This gives the next link in the chain a head-start in solving the problem rather than repeating previous steps, which can be time-consuming and frustrating for the customer.","Because all information in the technical support system is integrated along all points in the support chain, operators of the diagnostic center have the means to run much more efficient and effective reports for improved decision-making. For example, if a large amount of requests are made for content from a server, it may make sense to distribute support notes and maps directly out to end users' systems. Further, the operator may be interested in analyzing the effectiveness of self-service relative to automated service. By having an integrated reporting model, it is possible to analyze how early problems are being solved in the support chain and devise strategies to push solutions to earlier (and less expensive) links in the chain through time.","According to the present invention, various types of management reports may be generated for use in analyzing the effectiveness of the guided support process in general, the effectiveness of specific FAQ\/resolutions, the effectiveness of specific maps, user satisfaction statistics, the self-help to live service info, \u201chow to\u201d versus system problem splits, and the like.","In the prior art, the responsibility of weeding out irrelevant support information is usually given to the end user. When a user is given too many choices, especially ones that do not matter, time is wasted and frustration levels rise. An advantage of the guided self-help functionality of the present invention is the ability to cut through all of the clutter and get to the root cause of the problem. This is accomplished in part by the creation of specific active content support pages into self selecting content. In particular, given logic\/assertions may be added to a diagnostic map such that, when that map is executed, an output is provided that is a probability or weight of the relevance of the content page. As the user browses the categories of the active content trees, these logic segments are run dynamically (maybe automatically or by clicking a button) so that relevant content pages are presented.","As an example, assume that certain active content pages are only relevant for Windows NT client systems. The added assertion would be that the current system is that type of system. A much more complex example would involve checking registry values and installed software versions.","As information is provided to the diagnostic center, it is stored in the RDBMS to enlarge the \u201cknowledge base\u201d stored therein. In this manner, specific problems may be useful in generating new diagnostic maps that are then delivered or deliverable to the client machines as the system \u201cgrows\u201d in expertise.","Although the various methods described are conveniently implemented in a general purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by software, one of ordinary skill in the art would also recognize that such methods may be carried out in hardware, in firmware, or in more specialized apparatus constructed to perform the required method steps.","As used herein, \u201cWeb client\u201d should be broadly construed to mean any computer or component thereof directly or indirectly connected or connectable in any known or later-developed manner to a computer network, such as the Internet. The term \u201cWeb server\u201d should also be broadly construed to mean a computer, computer platform, an adjunct to a computer or platform, or any component thereof. Of course, a \u201cclient\u201d should be broadly construed to mean one who requests or gets the file, and \u201cserver\u201d is the entity which downloads the file.
