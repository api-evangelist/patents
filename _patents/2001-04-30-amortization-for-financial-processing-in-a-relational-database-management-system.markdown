In addition, there is no agreement as to the rules for profitability calculations, outside of generally accepted accounting policies that external auditors use.","Yet, the majority of financial processing systems attempt to use profitability calculations to differentiate between sources of revenues and expenses. There is a need, then, for a flexible approach to profitability calculations in terms of the overall metric, as well as the type of data used.","A Value Analyzer is a data-driven computer-facilitated financial processing system that accesses account, event and organization attributes from a relational database management database, wherein: (1) the account attributes comprise data about accounts being measured, (2) the event attributes comprise data about account-related transactions, and (3) the organization attributes comprise data about the organization's financial status.

This data includes: balance, rate (or interest accrued), product identification, limits, expected default frequency, and various dates (e.g., open, rate reset, last payment, next payment, maturity, etc.).","Event Attributes  comprise data about account-related events or transactions. This data includes: account identification, event or transaction amounts, event or transaction location, event or transaction time, counter-party identification, event or transaction type (e.g., loan payment, interest paid, loan draw down amount, etc.).","Organization Attributes  comprise data about the financial status of the organization. This data includes: balance sheet and profit statement amounts aggregated by the legal or management entities that own the account base being measured.","Profit Factors  include parameter values necessary to perform the Profitability Calculations . The major classifications of this data include:\n\n","Rules","The Profitability Calculations  use one or more Rules  applied to data retrieved from the RDBMS . These Rules  include, inter alia, the following:","Treatments. Every account with cash flows affecting a organization's balance sheet requires a method of valuing the account's use of internal funds. One approach is \u201cmatched maturity funds transfer pricing,\u201d which uses a canonical representation of an account's funding characteristics and then determines a value based on adjusted market yields for each instance that requires an interest rate transfer price to calculate an account's marginal Net Interest Revenue.","Equity Allocation. In order to provide precise Net Interest Revenue calculations, the amount of equity funds required at an account must be determined. This rule allows for equity allocation using any of the following methods: simple ratios; regulatory definitions; economic allocations, or user defined allocations.","Apportionment. Other Revenue, Risk Provision and Indirect Expense calculations are applied at the account level using Organization Attributes  that are not related directly to account activity. These profit adjustments are made so that the sum of all account-level Profitability Calculations  comprises the overall profit. One approach is to pool indirect costs and revenues and then apportion them. Apportionment rules specify how the pooled indirect costs and revenues is completely allocated to appropriate accounts, wherein the preferred embodiment uses closed form allocation rules, which require only information known in the current period and not iterative computation.","Amortization. Some types of income or expense are deferred or accrued over multiple periods, including and subsequent to the current accounting period. This is common to accrual accounting methods used in profit presentations of financial statements, and gives rise to timing differences between cash flows and their related profit as presented in a financial statement in any accounting period. Since the Value Analyzer is designed to reconcile to the financial statement's profit values, it supports deferral and accrual accounting principles. Amortization methods that account for these timing differences are: interest amortization (used for interest income and expense accruals and for deferral of fees that are in lieu of interest), and straight line or declining balance amortizations (used for cost deferrals and investment depreciation).","Other Revenue Pricing. In situations where account and event activity can be used to derive account level income or fees, the Value Analyzer calculates these drivers of the profitability in the Other Revenue calculations. These calculations comprise linear combinations of event or account values and modeled coefficients.","Direct Expense. The calculation of account profit adjustments due to account-related activity requires rules that take the form of linear combinations of event or account values and modeled coefficients.","Indirect Expense. In situations where expense apportionment or amortization amounts are aggregated, the user may want different rules applied depending on the path (or dimension) of aggregation. These rules allow for multiple profit calculations rules to be applied to derive multiple account level Indirect Expense amounts.","Risk Provision. Adjusting current profit for expected future losses is known as \u201cactuarial\u201d profit provisioning. The Value Analyzer applies actuarial-based methods in its account level profit calculations, where the actuarial reserve that the provisions maintain represents the expected loss associated with all accounts.","Taxable Equivalent Gross-up. Profit is an after-tax measure, and thus some events or portions of some accounts' profits may be excluded from normal taxation. The Value Analyzer adjusts these pre-tax values, so that a singular tax rate can be used to convert pre-tax profit into after-tax values, which are also known as taxable equivalent adjustment. These rules use account and event attributes to adjust each of the five factors of the FFAPM to a taxable equivalent basis.","Interest Yield Adjustments. Since the Value Analyzer can calculate profits for any number of periods, the adjustment of cash interest payments, and the financial statement's accrual or smoothed representation of interest-related Profit, the Value Analyzer provides a method for converting cash interest amounts to accrual amounts for financial statements. The Value Analyzer implements an \u201ceffective interest rate\u201d conversion to accomplish this type of calculation.","Profitability Calculations","The following describes the method used by the Profit Calculations :","1. Retrieve data from the RDBMS .","2. Calculate Net Interest Revenue for every account.","3. Calculate Other Revenue for every account.","4. Calculate Direct Expense for every account.","5. Calculate Indirect Expense for every account.","6. Calculate Risk Provision for every account.","7. Calculate Profit for every account.","8. Store the FFAPM Profit and the five factors of FFAPM into the RDBMS .","9. Aggregate and\/or re-calculate the FFAPM Profit and the five factors of FFAPM as necessary.","Note that steps 2 through 6 perform account-level calculations. Steps 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 can be performed independently and in parallel, while step 7 requires values derived in steps 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, and therefore must be performed after steps 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are completed.","Output Definition","The Profit Calculations  generate one or more values for the five factors of the FFAPM , and specifically, the NIR, OR, DE, IE, RP, and Profit values. These values are used to generate the output data , which can be stored by the RDBMS  in the relational database.","Analytic Variations","The Value Analyzer operates on data and calculations across a continuum, in order to provide the analytic variations necessary for financial processing at various levels of aggregation. This continuum is comprised of multiple tiers as described below:","basic\u2192intermediate\u2192advanced\u2192breakthrough.","Not every tier is necessarily present for each element of data or every calculation.","This continuum embodies the notion of inheritance, wherein the data and calculations of the higher tiers embody the data and calculations of the lower tiers. The principle of inheritance means that the data and calculations by which the separate tiers are defined are nested, i.e., the definition of \u201cintermediate\u201d includes the definition of \u201cbasic,\u201d but with added functionality that goes beyond \u201cbasic,\u201d and so on. Thus, there is consistency in the data and calculations performed at the different tiers in the continuum.","Amortization","Often, the Other Revenue, Direct Expense, Indirect Expense, or Risk Provision components of profitability to be assigned to an account must be amortized over a period of time. This reflects an accrual accounting method, rather than a cash flow accounting method. This allows cash flows that occur within a specific processing period to be recognized over time, thereby creating a more consistent picture of profitability over the life of an account. The amount of cash recognized in a future period is known as that period's \u201camortization.\u201d","In one embodiment, the present invention supports three different methods of amortization: straight-line, declining balance (e.g., single, double, or X declining), and interest methods. The choice of method is made at the level where accounts are linked to the amount to be amortized. The amortization life may be account specific, and when account data on estimated remaining life are available, default life values will be set at the time that the account-amount linkage occurs.","The following amortization properties are supported:\n\n","For any amortization method, there is a set of parameters required, including the following:\n\n","Amortization of amounts over a period of time is really a two-step process. The first step is to determine the amount to be amortized for the entire period. The second step is to determine the amount to be amortized in the current processing period, and to store the relevant data to calculate the amounts to be amortized in subsequent processing periods. Subsequent processing periods access this data and calculate the appropriate amount to be recognized, or amortized for that processing period.","An additional requirement is to start amortization of an amount after the amortization period has begun. In these cases, the system needs to have an additional process, that is, adjust the processing of current periods so that they represent the point in the amortization term from when the amortization of the amount should have started. This will allow the system to amortize amounts for accounts which were originated prior to the current processing period.","Amortization Formulas","As noted above, there are three amortization methods that may be selected. For convenience, a non-deferral (cash basis) method is included as an amortization method, by setting the amortization life to one cycle. In summary, then, the system performs amortization by one of four methods:","1) cash basis,","2) straight line amortization,","3) double declining balance amortization, and\n\n","The amortization requires identifying the amortization life, as well as the method. In many cases, this is the life of the account (such as the term of a loan), but it may be a fixed term depending on business rules and the nature of the deferral amount. As a default, the system assumes the amortization life to be the remaining life of the account, if it is fixed (which it is not for demand accounts, for example). This amount must be amortized over the remaining life of all accounts having this event type in this period. Further, the Financial Institution may choose to override this default life; an assumed life to amortize over is determined at the period of the initial event. If the account is closed prematurely, then the remaining unamortized amount is allocated at the time of closure.

This means there are two parts to each of the amortized and unamortized amounts for each period, the standard calculation plus an adjustment for start date effect.","To make the calculation process easier, two start date adjustments values will be calculated and stored first, then they can be used for any value of i. These values are:\n\n","The amount amortized in the first period is dependent upon the amortization method chosen as described above. Note that a start date adjustment may be made only when the account was originated during the current or prior processing periods. Start date adjustments will not be made to accounts which were opened prior to the start of processing, since those adjustments are not material from a business perspective, and the system would need to calculate the number of days in historical processing periods. This means that the two amounts defined above will have the same value if no start date adjustment was made.","Since the amount to be amortized in any period is determined by the amortization type, the unamortized amount and the amortized amount are also dependent on the amortization type.
