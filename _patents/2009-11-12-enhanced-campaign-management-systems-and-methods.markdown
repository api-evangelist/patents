title: Enhanced campaign management systems and methods
abstract: One exemplary embodiment of the disclosure provides a method to publish campaign data in an electronic environment. The exemplary method includes querying a database to select campaign metadata ready to publish to a target channel system and determining a plurality of value users as a subset of all end users. The value users are determined so that one or more coupons are automatically generated and distributed to each of the value users. A value of the coupon is based on a set of pre-defined criteria including a volume of business generated by the value user or how negatively impacted the value user was based on a negative purchase experience (e.g., product not as described or never received). The target channel system is selected from a plurality of channel systems based on a target indicating attribute of the campaign metadata. The packaged campaign metadata is transferred to the target channel system.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority benefit of U.S. application Ser. No. 11\/583,563, entitled, \u201cMethod and System of Publishing Campaign Data,\u201d filed Oct. 19, 2006, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,892,756 as a continuation-in-part application.","The present application relates generally to the technical field of data publishing and, more particularly, to systems and methods for publishing marketing campaign data from a database to campaign distribution systems.","With the development of network technologies, business users may use networks and communication links to carry marketing campaigns to prospective customers.","Campaign generation systems allow business users to create, edit and save or store campaign metadata. Channel systems such as, for example, email, direct mail, website advertising placements, website email, and outbound call systems are normally used by business users to distribute campaign information to potential customers. The channel systems can be owned and managed by different facilities.","Current campaign generation systems may have insufficient integration capabilities to send both campaign user lists and campaign information, which often includes offer metadata to downstream channel systems or content editing systems. Because of this, a business user may have to create campaign related information in the campaign generation system, and then login to the downstream systems, recreate the campaign related information, and then trigger the distribution of the campaigns to the targeted customers. Improved systems would eliminate duplicate data entry, prevent data errors, increase productivity of business users and shorten delays in campaign delivery to target customers.","Exemplary methods and systems to publish campaign and related user lists to existing and potential customers are described. The description that follows includes illustrative systems, methods, techniques, instruction sequences, and computing machine program products that embody the present invention. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth to provide an understanding of various embodiments of the inventive subject matter. It will be evident, however, to those skilled in the art that embodiments of the inventive subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. Further, well-known instruction instances, protocols, structures, and techniques have not been shown in detail.","As used herein, the term \u201cor\u201d may be construed in either an inclusive or exclusive sense. Similarly, the term \u201cexemplary\u201d is construed merely to mean an example of something or an exemplar and not necessarily a preferred or ideal means of accomplishing a goal. Additionally, although various exemplary embodiments discussed below focus on end-user campaigns in an electronic retail environment, the embodiments are given merely for clarity in disclosure. Thus, any type of electronic commerce or electronic business system and method, including various system architectures, may employ various embodiments of the end-user campaign system and method described herein and is considered as being within a scope of the present invention.","Exemplary embodiments of the invention can publish campaign related metadata created by marketer business users to potential customers. As used herein, \u201ccampaign information\u201d is marketing material sent to segmented customers with a goal of influencing the segmented customers' behavior, for example, attracting the segmented customers to buy a manufacturer's specific products. As used herein, \u201cmetadata\u201d are data that define other data, and \u201cuser lists\u201d are lists that uniquely identify customers targeted for marketing campaigns. In a specific exemplary embodiment defined herein, metadata are sent in the header information of a packet such that everything is sent in a single file.","The exemplary embodiments of the invention can determine how to package the campaign metadata based on the configurations and requirements of the target channel systems. Exemplary embodiments of the invention can also be used to validate the user lists which will be sent to potential customers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","200","300","200","300"]},"In a specific exemplary embodiment, the campaign generation system  is a system available in the market, such as, for example, \u201cUnica Affinium Campaign\u201d of Unica Co. The plurality of channel systems  are systems for distribution of email, direct mail, eBay website advertising placement on eBay.com, eBay MyMessages on eBay.com, which may be available in the market or have been custom built by eBay.com, and other channel systems known independently in the art.","In an exemplary embodiment, an exemplary one of the plurality of channel systems  is a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system used to track and manage inbound and outbound phone calls, such as a product produced by SalesForce.com. In another exemplary embodiment, an exemplary one of the plurality of channel systems  is a CRM system used to track and manage inbound and outbound phone calls. Additionally, the campaign publishing system  can use web service technologies, known independently in the art. For example, the campaign publishing system  can create an XML request (described in more detail, below) with a user list being sent to SalesForce.com.","In a specific exemplary embodiment, a first third party CRM  can be managed by SAP AG or SAP America, Inc., and a second third party CRM  can be managed by an Oracle Corporation CRM. In the case of an XML file being sent to, for example, the second third party CRM , an API web service  may be used as an interface. Electronic communications with each of the third party CRMs can be accomplished through an interface port (not shown directly but known independently to one of skill in the art) coupled to the campaign publishing system .","In an exemplary embodiment, the campaign publishing system  may access a database  as shown in . The database  can be located within or in proximity to the campaign publishing system  or, alternatively, with either the first  or second  third party CRM. The campaign publishing system  reads from and writes to the database . The database  includes a plurality of tables , such as campaign data or metadata. The campaign publishing system  also creates and writes to one or more flat files .","In some exemplary embodiments, the flat files  are stored in the campaign generation system . In other exemplary embodiments, the flat files  are stored on the database . The plurality of tables  is used to store metadata of a marketing campaign, for example, offer details, user information, and user campaign contact history. A flat file is used to store customer data, for example, potential target customer information for a marketing campaign.","As discussed above, in a specific exemplary embodiment defined herein, metadata are sent in the header information of a packet such that everything is sent in a single file. In contrast, certain prior art systems could only send metadata first, wait for a response, and then send the associated flat file.","Preparation for Publishing Campaign Metadata and Related User Lists","Before publishing the campaign metadata and user lists to a plurality of systems via the campaign publishing system , a campaign marketer may prepare marketing campaign related data by utilizing the campaign generation system . The campaign marketer may log into the campaign generation system  through a client computer , which communicates with the campaign generation system  through one or more various types of networks (not shown). For example, the campaign marketer may enter, update, and save campaign and offer metadata to relevant ones of the plurality of tables  in the database .","For instance, assume that a campaign marketer wants to create a new marketing campaign to be sent to all eBay customers who have purchased a toy on eBay.com in the last three months. The marketing campaign is to be sent through an eBay channel system, for example, one which is responsible for sending email campaigns to eBay customers.","In some exemplary embodiments, the marketing campaign is also intended to be sent to an external company responsible for sending postal direct mail campaigns to eBay customers. In other exemplary embodiments, the campaign is to be sent to customer support systems for use in outbound telephone calls to eBay customers. In other exemplary embodiments, the campaign is to be displayed as marketing advertisements to targeted customers on eBay.com.","The campaign marketer may create a new campaign by using a campaign creation page in the campaign generation system , and then save the campaign in a campaign table . After the creation of the metadata for the campaign, in some circumstances, the campaign marketer may update it by changing the status of a campaign from \u201cNew\u201d to \u201cReady to Publish\u201d and saving the campaign.","For example, the campaign publishing system  can automatically launch and e-mail or distribute one or more coupons to a particular subset of end users. The subset of end users is selected based on pre-defined criteria, such as high volume buyers or sellers, or buyers that are negatively impacted due to, for example, improperly described products, products never received, or products that are damaged as received. An additional set of pre-defined criteria is used to determine a value of the coupons distributed to the subset of end users.","A coupon engine  interfaces through the campaign publishing system  and the database . Either high volume users or negatively impacted users are identified as value users. Depending upon either a volume level or a severity of the negative impact to a user, coupons are e-mailed or otherwise sent through one of the plurality of channel systems  to the value users, either directly or through the first  or second  third party CRM services.","The coupons can be redeemed through, for example, a customer loyalty engine  (e.g., applying credit or other incentives). Alternatively or additionally, the coupons can also be redeemed through a coupon reward system  that is tied to, for example, a Paypal Incentive Engine (PIE, not shown). The coupons redeemed through the PIE can be used with a PayPal account (PayPal, Inc. is a division of eBay and is located in San Jose, Calif.).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":"200"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["200","10","200"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},"In some exemplary embodiments, the campaign marketer may use the campaign generation system  to create and save the campaign flowchart  in the campaign generation system . The campaign flowchart  corresponds to a query or series of consecutive queries to the database , which can be performed by using conventional DBMS skills to meet certain business requirements. For example, in some exemplary embodiments, the campaign marketer may choose to build the campaign flowchart  which contains a query to the user_information table. In some exemplary embodiments, the campaign marketer may select all buyers who have opted out of email communications. The campaign marketer may merge the two selects together, so the resulting output is the intersect of all toys buyers minus all who have opted out. After that, the campaign marketer may feed this result into a sample box, which will allow for segmenting and uniquely tracking members of a \u201choldout\u201d population who are eligible but will not be sent the communication in order for the business to calculate changes in customer behavior due to a campaign.","In some exemplary embodiments, the campaign generation system  may allow a campaign marketer to create user lists and to merge different customer segments (for example, all customers who bought in the Toys category on eBay with all customers who live in California) as well as exclude segments (for example, remove all customers who bought in the Apparel category) to generate a final list of customers and their email addresses. The user list can be the output of the campaign generation system .","With reference concurrently to , a method  of publishing campaign metadata of a campaign from database  to a plurality of channel systems  in accordance with an exemplary embodiment. In an exemplary embodiment, at step , the method  initiates the process of publishing campaign metadata. In an exemplary embodiment, for all campaigns, the campaign marketer initiates the process of publishing campaign metadata by saving a campaign with an attribute of \u201cready to publish.\u201d The campaign is saved in the database  and the campaign generation system . In an exemplary embodiment, a campaign flowchart  (see ) is saved in the campaign generation system .","In an exemplary embodiment, a the campaign flowchart  is run once from the campaign generation system . In another exemplary embodiment, an external system calls the campaign generation system  by using an exposed API of the campaign generation system  to run the campaign flowchart . In an exemplary embodiment, the call is done daily for a campaign, for example, \u201cWelcome new eBay users\u201d campaign, which is sent to all newly registered users each night.","In an exemplary embodiment, metadata is published by saving the campaign and setting the channel attribute (for example, email, mail, phone) to \u201cready to publish.\u201d The publishing is only done once per campaign, unless it is intended to update metadata, for example, to change the end date of the campaign.","At step , the campaign publishing system  queries a campaign table  in the database  to select campaign metadata with status \u201cready to publish.\u201d Each campaign metadata includes a channel indicator attribute to indicate a target one or ones of the plurality of channel systems , thus the campaign publishing system  knows to which one of the plurality of channel systems  to publish the selected campaign metadata.","At step , the campaign publishing system  selects a target one or ones of the plurality of channel systems  from a plurality of channel systems  based on the target indicator attribute of the campaign metadata.","At step , the campaign publishing system  determines whether the target one or ones of the plurality of channel systems  has a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) enabled web service Application Programming Interface (API) or whether the target one or ones of the plurality of channel systems  only accepts Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) posts.","At step A, if the campaign publishing system  determines that the target one or ones of the plurality of channel systems  has a SOAP enabled web service API, then at step A the campaign publishing system  packages the campaign metadata as an Extensible Markup Language (XML) message object.","Otherwise, at step B, if the campaign publishing system  determines that the target one or ones of the plurality of channel systems  only accepts HTTP posts, then at step B the campaign publishing system  packages the campaign metadata as a Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) request.","At step , the campaign publishing system  transfers all the packaged campaign metadata to the target one or ones or ones of the plurality of channel systems . In some exemplary embodiments, the campaign publishing system  transfers the XML message object to the target one or ones or ones of the plurality of channel systems  using SOAP over HTTP protocol. In some exemplary embodiments, the campaign publishing system  transfers the HTML request to the target one or ones of the plurality of channel systems  over HTTP protocol. At step , the method  of publishing the campaign metadata stops.","In an exemplary embodiment, after the step , the campaign publishing system  aggregates one or more offers and corresponding metadata to the selected campaign and campaign metadata. In an exemplary embodiment, the campaign publishing system  handles system errors of each step by sending email alerts to a support team and logging system errors to log files.","In an exemplary embodiment, after the campaign metadata has been transferred successfully, the campaign publishing system  updates the status of all the transferred campaign metadata in the database  to \u201csuccessful\u201d to identify that such campaign metadata has been transferred successfully.","Referring now concurrently to , a method  of publishing a user list for a marketing campaign from a database  to a plurality of channel systems  in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure.","In an exemplary embodiment, for a one-time campaign sent only once to customers, at step , the campaign marketer initiates the process of publishing user lists for a marketing campaign by running the flowchart . In some exemplary embodiments, the campaign flowchart  is saved in the campaign publishing system . In other exemplary embodiments, the campaign flowchart  is saved in the database .","In another exemplary embodiment, at step , for a recurring campaign, the process of publishing user lists for a marketing campaign is initiated by a \u201ccron job\u201d run periodically, for example, weekly, daily, or every 5 minutes. In an exemplary embodiment, the cron job is located within campaign publishing system . In another exemplary embodiment, the cron job is located in an external system, for example, campaign generation system .","At step , the campaign publishing system  queries the database  to obtain user lists of customer data meeting certain business requirements. In an exemplary embodiment, the user list obtained is associated to a campaign which has campaign metadata. The campaign metadata includes a channel indicator attribute, for example, \u201cKC1\u201d (see ) to indicate a target one or ones of the plurality of channel systems , accordingly the campaign publishing system  uses this channel indicator attribute to identify which one or ones of the plurality of channel systems  to publish a selected user list.","At step , the campaign publishing system  selects a target one or ones of the plurality of channel systems  based on the channel indicator attribute included in the campaign metadata.","At step , the campaign publishing system  uses internal configuration properties to determine whether or not the target one or ones of the plurality of channel systems  has a SOAP enabled web service API.","If the target one or ones of the plurality of channel systems  is SOAP enabled, the campaign publishing system  writes the user list to an XML file at step A, validates the XML file at step A, and transfers the packaged user list to the target one or ones of the plurality of channel systems  at step A using SOAP over HTTP protocol.","If it is not SOAP enabled, the campaign publishing system  writes the user list to the flat files  at step B, validates the flat files  at step B, validates the associated campaign metadata at step , and transfers the user list to the target one or ones of the plurality of channel systems  by copying the flat files  to the target one or ones of the plurality of channel systems  via a Secure Copying Protocol (SCP) at step B.","At step A and B mentioned above, the campaign publishing system  validates the XML file and the flat files . In some exemplary embodiments, the publishing process will be aborted and an email alert will be sent to a system administrator, if the campaign publishing system  finds any of the following cases exist: (1) the XML file or the flat files  are empty; (2) the XML file or the flat files  do not contain all required fields for the targeted channel system; or (3) any of the required fields in the XML file or the flat files  are not in valid format. For example, no spaces or invalid characters exist in the following fields of the XML file or the flat files : email address, address (city, state, address1, and address2), offer version, Segment_ID. In an exemplary embodiment, if any of the invalidations in the XML file or the flat files  are found, the campaign publishing system  will stop the publishing process and will send errors to an administrator.","In an exemplary embodiment, at step B mentioned above, the campaign publishing system  validates if the metadata of the flat files  matches the metadata of the associated campaign which has been successfully published to a targeted one or ones of the plurality of channel systems . If they do not match, in an exemplary embodiment, the campaign publishing system  will send errors to an administrator.","At step , after transferring the user list to the target of the plurality of channel systems , the campaign publishing system  writes the user list to a contact history table. In some exemplary embodiments, the contact history table is saved in the database  (including, for example, marketing information) for reporting and for customer suppression in subsequent marketing campaigns. At step , the process of publishing the user lists to the target channel system ends.","With reference again to  concurrently, a specific exemplary embodiment illustrates how to use the campaign publishing system  to publish a marketing campaign to potential customers. A campaign marketer logs in to the campaign generation system , navigates to a campaign created earlier, opens the campaign flowchart and selects \u201cEdit.\u201d Then, the marketer edits the flowchart.","For example, the campaign marketer builds customer segments via a query to the user_information table according to the business requirements for certain marketing purposes. The campaign marketer also selects all buyers who have opted out of email communication. The campaign marketer merges the two selects together, so a resulting output is an intersection of all ebay.com toys buyers minus all opt outs. The campaign marketer feeds this result into a sample box, which allows the marketer to segment out a holdout population. The holdout population is a group of customers who are selectively removed from the campaign in order for eBay to evaluate the effectiveness of the campaign, for example, the amount of purchases by customers who were eligible and did receive the campaign versus the amount of purchases by customers that were eligible but did not receive campaign.","The campaign marketer selects two mail list boxes and in the first, named \u201cemail output,\u201d assigns the previously created email offers to the Toys customer segment. The campaign marketer uses the second titled \u201cpostal output,\u201d and assigns the postal offer to the same segment of Toys customers. The campaign marketer uses a third mail list box to represent the \u201chold out\u201d segment, and assigns the Holdout offer to the holdout segment.","At this point the campaign flowchart  is built, and when run, will query the database for the customer segment according to requirements. The campaign flowchart  will assign offers to resulting segments, output the segments to the contact history table, and create the flat files  for the email and direct mail user lists. The campaign marketer saves the campaign flowchart  and returns to the campaign summary page. On the campaign summary page, the campaign marketer changes the eBay Marketing System (EMS) Publish Trigger from \u201cNew\u201d to \u201cReady for Publish\u201d and saves the campaign. This updates the data from \u201cNew\u201d to \u201cReady\u201d in a table, which can be used to trigger or publish a campaign. For example, the table UAC_CAMPAIGN.EMS_PUBLISH_TRIGGER can be used to trigger the campaign.","The campaign publishing system  is called, for example, every 5 minutes by a cron job process. The process calls the campaign publishing system  which queries the database and reads from the UAC_CAMPAIGN.EMS_PUBLISH_TRIGGER field for all records that are \u201cReady,\u201d (campaigns in a status of \u201cReady for Publish\u201d). In this case, it will find the above campaign in a status of \u201cready,\u201d and campaign publishing system  will follow logic specific to an eBay Marketing System, in order to build the related Campaign and Offer metadata and send using XML over SOAP to the external EMS system. The campaign marketer is able to see the transfer was successful by refreshing their browser on the campaign summary page. If successful, campaign publishing system  will write a status message to a field of a table (for example, UAC_CAMPAIGN), which is read by a campaign generation system  and displayed on the campaign summary page in the EMS success message field, for example \u201cEMS Transfer Successful.\u201d","EMS is used for email content creation, and an EMS user updates a program created by the campaign metadata sent over from campaign publishing system . For example, the program name will be created with Campaign Name, the start date and end date will be as indicated in the campaign metadata. In addition, the offers sent from campaign publishing system  will appear as codes which can be appended to the URLs within the campaign content. Using the descriptive Offer Names, the EMS user knows to assign the US_ToysNewHotItem_08162006_JP offer code to the links specific to the Toy's Content or image. Same for the Apparel content or image. The EMS user will finalize the email content, save and send to the Email channel systems using FTP (File Transfer Protocol) for subsequent launch.","Now that the content is ready, all pre-steps have been completed the user can transfer the campaign metadata to the email and postal channel and run the campaign (for example, run the flowchart ). The user will login to the campaign generation system  and navigate to the US_ToysMonthlyBuyer_08162006_JP campaign and select edit. On the campaign summary page, the user will change the value of Kana Publish Trigger from \u201cNew\u201d to \u201cReady to Publish\u201d and select Save. This will change a corresponding value in the field from New to Ready. A cron job is constantly running, calling the campaign publishing system  to scan the UAC_CAMPAIGN.Kana_Publish_trigger table for all Kana_publish_trigger=\u201cready.\u201d If found, the campaign publishing system  will query for all related metadata and package the corresponding xml for the channel. In this case, channel is \u201cKC1\u201d (eBay.com, for example, has three email systems: KC1, KC2, and KC3). The campaign publishing system  will initiate a Web Service call passing the metadata as well formed XML to the email system's Web Service API. The user is able to see the transfer was successful by refreshing their browser on the campaign summary page. If successful, the campaign publishing system  will write a status message to the UAC_CAMPAIGN.KANA_SUCCESS_MESSAGE field which is read by campaign generation system  and displayed on the campaign summary page in the Kana Success Message Field, for example \u201cKana Successful Transfer.\u201d","The campaign marketer user can then navigate to the campaign flowchart and select \u201cRun.\u201d This will cause the campaign generation system  to run the flowchart , which executes the pre-built queries against the database tables, pulls the matching users, and writes the user list to a flat file for Email and a different flat file for Postal as well as to the UAC_CONTACT_HISTORY table. Upon completion, the campaign generation system  will make a call to the campaign publishing system  to do two things. First, validate the content of the flat files meets business requirements. Second, transfer the validated flat files to the corresponding channel systems.","The campaign publishing system  performs validation on both the flat files , making sure that the flat files  are not empty, there are no abnormal characters in the fields, the flat files  are delimited correctly, and the metadata in the flat files  matches the metadata associated to the campaign. If all these checks pass, the flat files  are transferred using Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) from the server of campaign publishing system  to the KC1 email server and to the Postal server, respectfully.","At this point, the user may navigate to an email portion of the plurality of channel systems , find the corresponding campaign, associate the finished campaign content sent earlier from EMS, and launch the campaign. These actions cause the email system to send out email content to all customers on the campaign user list. Concurrently, an external postal catalog publisher may take the campaign publishing system postal flat file and use the corresponding customer name and addresses in this file for an eBay Catalog. The content of the catalog may be provided by an external vendor, and the postal catalog publisher will use their processes to associate customer name and address to catalog and send via postal mail. Thus, the campaign will be published to the potential customers.","Referring now to , a block diagram illustrates a machine in the example form of a computer system , within which a set of sequence of instructions for causing the machine to perform any one of the methodologies discussed herein may be executed. In alternative exemplary embodiments, the machine may be a server computer, a client computer, a personal computer (PC), a tablet PC, a set-top box (STB), a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), a cellular telephone, a web appliance, a network router, switch or bridge, or any machine capable of executing a set of instructions that specify actions to be taken by that machine. Further, while only a single machine is illustrated, the term \u201cmachine\u201d shall also be taken to include any collection of machines that individually or jointly execute a set of instructions to perform any one or more of the methodologies discussed herein.","The example computer system  includes a processor  (for example, a central processing unit (CPU) a graphics processing unit (GPU) or both), a main memory  and a static memory , which communicate with each other via a bus .
