Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a method, system, and article of manufacture for backing-up and restoring files including files referenced with multiple file names.","2. Description of the Related Art","Certain backup programs are designed to backup operating system state files, comprising those files required by the operating system to operate, such as dynamic link library (DLL) files, etc. The purpose of such backup programs is to backup those files needed to restore the operating system state to the state at the time of backup. The Tivoli\u00ae Storage Manager (TSM) backup archive client may backup all system state components in a single object to provide a consistent point-in-time snapshot of the system state. (Tivoli is a registered trademark of International Business Machines Corporation in the United States and other countries) On a Microsoft\u00ae Windows Server\u00ae system, the system state components to backup include active directory, system volume, COM+ database files, registry files, system and boot files. (Microsoft and Windows Server are registered trademarks of the Microsoft Corporation in the United States and other countries) The TSM backup archive client may transfer the object including the system state files to a TSM backup server that manages backup objects for multiple clients.","In certain embodiments, multiple names may be used to reference a file. For instance, in certain Microsoft\u00ae Windows\u00ae operating systems, a file may have multiple names that reference the file, referred to as hard links and soft or symbolic links. Further, Windows Vista\u2122 System Backup has the capability to backup an image and restore files having multiple names by restoring only one copy of the file from the image. (Windows Vista is a trademark of the Microsoft Corporation in the United States and other countries).","There is a need in the art for improved techniques for backing up files, including files which may be referenced by multiple file names.","Provided are a method, system, and article of manufacture for backing-up and restoring files including files referenced with multiple file names. Files to backup are determined. A determination is made from the files to backup files referenced with multiple names. An entry is created for each file to backup in a backup directory indicating file attributes and each name used to reference the file. The determined files and the backup directory are backed-up.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["2","4","6","2","8","10","12","14","8","2","8","12","16","18","4","12","18","18","16","2","20"]},"The clients  that communicate with the backup server  may comprise suitable computational devices known in the art, such as servers, desktop computers, workstations, mainframes, hand held computing devices, telephony devices, etc. The backup server  may comprise a suitable server system known in the art. The backup repository  may be implemented in a storage system known in the art, such as a storage system including a plurality of storage devices, e.g., interconnected hard disk drives (a Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID), Just a Bunch of Disks (JBOD), Direct Access Storage Device (DASD), disks connected in a loop configuration (serial loop, Fibre Channel Arbitrated Loop), a single storage device, a tape library, an optical library, a network attached storage (NAS), etc. The network  may comprise a Wide Area Network (WAN), Local Area Network (LAN), Storage Area Network (SAN), wireless network, the Internet, an Intranet, peer-to-peer network, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["30","16","32","34","32","34","30","34","8","34","32","34"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["40","42","14","44","46","46","48","48","40","14"],"i":["a ","n ","a ","n"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["12","30","100","12","102","34","12","10","104","112","12","106","110","106","12","40","32","42","44","12","108","12","12","14","40"]},"The backup client program  then indicates (at block ) the determined one or more file names referencing the file and each name length in the entry  being constructed. After generating backup directory entries  for each file to backup (at block ), the backup client program  writes (at block ) the determined files  and the backup directory  to a backup object . The backup client program  transfers (at block ) the generated backup object  to the backup server program  to store in the backup repository .","In one embodiment, the backup client program  may create the backup object  in a local memory or storage of the client  and then transfer the completed backup object  to the backup server program . In an alternative embodiment, the backup client program  may stream the contents of the backup object  being generated to the backup server program  to avoid having to read and write the backup object to local storage.","With the described operations of , the backup object includes self-contained information in the form of the backup directory  that maintains information on multiple names that may reference a single file. Further, in certain embodiments, only one instance of a file having multiple file names is included in the backup object .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"],"b":["12","30","2","2","34","30","150","12","152","30","18","12","16","20","30","12","154","34","2","8","12","156","162","158","160","30","12","158","40","32","30","12","160","14","46","46","40"],"i":["a ","n "]},"With the described operations of , only one instance of a file is restored, or written to the client  storage. Further, the backup directory  provides the information needed to create one or more entries in the file system  for the one or more file names that reference the file without having to write multiple instances of the file to the client  local storage.","Described embodiments provide techniques to backup and restore files to a backup object in a manner that avoids writing multiple instances of a file referenced with multiple file names to the backup object and that avoids restoring multiple instances of the file referenced with multiple file names. With the described embodiments, only one instance of a file is written to a backup object and the information on the multiple file names for a file are maintained in a backup directory  for the backup object. For the restore operation, the backup directory is used to write only one instance of the file back to the client and then update the client file system  to include the multiple names that reference the file.","The described operations may be implemented as a method, apparatus or article of manufacture using standard programming and\/or engineering techniques to produce software, firmware, hardware, or any combination thereof. The described operations may be implemented as code maintained in a \u201ccomputer readable medium\u201d, where a processor may read and execute the code from the computer readable medium. A computer readable medium may comprise media such as magnetic storage medium (e.g., hard disk drives, floppy disks, tape, etc.), optical storage (CD-ROMs, DVDs, optical disks, etc.), volatile and non-volatile memory devices (e.g., EEPROMs, ROMs, PROMs, RAMs, DRAMs, SRAMs, Flash Memory, firmware, programmable logic, etc.), etc. The code implementing the described operations may further be implemented in hardware logic (e.g., an integrated circuit chip, Programmable Gate Array (PGA), Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), etc.). Still further, the code implementing the described operations may be implemented in \u201ctransmission signals\u201d, where transmission signals may propagate through space or through a transmission media, such as an optical fiber, copper wire, etc. The transmission signals in which the code or logic is encoded may further comprise a wireless signal, satellite transmission, radio waves, infrared signals, Bluetooth, etc. The transmission signals in which the code or logic is encoded is capable of being transmitted by a transmitting station and received by a receiving station, where the code or logic encoded in the transmission signal may be decoded and stored in hardware or a computer readable medium at the receiving and transmitting stations or devices. An \u201carticle of manufacture\u201d comprises computer readable medium, hardware logic, and\/or transmission signals in which code may be implemented. A device in which the code implementing the described embodiments of operations is encoded may comprise a computer readable medium or hardware logic. Of course, those skilled in the art will recognize that many modifications may be made to this configuration without departing from the scope of the present invention, and that the article of manufacture may comprise suitable information bearing medium known in the art.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["250","2","4","250","252","254","256","256","258","256","254","252","260","262","262","264","252"]},"The terms \u201can embodiment\u201d, \u201cembodiment\u201d, \u201cembodiments\u201d, \u201cthe embodiment\u201d, \u201cthe embodiments\u201d, \u201cone or more embodiments\u201d, \u201csome embodiments\u201d, and \u201cone embodiment\u201d mean \u201cone or more (but not all) embodiments of the present invention(s)\u201d unless expressly specified otherwise.","The terms \u201cincluding\u201d, \u201ccomprising\u201d, \u201chaving\u201d and variations thereof mean \u201cincluding but not limited to\u201d, unless expressly specified otherwise.","The enumerated listing of items does not imply that any or all of the items are mutually exclusive, unless expressly specified otherwise.","The terms \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d mean \u201cone or more\u201d, unless expressly specified otherwise.","The variable \u201cn\u201d when used to represent a variable number of an element may indicate any number of instances of the element, and may indicate different integer numbers when used with different elements.","Devices that are in communication with each other need not be in continuous communication with each other, unless expressly specified otherwise.
