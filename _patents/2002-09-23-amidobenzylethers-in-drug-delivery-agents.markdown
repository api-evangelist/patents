{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 09\/963,103, filed Sep. 24, 2001, now U.S. Pat, No. 7,091,186 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The invention is in the field of pharmaceuticals, and provides drug conjugates as prodrugs for the delivery of drugs to cell populations, where the prodrugs are metabolized and activated by endogenous enzymes to provide active drugs.","Metastatic carcinomas often express proteolytic enzymes including the cysteine protease cathepsin B (Demchik, L. L.; Sloane, B. F. Cell-Surface Proteases in Cancer. In ; A. Turk, Ed.; Birkhauser Verlag: Basel, 1999; pp 109-124; Mai, J.; Waisman, D. M.; Sloane, B. F. Cell Surface Complex of Cathepsin B\/Annexin II Tetramer in Malignant Progression. 2000, 1477, 215-230; Koblinski, J. E.; Ahram, M.; Sloane, B. F. Unraveling the Role of Proteases in Cancer. 2000, 291, 113-135), matrix metalloproteinases such as collagenases and stromelysins (Davidson, A. H.; Drummond, A. H.; Galloway, W. A.; Whittaker, M. The Inhibition of Matrix Metalloproteinase Enzymes. 1997, 258-261), and serine proteases, represented by plasminogen activator and plasmin (Andreasen, P. A.; Egelund, R.; Petersen, H. H. The Plasminogen Activation System in Tumor Growth, Invasion, and Metastasis. 2000, 57, 25-40). These enzymes are thought to be critically involved in the events that lead to metastasis, since they are capable of degrading the basement membranes and extracellular matrices around tumor tissues, allowing the tumor cells to migrate and invade into the surrounding stroma and endothelium. Additional activities associated with these proteases include participation in protease cascades, activation of enzymes and growth factors, and in tumor angiogenic stimulation.","Several investigators have explored the possibility of exploiting tumor-associated proteases for the development of new cancer chemotherapeutics. This has led to several promising orally active protease inhibitors having both preclinical and clinical antitumor activities (Davidson, A. H.; Drummond, A. H.; Galloway, W. A.; Whittaker, M. The Inhibition of Matrix Metalloproteinase Enzymes. 1997, 258-261). An additional line of research involves the conscription of proteases for anticancer prodrug activation. Towards this end, peptide-containing anticancer prodrugs have been developed that are activated by proteases within solid tumors (Dubowchik, G. M.; Walker, M. A.

Pharmacokinetics of PK1 and Doxorubicin in Experimental Colon Tumor Models With Differing Responses to PK1. 1999, 5, 3682-3688). Several of these agents have led to significant in vitro and in vivo antitumor activities.","There are two general approaches for attaching drugs to peptides for intratumoral proteolytic activation. In the first approach, the drug is appended directly to the peptide, leading to prodrugs that can either release the parent drug or release a drug that contains vestiges of the bound peptide (Putnam, D. A.; Shiah, J. G.; Kopecek, J. Intracellularly Biorecognizable Derivatives of 5-Fluorouracil. 1996, 52, 957-962; Harada, M.; Sakakibara, H.; Yano, T; Suzuki, T.; Okuno, S.

Enzymatic Activation of a Doxorubicin-Peptide Prodrug by Prostate-Specific Antigen. 1998, 58, 2537-2540). In the latter case, the released drug may have impaired cytotoxic activity. An additional consideration for direct drug attachment to peptides is the negative influence the drug can have on the kinetics of peptide hydrolysis.","To circumvent these potential shortcomings, a second approach has been developed that relies on the use of self-immolative spacers to separate the drug from the site of enzymatic cleavage. The incorporated spacer allows for the release of fully active, chemically unmodified drug from the conjugate upon amide bond hydrolysis. A commonly used spacer utilizes the bifunctional p-aminobenzyl alcohol group, which is linked to the peptide through the amine moiety, thereby forming an amide bond. Amine-containing drugs are attached through carbamate functionalities to the benzylic hydroxyl group of the p-aminobenzyl alcohol-based spacer. The resulting prodrugs are activated upon protease-mediated cleavage, leading to a 1,6-elimination reaction (Wakselman, M. 1,4- and 1,6-Eliminations from Hydroxy- and Amino-Substituted Benzyl Systems: Chemical and Biochemical Applications. 1983, 7, 439-447) that splits off unmodified drug and carbon dioxide.","This methodology, based on the work of Sartorelli, Katzenellenbogen and coworkers (Teicher, B. A.; Sartorelli, A. C. Nitrobenzyl Halides and Carbamates as Prototype Bioreductive Alkylating Agents. 1980, 23, 955-960; Carl, P. L.; Chakravarty, P. K.; Katzenellenbogen, J. A. A Novel Connector Linkage Applicable in Prodrug Design. 1981, 24, 479-480) has been applied to plasmin catalyzed release of phenylenediamine mustard (Chakravarty, P. K.; Carl, P. L.; Weber, M. J.; Katzenellenbogen, J. A. Plasmin-Activated Prodrugs for Cancer Chemotherapy. 1. Synthesis and Biological Activity of Peptidylacivicin and Peptidylphenylenediamine Mustard. 1983, 26, 633-638) and anthracyclines (Chakravarty, P. K.; Carl, P. L.: Weber, M. J.; Katzenellenbogen, J. A. Plasmin-Activated Prodrugs for Cancer Chemotherapy. 2. Synthesis and Biological Activity of Peptidyl Derivatives of Doxorubicin. 1983, 26, 638-644; de Groot, F. M. H.; de Bart, A. C. W.; Verheijen, J. H.; Scheeren, H. W.

M.; Firestone, R. A. Cathepsin B-Sensitive Dipeptide Prodrugs. 1. A Model Study of Structural Requirements for Efficient Release of Doxorubicin. 1998, 8, 3341-3346; Dubowchik, G. M.; Mosure, K.; Knipe, J. O.; Firestone, R. A. Cathepsin B-Sensitive Dipeptide Prodrugs. 2. Models of Anticancer Drugs Paclitaxel (Taxol), Mitomycin C and Doxorubicin. 1998, 8, 3347-3352; Greenwald, R. B.; Pendri, A.; Conover, C. D.; Zhao, H.; Choe, Y. H.; Martinez, A.; Shum, K.; Guan, S. Drug Delivery Systems Employing 1,4- or 1,6-Elimination: Poly(ethylene glycol) Prodrugs of Amine-Containing Compounds. 1999, 42, 3657-3667). The same linkage system has also been applied for the activation of anthracyclines in cells that were transfected with carboxypeptidase G2 (Niculescu-Duvaz, I.; Niculescu-Duvaz, D.; Fiedlos, F.; Spooner, R.; Martin, J.; Marais, R.; Springer, C. J. Self-Immolative Anthracycline Prodrugs for Suicide Gene Therapy. 1999, 42, 2485-2489).","The chemistry used for drug attachment has generally been restricted to amine-containing drugs, with the exception of paclitaxel, which was linked through carbonates derived from hydroxyl groups at the 2\u2032 or 7-position (Dubowchik, G. M.; Mosure, K.; Knipe, J. O.; Firestone, R. A. Cathepsin B-Sensitive Dipeptide Prodrugs. 2. Models of Anticancer Drugs Paclitaxel (Taxol), Mitomycin C and Doxorubicin. 1998, 8, 3347-3352; de Groot, F. M. H.; van Berkon, L. W. A.; de Bart, A. C. W.; Scheeren, H. W. Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of 2\u2032-Carbonate-Linked and 2\u2032-Carbonate-Linked Prodrugs of Paclitaxel: Selective Activation by the Tumor-Associated Protease Plasmin. 2000, 43, 3093-3102). Unlike many carbonates that are hydrolytically unstable, these paclitaxel 2\u2032 and 7-carbonates were quite stable in aqueous environments, consistent with what had already been reported for other paclitaxel carbonates (Ueda, Y; Matiskella, J. J.; Mikkilineni, A. B.; Farina, V.; Knipe, J. O.; Rose, W. C.; Casazza, A. M.; Vyas, D. M. Novel, Water-Soluble Phosphate Derivatives of 2\u2032-Ethoxy Carbonylpaclitexel as Potential Prodrugs of Paclitaxel: Synthesis and Antitumor Evaluation. 1995, 5, 247-252; Senter, P. D.; Marquardt, H.; Thomas, B. A.; Hammock, B. D.; Frank, I. S.; Svensson, H. P. The Role of Rat Serum Carboxylesterase in the Activation of Paclitaxel and Camptothecin Prodrugs. 1996, 56, 1471-1474). Many drugs containing reactive hydroxyl groups would not be expected to exhibit such high carbonate stability.","The present invention recognizes and addresses the need for broadly useful and versatile methodologies for attaching drugs, including anticancer drugs, to self-immolative spacers, which would lead to high serum stability and conditional drug release upon peptide bond hydrolysis.","The recitation of any reference in Section 2 of this application is not an admission that the reference is prior art to this application.","In one aspect, the present invention provides compositions and methods which may be utilized to target a drug-ligand conjugate (prodrug) to a selected cell population, such as tumor sites, where the prodrug is enzymatically activated to release the drug. Based upon one aspect of the invention described herein, many drugs containing reactive hydroxyl groups may be converted into a prodrug form and in particular may be converted into a prodrug form capable of targeting a selected cell population, where these forms may have the desirable property of high stability in human serum. This new prodrug activation strategy is based on the remarkable and unexpected self-elimination reaction of aminobenzyl ethers as illustrated in Scheme 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"70.36mm","wi":"76.20mm","file":"US07553816-20090630-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"The drug conjugates of this invention comprise at least one drug moiety, and a prodrug linker. The prodrug linker is made up of an aminobenzyl ether-based self-immolative spacer, a peptide comprising a recognition\/cleavage site for the enzymes, and optional moieties such as one or more of an acyl unit, and a second self-immolative spacer which separates the drug and the aminobenzyl ether spacer. In one aspect, the prodrug linker joins (links, couples) the drug residue to a ligand for a biological receptor. In another aspect, the prodrug linker has an N-terminus in addition to the terminus that is coupled to the drug residue, where the N-terminus is blocked by a protecting group.

In one aspect, the drug may be derivatized through a reactive functional group that is important for the biological activity of the drug thereby inhibiting or reducing the pharmacological activity of the drug to thereby convert the drug into a pharmacologically inactive or relatively inactive peptidyl derivative conjugate. The prodrug linker contains a peptide specifically tailored so as to render a drug conjugate of the present invention a selective substrate susceptible to enzymatic cleavage by one or more proteases, e.g., preferably lysosomal proteases, such as cathepsin B, C or D. The enzymatic cleavage reaction will remove the prodrug linker from the drug moiety by triggering the self-elimination of the aminobenzyl ether spacer group, and affect the release of the drug in its pharmacologically active form.","In one aspect, the present invention provides drug conjugates having superior serum stability. For example, in contrast to drug conjugates wherein a hydroxyl group of a drug is linked to a spacer via a labile carbonate linkage that is susceptible to rapid hydrolysis in aqueous buffer or human serum, the drug conjugates of the present invention utilizing a benzyl ether linkage are relatively more stable under the same conditions, and selectively undergo ether fragmentation to release the drug upon treatment with protease, e.g., cathepsin B. Serum stability is a desirable property for drug conjugates where it is desired to administer inactive drug to the patient's serum, have that inactive drug concentrate at a target by way of the ligand, and then have that drug conjugate converted to an active form only in the vicinity of the target.","In one aspect, the present invention provides drug conjugates that are characterized by the capability of the drug conjugate to target a selected cell population, for example, a tumor site. In one aspect, the drug conjugate comprises a ligand that is linked to a drug moiety through a prodrug linker. The ligand serves to deliver the drug conjugate to the desired target site by binding to a receptor distinctively associated with the cell population at the target site. In another aspect, the peptide of a ligand-free drug conjugate is a highly selective substrate for tumor specific enzymes that are present at the tumor site in sufficient amounts to generate cytotoxic levels of free drug in the proximity of the tumor.","Ideally, the toxic activity of the drug is greatly reduced or absent when the drug is bonded directly to the prodrug linker where the prodrug linker is further coupled with either a ligand or a blocking group. Because the free drug is only released in the proximity of a targeted cell population, the conjugates of the present invention provide both specificity and therapeutic drug activity for the treatment of the selected cell population. They may be used in a pharmaceutical composition, such as one comprising a pharmaceutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I or II below, in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient.","In another aspect, the invention provides methods for treatment of cancers or precancerous conditions and other tumors in animal subjects. For instance, the invention provides compounds and compositions for use in a method for treating tumors wherein the animal subject is treated, in a pharmaceutically acceptable manner, with a pharmaceutically effective amount of a compound or composition of the present invention. Representative examples of precancerous conditions, include, but are not limited to, metaplasia, hyperplasia, dysplasia, colorectal polyps, actinic ketatosis, actinic cheilitis, human papillomaviruses, leukoplakia, lychen planus and Bowen's disease.","In another aspect, the present invention provides compositions comprising an effective amount of a drug conjugate and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or vehicle.","In another aspect, the present invention provides methods for killing or inhibiting the multiplication of a tumor cell or cancer cell, comprising administering to an animal in need thereof an effective amount of a drug conjugate.","In yet another aspect, the invention provides methods for treating cancer, comprising administering to an animal in need thereof an effective amount of a drug conjugate.","In another aspect, the invention provides methods for killing or inhibiting the replication of a cell that expresses an auto-immune antibody, comprising administering to an animal in need thereof an effective amount of a drug conjugate.","In yet another aspect, the invention provides methods for treating an autoimmune disease, comprising administering to an animal in need thereof an effective amount of a drug conjugate.","In still another aspect, the invention provides methods for treating an infectious disease, comprising administering to an animal in need thereof an effective amount of a drug conjugate.","In another aspect, the present invention provides methods for preventing the multiplication of a tumor cell or cancer cell, comprising administering to an animal in need thereof an effective amount of a drug conjugate.","In yet another aspect, the invention provides methods for preventing cancer, comprising administering to an animal in need thereof an effective amount of a drug conjugate.","In another aspect, the invention provides methods for preventing the multiplication of a cell that expresses an auto-immune antibody, comprising administering to an animal in need thereof an effective amount of a drug conjugate.","In yet another aspect, the invention provides methods for preventing an autoimmune disease, comprising administering to an animal in need thereof an effective amount of a drug conjugate.","In still another aspect, the invention provides methods for preventing an infectious disease, comprising administering to an animal in need thereof an effective amount of a drug conjugate.","The present invention may be understood more fully by reference to the following detailed description, Figures and illustrative examples, which are intended to exemplify non-limiting embodiments of the invention.","In one aspect, the present invention provides novel drug conjugates comprised of a ligand capable of targeting a selected cell population, and a drug connected to the ligand via a prodrug linker. The peptide-containing prodrug linker, shown as the group of chemical moieties within the square brackets in (I), is composed of an amino acid or a peptide (Z), an aminobenzyl ether self-immolative spacer (X), an optional acyl unit (A), and an optional second self-immolative spacer (W), which may separate the drug from the aminobenzyl ether group.

The desired biological activity includes the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals. Thus, so long as it has the needed reactive functional group, the term \u201cdrug\u201d refers to chemicals recognized as drugs in the official United States Pharmacopeia, official Homeopathic Pharmacopeia of the United States, or official National Formulary, or any supplement thereof Exemplary drugs are set forth in the Physician's Desk Reference (PDR) and in the Orange Book maintained by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Representative examples of derivatives of drugs disclosed herein include, but are not limited to camptothecin derivatives, such as topotecan, CPT-11 and 9-AC; taxol derivatives, such as taxotere; and the etoposide (VP-16) derivative, teniposide.","The drug conjugates as represented by formula I of the present invention are effective for the usual purposes for which the corresponding drugs are effective, and have superior efficacy because of the ability, inherent in the ligand, to transport the drug to the desired cells where it is of particular benefit.","The drug conjugates as represented by formula II of the present invention are effective for the usual purposes for which the corresponding drugs are effective, and have superior efficacy because they are capable of being selectively activated by enzymes associated with the cell population of interest.","In the drug conjugates of formulas I and II, when the only spacer is an aminobenzyl ether group (w=0), D is a drug that contains a hydroxyl group by means of which the drug is coupled to the aminobenzyl ether spacer group. Upon enzyme-activated fragmentation, as shown in Scheme 1, the aminobenzyl ether group decomposes to form an iminoquinone methide compound and the drug. It is speculated that initially upon decomposition, the drug is present in the form of an anion, i.e., a compound of the formula D-O, which is the conjugate base of a drug with the formula D-OH. Accordingly, as one factor in understanding the kinetics of the decomposition process, the stability of the D-O structure may be considered important. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, the drug has a hydroxyl group that is relatively acidic, i.e., has a relatively stable conjugate base of the formula D-O. In various aspects of the invention, the pKa of the \u201clinking\u201d hydroxyl group of the drug is 16 or less, 15 or less, 14 or less, 13 or less, 12 or less, 11 or less, 10 or less, 9 or less, and typically, the pKa will be greater than 3, or greater 4, or greater than 5, where the invention includes each possible combination of the listed lower and upper pKa values.","In one aspect, the \u201clinking\u201d hydroxyl group, i.e., the hydroxyl group of the drug that is used to conjugate the drug to the aminobenzyl group, is attached to an aromatic ring. Typically, hydroxyl groups that are attached to aromatic rings have greater acidity than hydroxyl groups that are attached to an aliphatic group. Perhaps for this reason, drugs with aromatic ring-bound hydroxyl groups typically tend to decompose more rapidly than drugs with aliphatic bound hydroxyl groups in the conjugates of the present invention. Nevertheless, in one aspect of the invention, the hydroxyl group that links the drug to the conjugate is bonded to an aliphatic carbon of the drug.","Factors other than the acidity of a hydroxyl group may be important in describing the kinetics of the decomposition process. Another factor to be considered is the steric strain of the conjugate. In general, as the drug is more sterically confined by being conjugated in the prodrug form, the drug will more readily separate from the prodrug form upon decomposition of the aminobenzyl ether group.","Yet another factor to consider is the substitution on the aromatic ring of the aminobenzyl ether group, i.e., the choice of the J group. As that substitution is better able to stabilize the decomposition product and\/or destabilize the drug conjugate, the substitution will be able to promote the decomposition process. Thus, with drugs that have relatively unstable D-O forms, and\/or that are not sterically strained in the prodrug form, it is preferred to select substitution for the aromatic ring of the aminobenzyl ether group such that the prodrug will more quickly decompose under the desired in vivo or in vitro conditions.","In one aspect, the drug used in the present invention is a cytotoxic drug, and particularly a cytotoxic drug that has demonstrated efficacy in cancer therapy.

Various procedures well known in the art may be used for the production of polyclonal antibodies to an antigen-of-interest. For example, for the production of polyclonal antibodies, various host animals can be immunized by injection with an antigen of interest or derivative thereof, including but not limited to rabbits, mice, rats, and guinea pigs. Various adjuvants may be used to increase the immunological response, depending on the host species, and including but not limited to Freund's (complete and incomplete), mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide, surface active substances such as lysolecithin, pluronic polyols, polyanions, peptides, oil emulsions, keyhole limpet hemocyanins, dinitrophenol, and potentially useful human adjuvants such as BCG (bacille Calmette-Guerin) and . Such adjuvants are also well known in the art.","In one embodiment, the ligand is a monoclonal antibody.","Useful monoclonal antibody ligands are homogeneous populations of antibodies to a particular antigen (e.g., a cancer cell antigen, a viral antigen, a microbial antigen covalently linked to a second molecule). A monoclonal antibody (mAb) to an antigen-of-interest can be prepared by using any technique known in the art which provides for the production of antibody molecules by continuous cell lines in culture. These include, but are not limited to, the hybridoma technique originally described by Kohler and Milstein (1975256, 495-497), the human B cell hybridoma technique (Kozbor et al., 19834: 72), and the EBV-hybridoma technique (Cole et al., 1985, Alan R. Liss, Inc., pp. 77-96). Such antibodies may be of any immunoglobulin class including IgG, IgM, IgE, IgA, and IgD and any subclass thereof. The hybridoma producing the mAbs of use in this invention may be cultivated in vitro or in vivo.","Useful monoclonal antibody ligands include, but are not limited to, human monoclonal antibodies or chimeric human-mouse (or other species) monoclonal antibodies. Human monoclonal antibodies may be made by any of numerous techniques known in the art (e.g., Teng et al., 198380, 7308-7312; Kozbor et al., 19834, 72-79; and Olsson et al., 198292, 3-16).","The ligand can also be a bispecific antibody. Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditional production of full-length bispecific antibodies is based on the coexpression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pairs, where the two chains have different specificities (Milstein et al., 1983305:537-539). Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, these hybridomas (quadromas) produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules, of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. Purification of the correct molecule, which is usually performed using affinity chromatography steps, is rather cumbersome, and the product yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed in International Publication No. WO 93\/08829, and in Traunecker et al., 10:3655-3659 (1991).","According to a different and more preferred approach, antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities (antibody-antigen combining sites) are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion preferably is with an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domain, comprising at least part of the hinge, CH2, and CH3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy-chain constant region (CH1) containing the site necessary for light chain binding, present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and, if desired, the immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate expression vectors, and are co-transfected into a suitable host organism. This provides for great flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yields. It is, however, possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains in one expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios are of no particular significance.","In a preferred embodiment of this approach, the bispecific antibodies have a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm, and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pair (providing a second binding specificity) in the other arm. This asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations, as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation (International Publication No. WO 94\/04690) which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","For further details for generating bispecific antibodies see, for example, Suresh et al., 1986, 121:210. Using such techniques, bispecific antibody ligands can be prepared for use in the treatment or prevention of disease as defined herein.","Bifunctional antibodies are also described, in European Patent Publication No. EPA 0 105 360. As disclosed in this reference, hybrid or bifunctional antibodies can be derived either biologically, i.e., by cell fusion techniques, or chemically, especially with cross-linking agents or disulfide-bridge forming reagents, and may comprise whole antibodies or fragments thereof. Methods for obtaining such hybrid antibodies are disclosed for example, in International Publication WO 83\/03679, and European Patent Publication No. EPA 0 217 577, both of which are incorporated herein by reference.","The ligand can be a functionally active fragment, derivative or analog of an antibody that immunospecifically binds to cancer cell antigens, viral antigens, or microbial antigens. In this regard, \u201cFunctionally active\u201d means that the fragment, derivative or analog is able to elicit anti-anti-idiotype antibodies that recognize the same antigen that the antibody from which the fragment, derivative or analog is derived recognized. Specifically, in a preferred embodiment the antigenicity of the idiotype of the immunoglobulin molecule can be enhanced by deletion of framework and CDR sequences that are C-terminal to the CDR sequence that specifically recognizes the antigen. To determine which CDR sequences bind the antigen, synthetic peptides containing the CDR sequences can be used in binding assays with the antigen by any binding assay method known in the art (e.g., the BIA core assay)","Other useful ligands include fragments of antibodies such as, but not limited to, F(ab\u2032)2 fragments, which contain the variable region, the light chain constant region and the CH1 domain of the heavy chain can be produced by pepsin digestion of the antibody molecule, and Fab fragments, which can be generated by reducing the disulfide bridges of the F(ab\u2032)2 fragments. Other useful ligands are heavy chain and light chain dimers of antibodies, or any minimal fragment thereof such as Fvs or single chain antibodies (SCAs) (e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,778; Bird, 1988242:423-42; Huston et al., 198885:5879-5883; and Ward et al., 1989334:544-54), or any other molecule with the same specificity as the antibody.","Additionally, recombinant antibodies, such as chimeric and humanized monoclonal antibodies, comprising both human and non-human portions, which can be made using standard recombinant DNA techniques, are useful ligands. A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions are derived from different animal species, such as those having a variable region derived from a murine monoclonal and a human immunoglobulin constant region. (See, e.g., Cabilly et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Boss et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,397, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.) Humanized antibodies are antibody molecules from non-human species having one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from the non-human species and a framework region from a human immunoglobulin molecule. (See, e.g., Queen, U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.) Such chimeric and humanized monoclonal antibodies can be produced by recombinant DNA techniques known in the art, for example using methods described in International Publication No. WO 87\/02671; European Patent Publication No. 184,187; European Patent Publication No. 171,496; European Patent Publication No. 173,494; International Publication No. WO 86\/01533; U.S. Pat.

(1988) 239:1534; and Beidler et al., 1988141:4053-4060; each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Completely human antibodies are particularly desirable for ligands. Such antibodies can be produced using transgenic mice that are incapable of expressing endogenous immunoglobulin heavy and light chains genes, but which can express human heavy and light chain genes. The transgenic mice are immunized in the normal fashion with a selected antigen, e.g., all or a portion of a polypeptide of the invention. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen can be obtained using conventional hybridoma technology. The human immunoglobulin transgenes harbored by the transgenic mice rearrange during B cell differentiation, and subsequently undergo class switching and somatic mutation. Thus, using such a technique, it is possible to produce therapeutically useful IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE antibodies. For an overview of this technology for producing human antibodies, see Lonberg and Huszar (199513:65-93). For a detailed discussion of this technology for producing human antibodies and human monoclonal antibodies and protocols for producing such antibodies, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,625,126; U.S. Pat. No. 5,633,425; U.S. Pat. No. 5,569,825; U.S. Pat. No. 5,661,016; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,545,806; each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Other human antibodies can be obtained commercially from, for example, Abgenix, Inc. (Freemont, Calif.) and Genpharm (San Jose, Calif.).","Completely human antibodies that recognize a selected epitope can be generated using a technique referred to as \u201cguided selection.\u201d In this approach a selected non-human monoclonal antibody, e.g., a mouse antibody, is used to guide the selection of a completely human antibody recognizing the same epitope. (Jespers et al. (1994) 12:899-903).","In other embodiments, the ligand is a fusion protein of an antibody, or a functionally active fragment thereof, for example in which the antibody is fused via a covalent bond (e.g., a peptide bond), at either the N-terminus or the C-terminus to an amino acid sequence of another protein (or portion thereof, preferably at least 10, 20 or 50 amino acid portion of the protein) that is not the antibody. Preferably, the antibody or fragment thereof is covalently linked to the other protein at the N-terminus of the constant domain.","The ligand antibodies include analogs and derivatives that are either modified, i.e., by the covalent attachment of any type of molecule as long as such covalent attachment permits the antibody to retain its antigen binding immunospecificity. For example, but not by way of limitation, the derivatives and analogs of the antibodies include those that have been further modified, e.g., by glycosylation, acetylation, pegylation, phosphylation, amidation, derivatization by known protecting\/blocking groups, proteolytic cleavage, linkage to a cellular ligand or other protein, etc. Any of numerous chemical modifications can be carried out by known techniques, including, but not limited to specific chemical cleavage, acetylation, formulation, metabolic synthesis of tunicamycin, etc. Additionally, the analog or derivative can contain one or more unnatural amino acids.","The ligand antibodies include antibodies having modifications (e.g., substitutions, deletions or additions) in amino acid residues that interact with Fe receptors. In particular, the ligand antibodies include antibodies having modifications in amino acid residues identified as involved in the interaction between the Fc domain and the FcRn receptor (see, e.g., International Publication No. WO 97\/34631, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Antibodies immunospecific for a cancer cell antigen can be obtained commercially, for example, from Genentech (San Francisco, Calif.) or produced by any method known to one of skill in the art such as, e.g., chemical synthesis or recombinant expression techniques.

Examples of antibodies available useful for the treatment of viral infection or microbial infection include, but are not limited to, S(MedImmune, Inc., MD) which is a humanized anti-respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) monoclonal antibody useful for the treatment of patients with RSV infection; PRO542 (Progenics) which is a CD4 fusion antibody useful for the treatment of HIV infection; O(Protein Design Labs, Inc., CA) which is a human antibody useful for the treatment of hepatitis B virus; P(Protein Design Labs, Inc., CA) which is a humanized IgGantibody useful for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV); and anti-LPS antibodies.","Other antibodies useful in the treatment of infectious diseases include, but are not limited to, antibodies against the antigens from pathogenic strains of bacteria (() fetus, spp., spp.); pathogenic fungi (); protozoa (); or Helminiths (, and hookworms).","Other antibodies useful in this invention for treatment of viral disease include, but are not limited to, antibodies against antigens of pathogenic viruses, including as examples and not by limitation: Poxyiridae, Herpesviridae, Herpes Simplex virus 1, Herpes Simplex virus 2, Adenoviridae, Papovaviridae, Enteroviridae, Picomaviridae, Parvoviridae, Reoviridae, Retroviridae, influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, mumps, measles, respiratory syncytial virus, rubella, Arboviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Arenaviridae, Hepatitis A virus, Hepatitis B virus, Hepatitis C virus, Hepatitis E virus, Non-A\/Non-B Hepatitis virus, Rhinoviridae, Coronaviridae, Rotoviridae, and Human Immunodeficiency Virus.","The antibodies suitable for use in the invention can be produced by any method known in the art for the synthesis of antibodies, in particular, by chemical synthesis or by recombinant expression, and are preferably produced by recombinant expression techniques.","Ligand antibodies of the invention can be produced using any method known in the art to be useful for the synthesis of antibodies, in particular, by chemical synthesis or by recombinant expression, and are preferably produced by recombinant expression techniques.","Recombinant expression of the ligand antibodies, or fragment, derivative or analog thereof, requires construction of a nucleic acid that encodes the antibody. If the nucleotide sequence of the antibody is known, a nucleic acid encoding the antibody may be assembled from chemically synthesized oligonucleotides (e.g., as described in Kutmeier et al., 199417:242), which involves the synthesis of overlapping oligonucleotides containing portions of the sequence encoding the antibody, annealing and ligation of those oligonucleotides, and then amplification of the ligated oligonucleotides by PCR.","Alternatively, a nucleic acid molecule encoding an antibody can be generated from a suitable source. If a clone containing the nucleic acid encoding the particular antibody is not available, but the sequence of the antibody is known, a nucleic acid encoding the antibody can be obtained from a suitable source (e.g., an antibody cDNA library, or cDNA library generated from any tissue or cells expressing the immunoglobulin) by PCR amplification using synthetic primers hybridizable to the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of the sequence or by cloning using an oligonucleotide probe specific for the particular gene sequence.","If an antibody that specifically recognizes a particular antigen is not commercially available (or a source for a cDNA library for cloning a nucleic acid encoding such an immunoglobulin), antibodies specific for a particular antigen can be generated by any method known in the art, for example, by immunizing an animal, such as a rabbit, to generate polyclonal antibodies or, more preferably, by generating monoclonal antibodies, e.g., as described by Kohler and Milstein (1975256:495-497) or, as described by Kozbor et al. (19834:72) or Cole et al. (1985 in , Alan R. Liss, Inc., pp. 77-96). Alternatively, a clone encoding at least the Fab portion of the antibody can be obtained by screening Fab expression libraries (e.g., as described in Huse et al., 1989246:1275-1281) for clones of Fab fragments that bind the specific antigen or by screening antibody libraries (See, e.g., Clackson et al., 1991352:624; Hane et al., 1997 94:4937).","Once a nucleic acid sequence encoding at least the variable domain of the antibody is obtained, it can be introduced into a vector containing the nucleotide sequence encoding the constant regions of the antibody (see, e.g., International Publication No. WO 86\/05807; International Publication No. WO 89\/01036; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,122,464). Vectors containing the complete light or heavy chain that allow for the expression of a complete antibody molecule are available. Then, the nucleic acid encoding the antibody can be used to introduce the nucleotide substitutions or deletion necessary to substitute (or delete) the one or more variable region cysteine residues participating in an intrachain disulfide bond with an amino acid residue that does not contain a sulfhydyl group. Such modifications can be carried out by any method known in the art for the introduction of specific mutations or deletions in a nucleotide sequence, for example, but not limited to, chemical mutagenesis and in vitro site directed mutagenesis (Hutchinson et al., 1978, J. Biol. Chem. 253:6551).","In addition, techniques developed for the production of \u201cchimeric antibodies\u201d (Morrison et al., 198481:851-855; Neuberger et al., 1984312:604-608; Takeda et al., 1985314:452-454) by splicing genes from a mouse antibody molecule of appropriate antigen specificity together with genes from a human antibody molecule of appropriate biological activity can be used. A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions are derived from different animal species, such as those having a variable region derived from a murine monoclonal antibody and a human immunoglobulin constant region, e.g., humanized antibodies.","Alternatively, techniques described for the production of single chain antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,694,778; Bird, 1988242:423-42; Huston et al., 198885:5879-5883; and Ward et al., 1989334:544-54) can be adapted to produce single chain antibodies. Single chain antibodies are formed by linking the heavy and light chain fragments of the Fv region via an amino acid bridge, resulting in a single chain polypeptide. Techniques for the assembly of functional Fv fragments in may also be used (Skerra et al., 1988242:1038-1041).","Antibody fragments that recognize specific epitopes can be generated by known techniques. For example, such fragments include, but are not limited to, the F(ab\u2032)2 fragments that can be produced by pepsin digestion of the antibody molecule and the Fab fragments that can be generated by reducing the disulfide bridges of the F(ab\u2032)2 fragments.","Once a nucleic acid sequence encoding a ligand antibody has been obtained, the vector for the production of the antibody can be produced by recombinant DNA technology using techniques well known in the art. Methods that are well known to those skilled in the art can be used to construct expression vectors containing the antibody coding sequences and appropriate transcriptional and translational control signals. These methods include, for example, in vitro recombinant DNA techniques, synthetic techniques, and in vivo genetic recombination. See, for example, the techniques described in Sambrook et al. (1990, A Laboratory Manual, 2Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.) and Ausubel et al. (eds., 1998, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, NY).","An expression vector comprising the nucleotide sequence of an antibody or the nucleotide sequence of an antibody can be transferred to a host cell by conventional techniques (e.g., electroporation, liposomal transfection, and calcium phosphate precipitation), and the transfected cells are then cultured by conventional techniques to produce the antibody. In specific embodiments, the expression of the antibody is regulated by a constitutive, an inducible or a tissue, specific promoter.","The host cells used to express the recombinant ligand antibody can be either bacterial cells such as , or, preferably, eukaryotic cells, especially for the expression of whole recombinant immunoglobulin molecule. In particular, mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO), in conjunction with a vector such as the major intermediate early gene promoter element from human cytomegalovirus is an effective expression system for immunoglobulins (Foecking et al., 19845:101; Cockett et al., 19908:2).","A variety of host-expression vector systems can be utilized to express the immunoglobulin ligands. Such host-expression systems represent vehicles by which the coding sequences of the antibody can be produced and subsequently purified, but also represent cells that can, when transformed or transfected with the appropriate nucleotide coding sequences, express a ligand immunoglobulin molecule in situ. These include, but are not limited to, microorganisms such as bacteria (e.g., and ) transformed with recombinant bacteriophage DNA, plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA expression vectors containing immunoglobulin coding sequences; yeast (e.g., ) transformed with recombinant yeast expression vectors containing immunoglobulin coding sequences; insect cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., baculovirus) containing the immunoglobulin coding sequences; plant cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) and tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)) or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors (e.g., Ti plasmid) containing immunoglobulin coding sequences; or mammalian cell systems (e.g., COS, CHO, BH, 293, 293T, 3T3 cells) harboring recombinant expression constructs containing promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells (e.g., metallothionein promoter) or from mammalian viruses (e.g., the adenovirus late promoter; the vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter).","In bacterial systems, a number of expression vectors can be advantageously selected depending upon the use intended for the antibody being expressed. For example, when a large quantity of such a protein is to be produced, vectors that direct the expression of high levels of fusion protein products that are readily purified might be desirable. Such vectors include, but are not limited, to the expression vector pUR278 (Ruther et al., 19832:1791), in which the antibody coding sequence may be ligated individually into the vector in frame with the lac Z coding region so that a fusion protein is produced; pIN vectors (Inouye & Inouye, 198513:3101-3109; Van Heeke & Schuster, 198924:5503-5509); and the like. pGEX vectors can also be used to express foreign polypeptides as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase (GST). In general, such fusion proteins are soluble and can easily be purified from lysed cells by adsorption and binding to a matrix glutathione-agarose beads followed by elution in the presence of free glutathione. The pGEX vectors are designed to include thrombin or factor Xa protease cleavage sites so that the cloned target gene product can be released from the GST moiety.","In an insect system, nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) or the analogous virus from is used as a vector to express foreign genes. The virus grows in cells. The antibody coding sequence can be cloned individually into non-essential regions (for example the polyhedrin gene) of the virus and placed under control of an AcNPV promoter (for example the polyhedrin promoter).","In mammalian host cells, a number of viral-based expression systems can be utilized. In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector, the antibody coding sequence of interest can be ligated to an adenovirus transcription\/translation control complex, e.g., the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence. This chimeric gene can then be inserted in the adenovirus genome by in vitro or in vivo recombination. Insertion in a non-essential region of the viral genome (e.g., region E1 or E3) results in a recombinant virus that is viable and capable of expressing the immunoglobulin molecule in infected hosts. (e.g., see Logan & Shenk, 198481:355-359). Specific initiation signals can also be required for efficient translation of inserted antibody coding sequences. These signals include the ATG initiation codon and adjacent sequences. Furthermore, the initiation codon must be in phase with the reading frame of the desired coding sequence to ensure translation of the entire insert. These exogenous translational control signals and initiation codons can be of a variety of origins, both natural and synthetic. The efficiency of expression can be enhanced by the inclusion of appropriate transcription enhancer elements, transcription terminators, etc. (see Bittner et al., 1987153:51-544).","In addition, a host cell strain can be chosen to modulate the expression of the inserted sequences, or modifies and processes the gene product in the specific fashion desired. Such modifications (e.g., glycosylation) and processing (e.g., cleavage) of protein products can be important for the function of the protein. Different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the post-translational processing and modification of proteins and gene products. Appropriate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the foreign protein expressed. To this end, eukaryotic host cells that possess the cellular machinery for proper processing of the primary transcript, glycosylation, and phosphorylation of the gene product can be used. Such mammalian host cells include, but are not limited to, CHO, VERY, BH, Hela, COS, MDCK, 293, 293T, 3T3, WI38, BT483, Hs578T, HTB2, BT20 and T47D, CRL7030 and Hs578Bst.","For long-term, high-yield production of recombinant proteins, stable expression is preferred. For example, cell lines that stably express an antibody can be engineered. Rather than using expression vectors that contain viral origins of replication, host cells can be transformed with DNA controlled by appropriate expression control elements (e.g., promoter, enhancer, sequences, transcription terminators, polyadenylation sites, etc.), and a selectable marker. Following the introduction of the foreign DNA, engineered cells can be allowed to grow for 1-2 days in an enriched media, and then are switched to a selective media. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci that in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines. This method can advantageously be used to engineer cell lines which express the antibody Such engineered cell lines can be particularly useful in screening and evaluation of tumor antigens that interact directly or indirectly with the antibody ligand.","A number of selection systems can be used, including but not limited to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (Wigler et al., 197711:223), hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Szybalska & Szybalski, 19248:202), and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (Lowy et al., 198022:817) genes can be employed in tk-, hgprt- or aprt-cells, respectively. Also, antimetabolite resistance can be used as the basis of selection for the following genes: dhfr, which confers resistance to methotrexate (Wigler et al., 198077:357; O'Hare et al., 198178:1527); gpt, which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid (Mulligan & Berg, 198178:2072); neo, which confers resistance to the aminoglycoside G-418 (12:488-505; Wu and Wu, 19913:87-95; Tolstoshev, 199332:573-596; Mulligan, 1993260:926-932; and Morgan and Anderson, 199362:191-217; May, 1993, TIB TECH 11(5):155-215) and hygro, which confers resistance to hygromycin (Santerre et al., 198430:147). Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology which can be used are described in Ausubel et al. (eds., 1993, John Wiley & Sons, NY; Kriegler, 1990, Stockton Press, NY; and in Chapters 12 and 13, Dracopoli et al. (eds), 1994, John Wiley & Sons, NY.; Colberre-Garapin et al., 1981150:1).","The expression levels of an antibody can be increased by vector amplification (for a review, see Bebbington and Hentschel, , Vol. 3. (Academic Press, New York, 1987)). When a marker in the vector system expressing an antibody is amplifiable, an increase in the level of inhibitor present in culture of host cell will increase the number of copies of the marker gene. Since the amplified region is associated with the nucleotide sequence of the antibody, production of the antibody will also increase (Crouse et al., 19833:257).","The host cell can be co-transfected with two expression vectors of the invention, the first vector encoding a heavy chain derived polypeptide and the second vector encoding a light chain derived polypeptide. The two vectors can contain identical selectable markers that enable equal expression of heavy and light chain polypeptides. Alternatively, a single vector can be used to encode both heavy and light chain polypeptides. In such situations, the light chain should be placed before the heavy chain to avoid an excess of toxic free heavy chain (Proudfoot, 1986322:52; Kohler, 198077:2197). The coding sequences for the heavy and light chains can comprise cDNA or genomic DNA.","Once the antibody has been recombinantly expressed, it can be purified using any method known in the art for purification of an antibody, for example, by chromatography (e.g., ion exchange, affinity, particularly by affinity for the specific antigen after Protein A, and sizing column chromatography), centrifugation, differential solubility, or by any other standard technique for the purification of proteins.","In any case, the hybrid antibodies have a dual specificity, preferably with one or more binding sites specific for the hapten of choice or one or more binding sites specific for a target antigen, for example, an antigen associated with a tumor, an autoimmune disease, an infectious organism, or other disease state.","The peptide derivative, Cbz-valine-citrulline-p-aminobenzyl alcohol (1, Cbz-val-cit-PAB-OH) has previously been used for the preparation of Cbz-val-cit-PAB-doxorubicin carbamate, a compound that released active doxorubicin upon treatment with cathepsin B (Dubowchik, G.

HPLC analysis indicated that the naphthol ether 2 was a substrate for bovine spleen cathepsin B, and that the products formed were naphthol and Cbz-val-cit-COOH. The reaction proceeded rapidly (350 nmol\/min\/mg cathepsin B), but in the absence of added enzyme there was no breakdown of the starting material after 1 week at 37\u00b0 C. at pH 5.1, 7.2, and in pooled human serum (Table I). The present invention provides the first indication that p-aminobenzyl ethers are capable of undergoing 1,6-elimination reactions.","Similar studies undertaken with the N-acetylnorephedrine ether 5 demonstrated that the compound was hydrolyzed by cathepsin B, leading to the release of Cbz-val-cit-COOH as expected. However, no N-acetylnorephedrine was detected, suggesting that the p-aminobenzyl ether formed after peptide bond cleavage did not undergo further fragmentation. Thus, the nature of the leaving group attached to the p-aminobenzyl group affects the 1,6-elimination reaction. It is speculated, however, that a more electron negative substituent at the \u03b1 position of the hydroxyl group may facilitate the fragmentation. For example, if \u2014NHAc is replaced by \u2014F, the inductive effect of the strongly electron negative group F is capable of stabilizing the intermediate conjugate base resulted from the fragmentation.","On the basis of these results, the anticancer drugs etoposide (VIIIa) and combretastatin A-4 (VIIIb) were linked to 1 using the coupling conditions shown in Scheme 4.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0188","num":"0187"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00028","num":"00028"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00028","he":"67.73mm","wi":"157.23mm","file":"US07553816-20090630-C00028.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Etoposide is a clinically approved topoisomerase inhibitor that has demonstrated utility in chemotherapeutic combinations for the treatment of leukemia, lymphoma, germ cell tumors, small cell lung tumors and several other carcinomas (Hande, K.

Combretastatin A-4 is a promising antiangiogenic agent that inhibits the polymerization of tubulin (Horsman, M. R.; Murata, R.; Breidahl T.; Nielson, F. U.; Maxwell, R.

It is noteworthy that there were no significant kinetic differences in cathepsin B mediated hydrolyses of the peptide-carbonate and peptide-ether derivatives. Thus, peptide derivatives of p-aminobenzyl aromatic ethers are stable in neutral or slightly acidic buffers, and undergo facile ether fragmentation upon treatment with an enzyme that cleaves the amide bond.","In vitro cytotoxicity were performed on cancer cell lines to determine if the peptide derivatives acted as prodrugs. The cell lines (L2987 human lung adenocarcinoma, WM266\/4 and IGR-39 human melanomas) were exposed to the agents for 24 h, washed, and viability was determined two days later by measuring the incorporation of H-thymidine compared to the untreated controls. There were significant differences in the cytotoxic activity etoposide (VIIIa) and the corresponding peptide ether derivative (6) on all three cell lines (). Etoposide (VIIIa) was 15-22 times more active than 6, a result consistent with the loss in cytotoxic activity that has been reported with another phenol derivatives of etoposide (Senter, P.

Significantly, the combretastatin A-4 carbonate derivative 11 was as cytotoxic as combretastatin A-4 (VIIIb), reflecting the inherent instability of carbonate compared to the ether linkages (Table I).

The Compounds of the Invention can be used accordingly in a variety of settings for the treatment of animal cancers. The drug conjugates can be used to deliver a drug to a tumor cell or cancer cell. Without being bound by theory, in one embodiment, the ligand of a Compound of the Invention binds to or associates with a cancer-cell or a tumor-cell-associated antigen, and the Compound of the Invention can be taken up inside a tumor cell or cancer cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis. The antigen can be attached to a tumor cell or cancer cell or can be an extracellular matrix protein associated with the tumor cell or cancer cell. Once inside the cell, one or more specific peptide sequences within the linker are hydrolytically cleaved by one or more tumor-cell or cancer-cell-associated proteases, resulting in release of a drug. The released drug is then free to migrate in the cytosol and induce cytotoxic activities. In an alternative embodiment, the drug is cleaved from the Compound of the Invention outside the tumor cell or cancer cell, and the drug subsequently penetrates the cell.","In one embodiment, the ligand binds to the tumor cell or cancer cell.","In another embodiment, the ligand binds to a tumor cell or cancer cell antigen which is on the surface of the tumor cell or cancer cell.","In another embodiment, the ligand binds to a tumor cell or cancer cell antigen which is an extracellular matrix protein associated with the tumor cell or cancer cell.","In one embodiment, the tumor cell or cancer cell is of the type of tumor or cancer that the animal needs treatment or prevention of.","The specificity of the ligand for a particular tumor cell or cancer cell can be important for determining those tumors or cancers that are most effectively treated.

S.; Frankfater, A. Specific Spectrophotometric Assays for Cathepsin B. 1975, 68, 119-127). A 1.0 mM stock solution of the peptide substrate in DMSO was added to acetate buffer (25 mM) containing 1 mM EDTA (pH 5.1) to give a final concentration of 0.08-0.14 mM, and to this was added the activated enzyme (12-15 \u03bcg\/mL). In the case of the naphthol ether 2, a 5.0 mM solution in MeOH was diluted to a final concentration of 0.22 mM. Periodically, aliquots were taken, quenched with an equal volume of MeCN, centrifuged, and 100 \u03bcL injections analyzed by HPLC (4.6 mm\u00d715 cm Ccolumn) with detection between 210 and 400 nm. The mobile phase consisted of (A) 5 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7) and (B) either MeOH (for compounds 2, 7, and 11) or MeCN (for compounds 5, 6, and 10). The gradient elution was 90% to 10% A over 10 min, followed by 5 min at 10% A, and the flow rate was 1.0 mL\/min. The disappearance of substrate and the appearances of released alcohol and Cbz-val-cit were recorded. Cathepsin B hydrolysis rates were calculated according to the disappearance of substrate (Table 7).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0268","num":"0267"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00007","num":"00007"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"147pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 7"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},{},"Specific"]},{"entry":["Com-","Stability","activity of"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["pound","pH 5.1","pH 7.2","Human serum","cathepsin B"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["2","0% loss, 7 days","0% loss, 7 days","0% loss, 7 days","350 nmol\/"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"min\/mg"]},{"entry":["5","0% loss 7 d","0% loss 7 d","0% loss 7 d","145 nmol\/"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"min\/mg"]},{"entry":["6","0% loss, 7 days","0% loss, 7 days","t\u00bd 48 hours","160 nmol\/"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"min\/mg"]},{"entry":["7","0% loss, 7 days","0% loss, 7 days","0% loss, 7 days","61 nmol\/"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"min\/mg"]},{"entry":["10\u2002","t\u00bd 104 hours","t\u00bd 79 hours","t\u00bd 9 days","150 nmol\/"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"min\/mg"]},{"entry":["11\u2002","t\u00bd 62 hours","t\u00bd 55 hours","t\u00bd 45 hours","32 nmol\/"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"min\/mg"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"left","id":"FOO-00001"},"sup":"a"}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"left","id":"FOO-00002"},"sup":"b"}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"left","id":"FOO-00003"},"sup":"c"}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"left","id":"FOO-00004"},"sup":"d"}}]}}]}},"br":{}},"Solutions of the substrates (0.08-0.14 mM in DMSO, and 0.22 mM in MeOH for 2) were diluted 10-20-fold in PBS, acetate buffer (25 mM, pH 5.1), or pooled human serum, and incubation was carried out at 37\u00b0 C.
