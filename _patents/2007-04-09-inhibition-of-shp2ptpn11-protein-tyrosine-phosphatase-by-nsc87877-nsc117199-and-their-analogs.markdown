title: Inhibition of Shp2/PTPN11 protein tyrosine phosphatase by NSC-87877, NSC-117199 and their analogs
abstract: Compounds and associated methods for inhibiting a protein tyrosine phosphatase. By a combination of experimental and virtual screenings of the NCI Diversity Set chemical library, NSC-87877 and NSC-117199 have been identified as Shp2 PTP inhibitors. Significantly, NSC-87877 is active in cell-based assays and has no detectable off-target effects in the EGF-stimulated Erk 1/2 activation pathway. Additionally, a number of analogs of NSC-117199 have been produced. These analogs exhibit enhanced protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibition and are found to be potent and/or selective inhibitors of Shp1 and/or Shp2 protein tyrosine phosphatases.

entitled, \u201cShp2 Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Inhibitor\u201d, filed Apr. 7, 2006, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.","This invention was made with Government support under Grant No. CA077467 awarded by the National Cancer Institute. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","This invention relates to cancer therapy. More specifically, this invention relates to compounds useful in inhibiting Shp2\/PTPN11 protein tyrosine phosphatase activity.","Shp2, encoded by the PTPN11 gene, is a non-receptor PTP with two Src homology-2 (SH2) domains (N-SH2, C-SH2) (Alonso et al., 2004; Neel et al., 2003). Molecular biology and genetic studies has shown that Shp2 mediates cell signaling by growth factors and cytokines, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), hepatocyte growth factor, and interleukin-6. In particular, Shp2 is involved in activation of Erk1\/2 MAP kinase by EGF (Deb et al., 1998).","Shp2 is basally inactive due to auto-inhibition by its N-SH2 domain (Hof et al., 1998). In growth factor- and cytokine-stimulated cells, Shp2 binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated docking proteins through its SH2 domains, resulting in its activation (Cunnick et al., 2001). It has been shown that Shp2 binds to Gab1 (or Gab2) in cells stimulated with EGF, HGF, or interleukin-6 (Cunnick et al., 2001; Gu and Neel, 2003; Maroun et al., 2000; Nishida and Hirano, 2003). Gab1-Shp2 interaction as well as Shp2 PTP activity are necessary for Erk1\/2 activation by these growth factors (Cunnick et al., 2002; Neel et al., 2003). While the mechanism by which growth factors activate Shp2 has been elucidated, those by which Shp2 produces downstream signals to activate Ras-Erk1\/2 MAP kinase pathway and possibly other pathways are less clear and may be growth factor- and cell context-dependent (Mohi et al., 2005).","Besides its role in growth factor and cytokine signaling, Shp2 has been implicated in pathogenicity of . Cytotoxin-associated antigen A (CagA)-positive strains of are strongly associated with gastritis and gastric cancer. After injected into host cells, CagA is retained on the plasma membrane and recruits Shp2 to induce transformation of gastric epithelial cells (Hatakeyama, 2004).","Remarkably, PTPN11 mutations have been found in Noonan syndrome, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), and several types of human malignancies (Bentires-Alj et al., 2004; Tartaglia and Gelb, 2005). Noonan syndrome is a developmental disorder characterized by facial anomalies, short stature, heart disease, skeletal defects, and hematological disorders (Tartaglia and Gelb, 2005). Germline PTPN11 mutations are responsible for causing 50% of cases of Noonan syndrome. Some children with Noonan syndrome also develop JMML (Tartaglia et al., 2003). JMML is a progressive myelodysplastic\/myeloproliferative disorder characterized by overproduction of tissue-infiltrating myeloid cells. Approximately 50% of cases of JMML have activating Ras mutations or homozygotic inactivation of the NF1 gene that encodes a Ras-GTPase activating protein, neurofibromin. Somatic mutations in PTPN11 account for about 35% of JMML patients who do not have Ras or neurofibromin mutations (Kratz et al., 2005). It was reported recently that JMML-associated Shp2 mutants could transform murine bone marrow and fetal liver cells (Chan et al., 2005; Mohi et al., 2005; Schubbert et al., 2005) and caused fatal JMML-like disorder in Balb\/c mice (Mohi et al., 2005). While molecular etiologies of Noonan syndrome and JMML are becoming clear, several mechanistic issues regarding how Shp2 mutants cause Noonan syndrome and JMML remain unanswered. Importantly, all Shp2 mutants found in Noonan syndrome and JMML are gain-of-function mutations, mostly resulting from weaker autoinhibition of the N-SH2 domain (Fragale et al., 2004; Keilhack et al., 2005).","In short, accumulated molecular biology and genetic evidence has suggested that Shp2 is an important signaling component of growth factors, cytokines, and oncogenic bacteria. Gain-of-function Shp2 mutations are linked to childhood developmental disorder and juvenile leukemias. Therefore, Shp2 PTP is an important target for controlling growth factor receptor signaling and a potential target for development of novel therapies for Noonan syndrome, JMML, and possibly other Shp2-associated cancers.","PTP inhibitor development is an emerging area in the field of drug development (Bialy and Waldmann, 2005). Most efforts of PTP inhibitor discovery and design have so far been focused on PTP1B and Cdc25 inhibitors (Lazo et al., 2002; Zhang, 2002). No systematic effort to identify Shp2-selective PTP inhibitors has been reported. While PTP1B inhibitors that cross-inhibit Shp2 have been found (Huang et al., 2003; Shen et al., 2001), none of them has demonstrated in vivo activity in cell cultures.","The present invention provides compounds and associated methods for inhibiting a protein tyrosine phosphatase. By a combination of experimental and virtual screenings of the NCI Diversity Set chemical library, NSC-87877 and NSC-117199 have been identified as Shp2 PTP inhibitors. Significantly, NSC-87877 is active in cell-based assays and has no detectable off-target effects in the EGF-stimulated Erk1\/2 activation pathway. Additionally, a number of analogs of NSC-117199 have been produced.

It is involved in growth factor-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases Erk1 and Erk2 (Erk1\/2) and has been implicated in the pathogenicity of the oncogenic bacterium (). Moreover, gain-of-function Shp2 mutations have been found in childhood leukemias and Noonan syndrome. Thus, small molecule Shp2 PTP inhibitors are much needed reagents for evaluation of Shp2 as a therapeutic target and for chemical biology studies of Shp2 function. By screening the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Diversity Set chemical library, NSC-87877 was identified as a potent Shp2 PTP inhibitor. Site-directed mutagenesis and molecular modeling studies suggested that NSC-87877 binds to the catalytic cleft of Shp2 PTP. NSC-87877 cross-inhibited Shp1 in vitro, but it was selective for Shp2 over other PTPs (PTP1B, HePTP, DEP1, CD45, and LAR). Importantly, NSC-87877 inhibited EGF-induced activation of Shp2 PTP, Ras, and Erk1\/2 in cell cultures but did not block EGF-induced Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation or Gab1-Shp2 association. Furthermore, NSC-87877 inhibited Erk1\/2 activation by a Gab1-Shp2 chimera but did not affect the Shp2-independent Erk1\/2 activation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). These results identified NSC-87877 as the first PTP inhibitor capable of inhibiting Shp2 PTP in cell cultures without a detectable off-target effect. This provides the first pharmacological evidence that Shp2 mediates EGF-induced Erk1\/2 MAP kinase activation.","Definitions","The term \u201cadministration\u201d and variants thereof (e.g., \u201cadministering\u201d a compound) in reference to a compound of the invention means introducing the compound or a prodrug of the compound into the system of the animal in need of treatment.

Confirmed hits (>50% inhibition at 10 \u03bcM) that were either 1) organometallic agents, 2) arsenic compounds, 3) previously identified PTP inhibitors (NSC-668394, NSC-5069) (Lazo et al., 2002), 4) potential carcinogens, 5) with lower ICfor Shp1 than that for Shp2 in the initial analyses, 6) a non-specific protein binding agent, or 7) polymers were excluded from further analysis. Authentic compounds of the remaining seven hits were either obtained from independent sources or synthesized in house and then compared to the samples from the NCI Diversity Set library for inhibition of GST-Shp2. Only one of these compounds, NSC-87877 (), showed a similar or greater potency than the sample of the same chemical identification obtained from NCI.","The PTP inhibitory activity of NSC-87877 was then assessed against several human PTPs in vitro. As shown in Table I, NSC-87877 potently inhibited Shp2 with an ICof 0.318\u00b10.049 (\u03bcM). NSC-87877 appeared to have no selectivity between human Shp2 and Shp1 in vitro. NSC-87877 showed approximately 5-, 24-, 206-, 266-, and 475-fold selectivity for Shp2 over PTP1B, HePTP, DEP1, CD45, and LAR (Table I).","NSC-87877 ranked among top 10% (175) of the compounds with the best GLIDE scores for the docking to the human Shp2 PTP domain in our virtual screening of 2368 3D structures derived from the NCI Diversity Set. Computer docking of NSC-87877 () suggested that the B-ring sulfonic acid group forms hydrogen bond with the backbone NH group of Arg-465. Arg-465 is a conserved residue in the PTP signature motif (motif 9) VHCSXGXGR[T\/S]G located at the base of the PTP catalytic cleft (Andersen et al., 2001). The A-ring sulfonic acid forms hydrogen bonds with the side-chain NHgroup of Lys-280 and the side-chain NHgroup of Asn-281. Lys-280\/Asn-281 are non-conserved PTP residues located adjacent to the phosphotyrosine recognition loop (motif 1) (Andersen et al., 2001). The interaction between aromatic rings of the compound and the protein contributes to the binding through hydrophobic stabilization.","NSC-117199 was docked to the catalytic site of Shp2 in the same way (See ). The docked structure, along with the analog HL2-052-2 (see Table II) is shown in .

One (Shp2V280) mutant contained a Lys-280 to Val-280 mutation and the other (Shp2RD) mutant contained dual Lys-280\/Asn-281 to Arg-280\/Asp-281 mutations. In silico prediction gave both Shp2V280 and Shp2RD mutants a 0.6 kcal\/mole increase (destabilization) in the GLIDE docking score. Sensitivity of mutated and wild-type Shp2 to NSC-87877 inhibition was then compared experimentally by the PTP assay. As shown in Table I, Shp2V280 and Shp2RD were approximately 3-fold less sensitive to NSC-87877 inhibition (p=0.0015 for comparison of ICbetween Shp2 and Shp2V280; p=0.0062 for comparison of ICbetween Shp2 and Shp2RD). These data suggest that Lys-280 and\/or Asn-281 are involved in NSC-87877 binding to Shp2.","To determine if NSC-87877 is able to inhibit Shp2 in the cells, serum-starved HEK293 cells were pre-incubated with or without NSC-87877 and then stimulated with EGF or mock-treated. Shp2 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and Shp2 PTP activity was then determined in the immune complexes using DiFMUP as the substrate. Shp2 PTP activity increased 2.6-fold in response to EGF stimulation in the absence of NSC-87877 pretreatment (). Incubation of NSC-87877 alone reduced the basal Shp2 PTP activity by 45%. The EGF-stimulated Shp2 activation was inhibited by 97% when cells were pretreated with 50 \u03bcM NSC-87877 ().","Molecular biology studies using overexpression of a PTP-inactive Shp2 mutant have suggested that Shp2 is involved in EGF-induced Erk1\/2 activation (Deb et al., 1998). To evaluate if NSC-87877 could inhibit Shp2-dependent cell signaling in the cells, we examined the effect of NSC-87877 on EGF-stimulated Erk1\/2 activation. Serum-starved HEK293 cells were pretreated with 0-50 \u03bcM NSC-87877 for 3 h and then stimulated with EGF for 5 min. Erk1\/2 activation was determined by immunoblotting analysis of cell lysates with an anti-phospho-Erk1\/2 antibody. As shown in , NSC-87877 inhibited EGF-stimulated Erk1\/2 activation in a concentration dependent manner. A 50% inhibition of EGF-stimulated Erk1\/2 activation was observed at an average of 6 \u03bcM NSC-87877 in two independent experiments.","It has been observed that expression of a chimeric protein (Gab1PH-Shp2\u0394N) consisting of the Gab1 PH domain and a constitutively active Shp2 N-SH2 domain deletion mutant resulted in Erk1\/2 activation and that the Shp2 PTP activity is necessary for Erk1\/2 activation by Gab1PH-Shp2\u0394N (Cunnick et al., 2002). To examine if NSC-87877 could inhibit Shp2-dependent Erk1\/2 activation that bypasses the ligand-receptor interaction, HEK293-derived cell lines (dox-G1S2) containing dox-inducible Gab1PH-Shp2\u0394N were established using the Flp-In-T-Rex-293 cells.  (top panel) shows a representative dox-G1S2 cell line that demonstrated the property of dox-inducible expression of Flag-tagged Gab1PH-Shp2\u0394N. In the absence of dox, there was little, residual level of Gab1PH-Shp2\u0394N in the cells and the level of active Erk1\/2 was minimal. Induction of cells with dox induced Gab1PH-Shp2 AN expression and Erk1\/2 activation (). However, in NSC-87877 treated cells, Erk1\/2 activation by Gab1PH-Shp2\u0394N was inhibited. Coupled with data from , this result suggests that the mechanism by which NSC-87877 inhibits EGF-induced Erk1\/2 activation is not mediated by events upstream of Shp2 such as activation of EGF receptor. Furthermore, since there was no extracellular stimulation involved in the Erk1\/2 activation by Gab1PH-Shp2\u0394N, the observation that NSC-87877 could inhibit Gab1PH-Shp2\u0394N-induced Erk1\/2 activation indicates that the target of NSC-87877 is intracellular.","Previous studies have shown that PMA-induced Erk1\/2 activation is not affected by overexpression of a PTP-inactive Shp2 mutant (Yamauchi et al., 1995), suggesting that the protein kinase C (PKC) activator-mediated Erk1\/2 activation is Shp2-independent. We, therefore, compared the effect of NSC-87877 on EGF- and PMA-stimulated Erk1\/2 activation. Consistent with data presented in , EGF-stimulated Erk1\/2 activation was inhibited by NSC-87877 (). In contrast, NSC-87877 did not affect PMA-induced Erk1\/2 activation (). PKC is known to activate the Erk1\/2 MAP kinase cascade by directly phosphorylating Raf-1 (Carroll and May, 1994; Kolch et al., 1993). Thus, our data that NSC-87877 inhibited EGF-induced, but not PMA-induced, Erk1\/2 activation, suggest that the target of NSC-87877 is upstream of Raf-1, consistent with the notion that NSC-87877 is acting on Shp2 to inhibit Erk1\/2 activation.","Shp2 is activated in EGF-stimulated cells by binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated Gab1 (and Gab2 if it is also expressed) (Cunnick et al., 2001). To further assess if NSC-87877 has an off-target effect upstream of Shp2 activation in the EGF-stimulated cells, we analyzed EGF-induced Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation and Gab1-Shp2 association in HEK293 cells treated with NSC-87877 and\/or EGF. HEK293 cells express Gab1 but not Gab2.  shows that Gab1 was not tyrosine-phosphorylated and Shp2 was not detected in Gab1 immunoprecipitates in the absence of EGF stimulation. Gab1 became tyrosine-phosphorylated and Shp2 was co-immunoprecipitated with Gab1 upon stimulation of cells with EGF.  also shows that NSC-87877 did not inhibit EGF-stimulated Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent binding of Shp2 to Gab1. Immunoblotting analysis of cell lysate supernatants used for immunoprecipitation of Gab1 indicated that an equal amount of Shp2 was present in each sample (, bottom panel). These results indicate that NSC-87877 does not affect EGF-activated signaling steps prior to Shp2 activation.","HEK293 cells express Shp2 but not Shp1. Since NSC-87877 inhibits Shp2 and Shp1 with the similar ICin vitro, we next tested the inhibitory effect of NSC-87877 on EGF signaling in MDA-MB-468 cells that express both Shp2 and Shp1. Near confluent MDA-MB-468 cells were serum-starved, pretreated with NSC-87877 or solvent, and then stimulated with EGF. Shp2 and Shp1 were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and their PTP activities were determined by the immune complex PTP assay. Similar to that observed in HE 293 cells, EGF induced Shp2 activation in MDA-MB-468 cells and NSC-87877 inhibited the EGF-induced Shp2 PTP activity in these cells (). Shp1 immunoprecipitated from serum-starved MDA-MB-468 cells had a similar low basal PTP activity as that of Shp2. Interestingly, EGF did not induce Shp1 activation in repeated experiments ().","Paxillin is a physiological substrate of Shp2 (Ren et al., 2004). As shown in , EGF-induced paxillin dephosphorylation in MDA-MB-468 cells, which was inhibited by NSC-87877. Thus, inhibition of Shp2 PTP activity by NSC-87877 in MDA-MB-468 cells blocked dephosphorylation of its protein substrate in these cells, demonstrating a direct functional consequence of Shp2 inhibition. Shp2 functions upstream of Ras in the Ras-Erk1\/2 MAP kinase pathway (Neel et al., 2003). To determine if NSC-87877 could inhibit Ras activation, EGF-induced Ras activation in MDA-MB-468 cells was analyzed by the GST-RBD pulldown assay. As shown in , more active Ras was pulled down by GST-RBD in EGF-stimulated cells than that in serum-starved cells, indicating that Ras was activated in EGF-stimulated cells. However, if cells were pretreated with NSC-87877, EGF-induced Ras activation was blocked (). Consistently, EGF-induced Erk1\/2 activation was inhibited by NSC-87877 in MDA-MB-468 cells (). Thus, NSC-87877 can inhibit EGF-stimulated Erk1\/2 activation in MDA-MB-468 cells that co-express Shp2 and Shp1.","While molecular biology and genetic evidence has suggested that Shp2 plays important roles in growth factor and cytokine signaling and that Shp2 mutations are linked to human diseases, chemical biology interrogation of Shp2 function and signaling mechanisms had not been possible due to the lack of a suitable Shp2 inhibitor. NSC-87877 has been identified herein as a potent Shp2 inhibitor and has been demonstrated to inhibit Shp2 PTP activity and Shp2-mediated Erk1\/2 activation in intact cell models. This represents the first successful effort of identification of a Shp2 PTP inhibitor that is effective in inhibiting Shp2-dependent Erk1\/2 activation in the cells. The present invention also provides the first pharmacological evidence that Shp2 PTP is involved in growth factor-stimulated Erk1\/2 activation. This important discovery opens a new avenue in Shp2 research by providing a novel tool for chemical biology exploration of Shp2 function and signaling mechanisms.","The in vitro PTP assays show that NSC-87877 inhibits Shp2 selectively over PTP1B, HePTP, DEP1, CD45, and LAR, but it inhibits Shp2 and Shp1 with a similar potency. Development of a Shp2-specific inhibitor that does not cross-inhibit Shp1 is a future aim. Nevertheless, the present invention illustrates that a Shp2 PTP inhibitor without selectivity between Shp2 and Shp1 could still be a useful reagent for targeting Shp2 over other PTP inhibitors due in part to the differential expression of Shp1 and Shp2. Unlike Shp2, which is ubiquitously expressed, Shp1 expression is limited to hematopoietic cells and certain epithelial cells. Furthermore, Shp1 is epigenetically silenced in some leukemias and lymphomas (Oka et al., 2002). Shp1 PTP inhibition activity becomes irrelevant in cells that do not express Shp1 or contain a minimal amount of Shp1. While Shp1 negatively regulates cytokine and immune receptor signaling in hematopoietic cells, the role of Shp1 in epithelial cells is less clear. Expression of exogenous wildtype or PTP-inactive Shp1 in HEK293 cells was found to have little effect on the Erk1\/2-dependent Elk-1 activation by EGF (Bennett et al., 1996). Interestingly, the present data show that EGF activates Shp2 but not Shp1 in the MDA-MB-468 human breast carcinoma cells. Thus, even in certain cells where Shp1 is present, it may not play a significant role in a particular signaling pathway. Under this condition, a Shp2 inhibitor without selectivity between Shp1 and Shp2 can be used to analyze or control Shp2 function.","NSC-87877 contains two arylsulfonic acid groups, one as naphthylsulfonic acid and the other as quinolinesulfonic acid. The arylsulfonic acid moiety has been identified as a pharmacophore of PTP inhibitors (Huang et al., 2003; McCain et al., 2004). In fact, suramin, a hexasulfonated polyaromatic naphthylurea, and several polysulfonic derivatives of suramin that contain multiple naphthylsulfonic acid groups or phenylsulfonic acid groups, are PTP inhibitors in vitro (McCain et al., 2004). Although negatively charged arylsulfonic acids were thought to be unfavorable for cellular uptake, compounds containing multiple arylsulfonyl acid groups capable of entering cells are not without precedent. For instance, suramin, which has six arylsulfonic acid groups, can enter cells through an active process (Stein, 1993). Whereas the means by which NSC-87877 enters cells requires further investigation, it is possible that it may not occur by passive diffusion but rather through an active process. Consistent with this notion, we noticed that it was necessary to incubate cells with NSC-87877 for 2-3 h in order to observe the inhibitory effects of NSC-87877 in the cells, suggesting that NSC-87877 cannot rapidly diffuse into cells.","Because of the similarity between Shp1 and Shp2, development of a Shp2-specific inhibitor will be challenging but not impossible. Selectivity between Shp1 and Shp2 (either towards Shp1 or towards Shp2) was observed among several hits from the NCI Diversity Set chemical library (our unpublished data). Shp1 and Shp2 catalytic domains are known to have different substrate specificity (O'Reilly and Neel, 1998), suggesting that the catalytic cleft is not identical between Shp1 and Shp2. Furthermore, the surface electrostatic potential of the catalytic cleft is much more positive in human Shp2 than in human Shp1 (Yang et al., 1998). The PTP catalytic cleft consists of a base and four sides in the 3D structures (Hof et al., 1998; Yang et al., 2003). Although amino acid residues present at the base of Shp1 and Shp2 PTP catalytic clefts are identical, all four sides of the catalytic cleft contains one or more residues that are different between Shp1 and Shp2. These differences will provide the basis for developing an Shp2-specific PTP inhibitor in our continuing effort.","Materials and Methods","Chemical Library: The NCI Diversity Set chemical library of 1981 compounds was provided by the NCI Developmental Therapeutics Program. Information about the Diversity Set is available at http:\/\/www.dtp.nci.nih.gov\/branches\/dscb\/diversity_exylanation.html. After the initial identification of NSC-87877 from the NCI Diversity Set, the authentic, 98% pure NSC-87877 [8-hydroxy-7-(6-sulfonaphthalen-2-yl)diazenyl-quinoline-5-sulfonic acid] was obtained from Acros for subsequent experiments.","Recombinant PTP Proteins: Plasmids for expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-PTP fusion proteins of human Shp2 (residues 205-593), Shp1 (residues 205-597), and PTP1B (residues 1-435) were constructed in pGEX-2T by PCR subcloning techniques. A plasmid for GST fusion protein of human HePTP (residues 1-399) was constructed in pGEX-2T-KG. GST-Shp2 PTP containing Lys-280 to Val (V280) and Lys-280\/Asn-281 to Arg\/Asp (R280D281) mutants were generated by PCR-based mutagenesis. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing.","GST-PTP fusion proteins were expressed in DH5\u03b1 and affinity purified with glutathione Sepharose. After elution from glutathione affinity column, GST-fusion proteins were dialyzed with dialysis buffer (12.5 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 25 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and 0.1% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol) at 4\u00b0 C. for 40 h and then stored in dialysis buffer plus 20% glycerol at \u221280\u00b0 C. Recombinant CD45 (residues 584-1281) and LAR D1 domain were obtained from Calbiochem. Recombinant DEP1 was from Abcam. GST fusion proteins of murine Shp2 (GST-Shp2\u0394N) and Shp1 have been reported (Cunnick et al., 1998; Cunnick et al., 2001) and were used in the chemical library screening and initial in vitro characterization.","PTP Activity Assay: PTP activity was measured using the fluorogenic 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (DiFMUP, from Invitrogen) as the substrate. Unless otherwise specified, each reaction contained 25 mM MOPS (pH 7.0), 50 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20, 1 mM DTT, 20 \u03bcM DiFMUP, 10 nM Microcystin LR, 20 nM GST-PTP, and 5 \u03bcl test compound or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, solvent) in a total reaction volume of 100 \u03bcl in black 96-well plates. Reaction was initiated by addition of DiFMUP and the incubation time was 30 min at room temperature. DiFMU fluorescence signal was measured at an excitation of 355 nm and an emission of 460 nm with a Wallac Victor1420 plate reader. ICwas defined as the concentration of an inhibitor that caused a 50% decrease in the PTP activity. For ICdetermination, 8 concentrations of NSC-87877 at \u2153 dilution (\u02dc0.5 log) were tested. The ranges of NSC-87877 concentrations used in each PTP assay were determined from preliminary trials. Each experiment was performed in triplicate and ICdata were derived from at least three independent experiments. The curve-fitting program Prism 4 (GraphPad Software) was used to calculate the ICvalue.","Computer Docking: Computer docking was performed using the X-ray crystal structure of human Shp2 (PDB identification code: 2SHP) (Hof et al., 1998) using the GLIDE (Grid-Based Ligand Docking from Energetics, as part of the FirstDiscovery Suite from Schr\u00f6dinger, L.L.C.) program (Friesner et al., 2004; Halgren et al., 2004). The N-SH2 domain of Shp2, which blocks the catalytic site, was removed from the 3D structure prior to the computer docking analysis. The GLIDE program relies on the Jorgensen OPLS-2001 force field. The optimal binding geometry for each model was obtained by utilization of Monte Carlo sampling techniques coupled with energy minimization.","Preparation of HEK293 Cell Line for Doxycycline-inducible Expression of a Gab1-Shp2 Chimera: Plasmid pcDNA5\/FRT\/TO-Gab1PH-Shp2\u0394N was constructed by subcloning the coding sequence for Flag-Gab1PH-Shp2\u0394N (Cunnick et al., 2002) from pcDNA3.1 into pcDNA5\/FRT\/TO (Invitrogen) through HindIII and ApaI sites. pcDNA5\/FRT\/TO-Gab1PH-Shp2\u0394N and pOG44 was then co-transfected into the Flp-In-T-Rex-293 cells (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were selected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM)\/10% tetracycline-free fetal bovine serum (FBS) medium containing 100 \u03bcg\/ml hygromycin. Individual Hygromycin-resistant cell lines were screened for dox-inducible expression of Flag-tagged Gab1PH-Shp2\u0394N by immunoblotting analysis of cell lysates with an anti-Flag antibody (M2, from Sigma). Among 24 hygromycin-resistant cell lines that we have screened, 21 cell lines showed dox-inducible expression of Gab1PH-Shp2\u0394N. One of these 21 cell lines was randomly selected for use in the subsequent experiments.","Cell Culture, Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting: Cells were cultured in DMEM\/10% FBS. Sub-confluent cells were serum-starved in DMEM\/0.1% BSA for 18 h prior to treatment with NSC-87877 and stimulation with EGF or PMA. Cells were lysed on ice with Lysis Buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 25 mM NaF, 5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM DTT, 20 mM p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1% Triton X-100). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting analyses of Gab1, Shp2 , paxillin, and Erk1\/2 were performed essentially as described (Cunnick et al., 2001; Ren et al., 2004). Erk1\/2 kinase assay was performed as reported except that endogenous Erk1\/2 kinase activity was measured (Cunnick et al., 2001).","Immune Complex PTP Assay: Serum-starved cells were pretreated with NSC-87877 (50 \u03bcM, 3 h) or DMSO (solvent) and then stimulated with EGF (100 ng\/ml, 5 min) or left untreated. Cells were lysed in ice-cold PTP Lysis Buffer [25 mM Hepes pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1:50 diluted protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)]. Shp2 or Shp1 in cell lysate supernatants (0.5 mg\/each) was immunoprecipitated with an antibody to Shp2 or an antibody to Shp1 (Santa Cruz) plus Protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 C. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with the PTP lysis buffer and twice with Reaction Buffer (20 mM Hepes pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 5% Glycerol, 1 mM DTT) (Tartaglia et al., 2003). Each Shp2 or Shp1 immune complex was resuspended in 100 \u03bcl Reaction Buffer containing 50 \u03bcM DiFMUP and then incubated at room temperature for 20 min. After a brief centrifugation, supernatants were transferred into 96-well plates and the DiFMU fluorescence signal was measured. The remaining immune complexes were used for immunoblotting analysis of Shp2 or Shp1.","Ras Activation Assay: Active Ras in MDA-MB-468 cells was detected by means of Ras-GTP bound to a GST fusion protein of the Ras-GTP binding domain of Raf fragment (GST-RBD) (Cunnick et al., 2002) followed by immunoblotting with an anti-Ras antibody (Santa Cruz).","Statistical Analysis: Statistical analyses were performed using unpaired t test with Welch's correction using the GraphPad Prism 4 program (GraphPad Software).","Development of Additional Inhibitors of Shp2 protein tyrosine kinase.","The following is a series of compounds that were synthesized based upon the NSC87877 and NSC 117199.
