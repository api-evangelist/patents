{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE DESCRIPTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority benefit of the following five U.S. provisional patent applications, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.\n\n","This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 13\/052,511, entitled LIGHT-BASED TOUCH SCREEN WITH SHIFT-ALIGNED EMITTER AND RECEIVER LENSES, filed on Mar. 21, 2011 by inventors Magnus Goertz, Thomas Eriksson, Joseph Shain, Anders Jansson, Niklas Kvist, Robert Pettersson, Lars Sparf and John Karlsson.","This application is a continuation-in-part of the following five U.S. patent applications, the disclosures of which are also hereby incorporated herein by reference.\n\n","The field of the present invention is light-based touch screens.","Many consumer electronic devices are now being built with touch sensitive screens, for use with finger or stylus touch user inputs. These devices range from small screen devices such as mobile phones and car entertainment systems, to mid-size screen devices such as notebook computers, to large screen devices such as check-in stations at airports.","Most conventional touch screen systems are based on resistive or capacitive layers. Such systems are not versatile enough to offer an all-encompassing solution, as they are not easily scalable.","Reference is made to , which is a prior art illustration of a conventional touch screen system. Such systems include an LCD display surface , a resistive or capacitive overlay  that is placed over the LCD surface, and a controller integrated circuit (IC)  that connects to the overlay and converts inputs from the overlay to meaningful signals. A host device (not shown), such as a computer, receives the signals from controller IC , and a device driver or such other program interprets the signals to detect a touch-based input such as a key press or scroll movement.","Reference is made to , which is a prior art illustration of a conventional resistive touch screen. Shown in  are conductive and resistive layers  separated by thin spaces. A PET film  overlays a top circuit layer , which overlays a conductive coating . Similarly, a conductive coating  with spacer dots  overlays a bottom circuit layer , which overlays a glass layer . When a pointer , such as a finger or a stylus, touches the screen, a contact is created between resistive layers, closing a switch. A controller  determines the current between layers to derive the position of the touch point.","Advantages of resistive touch screens are their low cost, low power consumption and stylus support.","A disadvantage of resistive touch screens is that as a result of the overlay, the screens are not fully transparent. Another disadvantage is that pressure is required for touch detection; i.e., a pointer that touches the screen without sufficient pressure goes undetected. As a consequence, resistive touch screens do not detect finger touches well. Another disadvantage is that resistive touch screens are generally unreadable in direct sunlight. Another disadvantage is that resistive touch screens are sensitive to scratches. Yet another disadvantage is that resistive touch screens are unable to discern that two or more pointers are touching the screen simultaneously, referred to as \u201cmulti-touch\u201d.","Reference is made to , which is a prior art illustration of a conventional surface capacitive touch screen. Shown in  is a touch surface  overlaying a coated glass substrate . Two sides of a glass  are coated with a uniform conductive indium in oxide (ITO) coating . In addition, a silicon dioxide hard coating  is coated on the front side of one of the ITO coating layers . Electrodes  are attached at the four corners of the glass, for generating an electric current. A pointer , such as a finger or a stylus, touches the screen, and draws a small amount of current to the point of contact. A controller  then determines the location of the touch point based on the proportions of current passing through the four electrodes.","Advantages of surface capacitive touch screens are finger touch support and a durable surface.","A disadvantage of surface capacitive touch screens is that as a result of the overlay, the screens are not fully transparent. Another disadvantage is a limited temperature range for operation. Another disadvantage is a limited capture speed of pointer movements, due to the capacitive nature of the touch screens. Another disadvantage is that surface capacitive touch screens are susceptible to radio frequency (RF) interference and electromagnetic (EM) interference. Another disadvantage is that the accuracy of touch location determination depends on the capacitance. Another disadvantage is that surface capacitive touch screens cannot be used with gloves. Another disadvantage is that surface capacitive touch screens require a large screen border. As a consequence, surface capacitive touch screens cannot be used with small screen devices. Yet another disadvantage is that surface capacitive touch screens are unable to discern a mufti-touch.","Reference is made to , which is a prior art illustration of a conventional projected capacitive touch screen. Shown in  are etched ITO layers  that form multiple horizontal (x-axis) and vertical (y-axis) electrodes. Etched layers  include outer hard coat layers  and , an x-axis electrode pattern , a y-axis electrode pattern , and an ITO glass  in the middle. AC signals  drive the electrodes on one axis, and the response through the screen loops back via the electrodes on the other axis. Location of a pointer  touching the screen is determined based on the signal level changes  between the horizontal and vertical electrodes.","Advantages of projective capacitive touch screens are finger mufti-touch detection and a durable surface.","A disadvantage of projected capacitive touch screens is that as a result of the overlay, the screens are not fully transparent. Another disadvantage is their high cost. Another disadvantage is a limited temperature range for operation. Another disadvantage is a limited capture speed, due to the capacitive nature of the touch screens. Another disadvantage is a limited screen size, typically less than 5\u2033. Another disadvantage is that surface capacitive touch screens are susceptible to RF interference and EM interference. Yet another disadvantage is that the accuracy of touch location determination depends on the capacitance.","It will thus be appreciated that conventional touch screens are not ideal for general use with small mobile devices and devices with large screens. It would thus be beneficial to provide touch screens that overcome the disadvantages of conventional resistive and capacitive touch screens described above.","The present invention provides touch screens that overcome the drawbacks of conventional resistive and capacitive touch screens.","Aspects of the present invention relate to various embodiments of touch screens, including inter alia, (i) touch screens with wide light beams, (ii) touch screens with shift-aligned emitters and receivers, (iii) touch screens with highly refractive lenses, (iv) touch screens with a low bezel, (v) light-based touch screens using long thin light guides, (vi) pressure-sensitive light-based touch screens, and (vii) touch screens that use a reflected image to calculate a pointer location in three dimensions. Further aspects of the present invention relate to methods for touch screens, including inter alia (viii) methods for touch detection, and (ix) methods for calibrating touch screen components. Still further aspects of the present invention relate to precise placement and alignment of elements as required in certain embodiments of the present invention, as well as in other applications. Such aspects include (x) forming inter-fitting blocks that combine an emitter or receiver element and a lens, and (xi) methods for guiding an element during device assembly using a capillary effect.","Touch Screens with Wide Light Beams","In these embodiments of the present invention light from a narrow source, such as a near infrared LED, is widened, using lenses or reflective elements, to project over a wide swath of screen area. In order to widen a narrow cone of light, the light source is placed at a relatively long distance away from the screen edge. In one embodiment, the light source is placed underneath the screen, at an appropriate distance from the screen edge to allow for a gradual widening of the beam. The widened beam is reflected above the screen surface by reflectors placed near the screen edge.","In another embodiment of the present invention the light source is placed along a screen edge. Reflectors that reflect light over the screen surface are also placed along the same screen edge, at a suitable distance away from the light source, to allow for a gradual widening of the light beam before it is reflected over the screen surface. The light source emits a narrow cone of light substantially along the screen edge, and the light is reflected as a wide beam over the screen surface. A pointer, such as a finger or stylus, touching the screen blocks some of the emitted light. By measuring the blocked light, the location of the pointer on the screen is determined.","In an embodiment of the present invention the wide beam converges onto a narrow light detector after traversing the screen, via reflectors placed a suitable distance away from respective light detectors. The light detectors are placed either underneath the screen, or along a screen edge.","Touch Screens with Shift-Aligned Emitters and Receivers","In these embodiments of the present invention an arrangement of light emitters send light over the screen surface to an arrangement of light receivers, where the emitters are shift-aligned with the opposing receivers. As such, instead of light from each emitter being detected by one opposite receiver, light from each emitter arrives at two opposite receivers. Similarly, instead of each receiver detecting light from one opposite emitter, each receiver detects light from two opposite emitters. Such overlapping detection ensures that a touch on the screen is detected by at least two emitter-receiver pairs. In some embodiments an arrangement of shift-aligned lenses is used to ensure that light from each emitter arrives at two opposite receivers, and that each receiver detects light from two opposite emitters.","There is thus provided in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention a touch screen including a housing, a display mounted in the housing, a row of light pulse emitters, mounted in the housing, that transmit light pulses over the display, a row of light pulse receivers, mounted in the housing, that receive the light pulses, and a calculating unit, mounted in the housing and connected to the receivers, that determines a location of a pointer on the display that partially blocks the light pulses transmitted by the emitters, based on outputs of the receivers, wherein the emitters are shift-aligned with the receivers.","There is additionally provided in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention a touch screen including a housing, a display mounted in the housing, a frame of collimating lenses surrounding the display, wherein the collimating lenses along a first edge of the frame are shift-aligned with the collimating lenses along an opposite edge of the frame, a plurality of light pulse emitters mounted in the housing that transmit light pulses over the display through the collimating lenses of the first edge, a plurality of light pulse receivers mounted in the housing that receive the light pulses through the collimating lenses of the opposite edge, and a calculating unit, mounted in the housing and connected to the receivers, to determine a location of a pointer on the display that partially blocks the light pulses transmitted by the emitters, based on outputs of the receivers.","There is further provided in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention a touch screen including a housing, a display mounted in the housing, a plurality of collimating lenses mounted in the housing and surrounding the display, wherein the collimating lenses along a first edge of the display are shift-aligned with the collimating lenses along an opposite edge of the display, a plurality of light pulse emitters mounted in the housing that transmit light pulses over the display through the collimating lenses of the first edge, a plurality of light pulse receivers mounted in the housing that receive the light pulses through the collimating lenses of the opposite edge, and a calculating unit, mounted in the housing and connected to the receivers, to determine a location of a pointer on the display that partially blocks the light pulses transmitted by the emitters, based on outputs of the receivers.","Aspects of the present invention employ a novel collimating lens coupled with a surface of micro-lenses that refract light to form multiple wide divergent beams. When the surface of micro-lenses is on a surface not facing an emitter or receiver element, such a collimating lens transmits light in two stages. As light passes through the body of the lens, light beams are collimated, as with conventional collimating lenses. However, as the light passes through the surface of micro-lenses, the light is refracted into multiple wide divergent beams. When the surface of micro-lenses is on a surface facing an emitter or receiver element, such a collimating lens outputs beams substantially similar to those produced by a collimating lens having an outer surface of micro-lenses.","Touch Screens with Highly Refractive Lenses","In these embodiments of the present invention an arrangement of one or more light emitters send light over the screen surface to an arrangement of one or more light receivers. The light emitters and the light receivers use highly refractive lenses. Light passing through the lenses on the emitter side creates a pattern of highly divergent light beams that traverse the screen, thus ensuring that (a) a pointer touching the screen will block multiple light beams originating along a large section of the emitter edge, and (b) at any point along the receiver edge of the screen, multiple light beams originating along a large section of the emitter edge converge. As such, a touch on the screen is detected by each of multiple beams along a large section of the receiver edge. The lenses on the receiver side refract multiple incoming light beams to ensure that the beams converging at each point along the receiver edge are detected by the receivers.","There is thus provided in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention a touch screen including a housing, a display mounted in the housing, a light guide frame surrounding the display, the frame including patterns of micro-lenses along two opposing sides of the frame for refracting incoming light in multiple directions, a plurality of light pulse emitters mounted in the housing that transmit light pulses over the display through the patterns of micro-lenses along a first edge of the frame, a plurality of light pulse receivers mounted in the housing that receive the light pulses through the patterns of micro-lenses along the opposite edge of the frame, and a calculating unit, mounted in the housing and connected to the receivers, to determine a location of a pointer on the display that partially blocks the light pulses transmitted by the emitters, based on outputs of the receivers.","There is additionally provided in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention a touch screen including a housing, a display mounted in the housing, two light guides mounted in the housing and arranged along two opposite edges of the display, each light guide including a pattern of micro-lenses for refracting incoming light in multiple directions, a plurality of light pulse emitters mounted in the housing that transmit light pulses over the display through a first light guide, a plurality of light pulse receivers mounted in the housing that receive the light pulses through a second light guide, and a calculating unit, mounted in the housing and connected to the receivers, to determine a location of a pointer on the display that partially blocks the light pulses transmitted by the emitters, based on outputs of the receivers.","Further, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the light emitters and light receivers are positioned below the screen surface, and light is directed above and across the screen surface by a first light guide positioned along a first screen edge, the light guide including a collimating lens for each light emitter, each collimating lens having a plurality of micro-lenses etched thereon. The collimating lenses are positioned below the screen surface.","Yet further, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a second light guide is positioned along a second screen edge opposite the first screen edge, to direct light beams from the first light guide to the light receivers below the screen surface. Moreover, the second light guide may be substantially similar to the first light guide, including a lens with a plurality of micro-lenses etched thereon for each light receiver.","There is additionally provided in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention a touch screen system, including a plurality of light emitters and light receivers that are positioned along respective opposite edge of the screen, and not below the screen surface. Light is directed from the emitters across the screen surface by collimating lenses that have a plurality of micro-lenses etched thereon, and directed to the receivers by similar lenses.","Touch Screens with a Low Bezel","In these embodiments of the present invention an arrangement of one or more light emitters send light over the screen surface to an arrangement of one or more light receivers. Both the light emitters and the light receivers are placed below the screen surface. Light from the emitters is reflected over the screen by a reflective light guide that extends above the screen. Similarly, light that has passed over the screen surface is reflected onto the receivers by a reflective light guide. The height of these reflective light guides above the screen creates a bezel surrounding the screen. A conventional reflective light guide has a substantially flat reflective surface inclined at a 45\u00b0 angle to the screen surface. Light beams vertical to the screen are re-directed by the light guide to a plane substantially parallel with the screen surface. However, substantially all of the reflective surface extends above the screen surface, forming a bezel around the screen. In order to reduce the bezel height, embodiments of the present invention use a light guide having a parabolic reflective surface and a corresponding refractive elliptical surface to re-direct the light beams. The parabolic reflective surface does not extend substantially above the screen surface, thus reducing the bezel height around the screen. Furthermore, the conventional light guide generally has a second surface substantially vertical to the screen surface through which light beams enter and exit. The abrupt vertical edge makes the bezel prominent and may be difficult to clean. The elliptical refractive surface used in embodiments of the present invention is less prominent, and is easier to clean. In some embodiments the elliptical refractive surface is part of the screen glass.","There is thus provided in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention a touch screen including a housing, a display mounted in the housing, a plurality of light pulse emitters mounted in the housing below the display, a plurality of light pulse receivers mounted in the housing below the display, a first light guide, mounted in the housing along a first edge of the display, having a substantially parabolic reflective surface and a substantially elliptical refractive surface for, respectively, reflecting and refracting light pulses transmitted by the emitters over the display, a second light guide, mounted in the housing along an opposite edge of the display, having a substantially elliptical refractive surface and a substantially parabolic reflective surface for, respectively, refracting and reflecting light pulses transmitted over the display to the receivers, and a calculating unit, mounted in the housing and connected to the receivers, to determine a location of a pointer on the display that partially blocks the light pulses transmitted by the emitters, based on outputs of the receivers.","There is additionally provided in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention a touch screen including a housing, a display mounted in the housing, a plurality of light pulse emitters mounted in the housing below the display, a plurality of light pulse receivers mounted in the housing below the display, a light guide frame mounted in the housing and surrounding the display, having a substantially parabolic reflective surface and a substantially elliptical refractive surface along each edge for, respectively, reflecting and refracting light pulses transmitted by the emitters over the display to the receivers, and a calculating unit, mounted in the housing and connected to the receivers, to determine a location of a pointer on the display that partially blocks the light pulses transmitted by the emitters, based on outputs of the receivers.","There is further provided in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention a touch system, including a plurality of light emitters and light receivers positioned below the screen surface, and light is directed above and across the screen surface by light guides that each have at least two units; namely, a first unit having a collimating lens at one end and a plurality of micro-lenses along a surface at the other end, and a second unit that re-directs light over the screen surface.","Yet further, the second unit includes at least two active surfaces; namely, a first surface that is a parabolic or a quasi-parabolic reflective surface that folds incoming light beams into a focal location, and a second surface that is a complementary elliptical or quasi-elliptical surface having the same focal location, wherein the second surface directs the folded light beams over the screen surface.","There is moreover provided in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention a touch screen system, including a plurality of light emitters and light receivers positioned below a display screen, and a first light guide along at least one edge of the screen that reflects light from the emitters above the screen. The light guide includes at least two active surfaces; namely, a first surface that is a parabolic or a quasi-parabolic reflective surface that folds incoming light beams into a focal location, and a second surface that is a complementary elliptical or quasi-elliptical surface having the same focal location. The second surface directs the folded light beams over the screen surface.","Additionally, a second light guide is positioned opposite the first light guide across the screen, to direct light beams from the first light guide to light receivers below the screen. The second light guide may be substantially similar to the first light guide.","Touch Screens using Long Thin Light Guides","There is provided in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention a touch screen including a housing, a display mounted in the housing, a plurality of collimating lenses mounted in the housing and arranged along a first edge of the display, a plurality of light pulse emitters mounted in the housing that are spaced apart from and serially transmit light pulses through the collimating lenses over the display, a light guide mounted in the housing along the edge of the display opposite the first edge, for receiving the light pulses, the light guide including a reflective strip that reflects light pulses received along the length of the light guide to one end of the light guide, a light pulse receiver mounted in the housing near the one end of the light guide, for receiving the reflected light pulses, and a calculating unit, mounted in the housing and connected to the receiver, for determining a location of a pointer on the display that partially blocks light pulses transmitted by the emitters, based on outputs of the receiver.","There is additionally provided in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention a touch screen including a housing, a display mounted in the housing, a light guide mounted in the housing along a first edge of the display, the light guide including a reflective strip that reflects light pulses received along the length of the light guide to both ends of the light guide, a plurality of light pulse

location of a pointer on the display that partially blocks the light pulses transmitted by the emitters, based on outputs of the receivers.","Touch Screens Using a Reflected Image to Determine a Height of a Pointer Above a Touch Screen","There is provided in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention a touch screen system including a reflective display surface, a camera mounted so as to capture an image of (i) the reflective display surface, (ii) a pointer approaching the reflective display surface, and (iii) a reflection of the pointer on the reflective display surface, and a processor coupled with the camera that determines a three-dimensional location of the pointer relative to the reflective display surface, based on the positions of the pointer and the reflection of the pointer in the image captured by the camera.","Pressure-Sensitive Light-Based Touch Screens","There is provided in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention a light-based touch screen that discriminates between hard touches and soft touches. In one embodiment, a rigidly mounted screen is surrounded by emitters and receivers. A hard touch is discriminated from a soft touch by an increase in detected light at a plurality of receivers, the increase resulting from a bending of the rigidly mounted screen caused by the hard touch. In another embodiment, a screen is flexibly mounted in a housing surrounded by rigidly mounted emitters and receivers. The pressure of the touch lowers the screen into the housing, resulting in an increase in detected light at a plurality of the receivers. Different amounts of pressure correspond to differences in the increased amounts of detected light.","Methods for Touch Detection","There is provided in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention a method of calculating a touch coordinate on a touch screen, including providing a display, a row of light pulse emitters that transmit light pulses over the display, and a row of light pulse receivers that receive the light pulses and that output signals representing the received light pulses, wherein the emitters are shift-aligned with corresponding receivers, detecting a touch on the display that partially blocks the light pulses, based on the receiver outputs, selecting a maximum touch detection receiver output, identifying the emitter-receiver pair corresponding to the maximum touch detection receiver output, selecting at least one emitter-receiver pair to the left, and at least one emitter-receiver pair to the right of the maximum touch detection emitter-receiver pair, for each of the at least three emitter-receiver pairs, identifying a respective corresponding touch screen coordinate, for each of the at least three emitter-receiver pairs, calculating a product of the emitter-receiver pair coordinate and its respective touch detection output signal, calculating a first sum of the products, calculating a second sum of the receiver outputs, calculating a spatially-filtered touch coordinate by dividing the first sum by the second sum, providing a reference touch coordinate based on previous touch detection signals, calculating a temporally-filtered touch coordinate based on the spatially-filtered touch coordinate and the reference touch coordinate, and assigning either (i) the temporally-filtered touch coordinate value, or (ii) a value that combines the temporally-filtered touch coordinate and the reference touch coordinate, to the reference touch coordinate.","There is additionally provided in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention a touch screen system, including a plurality of light emitters and light receivers, wherein light from each emitter is detected by more than one receiver, and each receiver detects light from more than one emitter.

Alternatively, a touch location is determined based on (a) signal differences at three or more receivers that detect light from the same emitter, and (b) signal differences at a receiver that detects light from three or more emitters. Yet further, each emitter is situated opposite a midpoint between two receivers, and each receiver is situated opposite a midpoint between two emitters, with the exception of emitters and receivers at or near screen corners.","There is additionally provided in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention a touch screen system operable to disambiguate a mufti-touch operation. Certain mufti-touch operations generate two or more touch x-coordinates and two or more touch y-coordinates. In such situations it is essential to resolve which x-coordinate is associated with which y-coordinate. E.g., when two touches performed simultaneously are not aligned vertically or horizontally, the two touches generate two touch x-coordinates and two touch y-coordinates. Similarly, in response to a rotation gesture, where two fingers touch the screen and glide in a circular pattern around an axis, the screen display, or a screen element display, is rotated either clockwise or counter-clockwise, according to the sense of the rotation gesture. As such, it is essential to resolve whether the sense of the rotation gesture is clockwise or counter-clockwise. Aspects of the present invention provide a touch screen system that uses intensities of touch detections to resolve mufti-touch touch locations, and to resolve the sense of a rotation gesture as being clockwise or counter-clockwise.","Methods for Calibrating Touch Screen Components","There is provided in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention a method of calibrating optical components in a light-based touch screen, including providing a display, a row of light pulse emitters that transmit light pulses over the display according to pulse current and pulse duration controls, and a row of light pulse receivers that receive the light pulses and that output signals representing the received light pulses, determining whether a touch event occurred on the display that partially blocks the light pulses, based on the receiver outputs, if the determining determines that a touch event has not occurred, then further determining if the receiver outputs are stable, if the further determining determines that the receiver outputs are stable, then yet further determining if each receiver output is within a respective designated deviation from a respective reference value of the receiver, if the yet further determining determines that at least one receiver output is not within its designated deviation from its reference value, then modifying at least one emitter pulse current and pulse duration, and if the yet further determining determines that all receiver outputs are within their respective designated deviations from their respective reference values, then assigning the respective receiver outputs to their respective reference values.","There is additionally provided in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention a method of calibrating optical components in a light-based touch screen, including providing a display, a row of light pulse emitters that transmit light pulses over the display, and a row of light pulse receivers that receive the light pulses and that output signals representing the received light pulses, determining whether a touch event occurred on the display that partially blocks the light pulses, based on some of the receiver outputs, if the determining determines that a touch event has occurred, then further determining if the remaining receiver outputs are stable, if the further determining determines that the remaining receiver outputs are stable, then yet further determining whether the remaining receiver outputs are within respective designated deviations from respective reference values of the receivers, and if the yet further determining determines that the remaining receiver outputs are within their respective designated deviations from their respective reference values, then assigning the respective remaining receiver outputs to their respective reference values.","Inter-Fitting Lens Blocks","There is provided in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention a touch screen assembled from pre-fabricated lens blocks.

surfaces.","For clarity of exposition, throughout the present specification the term \u201ctouch screen\u201d is used as a generic term to refer to touch sensitive surfaces that may or may not include an electronic display. As such, the term \u201ctouch screen\u201d as used herein includes inter alia a mouse touchpad as included in many laptop computers, and the cover of a handheld electronic device. The term \u201coptical touch screen\u201d is used as a generic term to refer to light-based touch screens, including inter alia screens that detect a touch based on the difference between an expected light intensity and a detected light intensity, where the detected light intensity may be greater than or less than the expected light intensity. The term \u201cscreen glass\u201d is used as a generic term to refer to a transparent screen surface. The screen may be constructed inter alia from glass, or from a non-glass material including inter alia crystal, acrylic and plastic. In some embodiments of the present invention, the screen allows near-infrared light to pass through, but is otherwise non-transparent.","For clarity of exposition, throughout the present specification, the term \u201cemitter\u201d is used as a generic term to refer to a light emitting element, including inter alia a light-emitting diode (LED), and the output end of a fiber optic or tubular light guide that outputs light into a lens or reflector that directs the light over a display surface. The term \u201creceiver\u201d is used as a generic term to refer to a light detecting element, including inter alia a photo diode (PD), and the input end of a fiber optic or tubular light guide that receives light beams that traversed a display surface and directs them to a light detecting element or to an image sensor, the image sensor being inter alia a charge coupled device (CCD) or a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor.","Reference is made to , which is an illustration of a portion of a touch screen including a plurality of emitters - that are positioned close together, wherein light is guided by fiber optic light guides  to locations along a first screen edge, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The portion of the touch screen also includes a plurality of receivers - that are positioned close together, wherein light is guided thereto by fiber optic light guides  from locations a long a second screen edge.","According to embodiments of the present invention, a light-based touch screen includes one or more emitters, including inter alia infra-red or near infra-red light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and a plurality of receivers, including inter alia photo diodes (PDs), arranged along the perimeter surrounding the touch screen or touch surface. The emitters project light substantially parallel to the screen surface, and this light is detected by the receivers. A pointer, such as a finger or a stylus, placed over a portion of the screen blocks some of the light beams, and correspondingly some of the receivers detect less light intensity. The geometry of the locations of the receivers, and the light intensities they detect, suffice to determine screen coordinates of the pointer. The emitters and receivers are controlled for selective activation and de-activation by a controller. Generally, each emitter and receiver has I\/O connectors, and signals are transmitted to specify which emitters and which receivers are activated.","In an embodiment of the present invention, plural emitters are arranged along two adjacent sides of a rectangular screen, and plural receivers are arranged along the other two adjacent sides. In this regard, reference is now made to , which is a diagram of a touch screen  having 16 emitters  and 16 receivers , in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Emitters  emit infra-red or near infra-red light beams across the top of the touch screen, which are detected by corresponding receivers  that are directly opposite respective emitters . When a pointer touches touch screen , it blocks light from reaching some of receivers . By identifying, from the receiver outputs, which light beams have been blocked by the pointer, the pointer's location can be determined.","Reference is now made to , which are diagrams of touch screen  of , showing detection of two pointers,  and , that touch the screen simultaneously, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. When two or more pointers touch the screen simultaneously, this is referred to as a \u201cmulti-touch.\u201d Pointers  and , which are touching the screen, block light from reaching some of receivers . In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the locations of pointers  and  are determined from the crossed lines of the infra-red beams that the pointers block. In distinction, prior art resistance-based and capacitance-based touch screens are generally unable to detect a multi-touch.","When two or more pointers touch screen  simultaneously along a common horizontal or vertical axis, the positions of the pointers are determined by the receivers  that are blocked. Pointers  and  in  are aligned along a common vertical axis and block substantially the same receivers  along the bottom edge of touch screen ; namely the receivers marked a, b, c and d. Along the left edge of touch screen , two different sets of receivers  are blocked. Pointer  blocks the receivers marked e and f, and pointer  blocks the receivers marked g and h. The two pointers are thus determined to be situated at two locations. Pointer  has screen coordinates located at the intersection of the light beams blocked from receivers a-d and receivers e and f; and pointer  has screen coordinates located at the intersection of the light beams blocked from receivers a-d and receivers g and h.","Pointers  and  shown in  are not aligned along a common horizontal or vertical axis, and they have different horizontal locations and different vertical locations. From the blocked receivers a-h, it is determined that pointers  and  are diagonally opposite one another. They are either respectively touching the top right and bottom left of touch screen , as illustrated in ; or else respectively touching the bottom right and top left of touch screen , as illustrated in .","Discriminating between  and  is resolved by either (i) associating the same meaning to both touch patterns, or (ii) by associating meaning to only one of the two touch patterns, or (iii) by measuring the amount of light detected at the blocked receivers. In case (i), the UI arranges its icons, or is otherwise configured, such that the effects of both touch patterns  and  are the same. For example, touching any two diagonally opposite corners of touch screen  operates to unlock the screen.","In case (ii), the UI arranges its icons, or is otherwise configured, such that only one of the touch patterns  and  has a meaning associated therewith. For example, touching the upper right and lower left corners of touch screen  operates to unlock the screen, and touch the lower right and upper left of touch screen  has no meaning associated therewith. In this case, the UI discriminates that  is the correct touch pattern.","In case (iii), a finger closer to a receiver blocks more light from reaching the receiver than does a finger that is farther from the receiver. In part, this is due to the closer finger blocking more ambient light from reaching the receiver than does the farther finger. The light intensities detected at receivers e and f are compared with the light intensities detected at receivers g and h. Similarly, the light intensities detected at receivers a and b are compared with the light intensities detected at receivers c and d. If the light detected at receivers e and f and at receivers c and d is greater than the light detected at receivers g and h and at receivers a and b, then it is inferred that the fingers are positioned as shown in . Similarly, if the light detected at receivers e and f and at receivers c and d is less than the light detected at receivers g and h and at receivers a and b, then it is inferred that the fingers are positioned as shown in . The comparison may be based on summing or averaging the respective blocked receivers along each edge separately, e+f vs. g+h, and a+b vs. c+d. Alternatively, the comparison may be based on summing or averaging blocked receivers along two edges; i.e., based on the maximum and minimum of the values a+b+e+f, a+b+g+h, c+d+e+f, and c+d+g+h. The maximum and minimum values determine the locations of the fingers. E.g., if c+d+e+f is the maximum value and if a+b+g+h is the minimum value, then it is inferred that the fingers are positioned as shown in .","The number of receivers in each sum depends on the sequence of blocked, or at least partially blocked, receivers. The number of receivers may be different for each sequence. E.g., a sum of four receivers may be compared to a sum of six receivers. In one embodiment of the present invention the minimum receiver value in each sequence is used. The minimum receiver value corresponds to the receiver that is most blocked within a sequence of blocked receivers, and is a good indicator of proximity of the blocking finger to the sequence of receivers.","Determining locations of a diagonally oriented mufti-touch is discussed further hereinbelow with reference to shift-aligned arrangements of emitters and receivers.","Reference is now made to , which are diagrams of a touch screen  that detects a two finger glide movement, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The glide movement illustrated in  is a diagonal glide that brings pointers  and  closer together. The direction of the glide is determined from changes in which receivers  are blocked. As shown in , blocked receivers are changing from a and b to receivers  more to the right, and from c and d to receivers  more to the left. Similarly, blocked receivers are changing from e and f to receivers  more to the bottom, and from g and h to receivers  more to the top. For a glide in the opposite direction, that moves pointers  and  farther apart, the blocked receivers change in the opposite directions.","When pointers  and  are aligned in a common vertical or horizontal axis, there is no ambiguity in identifying glide patterns. When pointers  and  are not aligned in a common vertical or horizontal axis, there may be ambiguity in identifying glide patterns, as illustrated in . In case of such ambiguity, and as described hereinabove with reference to , discriminating between  and  is resolved by either (i) by associating the same meaning to both glide patterns, or (ii) by associating meaning to only one of the two glide patterns, or (iii) by measuring and comparing the amounts of light detected at the blocked receivers.","Associating the same meaning to both glide patterns may be performed in a pinch zoom gesture, whereby a user places two fingers on the screen and spreads the fingers apart along a diagonal of the screen. Such a gesture activates a zoom-in operation, for increasing the magnification of graphics displayed on the screen. Such a gesture has the same meaning irrespective of whether the pinch zoom is performed along a top-left to bottom-right diagonal, or along a top-right to bottom-left diagonal.","Similar considerations apply to a zoom-out gesture, whereby a user places two fingers on the screen and brings the fingers closer together along a diagonal of the screen, for decreasing the magnification of graphics displayed on the screen. This gesture, too, has the same meaning irrespective of along which diagonal of the screen the gesture is performed.","Reference is made to , which is a circuit diagram of touch screen  from , in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The emitters and receivers are controlled by a controller (not shown). The emitters receive respective signals LED00-LED15 from switches A, and receive current from VROW and VCOL through current limiters B. The receivers receive respective signals PD00-PD15 from shift register . Receiver output is sent to the controller via signals PDROW and PDCOL.

Each bit of the binary string corresponds to one of the emitters, and indicates whether to activate or deactivate the corresponding emitter, where a bit value \u201c1\u201d indicates activation and a bit value \u201c0\u201d indicates deactivation. Successive emitters are activated and deactivated by shifting the bit string within shift register .","Similarly, the receivers are controlled by a second serial interface, which transmits a binary string to a shift register .

The touch screen of  does not require an overlay. Instead, a small frame  surrounds the display with emitters  and receivers positioned on opposite sides of the screen, and hidden behind an infrared transparent bezel. When a pointer, such as a finger or a stylus, touches the screen in a specific area , one or more light beams generated by emitters  are obstructed. The obstructed light beams are detected by corresponding decreases in light received by one or more of the receivers, which is used to determine the location of the pointer.","Reference is made to , which is a simplified cross-sectional diagram of the touch screen system of , in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Shown in  is a cross-sectional view of a section A-A of an LCD display  and its surrounding infrared transparent frame . The cross-sectional view shows an emitter  emitting light  that is reflected by a cut-out  in frame , and directed substantially parallel over the display surface. As a finger  approaches near the display surface, some of the light, , emitted by the emitters and directed over the location of the near touch is blocked by the finger, and some of the light, , passes between the fingertip and the screen glass. When finger  touches the display surface, all of the light emitted by the emitters and directed over the touch location is blocked by finger .","Touch Screen System Configuration No. 1","Reference is made to , which is a simplified illustration of an arrangement of emitters, receivers and optical elements that enable a touch screen system to read pointers that are smaller than the sensor elements, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Shown in  are a mirror or optical lens , an emitter , a wide reflected light beam , a pointer  and a receiver . Mirror or optical lens  generates a wide light beam that is focused onto receiver  by a second mirror or optical lens. The wide beam makes it possible to sense an analog change in the amount of light detected at receiver  when a pointer blocks a portion of the wide beam. The wide beam enables sensing an analog change when pointer  is placed in front of mirror or lens . Thus, pointer  in  blocks only a portion of wide beam . The wide beam also enables mounting the emitters far apart from one another, and mounting the receivers far apart from one another. Consequently, this reduces the bill of materials by requiring fewer emitters and fewer receivers.","Reference is made to , which is a simplified illustration of an arrangement of emitters, receivers and optical elements that enable a touch screen system to detect a pointer that is smaller than the sensor elements, including inter alia a stylus, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.

Pointer , as shown in , blocks only a portion of wide beam , indicated by beam  being blocked by the tip of pointer . The wide beam also enables mounting emitters far apart from one another, and mounting receivers far apart from one another. In turn, this reduces the bill of materials by requiring fewer emitters and fewer receivers.","Without the wide beam, there are generally spaces between beams that go undetected, making it impossible to distinguish between a user dragging a fine-point stylus across the beams, and the user tapping on different beams with a fine-point stylus. Moreover, with widely spaced narrow beams the pointer touch must be very precise in order to cross a narrow beam.","Reference is made to , which is a simplified diagram of a touch screen with wide light beams covering the screen, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.

Generally, the emitters are not activated simultaneously.

Emitters  and receivers  are positioned beneath screen . Emitters  project arcs  of light under screen  onto reflectors . The distance between emitters  and reflectors  is sufficient for an arc to spread into a wide beam at a reflector . In various embodiments of the present invention, the distance between emitters  and reflectors  may be approximately 4 mm, 10 mm, 20 mm or greater, depending on factors including inter alia screen size, required touch resolution, emitter characteristics and optical reflector characteristics.","Reflectors  collimate the light as wide beams  across a swath of screen surface. A wide beam  reaches a reflector , which (i) redirects the light beam below screen , and (ii) narrows the wide beam  into an arc .

Referring to , it is desirable that the outer surface of section , facing emitter , be vertical, so that the front surface of section  is parallel with the straight back surface portion of light guide . However, it is difficult to manufacture exactly parallel surfaces. Moreover, if the light guide  were to be wider at its bottom, then it would not be easily removable from its mold. As such, the two surfaces generally form a wedge, and the surface of section  facing emitter  is not perfectly vertical.

Many electronic devices are designated with a display surface that is flush with the edges of the devices. This is often an aesthetic feature and, as such, when integrating optical touch screens with electronic devices, it is desirable to minimize or eliminate the raised rims. Less visibly prominent rims result in sleeker, more flush outer surfaces of the devices.","Moreover, in optical touch screens, the raised rim occupies a width around the display, beyond the edges of the display.

Such difference indicates that an object is touching the screen, blocking a portion of the expected light. Calibration and normalization of the weights is described hereinbelow. A similar weighted average is used to determine the y-coordinate Y.\n","If the pointer  is detected by more than two emitter-receiver pairs, then the above weighted average is generalized to\n\n=\u03a3()\/(\u03a3),\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nwhere the weights Ware normalized signal differences, and the Xare weight positions.\n","In one embodiment of the present invention, where the pointer  is a small object, the largest signal difference is used in conjunction with the two closest signals to calculate the position. This compensates for the fact that the signal differences for small objects are small, and noise thus becomes a dominant error factor. Use of the two closest signals reduces error due to noise. In another embodiment of the present invention, only the two largest signal differences are used.","Reference is made to , which is an illustration of a light guide frame for the configuration of , in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Shown in  are four edges of a light guide frame, with optical emitter lenses  and optical receiver lenses . It is noted that the inner edges of the frame are not completely covered by beams . As such, in some embodiments of the present invention only an inner touch area , indicated by the dashed rectangle, is used.","To reduce error due to signal noise, the final coordinate is determined as the output of a temporal filter, using the spatially filtered current coordinate value, determined as above, and a previous coordinate value. The higher the filter weight given to the current x-coordinate, the closer the output will be to that value, and the less will be the impact of the filter. Generally, use of substantially equal weights for both coordinate values results in a strong filter. In one embodiment of the present invention, the temporal filter is a low-pass filter, but other filters are also contemplated by the present invention. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, different pre-designated filter weight coefficients may be used in different cases. In an alternative embodiment, the filter weight coefficients are calculated as needed.","Choice of appropriate filter coefficients is based on scanning frequency, the speed at which a touch object is moving across the screen, whether the object motion is along a straight line or not, and the size of the touch object.","Generally, the higher the scanning frequency, the nearer the current coordinate value is to the previous coordinate value, and a stronger filter is used. Scanning frequency is used to estimate the speed and direction of movement of an object. Based on the scanning frequency, a threshold distance is assigned to two input values, the threshold indicating fast movement. If the difference between the current and previous coordinate values is greater than the threshold distance, a weaker filter is used so that the output coordinate not lag considerably behind the actual touch location. It has been found by experiment that the filter\n\noutput1\/10*previous9\/10*current\u2003\u2003(3)\n\nprovides good results in this case. In addition, the lag value, described hereinbelow, is reset to equal the output value in this case.\n","If the difference between the current and previous coordinate values is less than the threshold distance, then a lag value is determined. The lag value indicates speed and direction along an axis. In has been found by experiment that the value\n\nlag=5\/6*lag+1\/6*current\u2003\u2003(4)\n\nprovides good results in this case. The filter weight coefficients are selected based on the difference between the lag value and the current coordinate value. Generally, the greater this difference, which indicates either fast motion or sudden change in direction, the weaker the filter.\n","For example, if the touch object is stationary, the lag value eventually is approximately equal to the current coordinate value. In such case, signal noise may cause small differences in the spatially calculated touch position, which in turn may cause a disturbing jitter effect; i.e., the touch screen would show the object jittering. Use of a strong temporal filter substantially dampens such jittering.","If the touch object is moving fast or makes a sudden change in direction, a strong temporal filter may create a perceptible lag between the actual touch location and the displayed touch location. In the case of a person writing with a stylus, the written line may lag behind the stylus. In such cases, use of a weak temporal filter reduces such lagging.","When the touch object covers a relatively large screen area, such as a finger or other blunt object touching the screen, the lag between the actual finger motion and the displayed trace of the motion is less perceptible, because the finger covers the area of the lag. In such case, a different temporal filter is used.","The type of object, finger vs. stylus, being used may be inferred by knowing expected user behavior; e.g., a user interface intended for finger touch assumes a finger being used. The type of object may also be inferred by the shadowed area created by the object. The size of the touch area as determined based on shadowed emitter signals, is therefore also a factor used in selecting temporal filter weight coefficients.","Reference is made to , which is a simplified flowchart of a method for touch detection for an optical touch screen, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. At operation , a current coordinate value is received, based on a spatial filter that processes signals from multiple emitter-receiver pairs. A threshold distance is provided, based on a scan frequency. At operation , the difference between the current coordinate value and a previous coordinate value is compared to the threshold distance. If the difference is less than or equal to the threshold distance, then at operation  a new lag value is calculated, as in Eq. (4). At operation  temporal filter weight coefficients are determined based on the difference between the current coordinate value and the lag value. At operation , the temporal filter is applied to calculate an output coordinate value, as in Eq. (3).","If, at operation , the difference between the current coordinate value and previous coordinate value is greater than the threshold distance, then weak filter weight coefficients are selected at operation . At operation , the temporal filter is applied to calculate an output coordinate value, as in Eq. (3). At operation  the lag value is set to the output coordinate value.","Embodiments of the present invention provide a method and apparatus for detecting a mufti-touch operation whereby two touches occur simultaneously at two corners of a touch screen. An example of such a mufti-touch is a rotation gesture, shown in , whereby a user places two fingers  on a screen  and turns them around an axis.

Thus, referring back to , four detection points are shown along two rows of receivers. Detections D-D detect touch points  in upper-right & lower-left corners of the screen. Based on whether the detection pattern of each point is of type 1 or 3, or of type 2 or 4, the detection patterns determine whether the corresponding touch is closer to the emitters, or closer to the receivers. Each touch has two independent indicators; namely, the X-axis detectors, and the Y-axis detectors. Thus, for detection points  in , detections D and D are of types 2 or 4, and detections D and D are of types 1 or 3. In distinction, for detection points  in , detections D and D are of types 2 or 4, and detections D and D are of types 1 or 3.","In addition to evaluation of detection points independently, the various detection patterns may be ranked, to determine which touch point is closer to the emitters or to the receivers.","Moreover, when a rotate gesture is performed, from touch points  to touch points , movement of detections discriminates whether the gesture glides away from the emitters and toward the receivers, or vice versa. In particular, subsequent detections are compared, and discrimination is based on whether each detection pattern is becoming more like type 1 or 3, or more like type 2 or 4.","Reference is made to , which is a simplified flowchart of a method for determining the locations of simultaneous, diagonally opposed touches, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. At operation , two x-coordinates and two y-coordinates are detected, such as x-coordinates D and D, and y-coordinates D and D, shown in . At operation  the detected x-coordinates are analyzed to identify a pattern of detection from among those listed in TABLE I. At operation  the detected x-coordinates are ranked according to touches that occurred closer to or farther from a designated screen edge, based on the pattern detected at operation  and based on the \u201cTouch Location\u201d column of TABLE I. The y-coordinates represent distances from the designated edge. At operation , each ranked x-coordinate is paired with a corresponding y-coordinate. Operations - are performed for the y-coordinates, similar to operations - performed for the x-coordinates. At operation , the two sets of results are compared.","Reference is made to , which is a simplified flowchart of a method for discriminating between clockwise and counter-clockwise gestures, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. At operation , two glide gestures are detected along an x-axis. Each glide gesture is detected as a series of connected touch locations. Thus, with reference to , a first glide gesture is detected as a connected series of touch locations beginning at x-coordinate D, and a second concurrent glide gesture is detected as a connected series of touch locations beginning at x-coordinate D. At operation , the x-glide detections are analyzed to determine the types of detections that occurred in each series, from among the patterns listed in TABLE I.","At operation , the x-glide detections are ranked according to touches that occurred closer to or farther from a designated screen edge, based on the patterns of detections determined at operation , and based on the \u201cTouch Location\u201d column of TABLE I. Operation  relates to series of connected touch detections over a time interval. Each series generally includes touch detections of patterns 1 and 3, or of patterns 2 and 4, listed in TABLE I, depending on whether the glide was closer to or further away from the designated edge. In addition to analyzing the individual detections that comprise a glide, the series of touch detections is also analyzed to determine if the glide is moving closer to or farther from the designated edge, based on comparison of intensities of detections over time. E.g., in one series of detections having multiple pattern 1 detections, if the amount of blocked light increases over time, then it is inferred that the glide is moving toward the receivers, otherwise the glide is moving toward the emitters.","The y-coordinates represent distances from a designated edge, such as the edge of emitters. At operation  each ranked x-axis glide is paired with a corresponding y-axis glide. Operations - are performed for the y-axis glide, similar to operations - performed for the x-axis glide. At operation  the two sets of results are compared. At step  a discrimination is made as to whether the rotation gesture is clockwise or counter-clockwise.","Calibration of Touch Screen Components","Reference is made to , which is a simplified flowchart of a method of calibration and touch detection for an optical touch screen, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In general, each emitter\/receiver pair signal differs significantly from signals of other pairs, due to mechanical and component tolerances. Calibration of individual emitters and receivers is performed to ensure that all signal levels are within a pre-designated range that has an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio.","In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, calibration is performed by individually setting (i) pulse durations, and (ii) pulse strengths, namely, emitter currents. For reasons of power consumption, a large current and a short pulse duration is preferred. When a signal is below the pre-designated range, pulse duration and\/or pulse strength is increased. When a signal is above the pre-designated range, pulse duration and\/or pulse strength is decreased.","As shown in , calibration (operation ) is performed at boot up (operation ), and is performed when a signal is detected outside the pre-designated range (operation ). Calibration is only performed when no touch is detected (operation ), and when all signals on the same axis are stable (operation ); i.e., signal differences are within a noise level over a time duration.","Reference signal values for each emitter\/receiver pair are used as a basis of comparison to recognize a touch, and to compute a weighted average of touch coordinates over a neighborhood. The reference signal value for an emitter\/receiver pair is a normal signal level. Reference signal values are collected at boot up, and updated when a change, such as a change in ambient light or a mechanical change, is detected. In general, as shown in , reference signal values are updated (operation ) when signals are stable (operation ); i.e., when signals are within their expected range for some number, N, of samples over time.","A touch inside the touch area of a screen may slightly bend the screen surface, causing reflections that influence detected signal values at photo diodes outside of the touch area. Such bending is more pronounced when the touch object is fine or pointed, such as a stylus. In order to account for such bending, when a touch is detected (operation ), all stable signals (operation ) outside the touch area undergo a reference update (operation ). When no touch is present and all signals are stable (operation ), but a signal along an axis differs from the reference value by more than the expected noise level (operation ), the emitters are calibrated (operation ). Recalibration and updating of reference values require stable signals in order to avoid influence of temporary signal values, such as signal values due to mechanical stress by bending or twisting of the screen frame.","To further avoid error due to noise, if the result of an emitter\/receiver pair differs from a previous result by more than an expected noise level, a new measurement is performed, and both results are compared to the previous result, to get a best match. If the final value is within the expected noise level, a counter is incremented. Otherwise, the counter is cleared. The counter is subsequently used to determine if a signal is stable or unstable, when updating reference values and when recalibrating.","After each complete scan, signals are normalized with their respective reference values. If the normalized signals are not below a touch threshold, then a check is made if a recalibration or an update of reference values is necessary. If a normalized signal is below the touch threshold, then a touch is detected (operation ).","To reduce risk of a false alarm touch detection, due to a sudden disturbance, the threshold for detecting an initial point of contact with the screen, such as when a finger first touches the screen, is stricter than the threshold for detecting movement of a point of contact, such as gliding of a finger along the screen while touching the screen. I.e., a higher signal difference is required to detect an initial touch, vis-\u00e0-vis the difference required to detect movement of an object along the screen surface. Furthermore, an initial contact is processed as pending until a rescan verifies that the touch is valid and that the location of the touch remains at approximately the same position.","To determine the size of a touch object (operation ), the range of blocked signals and their amplitudes are measured. For large objects, there is a wait for detecting an initial point of contact with the screen, until the touch has settled, since the touch of a large object is generally detected when the object is near the screen before it has actually touched the screen. Additionally, when a large object approaches the screen in a direction not perpendicular to the touch area, the subsequent location moves slightly from a first contact location.","However, objects with small contact areas, such as a pen or a stylus, are typically placed directly at the intended screen location. As such, in some embodiments of the present invention, the wait for detecting an initial contact of a fine object is shortened or skipped entirely.","It has been found advantageous to limit the size of objects that generate a touch, in order to prevent detection of a constant touch when a device with a touch screen is stored in a pouch or in a pocket.","At operation , it is also necessary to distinguish between signals representing a valid touch, and signals arising from mechanical effects. In this regard, reference is made to , which is a picture showing the difference between signals generated by a touch, and signals generated by a mechanical effect, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. As seen in , signal gradients discriminate between a valid touch and a mechanical effect.","Reference is made to , which is a simplified diagram of a control circuit for setting pulse strength when calibrating an optical touch screen, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Reference is also made to , which is a plot of calibration pulses for pulse strengths ranging from a minimum current to a maximum current, for calibrating an optical touch screen in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.  shows plots for six different pulse durations (PULSETIME1-PULSETIME6), and sixteen pulse strength levels (1-16) for each plot.","The control circuit of  includes 4 transistors with respective variable resistors R, R, R and R. The values of the resistors control the signal levels and the ratio between their values controls gradients of the pulse curves shown in .","Reference is made to , which is a simplified pulse diagram and a corresponding output signal graph, for calibrating an optical touch screen, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The simplified pulse diagram is at the left in , and shows different pulse duration, t, . . . , t, that are managed by a control circuit when calibrating the touch screen. As shown in , multiple gradations are used to control duration of a pulse, and multiple gradations are used to control the pulse current. The corresponding output signal graph is at the right in .","As shown in , different pulse durations result in different rise times and different amplitudes. Signal peaks occur close to the time when the analog-to-digital (A\/D) sampler closes its sample and hold circuit. In order to obtain a maximum output signal, the emitter pulse duration is controlled so as to end at or near the end of the A\/D sampling window. Since the A\/D sampling time is fixed, the timing, t, between the start of A\/D sampling and the pulse activation time is an important factor.","Assembly of Touch Screen Components","As described hereinabove, a minimum of tolerances are required when aligning optical guides that after the shape of a wide light beam with respective light emitters and light receivers, in order to achieve accurate precision on an optical touch screen. A small misalignment can severely degrade accuracy of touch detection by altering the light beam. It is difficult to accurately place a surface mounted receiver and transmitter such that they are properly aligned with respective light guides.","Because of this difficulty, in an embodiment of the present invention, a light guide and transmitter or receiver are combined into a single module or optical element, as described above with reference to .","In some instances it may be of advantage not to combine an emitter or a receiver into an optical element, e.g., in order to use standard emitter and receiver components. In such instances precision placement of components is critical.","In some embodiments of the present invention, the optical lens that includes the feather pattern is part of a frame that fits over the screen.  shows a cross-section of such a frame , which is separate from LED .","Reference is made to , which is an illustration showing how a capillary effect is used to increase accuracy of positioning a component, such as an emitter or a receiver, on a substrate, inter alia a printed circuit board or an optical component, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
