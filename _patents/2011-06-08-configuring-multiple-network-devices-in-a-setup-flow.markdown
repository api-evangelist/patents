title: Configuring multiple network devices in a setup flow
abstract: A smart network may include a smart network host device as well as a smart network connector device, a smart network extender device and one or more client devices configured to connect to the smart network. An installation module is configured to connect to the smart network host device to determine whether a user is attempting to setup multiple network devices substantially simultaneously. The installation module then configures the multiple network devices based on the other network devices connected to the smart network host device. The installation module simplifies setup of the smart network by combining the configuration of multiple network devices into a single setup flow.

Technical Field","The present disclosure relates generally to wireless networks and, more specifically, to configuring multiple network devices in a setup flow.","2. Description of the Related Art","Home networks, in which multiple computing and\/or peripheral devices are communicatively linked together in a consumer's home, are becoming increasingly ubiquitous. A home environment may include one or more computers, a wireless router, a dsl modem, and one or more other devices capable of connecting to the home network. Conventionally, each device in the home network must be individually configured to connect to the network and, once configured, may then communicate with each of the other devices attached to the home network.","In practice, however, procedures for establishing and provisioning services on a home network are typically too involved for the majority of home network users to implement reliably. For example, a network user may need to manually reconfigure the home network router, determine a network IP address and\/or hostname for each device, establish network credentials, register the various services for each device, etc. Furthermore, in order for a device to locate another device on the home network, a device must establish communication using a unique IP address of the other device. Such connections are typically defined as peer-to-peer connections. A user may be required to manually keep track of which address is associated with which device or service in order to configure the devices to communicate on the home network. The manual configuration procedures described above make it a challenge for unsophisticated users to reliably setup a home network and provision services on the home network.","Accordingly, there is a need in the art for systems and methods that reliably and conveniently enable the user of a home network to automatically configure and provision multiple devices on the home network.","For clarity, identical reference numbers have been used, where applicable, to designate identical elements that are common between figures.

Furthermore, the client device () is able to authenticate the smart network  as a trusted network by accessing credentials for the corresponding ID device () specifically via the smart network . In one embodiment, the ID devices  are implemented as near field radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. Each one of the RFID tags is configured to retain authentication credentials necessary to uniquely associate the one RFID tag with one instance of the client device . In this way, an RFID tag may be paired with a given client device . Persons skilled in the art will recognize that any technique may be implemented to generate and represent authentication credentials without departing the scope and spirit of the present disclosure. For example, in another embodiment, the ID devices  could be implemented as a physical token that includes a printed bar code on a face of the token. The bar code may encode authentication credentials for a corresponding client device . In such an embodiment, the smart network host device  may include an optical scanner capable of reading the printed bar code from the physical token. In alternative embodiments, other forms of ID devices  may implement storage of the authentication credentials. For example, a universal serial bus (USB) storage device may be used to present authentication credentials to the smart network host device  for authenticating a related device, such as the computer . In other alternative embodiments, a user may manually authenticate a client device  with the smart network host device . For example, the user may log onto a management web page generated by the smart network host device  and manually enter authentication credentials, such as a printed code associated with the client device . In yet other embodiments, the smart network host device  and one or more client devices  may implement the Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) protocol for establishing and securing the smart network .","In one usage scenario involving ID device , the user wishes to add a new device, such as a smart network-enabled printer to the smart network . The printer includes an ID device  implemented as an RFID tag that is paired to the printer. The user places the ID device  in close physical proximity to the smart network host device , which is the able to read the ID device  and authenticate the printer. The printer registers with the smart network host device  and is then available for use by devices connected within the smart network .

Data packets transmitted by client devices () through (N) and destined to the external network  are received by the smart network extender device  and retransmitted by the smart network extender device  via bridge link  to the smart network host device , which then forwards the data packets to the external network . Similarly, data packets from the external network  that are destined to any of the client devices () through (N) are transmitted via bridge link  to the smart network extender device , which retransmits the data packets via wireless client links ()-(N).

In another embodiment, the wireless network adapter  may be replaced with a wired network adapter, such as an Ethernet NIC, a USB\u2122 port, or any other technically feasible communications interface capable of communicating with the smart network host device . Processor  may be any type of processing unit well-known in the art such as a central processing unit (CPU) that may include on-chip memory (RAM), one or more high speed caches, one or more processing cores and other common components of a CPU.

In some embodiments, memory  may also include non-volatile memory such as a hard disk drive or a flash memory device.","As shown in , memory  stores installation module  and driver . Driver  is configured to enable the operating system (not shown) running on computer  to transmit and receive data on the smart network  via the wireless network adapter . Driver  may implement an application programming interface (API) that enables the installation module  to transmit or receive data packets over data link  via antenna . Antenna  is similar to antennas  or , described above.","In order for a user to setup the smart network  shown in , the user must first install the installation module  in the memory  of the computer . In one embodiment, the installation module will be provided with the smart network host device  on a computer-readable storage medium such as a CD or DVD. The user may place the CD or DVD containing the installation module  in a drive of the computer , which causes the computer  to automatically transfer the installation module  to the memory . In another embodiment, the installation module  may be downloaded from a server connected to the Internet via a prior configured connection such as a wired Ethernet connection between WAN interface device  and an Ethernet NIC of computer . Once the installation module  is transferred to memory , the installation module  may be executed in processor  to cause computer  to begin a setup flow for configuring the smart network .","In one embodiment, the installation module  is configured to detect whether the operating system running on computer  is compatible with the current version of the installation module . If the operating system is not compatible, then the setup flow will terminate. However, if the operating system is compatible, then the installation module  may check for current internet connectivity. In one embodiment, the installation module  may query the operating system to determine whether computer  is connected to the internet. In another embodiment, installation module  may check for internet connectivity in any technically-feasible manner such as by attempting to ping a well-known IP address. If the computer  is connected to the Internet, then installation module  may determine whether an updated version of the installation module  is available on a remote server. In one embodiment, installation module  may transmit a message to a manufacturer website hosted on the remote server connected to the Internet. The message may be an XML message that queries the remote server as to a version number associated with the most up-to-date version of the installation module . If the version number received from the remote server does not match a version number associated with installation module  stored in memory , then the installation module  may be configured to download a new version of the installation module  and replace installation module  in memory  with the new version of the installation module .","However, if either computer  is not connected to the Internet or the installation module  is the most up-to-date version of the installation module , then the installation module  may determine whether the installation module  is executing on processor  with elevated privileges. For example, an installation module  designed for the Windows\u2122 operating system may require administrator privileges. If installation module  determines that the installation module  is not executing with elevated privileges, then the installation module  may cause a user interface to be displayed on a display associated with computer  that prompts for the user to enter credentials for elevated privileges. If the installation module  determines that the credentials are invalid, then the installation module  may retry prompting the user for new credentials. Otherwise, the installation module  may be configured to terminate the setup flow.","However, if installation module  determines that the installation module  is executing with elevated privileges, then the installation module  may cause a user interface to be displayed on the display device that prompts the user to plug in the smart network host device  and the smart network connector device . The user interface may also prompt the user to place an ID device () associated with the smart network connector device  in proximity to the smart network host device . The ID device () enables the smart network host device  to authenticate the smart network connector device  via the backhaul link . In order to setup the smart network , the user places the smart network host device  at a desired location in the home, such as near the center of the home, and plugs in the smart network host device . Similarly, the user places the smart network connector device  at a location proximate to the WAN interface device . The user then plugs in the smart network connector device  and connects the smart network connector device  to the WAN interface device .","Once the user has been prompted to plug in the network devices, the installation module  is configured to determine whether a wireless network adapter  is enabled in computer . If a wireless network adapter  is not enabled, then installation module  determines whether the user would like to install a wireless network adapter . If the user has a wireless network adapter  to install in computer  or if a wireless network adapter  is already installed but needs to be enabled, the installation module  executes a setup flow for the wireless network adapter . For example, the installation module  may prompt the user to install driver  associated with the wireless network adapter  or, after prompting the user to install driver , may also prompt the user to turn off the computer , install the wireless network adapter  in the chassis of the computer  and reboot computer  so the operating system automatically recognizes the wireless network adapter  and enables the wireless network adapter  via driver . However, if the user indicates that he does not want to install a wireless network adapter , installation module  determines whether a wired network adapter is enabled. If no wired network adapter (or other suitable communication interface) is enabled, then installation module  may cause an error message to be displayed on the display device that indicates that no network adapters are available to connect to the smart network host device  and the setup flow terminates.","If either a wireless network adapter  or a wired network adapter is enabled, then installation module  attempts to connect with the smart network host device . In one embodiment, the smart network host device  provides a wireless access point to any wireless enabled devices within range of antenna . The smart network host device  may broadcast a well-known service set identifier (SSID) associated with the wireless access point. The installation module  may be configured to attempt to connect to the wireless access point associated with the well-known SSID via the wireless network adapter . The installation module  may prompt the user to enter network credentials to authenticate the smart network host device  as a trusted network device. The network credentials may be provided via a USB\u2122 key or may be manually input via a keyboard connected to computer . The installation module  may then attempt to authenticate the smart network host device  via a handshake mechanism that tests whether the network credentials match the network credentials associated with the smart network host device . If the smart network host device  is authenticated, then the installation module  is connected to the smart network host device .","In alternative embodiments, the computer  may connect to the smart network host device via a wired connection such as via an Ethernet cable or a USB cable. In such embodiments, the installation module  may skip any type of network authentication because the physical connection ensures that the smart network host device  is a trusted network device.","If the installation module  determines that the connection to the smart network host device  has failed, then installation module  may attempt to re-connect to the smart network host device . Alternatively, installation module  may cause an error message to be displayed on the display device associated with computer  that informs the user that the smart network host device  cannot be detected. However, if the installation module  determines that the connection to the smart network host device  has succeeded, then installation module  may determine whether the smart network host device  is connected to a smart network connector device . In one embodiment, the installation module  is configured to send a message to the smart network host device  that queries the smart network host device  as to whether a smart network connector device  is connected to the smart network host device . For example, the ID device () may enable the smart network host device  to automatically establish a connection with the smart network connector device  via the backhaul link . The smart network host device  tracks the network devices authenticated with the smart network host device  via the ID device () and may transmit a response message to the installation module  that indicates whether the smart network host device  is connected to a smart network connector device .","If the smart network host device  is not connected to a smart network connector device , then the installation module  causes the smart network host device  to be configured as a router device. Such a configuration assumes that the user has setup a smart network  where the smart network host device  is connected directly to the WAN interface device (or is not connected to an external network at all) and will provide certain functions such as NAT, firewall services, and the like. In such configurations, one of the ports of the smart network host device  may be configured as a WAN port while the remainder of the ports of the smart network host device  are configured as LAN ports. However, if the smart network host device  is connected to a smart network connector device , then the installation module  causes the smart network connector device  to be configured as a router device and also causes the smart network host device  to be configured as a bridge device. In such configurations, all of the ports of the smart network host device  are configured as LAN ports.","After causing the smart network host device  and, if connected, the smart network connector device  to configure as network devices with particular functionality, installation module  determines whether the smart network host device  is connected to a smart network extender device . As shown in , the user has not purchased a smart network extender device  and, therefore, the installation module  proceeds to configure the router device to connect to the Internet. In the particular embodiment shown in , installation module  configures the smart network connector device  as a router device. Thus, installation module  configures the smart network connector device  to connect to the Internet. For example, installation module  may cause the smart network connector device  to broadcast a DHCP message on a WAN port of the smart network connector device  that is wired via an Ethernet cable directly to the WAN interface device . A DHCP server on a remote network hosted by an internet service provider (ISP) associated with the WAN interface device  may receive the broadcast DHCP message and transmit a DHCP response message to the smart network connector device . If the smart network connector device  receives a DHCP response message, the smart network connector device  may populate one or more routing tables in a memory of the router device using one or more IP addresses included in the DHCP response message. Consequently, the remote network hosted by the ISP may provide the smart network  with access to the Internet.","However, if the smart network connector device  does not receive a DHCP response message, the installation module  may prompt a user to enter network credentials for connecting with the remote network via point-to-point protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE) messages. Once the user has entered network credentials, the installation module  causes the smart network connector device  to broadcast a PPPoE message on the WAN port. If the smart network connector device  receives a PPPoE response message, then the smart network connector device  may populate one or more routing tables using one or more IP addresses included in the PPPoE response message. However, if the smart network connector device  does not receive a PPPoE response message, then the WAN interface device  may not be connected to the Internet.","Once the installation module  has configured the router device, installation module  checks for internet connectivity, as described above. If installation module  detects that the router device has failed to connect to the Internet, installation module  may determine whether to attempt to re-configure the router device. In one embodiment, installation module  may transmit a signal to the WAN interface device  that causes the WAN interface device  to perform a power cycle (i.e., rebooting the WAN interface device ). In another embodiment, installation module  may display a user interface on the display device that prompts the user to manually remove power to the WAN interface device  and then plug the WAN interface device  back into a power source. The installation module  may then try to re-configure the router device. However, if installation module  determines not to attempt to re-configure the router device, installation module  may cause an error message to be displayed that indicates that the smart network  cannot connect to the Internet and the setup flow is terminated.","If installation module  determines that the router device is connected to the Internet, then installation module  may cause a user interface to be displayed on the display device that prompts the user to create a username and password for portal  installed on the computer . The username and password ensure that only authorized users may download and install applets  for use with smart network . In one embodiment, the username and password may provide access to the applet store  connected to the external network .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B"],"b":["102","120","140","102","130","102","110","102","102","150","232","120","112","120","110"]},"In addition, installation module  may detect during the setup flow that the smart network host device  is connected to a smart network extender device  via the presence of ID device () that is associated with the smart network extender device . Thus, when the installation module  determines that the smart network extender device  is connected to the smart network host device  via bridge link , installation module  causes the smart network extender device to be configured to provide at least one additional wireless access point for client devices  to connect to the smart network .","It will be appreciated that initiating the setup flow via computer  is only one possible solution and that any device capable of implementing the functions of installation module  is contemplated to be within the scope of the present disclosure. For example, a manufacturer may provide a dedicated hardware device that implements installation module  in one or more hardware units. In another embodiment, installation module  may be included in the smart network host device . In such embodiments, installation module  may skip any steps involving establishing a connection between computer  and the smart network host device . Alternatively, the installation module  executing on the processor complex  of the smart network host device  may communicate with a thin client on a computer  to provide the user with a user interface. For example, a user may connect to a default IP address for the smart network host device  via a wired connection between a wired network adapter of computer  and a port of the smart network host device .
