JavaScript may be used in the form of client-side JavaScript, implemented as an integrated component of the web browser. A web browser is generally a software application for retrieving, presenting, and traversing information resources on the Internet. Although browsers are primarily intended to access the Internet, they may also be used to access information provided by web servers in private networks or files in file systems. Examples of web browsers are Windows Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, and Google Chrome. AJAX is generally a group of interrelated web development techniques that may be used on the client-side to create interactive web applications or rich Internet applications, for example. With AJAX, web applications may retrieve data from a server asynchronously in the background without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page.","In one general aspect, various embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to a systems and methods wherein a first party can control the browser content of a second party. According to various embodiments, the method may be for communication between a first party and a second party, where the first party has a computer device in a first location and the second party has a computer device in a second location, and where the first party's computer device runs a browser application and the second party's computer device runs a browser application. Furthermore, various embodiments may provide, by the first party's computer device to a processor-based computer server, a first indication of a first content to be displayed by the second party's browser application. Various embodiments may further provide, by the server to the second party's computer device, the first content to be displayed by the second party's browser application after the first indication has been provided to the server, where the server is in communication with the second party's computer device via a data network. Additionally, various embodiments may further provide, by the first party's computer device to a server, a second indication of a second content to be displayed by the second party's browser application after the first indication has been provided to the server. After expiration of a first timer associated with the second party's browser application, a query may be received at the server via the data network from the second party's computer device that queries whether the first content should continue to be displayed by the second party's browser application and in response to the query, the server may provide to the second party's computer device, the second content to be displayed by the second party's browser application at least until the expiration of a second timer.","In another general aspect, a system for communication between a first party and a second party, where the first party has a first computer device in a first location and the second party has a second computer device in a second location, where the first party's computer device runs a browser application and the second party's computer device runs a browser application may comprise a computer database that stores data comprising a first content and a second content and a server in communication with the computer database that electronically communicates with a first computer device and a second computer device, where the server comprises at least one processor circuit and at least one memory circuit, wherein the server is programmed to receive from the first computer device an indication of a first content to be displayed by a browser application run by the second computer device. Further, the server may be programmed to provide to the second computer device the first content to be displayed by the browser application of the second computer device and receive from the first computer device an indication of a second content to be displayed by the browser application of the second computer device. After expiration of a first timer associated with the browser application of the second computer device, the server may receive a query from the second computer device that queries whether the first content should continue to be displayed by the browser application of the second computer device. In response to the query, the server may provide to the second computer device the second content to be displayed by the browser application of the second computer device at least until the expiration of a second timer.","Various non-limiting embodiments of the present disclosure will now be described to provide an overall understanding of the principles of the structure, function, manufacture, and use of the systems, apparatuses, accessories, and methods disclosed herein.

In one embodiment, a customer may visit a webpage and indicate that the customer wishes to converse with an agent about a particular service or product. The customer may then populate an on-line form with information, such as name and telephone number, and electronically transmit the form to the call center. The form may have a \u2018call me now option\u2019 preselected. The form may also include a calendaring functionality allowing the customer to schedule a call at a future date. Upon successful transmission of the form, the customer may be provided with an access code from the call center. The access code may be provided to the customer using any suitable technique, such as by displaying the access code on a webpage, sending the code via e-mail, or sending the code via a text message, for example. For outgoing calls to the customer, an automated telephone system associated with the call center, may then dial the telephone number for the customer provided in the form. Upon answering the telephone, the customer may be asked to input the access code in order to verify the identify of the customer and reduce spurious connections. Once the customer has been verified, the telephone system of the call center may connect the selected agent to the call with the customer. As is to be appreciated, any suitable telephony network may be used, such as traditional telephone networks (e.g., public switched telephone network) or VOiP networks, for example. Additionally, the call center's telephone system may be implemented using any suitable telephony engine, such as ASTERISK\u00ae PBX, for example.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","202","204","206","208","210","212"]},"Still referring to , at , it may be determined if the customer wishes to make a purchase. In other embodiments, other \u201cgoals\u201d may be desired besides making a purchase, such as scheduling a follow-up meeting or adding the customer to a mailing list, for example. If the customer declines, the agent may show the customer a different offer or add the customer's telephone number to a do-not-call list. If the customer needs more time to make a purchasing decision, the agent may schedule a follow-up call with that agent or request a general request for a callback. Ultimately, the telephony connection may be terminated and the agent's control of the customer's browser may be relinquished at . If the customer wishes to make a purchase, or otherwise needs to provide information, a payment screen (or other goal screen) is provided to the customer at .

The embodiments presented herein are not limited to any particular service, product, or offering, but instead may be implemented across a number of varying applications, such as business services, consumer services, technical support services, travel services, and customer service support services, for example.","Furthermore, in various embodiments, the goal of the interaction between the agent and the customer may not necessarily to make a \u201cpurchase\u201d during the conversation. For example, in one embodiment, a goal of the interaction between the agent and the customer may be to schedule a follow-up meeting with a representative. Accordingly, a screen showing a calendar may be presented to the customer and the customer could select an appointment time. Meanwhile, as the calendar is displayed to the customer, the agent may be receiving status updates with regard to the customer's progress. In another embodiment, a goal of the interaction between the agent and the customer may be to sign the customer up for a mailing list. Accordingly, a screen prompting the customer for a mailing address or email address, for example, may be presented to the customer and the customer could complete a form with personal information. Meanwhile, as the form is displayed to the customer, the agent could be receiving status updates with regard to the customer's progress. Thus, various \u201cgoal\u201d screen, such as payment screens, calendar screens, personal information screens, for example, may be provided to the customer in various embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["1","7","100","102","1","104","104","1","106","107","107","106","106","107","10"]},"The information from the form  may be parsed and analyzed by the call center's computer system. In various embodiments, the call center may place a call to the customer. Upon answering, the customer will be requested to enter their access code via the customer's telephone device. In various embodiments, while the customer is answering the call and entering the access code, the call center computer system may route the call center's end of the call to an available agent. A telephony-based connection may then be established between the customer and the agent using any suitable technique. The call center may monitor the availability of the agents based on their login status as described above.","Once the call is connected between the agent and the customer, the agent's computer may connect to the customer's browser via a data network , as described in more detail below. At time point , the agent may view on their screen(s) a variety of information, such as a customer information block , a content block , and a script block . As is to be appreciated, the content of the agent's screen may differ for varying applications. The customer information block  may contain information regarding the customer with whom the agent is connected, such as name and address. The information displayed in the customer information block  may be gleaned from an online form the agent completed, and\/or data gathered from other data mining sources, for example. In some embodiments, the agent may further populate the information block  with newly acquired information. In other embodiments, the newly gathered information about the customer may be entered in other formats, such as in a \u201cnotes\u201d portion of the agent's screen. The content block  may be web-based content \u201cA\u201d describing a service or a product, for example. The script block  may be a script that that is associated with the content in the content block . Once the association is made between the agent's computer and the customer's computer via the network , and after the content has been transmitted to the customer's screen from the agent's computer, the customer may view agent-specified content  on their screen. The agent-specified content  may be substantially similar to the content block . The agent-specified content  may be displayed as a web-page or part of a web-page. The agent-specified content  may include text, hyperlinks, forms, a portable document format (PDF) file, graphics, multi-media content, video, audio, Flash, XML, or any other types of content that may be delivered to the customer's screen via the network .","Based on the conversation between the agent and the customer, the agent can decide to change the agent-specified  content being displayed to the customer. The agent-specified  content on the screen may be changed by the agent for new content, or the existing page can be appended with extra information. In some embodiments, the agent may have access to a wide variety of content that can be served to the customer throughout the session. The particular order of the content is not necessarily established before the call, as the agent may have the flexibility to pick and choose the content to serve to the customer based on the ongoing conversation between the agent and the customer. At time point , the agent may decide to change the display of the customer's screen. As illustrated, the content in the content block  is changed to \u201cB\u201d content and the script block  is changed to include other information about the \u201cB\u201d content. Once the customer's browser determines that new information should be displayed (discussed in more detail below), the \u201cB\u201d content is displayed on the customer's screen  as agent-specified content  at time point \u2032. As illustrated by time points -\u2032, the agent may display a variety of content on the customer's screen , such as \u201cC\u201d content, \u201cB\u201d content, and \u201cD\u201d content. The order of the content delivery and the duration of time spent displaying the various content may be variable and determined by the agent, for example.","The \u201cD\u201d content displayed in the agent-specified content  on the customer's screen  may contain a payment link . The payment link  may be a hyperlink that the customer can selectively activate using an input device, such as a mouse or a touch screen interface. Once the payment link  has been activated, an online payment screen  may be displayed on the customer's screen . The online payment screen  may be a form in which the customer enters credit card information, banking account information, or other types of personal or secured payment information. While the online payment screen  is displayed on the customer's screen , a payment status screen  may be displayed on the agent's screen . The agent cannot view the actual payment information being supplied by the customer; instead, the agent is provided with an ongoing status of the payment process. For example, the payment status screen  may display a status indicator providing that a credit card number has been accepted or a credit card number has been rejected, for example, without showing the credit card information to the agent. Since the customer and agent are telephonically connected, the agent may verbally assist the customer through the payment process if necessary. As is to be appreciated, however, the present disclosure is not limited to embodiments utilizing a telephony-based connection. For instance, the computer devices of the parties involved in the presentation may be associated through a server connection, but the parties may not be concurrently telephonically connected. Also, other type of coincident communication may be used, such as radio broadcasts, podcasts, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["300","302","304","306","308","310","312","314","316","316","318"]},"The administrators may be connected to the agents through data network connections, such as a WAN, LAN, or other type of network.

Such software may be stored on any type of suitable computer-readable medium or media such as, for example, a magnetic or optical storage medium. Thus, the operation and behavior of the embodiments are described without specific reference to the actual software code or specialized hardware components. The absence of such specific references is feasible because it is clearly understood that artisans of ordinary skill would be able to design software and control hardware to implement the embodiments of the present invention based on the description herein with only a reasonable effort and without undue experimentation.","Various embodiments of the systems and methods described herein may employ one or more electronic computer networks to promote communication among different components, to transfer data, or to share resources and information. Such computer networks can be classified according to the hardware and software technology that is used to interconnect the devices in the network, such as optical fiber, Ethernet, wireless LAN, HomePNA, power line communication or G.hn. The computer networks may also be embodied as one or more of the following types of networks: local area network (LAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), wide area network (WAN), virtual private network (VPN), storage area network (SAN), or global area network (GAN), among other network varieties.","For example, a WAN computer network may cover a broad area by linking communications across metropolitan, regional, or national boundaries. The network may use routers and\/or public communication links. One type of data communication network may cover a relatively broad geographic area (e.g., city-to-city or country-to-country) which uses transmission facilities provided by common carriers, such as telephone service providers. In another example, a GAN computer network may support mobile communications across multiple wireless LANs or satellite networks. In another example, a VPN computer network may include links between nodes carried by open connections or virtual circuits in another network (e.g., the Internet) instead of by physical wires. The link-layer protocols of the VPN can be tunneled through the other network. One VPN application can promote secure communications through the Internet. The VPN can also be used to separately and securely conduct the traffic of different user communities over an underlying network. The VPN may provide users with the virtual experience of accessing the network through an IP address location other than the actual IP address which connects the access device to the network.","The computer network may be characterized based on functional relationships among the elements or components of the network, such as active networking, client-server, or peer-to-peer functional architecture. The computer network may be classified according to network topology, such as bus network, star network, ring network, mesh network, star-bus network, or hierarchical topology network, for example. The computer network may also be classified based on the method employed for data communication, such as digital and analog networks.","Embodiments of the methods and systems described herein may employ internetworking for connecting two or more distinct electronic computer networks or network segments through a common routing technology. The type of internetwork employed may depend on administration and\/or participation in the internetwork. Non-limiting examples of internetworks include intranet, extranet, and Internet. Intranets and extranets may or may not have connections to the Internet. If connected to the Internet, the intranet or extranet may be protected with appropriate authentication technology or other security measures. As applied herein, an intranet can be a group of networks which employ Internet Protocol, web browsers and\/or file transfer applications, under common control by an administrative entity. Such an administrative entity could restrict access to the intranet to only authorized users, for example, or another internal network of an organization or commercial entity. As applied herein, an extranet may include a network or internetwork generally limited to a primary organization or entity, but which also has limited connections to the networks of one or more other trusted organizations or entities (e.g., customers of an entity may be given access an intranet of the entity thereby creating an extranet).","Computer networks may include hardware elements to interconnect network nodes, such as network interface cards (NICs) or Ethernet cards, repeaters, bridges, hubs, switches, routers, and other like components. Such elements may be physically wired for communication and\/or data connections may be provided with microwave links (e.g., IEEE 802.12) or fiber optics, for example. A network card, network adapter or NIC can be designed to allow computers to communicate over the computer network by providing physical access to a network and an addressing system through the use of MAC addresses, for example. A repeater can be embodied as an electronic device that receives and retransmits a communicated signal at a boosted power level to allow the signal to cover a telecommunication distance with reduced degradation. A network bridge can be configured to connect multiple network segments at the data link layer of a computer network while learning which addresses can be reached through which specific ports of the network. In the network, the bridge may associate a port with an address and then send traffic for that address only to that port. In various embodiments, local bridges may be employed to directly connect local area networks (LANs); remote bridges can be used to create a wide area network (WAN) link between LANs; and\/or, wireless bridges can be used to connect LANs and\/or to connect remote stations to LANs.","In various embodiments, a hub may be employed which contains multiple ports. For example, when a data packet arrives at one port of a hub, the packet can be copied unmodified to all ports of the hub for transmission. A network switch or other devices that forward and filter OSI layer 2 datagrams between ports based on MAC addresses in data packets can also be used. A switch can possess multiple ports, such that most of the network is connected directly to the switch, or another switch that is in turn connected to a switch. The term \u201cswitch\u201d can also include routers and bridges, as well as other devices that distribute data traffic by application content (e.g., a Web URL identifier). Switches may operate at one or more OSI model layers, including physical, data link, network, or transport (i.e., end-to-end). A device that operates simultaneously at more than one of these layers can be considered a multilayer switch. In certain embodiments, routers or other like networking devices may be used to forward data packets between networks using headers and forwarding tables to determine an optimum path through which to transmit the packets.","As employed herein, an application server may be a server that hosts an API to expose business logic and business processes for use by other applications. Examples of application servers include J2EE or Java EE 5 application servers including WebSphere Application Server. Other examples include WebSphere Application Server Community Edition (IBM), Sybase Enterprise Application Server (Sybase Inc), WebLogic Server (BEA), JBoss (Red Hat), JRun (Adobe Systems), Apache Geronimo (Apache Software Foundation), Oracle OC4J (Oracle Corporation), Sun Java System Application Server (Sun Microsystems), and SAP Netweaver AS (ABAP\/Java). Also, application servers may be provided in accordance with the .NET framework, including the Windows Communication Foundation, .NET Remoting, ADO.NET, and ASP.NET among several other components. For example, a Java Server Page (JSP) is a servlet that executes in a web container which is functionally equivalent to CGI scripts. JSPs can be used to create HTML pages by embedding references to the server logic within the page. The application servers may mainly serve web-based applications, while other servers can perform as session initiation protocol servers, for instance, or work with telephony networks. Specifications for enterprise application integration and service-oriented architecture can be designed to connect many different computer network elements. Such specifications include Business Application Programming Interface, Web Services Interoperability, and Java EE Connector Architecture.","In various embodiments, computers and computer systems described herein may have the following main components: arithmetic and logic unit (ALU), control unit, memory, and input and output devices (I\/O devices). These components can be interconnected by busses, often comprising groups of wires or cables. The control unit, ALU, registers, and basic I\/O (and often other hardware closely linked with these sections) can be collectively considered a central processing unit (CPU) for the computer system. The CPU may be constructed on a single integrated circuit or microprocessor.","The control unit (control system or central controller) directs the various components of a computer system. The control system decodes each instruction in a computer program and turns it into a series of control signals that operate other components of the computer system. To enhance performance or efficiency of operation, the control system may alter the order of instructions. One component of the control unit is the program counter, a memory register that tracks the location in memory from which the next instruction is to be read.","The ALU is capable of performing arithmetic and logic operations. The set of arithmetic operations that a particular ALU supports may be limited to adding and subtracting or might include multiplying or dividing, trigonometry functions (sine, cosine, etc.) and square roots. Some may be programmed to operate on whole numbers (integers), while others use floating point to represent real numbers, for example. An ALU may also compare numbers and return Boolean truth values (e.g., true or false). Superscalar computers may contain multiple ALUs to facilitate processing multiple instructions at the same time. For example, graphics processors and computers with SIMD and MIMD features often possess ALUs that can perform arithmetic operations on vectors and matrices. Certain computer systems may include one or more RAM cache memories configured to move more frequently needed data into the cache automatically.","Examples of peripherals that may be used in connection with certain embodiments of the invention include input\/output devices such as keyboards, mice, screen displays, monitors, printers, hard disk drives, floppy disk drives, joysticks, and image scanners.","Embodiments of the methods and systems described herein may divide functions between separate CPUs, creating a multiprocessing configuration. For example, multiprocessor and multi-core (multiple CPUs on a single integrated circuit) computer systems with co-processing capabilities may be employed. Also, multitasking may be employed as a computer processing technique to handle simultaneous execution of multiple computer programs.","In various embodiments, the systems and methods described herein may be configured and\/or programmed to include one or more of the above-described electronic, computer-based elements and components. In addition, these elements and components may be particularly configured to execute the various rules, algorithms, programs, processes, and method steps described herein.","While various embodiments of the invention have been described herein, it should be apparent, however, that various modifications, alterations and adaptations to those embodiments may occur to persons skilled in the art with the attainment of some or all of the advantages of the present invention. The disclosed embodiments are therefore intended to include all such modifications, alterations and adaptations without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention as set forth in the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"FIGURES","p":["Various embodiments of the present invention are described herein by way of example in conjunction with the following figures wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 12"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
