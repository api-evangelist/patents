Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a sheet member, a forming method of the sheet member, and an exhaust gas treatment apparatus using such a sheet member as its holding and sealing member and\/or its heat insulating member. Further, the present invention relates to a muffling apparatus having such a sheet member as a sound absorber.","2. Description of the Related Art","The number of vehicles has been dramatically increased from the beginning of this century, thereby steadily and rapidly increasing the amount of exhaust gas exhausted from the internal combustion engines of the vehicles. Particularly, various materials included in the exhaust gas exhausted from diesel engines are responsible for causing contamination, thereby seriously damaging the world-wide environment.","Under such circumstances, various exhaust gas treatment apparatuses have been conventionally proposed and put into practice. In a typical exhaust gas treatment apparatus, there is a casing made of, for example, metal in the middle of an exhaust gas tube connected to an exhaust gas manifold of an engine, and there is an exhaust gas treatment member in the casing. The exhaust gas treatment member has many cells each extending in the longitudinal direction and separated from each other by cell walls. As examples of the exhaust gas treatment member, there are an exhaust gas filter such as a catalyst carrier and a Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF). In such DPFs, one end surface of each cell is sealed to form a checkered pattern and the particulates in exhaust gas can be removed by being trapped on the cell walls before the exhaust gas is exhausted from the exhaust gas treatment member. The typical materials of the exhaust gas treatment member include ceramics in addition to metals and alloys. As a typical example of the exhaust gas treatment member, cordierite honeycomb filter is known. Recently, porous sintered silicon carbide has started to be used as a material of the exhaust gas treatment members from the viewpoint of its properties of thermal insulation, mechanical strength, and chemical stability.","Generally, a holding and sealing member is displaced between such an exhaust gas treatment member and a casing. The holding and sealing member is used to avoid the contact between the exhaust gas treatment member and the casing so as to avoid damage while the vehicle is being operated and also avoid leakage of untreated exhaust gas through the gaps between the casing and the exhaust gas treatment member. Further, the holding and sealing member has a role to avoid the displacement of the exhaust gas treatment member due to the pressure of the exhaust gas. Still further, the holding and sealing member is required to be kept at high temperature to sustain the reactivity, and to have thermal insulation efficiency. As a member meeting the above requirements, there is a sheet member made of inorganic fibers such as alumina-based fibers.","The sheet member is twisted around at least one part on the outer surface excepting an opening surface of the exhaust gas treatment member. For example, one end of the sheet member is engaged with the other end of the sheet member, and the sheet member is integrated with the exhaust treatment member by, for example, taping, so as to be used. After the processes, the integrated parts are housed inside the casing to form the exhaust gas treatment apparatus.","On the other hand, the inorganic fibers included in such a sheet member typically have various fiber diameters including extremely small diameters. Such fine fibers are apt to be scattered in all directions when being handled, so it is difficult to handle such fibers and, therefore, it is not good for the working environment and human health. For example, according to a report, inorganic fibers having a diameter of 3 micrometers or less are not good for human health. Because of the feature, inorganic fibers may be subject to control in some areas (For example, Germany Technical Guideline TRGS905). The contents of Germany Technical Guideline TRGS905 are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","To solve the problem, there is disclosed a sheet member that does not include inorganic fibers having a diameter of 3 micrometers or less (see Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2005-120560).","The contents of Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2005-120560 are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a sheet member having inorganic fibers, including a first outer layer; a center layer; and a second outer layer.

The first and the second outer layers include inorganic fibers having diameters greater than approximately 3 micrometers.","In the sheet member according to an embodiment of the present invention, the scattering of inorganic fibers is controlled, the handling of the sheet member becomes easier, and the working environment is improved.","According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided another sheet member including inorganic fibers. The sheet member includes first and second outer layers and a center layer.

The covering layer does not cover the sides of the two outermost layers.","In this case, especially, the covering layer may be disposed so as to cover the entire side surfaces of the center layer.","Further, the covering layer may be substantially the same as the first outer layer or the second outer layer.","Still further, the sheet member may further include binder.","Still further, the sheet member may further include an adhesive layer disposed between the first or the second outer layer and the center layer.","According to still another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of forming a sheet member including inorganic fibers, the method.

Further, when such a sheet member is used as a sound absorber of a muffling apparatus, it is possible to control the reduction of the surface pressure between the inner pipe and the outer shell.","Therefore, according to an embodiment of the present invention, there are provided an exhaust gas treatment apparatus using the sheet member as a holding and sealing member and\/or heat insulating member, a forming method of the exhaust gas treatment apparatus, and a muffling apparatus using the sheet member as a sound absorber.","The embodiments will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate corresponding or identical elements throughout the various drawings.","(First Embodiment)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"]},"When a sheet member  according to an embodiment of the present invention is twisted around an exhaust gas treatment member  such as a catalyst carrier to be used as a holding and sealing member  of an exhaust gas treatment apparatus, as shown in , an engagement convex part  and an engagement concave part  are provided on end faces  and , respectively, perpendicular to the twisting direction (X direction) of the sheet member . When the sheet member  is twisted around the exhaust gas treatment member , as shown in , the engagement convex part  and the engagement concave part  engage each other so as to fix the sheet member  in place around the exhaust gas treatment member . Then, the exhaust gas treatment member  with the sheet member  twisted around is pressed into a cylinder-shaped casing made of, for example, metal by, for example, a press-fit method to produce an exhaust gas treatment apparatus .","The sheet member  according to an embodiment of the present invention is made of mainly inorganic fibers, but may further include binder as described below.","A sheet member  according to an embodiment of the present invention includes at least three layers: a first outer layer , a center layer , and a second outer layer . The first outer layer , the center layer , and the second outer layer  are laminated to each other such that the first outer layer  and the second outer layer  are the outermost surfaces. For example, in , the sheet member  is configured such that the first outer layer , the center layer , and the second outer layer  are laminated in this order.","The center layer  is a sheet including inorganic fibers having diameters of approximately 3 micrometers or less (hereinafter referred to as \u201cfine fibers\u201d), or is, for example, a sheet member including inorganic fibers conventionally used as a holding and sealing member of an exhaust gas treatment apparatus. In contrast, the first outer layer  and the second outer layer  include the inorganic fibers except the \u201cfine fibers\u201d.","When such a sheet member having a three-layer structure is being handled, the \u201cfine fibers\u201d included in the center layer  are unable to move freely due to the first and the second outer layers  and , respectively provided on upper- and lower-most surfaces of the sheet member. Because of this structure, the scattering of the \u201cfine fibers\u201d from the sheet member is reduced, thereby improving the handling of the sheet member and the working environment while the sheet member is being handled. Accordingly, the embodiment of the present invention may provide a sheet member with ease of operation.","Generally, when a sheet member including fibers having only larger diameters is used as a holding and sealing member in an exhaust gas treatment apparatus, many fibers included in the sheet member may be broken and damaged, thereby disadvantageously reducing the repulsive power against an external compression stress and the holding power to hold the exhaust gas treatment member while the sheet member is being handled (that is, being twisted around an exhaust gas treatment member or put into a casing) or the exhaust gas treatment apparatus is being used. However, a sheet member according to an embodiment of the present invention includes the \u201cfine fibers\u201d capable of improving the holding power. Thus, when the sheet member is used as a holding and sealing member in an exhaust gas treatment apparatus, unlike the case where a sheet member that does not include the \u201cfine fibers\u201d is used, the reduction of the holding power to hold the exhaust gas treatment member can be attenuated, and an appropriate holding power to hold the exhaust gas treatment member can be thus maintained.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the upper limit of a weight ratio \u201cW\u201d of the total weight of the first and the second outer layers with respect to the total weight of the entire sheet member is not limited to, but preferably equal to or less than approximately 50 wt %, and more preferably equal to or less than approximately 20 wt %. On the other hand, the lower limit of \u201cW\u201d should be any value more than zero, theoretically. However, as long as the \u201cW\u201d is not extremely small, fine fibers included in the center layer  may not be scattered outside through the first outer layer  and\/or the second outer layer . Therefore, from a practical point of view, the lower limit of \u201cW\u201d is preferably equal to or more than approximately 2 wt %. Further, it should be noted that the weight of the first layer may be substantially the same as or may be different from the weight of the second layer. For example, the weight ratio of the first outer layer  to the second outer layer  may be in the range between approximately 1:9 and approximately 9:1.","Further, a thickness ratio \u201ct\u201d of the total thicknesses of the first and the second outer layers with respect to the total thickness of the entire sheet member is, for example, but not limited to, approximately 0<t\u2266 approximately 70%, preferably approximately 0<t\u2266 approximately 50%, and more preferably approximately 0<t\u2266 approximately 20%. Still further, the total thickness of the entire sheet member when the sheet member is placed on a horizontal surface in a stationary status is, for example, in a range between approximately 5 mm and approximately 20 mm. Further, it should be noted that the thickness of the first layer may be substantially the same as or may be different from the thickness of the second layer. For example, the height ratio of the first outer layer  to the second outer layer  may be in the range between approximately 1:9 and approximately 9:1.","However, when the thickness ratio \u201ct\u201d becomes extremely small, some fine fibers included in the center layer  may be scattered outside through the first outer layer  and\/or the second outer layer . Therefore, from a practical point of view, the lower limit of \u201cW\u201d is preferably equal to or more than approximately 1%.","Further, the first and the second outer layers having a basis weight of, for example, but not limited to, from approximately 60 g\/mto approximately 1,500 g\/mare typically used. The center layer having the basis weight of, for example, but not limited to, from approximately 500 g\/mto approximately 3,000 g\/mis typically used. Here, the basis weight refers to the total weight of the fibers included in a unit area of the sheet member. However, when binder is included in the sheet member, the basis weight refers to the total weight of the binder and the fibers included in a unit area. Also, each layer having a bulk density of, for example, but not limited to, from approximately 0.07 g\/cmto approximately 0.30 g\/cmare typically used.","According to the embodiment of the present invention, in general, a sheet member having a bulk density of, for example, but not limited to, from approximately 0.07 g\/cmto approximately 0.30 g\/cmand having a basis weight of, for example, but not limited to, from approximately 500 g\/mto approximately 3,000 g\/m, respectively, is typically used.","It should be noted that, in the first embodiment, as for the inorganic fibers used for the first and the second outer layers, the inorganic fibers having an average diameter of, for example, but not limited to, in the range between approximately 5 micrometers and approximately 10 micrometers can be used. However, it should be arranged that that \u201cfine fibers\u201d are not included in the both outer layers. Because of this feature, in most cases, the minimum diameter of the inorganic fibers included in the first and the second outer layers is in the range between approximately 3.1 micrometers and approximately 5.0 micrometers. Further, in the present invention, the specifications (average fiber diameter, minimum fiber diameter, and forming method) of the first and the second outer layers may be substantially the same or may be different from each other.","On the other hand, the average diameter of the inorganic fibers included in the center layer is in the range between approximately 3.0 micrometers and approximately 8.0 micrometers. But the \u201cfine fibers\u201d may also be included in the center layer.","The average diameter of inorganic fibers included in each layer is measured by the following method. First, a sample of alumina-based fibers obtained from each layer is entered into a cylinder and then is crushed under a pressure of approximately 20.6 MPa. Next, the sample is put on a sieving screen to be sieved. The sample that has passed through the sieving screen is transferred to be a specimen of an electron microscope. After a material such as gold is evaporated onto the surface of the specimen, electron microscope pictures with approximately 1500 times magnification of the specimen are taken. Diameters of at least 40 fibers from the taken pictures are measured. This procedure is repeated for five separate specimens to obtain the average diameter of the inorganic fibers in the layer by averaging the measured values.","Also, the minimum diameter of the fibers included in each layer is obtained by the following method. The electron microscope pictures (approximately 1,500 times magnitude) in appropriate portions of each of the outer layers and center layer are taken. From the taken pictures (of approximately 50 fibers), the fiber having the minimum diameter is selected, and the diameter of the fiber is measured. The same operation but in different portions of each layer is repeated to take additional six pictures. The minimum diameter from among the obtained diameters is selected as the minimum fiber diameter of the layer.","Further, when a sheet member is formed by the \u201cneedling processing method\u201d described below, the density of needle traces in each layer is preferably in the range between approximately 2.0 pieces\/cmand approximately 20.0 pieces\/cm. This is because when the density of needle traces is more than approximately 2.0 pieces\/cmthe strength of the sheet member is not reduced. On the other hand, when the density of needle traces is changed in the range less than approximately 20.0 pieces\/cm, the bulk density is changed and the sheet member is hardened and the handling won't be more difficult.","In the present application, \u201cneedle traces\u201d refer to the fiber confounding traces having a maximum size equal to or less than approximately 3 mmgenerated on the sheet member when fiber confounding units such as needles are thrust into and pulled out of the sheet member formed by the \u201cneedling processing method\u201d.","As described above, the sheet member  according to the embodiment of the present invention is twisted around the outer surface of the exhaust gas treatment member  and is used after the ends of the sheet member  are engaged with each other and fixed in place with a tape. The exhaust gas treatment member  covered by the sheet member  is then pressed into the casing  to form an exhaust gas treatment apparatus .","(Second Embodiment)","Next, a configuration of another sheet member (a second sheet member) according to an embodiment of the present invention is described.","Like a sheet member  shown in , the second sheet member includes the first outer layer, the center layer, and the second outer layer, those layers laminated in this order. However, in the second sheet, a value \u201cA\u201d, calculated by the following formula (1), of the inorganic fibers included in the first and the second outer layers is greater than approximately 6 micrometers.\n\n=(\u22122)\u2003\u2003(1)\n","Where, a reference symbol \u201cM\u201d represents an average diameter of the inorganic fibers included in the outer layers. A reference symbol \u201ce\u201d represents a standard error given by the following formula\n\n=(\u03c3\u00f7\u221a{square root over ()})\u2003\u2003(2)\n","Where, reference symbols \u201c\u03c3\u201d and \u201cn\u201d represent the standard deviation and the number of measurements, respectively.","According to EU directive 97\/69\/EC, effective on 5 Dec. 1997, the regulations for the health and safety aspects of glass fibers in Europe (hereinafter referred to as \u201cEU directive\u201d), the inorganic fibers whose value \u201cA\u201d in the formula (1) exceeds approximately 6 micrometers are classified as so-called \u201cNote-R\u201d and are not subject to control.","Therefore, in the sheet member having the above-mentioned first and the second outer layers (the second sheet member), even when the inorganic fibers are scattered from the first and the second outer layers, the inorganic fibers are unlikely to harm the human body. Further, as described above, since the first and the second outer layers are provided on both surface sides of the sheet member, the scattering of the \u201cfine fibers\u201d from the center layer is significantly controlled when being handled. As a result, in such a sheet member, as described above, the handling of the sheet member becomes easier and the working environment is improved. Further, since the sheet member includes the \u201cfine fibers\u201d contributing the improvement of the holding power, it is possible to minimize the reduction of the holding power as much as possible.","It should be noted that only when the relationship A>approximately 6 micrometers is satisfied, the average diameters of the first and the second outer layer are not limited. As a result, unlike the first embodiment, it should be noted that both the first and the second outer layers may include some amount of \u201cfine fibers\u201d. On the other hand, in the center layer, similar to the first embodiment, the \u201cfine fibers\u201d are included and the average diameter of the inorganic fibers is preferably in the range between approximately 3.0 micrometers and approximately 8.0 micrometers.","(Third Embodiment)","In the sheet member according to the first and the second embodiments of the present invention, the minimum diameter of the inorganic fibers in the first and the second outer layers exceeds approximately 3.0 micrometers and the inorganic fibers whose value \u201cA\u201d in the formula (1) exceeds approximately 6 micrometers are included in the first and the second outer layers. On the other hand, in a sheet member according to the third embodiment of the present invention (a third sheet member), \u201cbio-soluble inorganic fibers\u201d are included in the first outer layer and\/or the second outer layer.","The \u201cbio-soluble inorganic fibers\u201d generically refers to the inorganic fibers that satisfy so-called \u201cNote-Q\u201d requirements and that are not subject to control as inorganic fibers based on the \u201cEU directive\u201d. It should be noted that according to the \u201cNote-Q\u201d standards of the \u201cEU directive\u201d, the inorganic fibers fulfilling one of the following conditions is not classified as a control subject:\n\n","Even when such \u201cbio-soluble inorganic fibers\u201d are taken into a human body, since the \u201cbio-soluble inorganic fibers\u201d are dissolved in the human body and have little impact on the human body, the \u201cbio-soluble inorganic fibers\u201d are safe. Therefore, when the \u201cbio-soluble inorganic fibers\u201d are included in the first or the second outer layer of the sheet member, the inorganic fibers scattered from the layer have little impact on the human body. Further, the scattering of the \u201cfine fibers\u201d included in the center layer in the middle of the sheet member is controlled. As a result, when the third sheet member is used, it is possible that the handling of the sheet member becomes easier and the working environment is significantly improved.","(Fourth Embodiment)","In the aforementioned three embodiments, the first and the second outer sheets  and  are disposed one on each of the \u201cmain surfaces\u201d of the center layer  to configure the sheet member of the embodiment of the present invention. However, the sheet member according to an embodiment of the present invention is not limited to such configuration.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0091"},"figref":["FIGS. 3 and 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["30","31","82","84","86","31","30","31","88","40","31"]},"In the sheet member  including the covering layer , the center layer  is not exposed on the side surface  of the sheet member . Because of this structure, when, for example, the sheet member  is being handled, it is possible to control the scattering of the \u201cfine fibers\u201d outside from the sheet member l. Therefore, it is possible to further control the scattering of the \u201cfine fibers\u201d outside from the sheet member .","In , the covering layer  is provided so as to cover the entire side surface  of the sheet member . However, it should be noted that the covering layer  may be disposed so as to cover only a part of the side surface . In this case, the effect to control the scattering of the \u201cfine fibers\u201d is reduced compared with the sheet member  in .

It should be noted that the configuration of the exhaust gas treatment apparatus  according to an embodiment of the present invention is not limited to this configuration.

In the following, the forming method of the sheet member  according to the first embodiment of the present invention is described.","Typically, there are two methods of forming such a sheet member  according to an embodiment of the present invention: a \u201claminating method\u201d and an \u201call-in-one forming method\u201d.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0101","num":"0104"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["30","82","86","84"]},"First, in step S, the first outer layer including no \u201cfine fibers\u201d is formed. The first outer layer is formed by, for example, the \u201cneedling processing method\u201d or a \u201cpapermaking method\u201d as described below. In the present application, it should be noted that the term \u201cneedling processing method\u201d includes any method of forming a sheet member including a needling process in which fiber confounding units such as needles are thrust into and pulled out of the sheet member. Further, in the present application, it should be noted that the term \u201cpapermaking method\u201d refers to a method of forming a sheet member including each step of opening, slurring, forming, compressing, and drying fibers.","Next, in step S, the second outer layer including no \u201cfine fibers\u201d is formed. The same as the first outer layer, the second outer layer is formed by, for example, the \u201cneedling processing method\u201d or the \u201cpapermaking method\u201d.","Next, in step S, the center layer including the \u201cfine fibers\u201d is formed. The same as the first and the second outer layers, the center layer is also formed by, for example, the \u201cneedling processing method\u201d or the \u201cpapermaking method\u201d. It should be noted that the forming methods (for example, the \u201cneedling processing method\u201d and the \u201cpapermaking method\u201d) of those three layers may be the same or may be different from each other. Also the order of the forming steps is not always necessarily the same as the order of steps S through S; for example, the center layer may be formed before the first and the second outer layers are formed.","Next, in step S, these three layers are laminated in the order of the first outer layer, the center layer, and the second outer layer, and adjacent layers are adhered to each other. As a method of adhering layers to each other, there are some methods such as using an \u201cadhesive layer\u201d, made of, for example, a double-sided adhesive tape and adhesive agent, provided at the boundary surface between the first\/second outer layer and the center layer to adhere the layers to each other through the generated \u201cadhesive layer\u201d or sewing adjoining layers through the boundary surface. As the former method using the \u201cadhesive layer\u201d, besides the method adhering the adjoining layers to each other through the \u201cadhesive layer\u201d, there is another method in which thermally reversible films (such as a PE film and Warifu (Registered Trademark)) are thermally adhered to both sides of the center layer and the facing sides of the outer layers at a temperature of approximately 140\u00b0 C. and, for example, a double-sided adhesive tape or adhesive agent is applied to one of the facing films so as to adhere those three layers to each other. As the adhesive agent, acrylic-based adhesive agent, acrylate-based Latex or the like may be used. The thickness of the double-sided adhesive tape, the adhesive agent, and the thermally reversible film is, for example, but not limited to, in the range between approximately 0.02 mm and approximately 0.60 mm.","In the present application, the \u201cadhesive layer\u201d refers to a layer provided at the boundary surface so as to join the center layer and two outer layers, including the above-mentioned thermally reversible film when it is used. Therefore, when the thermally reversible film is used, the thickness of one \u201cadhesive layer\u201d is determined by the quotation of (Thickness of thermally reversible film)*2+(Thickness of both-sided adhesive tape (or adhesive agent)). Thickness of the \u201cadhesive layer\u201d is, for example, in the range between approximately 0.02 mm and approximately 0.60 mm.","In the \u201claminating method\u201d, a sheet member according to an embodiment of the present invention is formed through the steps described above.","In a typical \u201call-in-one forming method\u201d, unlike the above-mentioned \u201claminating method\u201d, a sheet member having a three-layer structure is formed through a sequence of processing steps. In the \u201call-in-one forming method\u201d, a sheet member is also formed by either the \u201cneedling processing method\u201d or the \u201cpapermaking method\u201d. However, in the \u201call-in-one forming method\u201d, since it is not necessary to prepare each layer independently and a single forming machine can be used, it is advantageous that the forming process can be simplified.","In the following, examples of forming a sheet member according to the embodiments of the present invention are described in detail based on the \u201claminating method\u201d and the \u201call-in-one forming method\u201d. In the following, a sheet member including a mixture of alumina and silica as inorganic fibers is described as examples. It should be noted that the inorganic fibers are not limited to this mixture but may include only either alumina or silica. Any other type of inorganic fibers may be used.","(Laminating Method 1)","As described above, in this laminating method, it is necessary to prepare each layer separately. Each layer is formed by the \u201cneedling processing method\u201d through each process of preparing spinning solution, blowing, needling, calcining, and impregnating binder.","(Preparing Process of Spinning Solution)","Silica sol is added to basic aluminum chloride aqueous solution with aluminum content 70 g\/l and Al\/Cl=approximately 1.8 (atom ratio) such that the composing ratio of alumina and silica is approximately 60-97: approximately 40-3 to prepare the precursor of inorganic fibers. More preferably, the composing ratio of alumina and silica is approximately 70-97: approximately 30-3. This is because, when the composing ratio of alumina is equal to or less than approximately 60%, the composing ratio of mullite prepared from alumina and silica is lowered, and the heat conductivity of each formed layer is increased. As a result, the thermal insulating properties of each layer is apt to be reduced. On the other hand, when the composing ratio of alumina exceeds approximately 97%, the flexibility of the inorganic fibers is lowered.","Next, organic polymer such as polyvinyl alcohol is added to the precursor of the alumina-based fibers. Then the liquid is condensed to prepare a spinning solution.","(Blowing Process)","Next, fibers are formed by a blowing process using the obtained spinning solution. The blowing process refers to a method of forming fibers using a carrier flow blown through a carrier nozzle and a spinning solution flow pushed out through a spinning solution supply nozzle. In this process, the average diameter and the minimum diameters of alumina fiber precursor is controlled by adjusting the flow rate of the carrier gas (air) and the supplying rate of the spinning solution. Therefore, in this process, the average diameter and the minimum diameters of the inorganic fibers included in the formed outer layers and center layer is determined.","Typically, the diameter of the spinning solution supply nozzle is in the range between approximately 0.1 mm and approximately 0.5 mm. When the outer layers are formed, the typical air flow rate of the flow through the carrier nozzle is in the range between approximately 30 m\/s and approximately 150 m\/s, and the typical supplying rate of the spinning solution through the spinning solution supply nozzle is in the range between approximately 1 ml\/h and approximately 120 ml\/h. On the other hand, when the center layer is formed, the typical air flow rate of the flow through the carrier nozzle is in the range between approximately 40 m\/s and approximately 200 m\/s, and typical supplying rate of the spinning solution through the spinning solution supply nozzle is in the range between approximately 1 ml\/h and approximately 60 ml\/h.","Next, a raw sheet is formed by laminating the precursors in which the fibers have been formed.","(Needling Process)","Next, a needling process is performed on the raw sheet. In the needling process, a needling device is typically used.","Generally, the needling device includes a needle board reciprocally movable in the thrusting direction (typically in the up-and-down direction) and a pair of supporting boards provided on both sides facing the front face and the rear face of the raw sheet. On the needle board, there are plenty of needles arranged in a density of, for example, 5 to 5,000 needles per 100 cmto thrust into the raw sheet. In each supporting board, there are plenty of through holes. Therefore, while the raw sheet is held down from both sides by a pair of the supporting boards, by bringing the needle board close to the raw sheet and separating the needle board away from the raw sheet, the needles are thrust into and pulled out of the raw sheet to form a raw sheet in which fibers are confounded. In this process, the needling device may include a conveying unit conveying the raw sheet at a constant speed (for example, approximately 20 mm\/s) in the predetermined direction (for example, substantially parallel to the front and rear surfaces of the raw sheet). In this case, since it is possible to perform the needling process while the raw sheet is being moved with a constant speed, it is no longer necessary to move the raw sheet manually every time after the needle board presses and contacts the raw sheet.","As another configuration, the needling device may include a pair of needle boards as a set. Each needle board has its corresponding supporting board. Two needle boards are provided on both the front and the rear sides of the raw sheet, and the raw sheet is held down from both sides by the supporting boards. The needles on the needle boards are arranged so that the positions of the needles on one needle board are not overlapped with the positions of the needles on the other needle board. Further, there are so many through holes provided in each of the supporting boards in consideration of the positions of needles on both needle boards so that no needle should contact the supporting boards when the needling process is performed on both surfaces of the raw sheet. With such a device, the raw sheet may be held down from both surfaces by using the two supporting boards and the needling process is performed on the raw sheet from both surfaces by using a pair of needle boards. When needles are thrust by such a method, the outer and center layers each having a high density of needle traces can be formed easily.","(Calcining Process)","Next, thus obtained raw sheet is heated from room temperature to approximately 1,250\u00b0 C. and the temperature is maintained for approximately 0.5 to approximately 2 hours for continuous calcination to prepare the outer and center layers for the sheet member.","(Impregnating and Adding Binder Process)","When necessary, binder impregnating and adding process may be further performed to impregnate the outer and center layers with binder such as organic resin. By performing this process, a bulk height of the outer and center layers can be reduced and the separation of fibers from a completed sheet member can be further reduced. However, the binder impregnating and adding process is not always necessarily performed in this step. For example, the binder impregnating and adding process may be performed after the center layer is joined to the two outer layers (that is, after the sheet member is formed).","In the impregnating and adding process, the adding amount of the binder is preferably in the range between approximately 1.0 wt % and approximately 10.0 wt %. When it is more than approximately 1.0 wt %, the separation-prevention effect of inorganic fibers is not reduced. On the other hand, when it is less than approximately 10.0 wt %, the amount of organic component (decomposed gas of the binder) exhausted is not increased while the exhaust gas treatment apparatus is being operated.","As binder, organic binder such as epoxy resin, acrylate resin, rubber-based resin, and styrene-based resin may be used. Also, for example, acrylic rubber (ACM), acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR), and styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) resin may be used.","The outer and center layers are impregnated with the binder by spray coating using the aqueous dispersion prepared by adding water to the binder. By this process, extra solid content and liquid added into the outer and center layers can be removed as described below.","The extra solid content is removed by a suction method using a suction device such as a vacuum pump. Also, the extra water may be removed by heating the sheet member at a temperature between approximately 90\u00b0 C. and approximately 160\u00b0 C. and\/or by compressing the sheet member at a pressure between approximately 40 kPa and approximately 100 kPa.","Through such processes, the outer and center layers impregnated with the binder are formed.","(Joining Process of Outer and Center Layers)","Next, the outer layers are laminated onto the front and rear surfaces of the center layer to join the three layers. As described above, the methods of joining the three layers include a method using the \u201cadhesive layer\u201d and a method of sewing adjoining layers through the boundary surface. By such a method, the sheet member according to an embodiment of the present invention can be formed.","(Laminating Method 2)","In another example of the laminating method, a \u201cpapermaking method\u201d is used to manufacture each layer. In the \u201cpapermaking method\u201d, each layer is formed through the processes of opening, slurrying, forming, and compressing and drying fibers.","(Opening Fibers)","First, an opening process of inorganic fibers is preformed. The opening process is performed through a dry-type opening process alone or through two processes consisting of the dry-type opening process and a wet-type opening process. In the dry-type opening process, a device such as a Feathermill may be used to open the raw fibers. On the other hand, in the wet-type opening process, the flocculated dry-type opened fibers obtained by the above-mentioned dry-type opening process are fed into a wet-type opening device to further perform the opening process. In the wet-type opening process, a wet-type opening device such as Pulper is used. Through such an opening process, the opened raw fibers can be obtained.","(Slurrying Process)","Next, thus obtained raw fibers are fed into a stirring device and are stirred for, for example, approximately 1 to approximately 5 minutes so that the relative weight of the raw fibers to water is in the range between approximately 1 wt % and approximately 2 wt % to prepare a mixture. Next, organic binder with approximately 4 wt % to approximately 8 wt % of the raw fibers is added to the mixture and the mixture is stirred for, for example, approximately 1 to approximately 5 minutes. Further, a flocculant with approximately 0.5 wt % of the raw fibers is added to the mixture and the mixture is stirred for up to 2 minutes to prepare raw slurry.","As inorganic binder, for example, alumina sol and\/or silica gel are used. As organic binder, for example, a rubber-based material, a water-soluble organic polymer compound, thermoreversible resin, and thermohardening resin are used. As a flocculant, for example, Percol 292 (Ciba Specialty Chemicals) is used.","(Forming Process)","Next, the obtained raw slurry is fed into a forming device having a desired shape and is dehydrated. In a typical case, at the bottom of the forming device, there may be provided a filtering mesh (mesh size is, for example, 30 meshes) and, through the meshes, extra water in the raw slurry fed into the forming device is drained. Therefore, by using such a forming device, both forming the raw slurry in the desired shape and dehydrating the raw slurry can be performed at the same time. When necessary, extra water may be compulsorily sucked from the lower side of the forming device through the filtering meshes using, for example, a suction pump or a vacuum pump.","(Compressing and Drying Process)","Next, the thus obtained formed body is removed from the forming device and is compressed using a compression device so that the thickness becomes approximately 0.3 to approximately 0.5 times the thickness before this process, and is heated and dehydrated at a temperature between approximately 90\u00b0 C. and approximately 150\u00b0 C. for approximately 5 minutes to approximately 1 hour to obtain the outer layers.","The center layer can be formed by the same processes.","The binder impregnating and adding process may be performed as performed in the \u201claminating method 1\u201d using the obtained outer layer However, as described above, in a case of the \u201claminating method\u201d, such binder impregnating and adding process may be performed after the three layers are joined.","Next, after three layers are laminated, by using the above-mentioned method (using a both-sided adhesive tape, an adhesive agent, or by sewing) the layers can be joined to manufacture the sheet member according to the embodiment of the present invention.","(All-In-One Forming Method 1)","In the \u201call-in-one forming method\u201d, the \u201cneedling processing method\u201d and the \u201cpapermaking method\u201d can also be used. In the \u201call-in-one forming method 1\u201d, an \u201call-in-one forming method\u201d based on the \u201cpapermaking method\u201d is described.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0137","num":"0140"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},"In this method, a process of step S, opening and slurrying processes, is the same as in the \u201claminating method 2\u201d. But the processes in and after step S in this method are different from the processes in the above-mentioned method.","More specifically, in step S of this method, first raw slurry is fed into a forming device and is dehydrated. Then, before the raw sheet is removed (that is in half-dehydrated condition), second raw slurry is added on the dehydrated forming body (hereinafter \u201cfirst forming body\u201d) (step S). Here, it should be noted that the inorganic fibers included in the first raw slurry do not include the \u201cfine fibers\u201d, and the inorganic fibers included in the second raw slurry include the \u201cfine fibers\u201d.","Next, the extra water included in the second raw slurry is drained from the lower side of the forming device through the first forming body and the filtering meshes to dehydrate the second raw slurry to prepare the second forming body. As described above, when necessary, the water may be compulsorily sucked from the lower side of the forming device.","Next, in step S, before a \u201ctwo-layered forming body\u201d consisting of the first and the second forming bodies is removed (that is, in the half-dehydrated condition), third raw slurry is added on the \u201ctwo-layered forming body\u201d. Further, the extra water included in the third raw slurry is drained from the lower side of the forming device through the \u201ctwo-layered forming body\u201d and the filtering meshes to dehydrate the third raw slurry. As described above, when necessary, the water may be compulsorily sucked from the lower side of the forming device. Here, it should be noted that the inorganic fibers included in the third raw slurry should not include the \u201cfine fibers\u201d and the third raw slurry may be the same as or different from the first raw slurry.","Through the above series of processes, a \u201claminated formed body\u201d having a three-layer structure is obtained.","Next, in step S, the \u201claminated formed body\u201d is removed from the forming device and is compressed using, for example, a pressing device so that the thickness becomes approximately 0.3 to approximately 0.5 times the thickness before this step and is simultaneously heated and dehydrated at a temperature between, for example, approximately 90\u00b0 C. and approximately 150\u00b0 C. for approximately 5 minutes to approximately 1 hour. By this method, in a series of processes, a sheet member having a three-layer structure can be formed at one time. The above-mentioned binder impregnating and adding process may be further performed using the obtained sheet member.","In this method, the thus obtained sheet member has an advantage in that the bonding strength of the boundary surface is higher than that of the sheet member formed through a process of joining each of the layers using, for example, an adhesive agent. The reason for this is that the contacting area between the layers becomes larger since, in this method, before a layer is fully formed, the adjoining layer is laminated directly on the layer.","(All-In-One Forming Method 2)","The \u201call-in-one forming method 2\u201d is the \u201call-in-one forming method\u201d based on the \u201cneedling processing method\u201d.","In this method as well, generally, a sheet member is formed using the same processes as in the above-mentioned \u201claminating method 1\u201d. But, in this all-in-one forming method 2, in the process of preparing the spinning solution through blowing spinning, a precursor having a three-layer structure is laminated at one time to manufacture the raw sheet. Then, in the needling process, the needling process is performed on the raw sheet having the laminated three layers, thereby obtaining the raw sheet having a three-layer structure. It should be noted that, in the three-layered precursor, in the blowing spinning process, the center layer is formed so as to include the \u201cfine fibers\u201d and the outer layers are formed so as not to include the \u201cfine fibers\u201d.","The processes after the above process in this method are the same as the processes in the \u201claminating method 1\u201d. But, obviously, a process of joining each of the layers is no longer necessary in this method.","In each of above-mentioned forming methods, cases where a sheet member having a three-layer structure are described. However, it is obvious that the present invention described herein is also applicable to any case where a sheet member has more than a three-layer structure as long as the upper- and lower-most layers of the sheet member do not include the \u201cfine fibers\u201d. Such a sheet member having a multi-layered structure may be easily formed by, for example, laminating more than three layers in the \u201claminating method 1\u201d and the \u201claminating method 2\u201d or further adding fourth raw slurry to the top of the third raw slurry in the \u201call-in-one forming method 1\u201d.","In the above description, the forming method is described using the first sheet member. However, it is obvious for a person having an ordinary skill in the art that the described method is basically applicable to the second through the fourth sheet members as well.","The advantages of the embodiments of the present invention are described below with reference to the following embodiments.","To verify the advantages of the embodiment of the present invention, sheet members according to the embodiment of the present inventions are formed by the above-mentioned \u201claminating method\u201d and various tests are performed. The sheet member is formed by the following processes.","A first outer layer is formed by the \u201cneedling processing method\u201d. First, silica sol is added to basic aluminum chloride aqueous solution with aluminum content of 70 g\/l and Al\/Cl=1.8 (atom ratio) such that the relative proportion of AlO:SiOin alumina-based fibers is 72:28 to prepare the precursor of alumina-based fibers. Next, polyvinyl alcohol is added to the precursor of alumina-based fibers. Further, this liquid is condensed to prepare a spinning solution. From the spinning solution, fibers are formed by the blowing spinning process. The flow rate of the carrier gas (air) is 52 m\/s and the supplying rate of the spinning solution is 5.3 ml\/h.","Then, the precursor of the alumina-based fibers is folded and laminated to manufacture a raw sheet of alumina-based fibers.","Next, the needling process is performed to the obtained raw sheet. In the needling process, a needling board having needles at a density of 80 needles per 100 cmis provided on one side of the raw sheet and the needling is performed from the one side of the sheet member. Since the entire length of the needles is longer than the entire thickness of the sheet member, the needles can pass through the sheet member completely when the needling board presses and contacts from the one side.","Then, the obtained sheet member is heated from room temperature to 1,250\u00b0 C. and the temperature is maintained for one hour for continuous calcination. Next, the obtained first outer layer is impregnated with binder. As the binder, acrylate-based Latex Emulsion is used and the impregnation amount is 5 wt % of the total weight.","By the same method, the second outer layer is obtained. The average diameter and the minimum diameters of the alumina-based fibers included in the first and the second outer layers are 7.2 micrometers and 3.2 micrometers, respectively. The thickness and the basis weight of each layer are 0.3 mm and 60 g\/m, respectively.","By the same method, the center layer is formed.

Next, the obtained raw fibers are fed into a stirring device and stirred for approximately 1 minute such that the relative weight of the raw fibers to water is between 1 wt % and 2 wt % to prepare a mixture. Next, approximately 5 wt % of organic binder is added to the mixture and the mixture is stirred for approximately  minute. Further, approximately 0.5 wt % of inorganic binder is added to the mixture and the mixture is stirred for approximately 1 minute. Still further, approximately 0.5 wt % of a flocculant is added to the mixture and the mixture is stirred for up to approximately 2 minutes to prepare raw slurry.","As inorganic binder, alumina sol is used. As organic binder, the acrylate-based Latex is used. As a flocculant, the Percol 292 is used.","Next, the obtained raw slurry is fed into a forming device with the sizes of 800 mm\u00d7500 mm (mesh size is 30 meshes) for further dehydration.","Next, the thus obtained formed body is removed from the forming device and is compressed using a pressing device so that the thickness becomes substantially 0.5 times the thickness before this compression and is simultaneously heated and dehydrated at a temperature of 150\u00b0 C. for 5 minutes to obtain the first outer layer.","The second outer layer is also formed in the same method of forming the first outer layer. The average diameter and the minimum diameters of the alumina-based fibers included in the first and the second outer layers are 7.2 micrometers and 3.2 micrometers, respectively. The thickness and the basis weight of each layer are 0.8 mm and 120 g\/m, respectively.","Further, the center layer is also formed by the same method. In the opening process when the center layer is formed, the dry-type opening using the Fethermill is performed. The average diameter and the minimum diameters of the alumina-based fibers included in the center layer are 5.1 micrometers and 2.4 micrometers, respectively. The thickness and the basis weight of the layer are 6.4 mm and 960 g\/m, respectively.","Next, the first outer layer, the center layer, and the second outer layer are joined by using a double-sided adhesive tape (thickness 100 micrometers provided by Beiersdor) in this order to manufacture a sheet member having a three-layer structure. The weight ratio of the first outer layer:the center layer:the second outer layer (wt %) is 10:80:10. This example is called example 8.","The center layer is formed by the same method as in example 1. The basis weight and the thickness of the center layer are 1,200 g\/mand 7.4 mm, respectively. But in this comparative example, no outer layers are formed; therefore there is provided only a single layer of the center layer. This comparative example is called comparative example 1.","The first and the second outer layers are formed by the same method in example 1. The basis weight and the thickness of the first and the second outer layers are 600 g\/mand 3.7 mm, respectively. In this comparative example, no center layer is formed, and the first outer layer and the second outer layer are joined together using a both-sided adhesive tape (thickness 100 micrometers provided by Beiersdor) to manufacture the sheet member. The weight ratio of the first outer layer:the second outer layer (wt %) is 50:50. This comparative example is called comparative example 2.","Table 1 shows the basis weight, the thickness, and the weight ratio of the both outer layers and center layer, and the comparative thickness

First, the position of the crosshead  is previously lowered to the level where there should be no significant gap capable of being easily recognized between the sample  and the upper pressing member . In this position, the crosshead  is moved downward at a speed of 1 mm\/min to compress the sample . When the bulk density of the sample reaches 0.4 g\/cm, the load applied to the sample  is measured.
