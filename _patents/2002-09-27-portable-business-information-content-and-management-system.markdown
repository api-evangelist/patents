title: Portable business information content and management system
abstract: A system and method for generating business content portable across multiple software applications is described. In one embodiment, a universal object model (UOM) is employed to art as an abstraction layer between business content and the application used to create the business content. The UOM generates portable business content from objects and operations uncovered by a descriptive language such as extendable mark-up language (XML). The UOM objects and/or properties are mapped to an application object model (AOM) which is capable of extending the properties and/or operations of the original business application. The portable business content is mapped from the AOM to another application in accordance to the applications application programming interface (API). The business content created by the UOM may be configured for other applications without rewriting the business content by modifying the AOM.

The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction of the specification as filed in the Patent and Trademark Office. Otherwise, all copyright rights are reserved.","This invention relates generally to software objects that are portable across multiple applications and application versions.","The creation of business content (e.g., reports, business process, etc.) is usually closely tied to the application specific object model and application programming interface (API), thus making it extremely hard to port business content from one application to another. Usually, the business content must be rewritten for the second application.","Additionally, changes to the application, due to maintenance, customer customizations and\/or version upgrades, must be propagated to every single business component affected by the changes. Therefore, the porting of business content from different versions of the same application also often requires a rewrite\/update of every single business component.","The process of developing business content for an application usually involves defining the functional requirements of the business content and the implementation of the business content using the application's defined object model and API thus creating a strong dependency between the business content functional definition and its implementation.","Embodiments according to the invention allow the creation of business content that is portable across multiple applications as well as multiple application versions. In some embodiments, business content can be created that, in effect, is self-aware of customer implementations and\/or modifications to the core application. Additionally, some embodiments permit isolating the business content from the underlying application's changes, upgrades and\/or maintenance.","Embodiments according to the present invention also isolate the business and functional expertise, responsible for defining the functional requirements of the business content, from technical expertise, responsible for implementing the business content for the underlying application. Thus, business content that is independent from the implementation can be created.","In one embodiment, a business content management system is provided. The system comprises an object mapper coupled to receive a first business content, the first business content comprising objects from a universal object model, wherein the object mapper maps the first business content to a second business content according to first mapping rules, the second business content comprising objects from an application object model. The system also comprises an application programming interface mapper coupled to receive the second business content, wherein the application programming interface mapper maps the second business content to a third business content according to second mapping rules, the third business content comprising application specific data.","These and other embodiments of the present invention, as well as its advantages and features are described in more detail in conjunction with the text below and attached Figures.","Some embodiments according the present invention use a universal object model (UOM) that acts as an abstraction layer between the business content and an application that creates the business content (see ).","Each object (see ) from the UOM is mapped (see ) to an object of an application object model (AOM), which can extend the UOM by exposing application specific properties and\/or operations. In a similar way, the UOM can extend the AOM by forcing the mapping of properties and\/or operations required by the UOM but that do not exist in the original application.","Business content can be built using objects and operations exposed by the UOM using a descriptive language such as, for example, XML (see ), SQL, natural language (see ), etc. The natural language commands of  correspond to the XML structures of .","The business content is then mapped from the descriptive language to an AOM exposing the application specific extensions as required\/optional properties.  illustrates one example of a mapping of business content from a UOM to a SAP AOM. In this example, a business content is requesting \u201cSalesOrderNumber\u201d, \u201cDate\u201d and \u201cAmount\u201d from the \u201cSalesOrder\u201d object. When mapped to the AOM, the \u201cSalesOrder\u201d object exposes two extra properties\u2014\u201cSalesOrg\u201d and \u201cDistChannel\u201d\u2014to its definition marked as mandatory properties. When this business content is mapped to the SAP AOM, it will expose these properties as required parameters even though it wasn't part of the original business content definition.","Then, the AOM is mapped to native business content that is native to the underlying application using the application's proprietary API (see ).","In some embodiments, business content is defined by using class definitions, interfaces, etc. When the business content is to be mapped to an underlying application, these class definitions, interfaces, etc., can be extended to accommodate any application requirements. Then, these class definitions, interfaces, etc., are translated into native business content that is native to the underlying application.","Business content comprises one or more business objects from the UOM, its properties and\/or operations, combined in a manner that creates content to for a user.  is an example of a definition of a sales order object of a UOM using XML descriptive language. Examples of business content include, but are not limited to, reports and business processes. Examples of business processes include, but are not limited to, a block of sales orders from customers whose balance is above a threshold, and an alert when a customer's balance exceeds a threshold. In some embodiments, the expertise required to create business content is focused on the functional part of the business content, rather than the application-specific programming API.","The UOM can be partitioned into fields of specialization that each comprise objects pertinent to that field. For example, a \u201csales & distribution object model\u201d would comprise objects pertinent to \u201csales & distribution\u201d. In some embodiments, the different specialized object models would be interlinked, creating a network of specialized object models, thus creating the UOM. The UOM determines the vocabulary that the business content descriptive language will use in order to create business content.","The object model mapping maps between each business object represented by the UOM to its counterpart for the underlying application.  is an example of a mapping of a sales order object to an object of an AOM. As described above,  is an example of a business content mapped to an SAP AOM.","In typical mapping schemes, one data element from a first application is mapped directly to one data element of a second application. For example, an MSOutlook \u201ccontact\u201d would be mapped directly to a Palm \u201ccontact\u201d. In embodiments according to the present invention, however, the UOM acts as a hub to which data elements from different applications are mapped. The mapping from one application is performed without knowledge of other applications. For example, an MSOutlook \u201ccontact\u201d would be mapped to a UOM \u201ccontact\u201d, and a Palm \u201ccontact\u201d would be mapped to the UOM \u201ccontact\u201d as well.","The application is allowed to extend the business content object model by exposing extra functionality at this layer. By doing so, it may influence the behavior of the business content itself by allowing it to adapt to the underlying application.","An example of such extensions would be an addition of mandatory fields, which are essential to the application, but not part of the UOM. In this case, these properties would be exposed to the business object as required properties when mapped to this specific application, but would not exist when the business object is mapped to a different application that does not require these properties.","The object model mapping is closely tied to the underlying application. Therefore, when changes are made to the underlying application due to maintenance, customer customizations, version upgrades, etc., the object model mapping should be updated as well to reflect the changes. The business content, however, remains independent of the underlying application. Thus, when changes are made to the underlying application, the business content need not be updated.","Porting any business content created using the UOM to another application, can be done by rewriting the AOM mapping and does not require a rewrite of the business content itself. The business content should remain unaware of changes on the AOM.","The business content can then be mapped into native code for the Application using the Application's API.  are an example of a business content mapped into SAP native code (ABAP).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["200","202","204","206","202","208","208","208"]},"The system  also includes an API mapper  maps the AOM business content  to business content  native to an underlying application. API mapper  maps according to rules  that govern how objects, operations, etc., in the AOM are mapped to native code.","In some embodiments, object mapper  and API mapper  can be implemented in one or more application programs running on a single workstation, personal computer, etc., or can be implemented as multiple programs in a distributed computing environment, such as a workstation, personal computer or a remote terminal in a client server relationship. In , business content ,  and , and mapping rules  and  are symbolically depicted as separate databases.

Many variations of the invention will become apparent to those of skill in the art upon review of this disclosure."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIGS. 7A and 7B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 8"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
