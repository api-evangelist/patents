title: Method to generate scripts from XML
abstract: An XML document can use tags such that scripts can be generated from the documents. The scripts can be start up scripts for different operating systems. For example, the same XML document can be used to produce a UNIX shell script as well as a Windows command file.

The XML document  includes tags which are defined to indicate information so that the XML document can be used to produce server start scripts for multiple types of operating systems. Examples of XML tags and constructed script formats of one example is given below in the Script Generator Specification section. The produced server start script, such as scripts , , and , can be stored in memory.","The server start scripts can include UNIX\u00ae shell scripts , WINDOWS\u2122 command files  and other operating system scripts . A graphical user interface  can be used to produce the XML document. Details of a graphical user interface of one embodiment are described below with respect to . The graphical user interface  can be used to select the script type. WINDOWS\u2122 and UNIX\u00ae are operating systems.","The XML document  can be merged with an extension XML document to produce a merged XML document from which the script is produced. The extension XML document can include tags defined for merging XML documents. Such tags can include marker tags, append tags and replace tags.","An Application Programming Interface (API) can be used to create the scripts and\/or XML documents. The API allows users to design software that allows for the construction of the scripts and\/or XML files.","In one embodiment, the graphical interface  is used to produce an intermediate representation, such as XML document . The intermediate representation can be such that it can be used to produce server start scripts , , and  for multiple types of operating systems. The intermediate representation can be stored in memory.","The graphical user interface can allow the dragging and dropping of elements for the construction of the XML document. The graphical user interface can include selectable elements for the construction of the XML documents. The selectable elements can be selectable from a menu of the graphical user interface. The graphical user interface can allow the selection of the script for the correct operating system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A-2C","FIG. 2A"],"b":["202","204","206","206"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2C"],"b":["208","206","210","212"]},"The construction of scripts from the XML can be automated by defining the XML tag structure (i.e., e.g., the document type definition DTD or XML schema) such that the XML document is sufficient to produce each type of script desired to be produced. In the script generator specification example given below, the XML document structure is such that both a WINDOWS\u2122 command file script and a UNIX\u00ae shell script can be produced. The tags are used to identify information that can be plugged into the scripts automatically.","For example as shown below in the script generator specification example, XML for the IF-THEN statements can look as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<if>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<test type=\u201cerror|string|file|directory|variable\u201d not=\u201cfalse|true\u201d"},{"entry":"case=\u201ctrue|false -- WINDOWS ONLY\u201d>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<operand value=\u201cop1\u201d preserve=\u201ctrue|false\u201d\/>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<operand value=\u201cop2\u201d preserve=\u201ctrue|false\u201d\/>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<test\/>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<then>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003. . . execute command(s) when true . . ."},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<\/then>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<else>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003. . . execute command(s) when false . . ."},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<\/else>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<\/if>"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"The <if> and <\/if> tags indicate the whole if-then section.

The <then> and <\/then> tags indicate the command or commands to execute if the test is true; and the <else> and <\/else> tags indicate the command or commands to execute if the test is true.","For example, if the type is string, not is false, and the case is false, script for checking if one string equals another string is given by:\n\nif \u201cstring1\u201d==\u201cstring2\u201d command [else expression]\n\nfor a WINDOWS\u2122 command file; and\n\nif [\u201cstring1\u201d=\u201cstring2\u201d] then; else;\n\nfor a UNIX\u00ae shell script Where \u201cstring1\u201d is obtained from \u201cop1\u201d and \u201cstring2\u201d is obtained from \u201cop2\u201d.\n","The script generator specification example below is merely one non-limiting example of a specification of the script generator.
