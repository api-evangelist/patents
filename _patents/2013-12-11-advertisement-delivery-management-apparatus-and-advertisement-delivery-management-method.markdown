Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to an advertisement delivery management apparatus and an advertisement delivery management method.","2. Description of the Related Art","In recent years, with the rapid spread of a network, such as the Internet, advertisements have been actively delivered through the network. As an aspect of the delivery of the advertisements, display advertising has been known which displays image or video advertisements in a predetermined space of a page (hereinafter, referred to as an advertisement delivery target page) which is to be an advertisement delivery target.","In the display advertising, advertisements are delivered to the users who have the user attributes (for example, sex, age, and interest) designated by an advertiser. Therefore, advertisements are effectively delivered (for example, see Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 2011-238020).","In the delivery of the advertisements, when the user who has accessed the advertisement delivery target page has the user attributes designated by the advertiser, advertisements are delivered. Therefore, it is preferable to predict a delivery target user, who will be a future advertisement delivery destination, as a future log including the user attributes and to accept an order from the advertiser on the basis of the future log.","However, when the delivery target user as predicted as the future advertisement delivery destination has a plurality of user attributes, in some cases, it is difficult to accept a new order from the advertiser, depending a method of allocating the delivery target users to an advertisement delivery order.","According to an exemplary embodiment, an advertisement delivery management apparatus includes a predicted information storage unit, an acquisition unit, and an allocating unit. The prediction information storage unit stores information including user attributes of a plurality of delivery target users predicted as future advertisement delivery destinations. The acquisition unit acquires a plurality of order requests designating user attributes and the numbers of deliveries. The allocation unit allocates the delivery target users to the plurality of order requests on the basis of the user attributes and the numbers of deliveries designated by the plurality of order requests such that the number of predetermined user attributes of the delivery target users who have not been allocated to the order requests is the maximum.","The above and other objects, features, advantages and technical and industrial significance of this invention will be better understood by reading the following detailed description of presently preferred embodiments of the invention, when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings.","Hereinafter, an advertisement delivery management apparatus and an advertisement delivery management method according to an exemplary embodiment (hereinafter, referred to as an \u201cembodiment\u201d) of the present disclosure will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. The advertisement delivery management apparatus and advertisement delivery management method according to the present disclosure are not limited by the embodiment. In the following description, in some cases, a \u201cdatabase\u201d is described as a \u201cDB\u201d.","1. Advertisement Delivery Management Process","First, an advertisement delivery management process according to the embodiment will be described.  are diagrams illustrating the advertisement delivery management process according to the embodiment. The advertisement delivery management process makes it possible to appropriately allocate a delivery target user in response to an order request from an advertiser.","As illustrated in , an advertisement delivery management system according to the embodiment includes an advertisement delivery management apparatus , an information delivery apparatus , an advertiser terminal , and a user terminal . The advertisement delivery management apparatus , the information delivery apparatus , the advertiser terminal , and the user terminal  are connected to each other through a communication network . The communication network  is an Internet protocol (IP) network, such as the Internet. In practice, there are a plurality of advertiser terminals  and a plurality of user terminals . However,  illustrates one advertiser terminal  and one user terminal , for convenience of explanation.","The advertiser terminal  is a terminal apparatus of the advertiser who wants to deliver advertisements and sends an order request to order advertisements which is desired to be delivered to the user terminal  of the user with predetermined user attributes to the advertisement delivery management apparatus . Specifically, the advertiser terminal  transmits, to the advertisement delivery management apparatus , an order request including advertising information which the advertiser wants to insert into an advertisement delivery target page, information on the user attributes which are designated as the delivery destination of the advertising information, and information on the number of times the advertising information is delivered. Examples of the advertising information include two-dimensional content and three-dimensional content, such as banner advertisements, text advertisements, and video advertisements.","The user terminal  is the terminal apparatus of the user who accesses the advertisement delivery management apparatus  and the information delivery apparatus . When the information delivery apparatus  is accessed by the user terminal , for example, information delivery apparatus  transmits an advertisement delivery target page, such as a Web page, to the user terminal . The advertisement delivery target page includes a uniform resource locator (URL) of the advertising information. The user terminal  transmits the order request to the advertisement delivery management apparatus  on the basis of the URL.","The URL of the advertising information may not be the URL of the advertisement delivery management apparatus , but may be the URL of the information delivery apparatus . In this case, the user terminal  requests the information delivery apparatus  to transmit advertising information on the basis of the URL of the advertising information. When receiving the request, the information delivery apparatus  requests the advertisement delivery management apparatus  to transmit advertising information. The advertisement delivery management apparatus  transmits advertising information corresponding to the transmission request from the information delivery apparatus  to the information delivery apparatus . When receiving the advertising information from the advertisement delivery management apparatus , the information delivery apparatus  transmits the advertising information to the user terminal .","The advertisement delivery management apparatus  performs a process of accepting an advertisement delivery order request, a process of allocating user attributes to the accepted order request, and a process of delivering the advertising information designated by the order request to perform processes from the reception of the advertisement delivery order to the delivery of the advertising information.","The advertisement delivery management apparatus  stores information including the user attributes of a plurality of delivery target users, who are predicted as future advertisement delivery destinations, as a future log in a DB and performs the process of accepting the order request and the process of allocating the user attributes on the basis of the future log.","In the example illustrated in , information including the user attributes of delivery target users to is stored as the future log in the DB. The delivery target user has user attributes A, B, and C, the delivery target user has the user attribute A, the delivery target user has user attributes A and C to E, the delivery target user has user attributes B, D, and E, and the delivery target user has user attributes B to D.","The advertisement delivery management apparatus  acquires the order request transmitted from the advertiser terminal  and allocates the delivery target users to response to the order request. As described above, the order request transmitted from the advertiser terminal  includes information on a user attribute (hereinafter, referred to as a designated user attribute) which is designated as the delivery destination of advertising information and information on the number (hereinafter, referred to as the designated number of deliveries) of times advertising information is delivered.","The advertisement delivery management apparatus  performs the process of allocating the delivery target users, using a plurality of order requests as a unit. Specifically, the advertisement delivery management apparatus  allocates the delivery target users to a plurality of order requests such that the number of predetermined user attributes of the delivery target users who have not been allocated to the order requests is the maximum, on the basis of the designated user attributes and the designated number of deliveries in each of the plurality of order requests. Hereinafter, in some cases, the delivery target user who has not been allocated to the order request is referred to as a non-allocated user.","For example, as illustrated in , a case is considered in which the advertiser terminal  transmits, to the advertisement delivery management apparatus , an order request in which the designated user attributes is the \u201cattribute A\u201d and the designated number of deliveries is \u201c2\u201d and an order request in which the designated user attribute is the \u201cattribute D\u201d and the designated number of deliveries is \u201c1\u201d. In addition, it is assumed that the predetermined user attributes (hereinafter, referred to as adequacy determining attributes) are the \u201cattribute B\u201d, the \u201cattribute C\u201d, and the \u201cattribute D\u201d.","When the delivery target users and with the \u201cattribute A\u201d, which is the designated user attribute in the order request , is allocated to the order request and the delivery target user with the \u201cattribute D\u201d, which is the designated user attribute in the order request , is allocated to the order request , the numbers of attributes A to E of the non-allocated users are \u201c1\u201d, \u201c1\u201d, \u201c0\u201d, \u201c1\u201d, and \u201c1\u201d, respectively. Therefore, the total number (hereinafter, referred to as a non-allocation score) of adequacy determining attributes (attributes B to D) of the non-allocated users is \u201c2\u201d.","When the delivery target users and with the \u201cattribute A\u201d, which is the designated user attribute in the order request , is allocated to the order request and the delivery target user with the \u201cattribute D\u201d, which is the designated user attribute in the order request , is allocated to the order request , the numbers of attributes A to E of the non-allocated users are \u201c1\u201d, \u201c1\u201d, \u201c2\u201d, \u201c2\u201d, and \u201c1\u201d, respectively. Therefore, the non-allocation score, which is the total number of adequacy determining attributes (attributes B to D) of the non-allocated users, is \u201c5\u201d.","When the delivery target users , , and are allocated to the plurality of order requests and , the non-allocation score is the maximum. Therefore, the advertisement delivery management apparatus  allocates the delivery target users , , and to the plurality of order requests and ","As such, the advertisement delivery management apparatus  allocates the delivery target users to a plurality of order requests such that the non-allocation score is the maximum. Since the non-allocation score is the number of adequacy determining attributes of the non-allocated users, for example, the user attributes which are frequently designated by the order requests are set as the adequacy determining attributes. In this case, it is possible to increase the possibility of a future order request being accepted and prevent loss of sales opportunities.","In this embodiment, the adequacy determining attributes are some user attributes among a plurality of user attributes. However, all of the user attributes may be used as the adequacy determining attributes. For example, when the delivery target users , , and are allocated to the order requests and , the non-allocation score is \u201c4\u201d. When the delivery target users , , and are allocated to the order requests and , the non-allocation score is \u201c7\u201d.","As such, when all of the user attributes are used as the adequacy determining attributes, it is possible to increase the total number of user attributes of the delivery target users which can be allocated to the order requests. Therefore, in this case, it is possible to increase the possibility of the future order request being accepted and prevent loss of sales opportunities.","Next, the detailed structure of the advertisement delivery management apparatus  which performs the above-mentioned advertisement delivery management process and the detailed content of the process will be described with reference to the drawings.","2. Structure of Advertisement Delivery Management Apparatus ",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["1","1","10","11","12","13","14","15","15","21","22","23","24"]},"The communication unit  is an interface, such as a network interface card (NIC). The control unit  transmits and receives various kinds of information to and from the advertiser terminal  or the user terminal  through the communication unit  and the communication network . The advertising information DB , the user information DB , the past log DB , and the future log DB  are each a semiconductor memory device, such as a hard disk, random access memory (RAM), or flash memory, or a storage device, such as an optical disk.","The control unit  is implemented by an integrated circuit, such as an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or a field programmable gate array (FPGA). A central processing unit (CPU) or a micro processing unit (MPU) executes a program stored in the internal storage device using the RAM as a work area to cause the control unit  to function as the advertisement delivery unit , the future log prediction unit , the accepting unit , and the allocation unit . The structure of the control unit  is not limited thereto, but the control unit  may have any structure as long as it can perform the following information processing.","Advertisement Delivery Unit ","When a request to deliver advertising information is received from the user terminal , the advertisement delivery unit  acquires advertising information corresponding to the user attributes of the user of the user terminal  from an advertising information table in the advertising information DB  and transmits the acquired advertising information from the communication unit  to the user terminal  which is a delivery request source.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":"11"},"The \u201cadvertisement ID\u201d is identification information which is allocated to each received order request. The \u201cuser attributes\u201d are user attributes (designated user attributes) designated by the order request. The \u201cdelivery period\u201d is the period for which the advertising information designated by the order request is delivered. The \u201cnumber of deliveries\u201d is the number (the designated number of deliveries) of times the advertising information designated by the order request is delivered. In addition, the \u201cadvertising information\u201d is advertising information designated by the order request.","For example, for an advertisement ID \u201cO\u201d, the user attribute of a delivery target is \u201cvehicle\u201d, the delivery period of advertising information is from \u201cJan. 1, 2013 to Jan. 31, 2013\u201d, the number of times the advertising information is delivered is \u201c100\u201d, and the advertising information is a \u201cbanner advertisement Ya\u201d. When the number of times the advertising information is delivered is greater than \u201c100\u201d within the delivery period of the advertising information, the process of delivering advertising information in response to the order request ends.","When the user of the user terminal  who has issued the advertising information delivery request has the user attribute \u201cvehicle\u201d, for example, the advertisement delivery unit  acquires the advertising information \u201cbanner advertisement Ya\u201d with the advertisement ID \u201cO\u201d from the advertising information table in the advertising information DB  and transmits the acquired advertising information to the user terminal  which is a delivery request source.","The user attributes of the user of the user terminal  are determined on the basis of the user information table in the user information DB .  is a diagram illustrating an example of the user information table stored in the user information DB . As illustrated in , the user information table includes information, such as a \u201cuser ID\u201d, \u201cpsychographic attributes\u201d, and \u201cdemographic attributes\u201d.","The \u201cuser ID\u201d is identification information for identifying the user of the user terminal . The \u201cuser ID\u201d corresponds to, for example, user identification information which is set to a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) cookie transmitted and received between the advertisement delivery management apparatus  and the user terminal .","The \u201cpsychographic attributes\u201d are information indicating, for example, the values, lifestyle, character, and preference of the user. The \u201cpsychographic attributes\u201d are classified into, for example, attributes \u201cvehicle\u201d, \u201ccosmetics\u201d, \u201cclothes\u201d, and \u201ctravel\u201d. In the example illustrated in , \u201c1\u201d is stored in each attribute when the preference of the user is relatively high and \u201c0\u201d is stored in each attribute in the other cases. In addition, the \u201cpsychographic attributes\u201d are not limited to the attributes illustrated in , but may include various attributes, such as economy, politics, baseball, soccer, other sports, sweets, a personal computer, white goods, and furniture.","The \u201cdemographic attributes\u201d indicate demographic user attribute information. The \u201cdemographic attributes\u201d are classified into, for example, attributes \u201csex\u201d and \u201cage\u201d of the user. For example, \u201c1\u201d is stored in the attribute \u201csex\u201d illustrated in  when the user is a female and \u201c2\u201d is stored in the attribute \u201csex\u201d when the user is a male. The age of the user is stored in the attribute \u201cage\u201d. The \u201cdemographic attributes\u201d are not limited to the attributes illustrated in , but may include various attributes, such as the job, family structure, annual income, address, native place, and academic background of the user.","For example, when the user with a user ID \u201cU\u201d illustrated in  has issued an advertising information delivery request from the user terminal , it is determined that the user attributes of the user are, for example, \u201cvehicle\u201d, \u201ctravel\u201d, \u201cmale\u201d, and \u201c21 years old\u201d. In addition, for example, when the user with a user ID \u201cU\u201d illustrated in  has issued an advertising information delivery request from the user terminal , the advertisement delivery unit  determines that the user attributes of the user are \u201cclothes\u201d, \u201cfemale\u201d, and \u201c44 years old\u201d.","The advertisement delivery unit  sets the user ID of the user who has issued the advertising information delivery request in an access log table stored in the past log DB .  is a diagram illustrating an example of the access log table stored in the past log DB .","As illustrated in , information (hereinafter, referred to as a past log in some cases) in which the day and time when the user of the user terminal  issues the advertising information delivery request to the advertisement delivery management apparatus  is associated with the user ID is set in the access log table. The advertisement delivery unit  updates the access log table whenever the advertising information delivery request is issued from the user terminal .","Future Log Prediction Unit ","The future log prediction unit  determines a plurality of delivery target users who are predicted as the future advertisement delivery destinations on the basis of the access log table stored in the past log DB  and sets the user information of the determined delivery target users in a future log table stored in the future log DB .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":"14"},"The \u201cdelivery target ID\u201d is identification information allocated to each delivery target user.

When the delivery target user has not been allocated to the order request, \u201c0\u201d is stored in the allocation state.","The \u201cpsychographic attributes\u201d and the \u201cdemographic attributes\u201d are the same as those in the user information table in the user information DB . The user who is set in the user information table may be presumed as the delivery target user and the delivery target ID may be used as the user ID. In this case, information on the \u201cpsychographic attributes\u201d and the \u201cdemographic attributes\u201d can be acquired from the user information table on the basis of the user ID.","The future log prediction unit  can predict the delivery target user who will be the advertisement delivery destination for a predetermined future period on the basis of, for example, the access log in the same period last year or the access log in the previous predetermined period. For example, the future log prediction unit  can presume the user who issued the advertising information delivery request for the previous month as the delivery target user for the next month.","The future log prediction unit  can perform a statistical process for the past log which is set in the access log table to determine the tendency of the delivery target user who will be the future advertisement delivery destination and predict the future log on the basis of the determination result. In this case, for example, the future log prediction unit  may determine the tendency of the delivery target user, considering, for example, weather or temperature change information.","The future log prediction unit  can set the predicted future log in the future log table. In addition, the future log prediction unit  may set the future log which is acquired from an external apparatus through the communication unit  in the future log table.","Accepting Unit ","The accepting unit  determines whether to accept the order request from the advertiser terminal  on the basis of the future log set in the future log table. When the accepting unit  determines to accept the order request, it transmits a response to the reception of the order to the advertiser terminal .","As described above, the order request from the advertiser terminal  includes designated information, such as the designated user attributes and the designated number of deliveries. When an order request is issued from the advertiser terminal , the accepting unit  counts the number of non-allocated users with the user attributes designated by the order request among the delivery target users set in the future log table. When the count result is equal to or greater than the designated number of deliveries in the order request, the accepting unit  accepts the order request from the advertiser terminal .","For example, when receiving an order request indicating that the designated user attribute is \u201cvehicle\u201d and the designated number of deliveries is \u201c100\u201d, the accepting unit  counts the number of delivery target users with the attribute \u201cvehicle\u201d to which \u201c1\u201d is set in the future log table. When the count result is equal to or greater than \u201c100\u201d, the accepting unit  accepts the order request from the advertiser terminal . When the count result is less than \u201c100\u201d, the accepting unit  does not accept the order request from the advertiser terminal .","The accepting unit  counts a combination of two or more user attributes which are designated by the order request at a frequency equal to or greater than a threshold value as one user attribute (hereinafter, referred to as a combined user attribute in some cases). For example, when a combination of the user attributes \u201cclothes\u201d and \u201ctravel\u201d is frequently designated by the order request, the accepting unit  counts the combination of the user attributes \u201cclothes\u201d and \u201ctravel\u201d as one user attribute.","Information on the order request accepted by the accepting unit  is set in the advertising information table stored in the advertising information DB . The accepting unit  can determine a combination of two or more user attributes which are designated by the order request at a frequency equal to or greater than the threshold value on the basis of the advertising information table.","For example, the accepting unit  calculates the total number of deliveries designated by the past order request as a first sum and calculates the total number of deliveries designated by the past order request as a second sum for each combination of two or more user attributes, on the basis of the advertising information table. Then, the accepting unit  counts, as one user attribute, a combination of the user attributes in which the ratio of the second sum to the first sum is equal to or greater than a predetermined threshold value.","When a combination of the user attributes \u201cvehicle\u201d and \u201ctravel\u201d is frequently designated by the order request and the future log table is in the state illustrated in , the user attribute of the delivery target user with a delivery target ID \u201cF\u201d is not \u201cvehicle\u201d or \u201ctravel\u201d, but is \u201cvehicle & travel\u201d.","The combination of two or more user attributes which are designated by the order request at a frequency equal to or greater than the threshold value may not be determined by the accepting unit , but may be set in the user information DB  by an external apparatus.","For example, when the number of non-allocated users is equal to or less than a predetermined value or when the number of non-allocated users with the combined user attribute is equal to or less than a predetermined value, the accepting unit  can divide the combined user attribute into a plurality of user attributes. Therefore, it is possible to increase the total number of user attributes. As a result, the possibility that the order request designating the combined user attribute will be accepted is reduced, but it is possible to increase the possibility that other order requests will be accepted.","Allocation Unit ","The allocation unit  allocates the delivery target user set in the future log table to the order request which is accepted by the accepting unit .","Specifically, the allocation unit  allocates the delivery target users to a plurality of order requests, on the basis of the designated user attribute and the designated number of deliveries in each of the plurality of order requests, such that the number of predetermined user attributes of the delivery target users who have not been allocated to the order requests is the maximum.","The \u201cpredetermined user attribute\u201d is the above-mentioned adequacy determining attribute and can be set by, for example, the administrator (hereinafter, referred to as a delivery administrator) of the advertisement delivery management apparatus  through an operation unit (not illustrated) of the advertisement delivery management apparatus . The delivery administrator may set all or some of the user attributes as the adequacy determining attributes.","In addition, the allocation unit  performs any one of a first allocation mode, a second allocation mode, and a third allocation mode on the basis of the settings set by the delivery administrator through the operation unit (not illustrated) of the advertisement delivery management apparatus .","When the first allocation mode is set, the allocation unit  repeatedly performs a process (hereinafter, referred to as a whole process in some cases) of allocating the delivery target users to all of the order requests set in the advertising information table each time the accepting unit  accepts a new order request.","When the second allocation mode is set, the allocation unit  performs a process (hereinafter, referred to as a partial process in some cases) of allocating the delivery target users to a newly acquired order request while maintaining the allocation of the delivery target users to the order requests.","When the third allocation mode is set, the allocation unit  performs the whole process at a predetermined time (for example, at night where the number of order requests is small) while performing the partial process for a new order request.","Next, the allocation process of the allocation unit  will be described in detail. When there are n order requests in the advertising information table, an order request Oi (1\u2266i\u2266n; i is an integer (see )) is defined and it is assumed that the designated number of deliveries in the order request Oi is \u201co_i\u201d. When m user attribute patterns are set, a user attribute pattern Pj (1\u2266j\u2266m; j is an integer) is defined and it is assumed that the number of delivery target users in the user attribute pattern Pj is \u201cp_j\u201d.","For example, when the future log table is in the state illustrated in , the \u201cuser attribute pattern\u201d is a combination of the attributes \u201cvehicle\u201d, \u201ccosmetics\u201d, \u201cclothes\u201d, and \u201ctravel\u201d. For example, when the attribute pattern is defined as {vehicle, cosmetics, clothes, travel, . . . }, each attribute pattern is represented by, for example, {1, 0, 0, 0, . . . }, {0, 1, 0, 0, . . . }, and {1, 1, 1, 0, . . . }. When the number of attributes is, for example, six, the number of user attribute patterns is 2. The user attributes which are less likely to be designated by the order request Oi may be excluded from the user attribute pattern.","The allocation unit  allocates the delivery target users to a plurality of order requests O to On with linear programming such that a non-allocation score KPI is the maximum, using the following formulas (1) and (2) as constraint conditions.

Process Flow of Advertisement Delivery Management Apparatus ","Next, the procedure of an advertisement delivery management process of the advertisement delivery management apparatus  according to the embodiment will be described.  is a diagram illustrating an example of the flow of the advertisement delivery management process of the advertisement delivery management apparatus  according to the embodiment.","As illustrated in , when an order request is received from the advertiser terminal , the control unit  of the advertisement delivery management apparatus  determines whether to accept the order request from the advertiser terminal  on the basis of the future log set in the future log table (Step S). For example, the control unit  counts the number of user attributes designated by the order request among the user attributes of the non-allocated users set in the future log table. When the count result is equal to or greater than the number of deliveries designated by the order request, the control unit  determines to accept the order request.","When the control unit  determines to accept the order request from the advertiser terminal  (Yes in Step S), the control unit  sets information included in the order request in the advertising information table and updates the advertising information table (Step S). The information included in the order request includes, for example, user attributes, a delivery period, the number of deliveries, and advertising information. The information is set in the advertising information table.","Then, the control unit  performs a process of allocating the delivery target users (Step S). The allocation process allocates the delivery target users with the user attributes designated by the order request to the order request and corresponds to, for example, Steps S to S illustrated in , which will be described in detail below.","Then, the control unit  updates the future log table on the basis of the result of the allocation process in Step S (Step S). Specifically, the control unit  sets, to \u201c1\u201d, the \u201callocation state\u201d of the delivery target user allocated to the order request among the delivery target users set in the future log table and sets, to \u201c0\u201d, the \u201callocation state\u201d of the delivery target user who has not been allocated to the order request.","Then, the control unit  transmits a response to the reception of the order to the advertiser terminal  through the communication unit  (Step S) and ends the advertisement delivery management process. On the other hand, when the control unit  determines not to accept the order request from the advertiser terminal  in Step S (No in Step S), the control unit  transmits an order rejection response to the advertiser terminal  through the communication unit  (Step S) and ends the advertisement delivery management process.","Next, an example of the allocation process in Step S will be described in detail with reference to .  is a diagram illustrating an example of the flow of the allocation process of the advertisement delivery management apparatus  according to the embodiment.","As illustrated in , when the process of allocating the delivery target users starts, the control unit  of the advertisement delivery management apparatus  determines whether the allocation mode is set to the first allocation mode (Step S). When it is determined that the allocation mode is set to the first allocation mode (Yes in Step S), the control unit  allocates the delivery target users using the whole process (Step S).","When it is determined in Step S that the allocation mode is not to the first allocation mode (No in Step S), the control unit  determines whether the allocation mode is set to the second allocation mode (Step S). When it is determined that the allocation mode is set to the second allocation mode (Yes in Step S), the control unit  allocates the delivery target users to a new order request using the partial process (Step S).","When it is determined in Step S that the allocation mode is not set to the second allocation mode (No in Step S), the control unit  determines that the allocation mode is set to the third allocation mode and allocates the delivery target users to a new order request using the partial process (Step S).","When the process in Step S ends, the control unit  determines whether the number of order requests accepted after the previous whole process reaches a predetermined value (Step S). When it is determined that the number of order requests reaches the predetermined value (Yes in Step S), the control unit  allocates the delivery target users using the whole process (Step S).","When it is determined that the number of order requests does not reach the predetermined value (No in Step S) or when the process in Steps S, S, and S ends, the control unit  ends the process of allocating the delivery target users.","4. Modifications","In the above-described embodiment, whenever an order request is issued from the advertiser terminal , the accepting unit  performs the accepting process. However, for example, when the user attributes designated by the order request do not overlap each other, the accepting unit  may perform the accepting process in a unit of plurality of order requests. In addition, for example, in the case in which the user attributes designated by the order request do not overlap each other, the accepting unit  may perform the accepting process when the user attributes designated by the order request overlap each other.","In the above-described embodiment, for ease of understanding, the target period for which the future advertisement delivery destination is predicted is equal to the delivery period of the order request. However, the target period for which the future advertisement delivery destination is predicted may not be equal to the delivery period of the order request. For example, the target period for which the future advertisement delivery destination is predicted may be a day and the delivery period of the order request may be a day. In this case, the allocation unit  can perform the process of allocating the delivery target users on a daily basis.","In the above-described embodiment, the process is performed for the order request. However, the control unit  may accept a cancel request from the advertiser terminal . In this case, the allocation unit  performs the whole process for a new advertisement delivery cancel request accepted by the accepting unit  such that the non-allocation score KPI is the maximum.","In the above-described embodiment, the first to third allocation modes are set by the delivery administrator. However, the first to third allocation modes may be changed depending on the load state of the advertisement delivery management apparatus . For example, when the processing load of the advertisement delivery management apparatus  is large, the control unit  performs the second allocation mode. When the processing load of the advertisement delivery management apparatus  is small, the control unit  performs the first allocation mode.","In the above-described embodiment, the control unit  performs the whole process in the first and third allocation modes, using all order requests as a unit of processing. However, the control unit  may perform the whole process, using the order requests in which the sum of the designated number of deliveries is equal to a predetermined value as a unit of processing.","In addition, the control unit  may allocate the delivery target users using a different allocation method until the number of non-allocated users is equal to or less than a predetermined value and perform the first to third allocation modes for the non-allocated users when the number of non-allocated users is equal to or less than the predetermined value. In the \u201cdifferent allocation method\u201d, the control unit  allocates the delivery target users to a new advertisement delivery order request such that a reduction in the total number of user attributes of the delivery target users who have not been allocated to the advertisement delivery order request among a plurality of delivery target users is the minimum. The use of the \u201cdifferent allocate method\u201d makes it possible to reduce the processing load, as compared to the first to third allocation modes.","In the above-described embodiment, the control unit  allocates the delivery target users to a plurality of order requests such that the non-allocation score which is calculated on the basis of the non-allocated users is the maximum. However, the control unit  may perform the allocation process such that the non-allocation score is the maximum. For example, the control unit  may allocate the delivery target users to a plurality of order requests such that an allocation score which is calculated on the basis of the delivery target users allocated to the order requests is the minimum. The allocation score is the total number of delivery target users who have a predetermined user attribute and have been allocated to the order requests. For example, the non-allocation score may be calculated by subtracting the allocation score from the total number of delivery target users with a predetermined user attribute.","In the above-described embodiment, the whole process allocates the delivery target users to all of the order requests set in the advertising information table. However, the whole process may allocate the delivery target users to some of the order requests. For example, whenever the accepting unit  accepts a new order request, the allocation unit  allocates the delivery target users to a predetermined number of recently accepted order requests among the order requests which are set in the advertising information table. In this case, the allocation unit  allocates the delivery target users to all of the order requests set in the advertising information table at a predetermined time (for example, 2 a.m.).","5. Effect","In the advertisement delivery management apparatus  according to the embodiment, the future log DB  (an example of a prediction information storage unit) stores information including the user attributes of a plurality of delivery target users who are predicted as the future advertisement delivery destinations. The accepting unit  (an example of an acquisition unit) acquires a plurality of order requests designating the user attributes and the numbers of deliveries. The allocation unit  (an example of an allocation unit) allocates the delivery target users to a plurality of order requests on the basis of the user attributes and the numbers of deliveries designated by the plurality of order requests such that the number of adequacy determining attributes (predetermined user attributes) of the delivery target users who have not been allocated to the order requests is the maximum.","According to this structure, it is possible to appropriately allocate the delivery target users to an advertisement delivery order and prevent a reduction in the possibility of a future advertisement delivery order request being accepted.
