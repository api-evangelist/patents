{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Information provided to a user or a system application is often duplicated in some form to allow access to the information to other users, system applications, or a system comprising another environment. For example, where data provided in a central data store or location is shared across a number of different systems or applications, each system may replicate the data in some form locally, e.g., by periodically downloading the data from the central data store. In this way, each individual system or application is able to access the information maintained in the central data store without disrupting access to the information by other systems.","Individual systems or applications may also modify information kept at the central data store by updating the central data store according to modifications made to local versions of the data. For example, changes to data initially copied from the central data store to a local data store or application may be distributed to the central data store so that information is consistent across all applications pulling data from the central data store.","Local applications or environments often have varied requirements for information to be compatible with the application, e.g., format requirements, database schemas for the local applications, etc. Processes for updating the local applications with information must generally be carried out manually, e.g., by administrators of the applications or of a central data store, in order to provide data in a format that can be used by each of the local applications. As a result, where a central data store provides data to a large number of local applications or environments, the process of updating the many applications with current data from the central data store and also updating the central data store with new information submitted via the application can be very time consuming and labor intensive. Additionally, any changes to local applications, e.g., format of the application or methodologies for using the information, must generally be communicated to the central data store to allow the central data store to transmit data to the local applications in the proper format or location.","Accordingly, there is a need for an improved central data storage system that provides for a simplified manner of updating information in different environments.","Various examples of a method and a system for storing data in a central data store are disclosed. An exemplary method may include providing a central data store including data for use in a plurality of environments, with the central data store selectively transmitting a portion of the data to a synchronized application associated with at least one of the environments. The method further includes establishing configurable instructions included in the central data store defining at least one synchronization parameter associated with the synchronized application, and modifying at least one of the synchronization parameters via the central data store according to a communication received from the synchronized application.","An exemplary information system may generally include a central data store including a plurality of first data servers, where each of the first data servers includes data associated with at least one data environments. The exemplary system further includes a synchronized application that includes a second data store in selective communication with the first data store. The second data store is associated with a first one of the plurality of environments and includes a plurality of synchronized data servers, with each synchronized data server including at least a subset of the data included in the central data store. The first data store is configured to synchronize data stored in the first data store with the data of the second data store, e.g., the subset of data from the first data store. The first data store synchronizes the data according to at least one parameter defined by synchronizing instructions that are configured to be modified by the second data store via a communication received from the second data store.","The exemplary systems and methods generally provide a configurable process for synchronizing data of a central data store with one or more local applications having different environments or formats. As described further below, an environment may include any parameter or characteristic of the data in the central data store that is used in organizing or segregating data, e.g., geographical locations associated with servers supporting the data, formats of associated servers or local applications, or the like. In some examples, a platform-neutral data representation language may be employed that allows self-configuration of synchronization parameters by applications as they are added, removed, or modified within an information system, thereby eliminating a need for manual configuration processes, e.g., by an administrator of the central data store, for each individual application or instance of the central data store.","Turning now to , a general architecture and operation of an exemplary information system  is illustrated. Information system  generally provides a central data store or repository for use by one or more applications that update or synchronize data, e.g., a portion of the data within the central data store. In some cases the information system  may supply data to a very large number of applications. For example, the information system  may be a national telephone number and address information directory (NTAS) that stores data for all telephone numbers offered by a telephone service provider, and data associated with each of the telephone numbers that is used by the service provider across a variety of applications, e.g., addresses associated with the telephone numbers, phone or wireless call activity logs, user information, etc. A service provider may use the information system  to maintain a centralized data store of telephone numbers for use by specific local applications such as billing systems, production systems, switching applications, or local service management systems, merely as examples, while minimizing the need to reproduce the data many times over for the various local applications.","The information system  may generally include a central data store  that is configured to maintain a centralized information database. The central data store  may include one or more servers , , (collectively, ) that store data. While the servers  are shown as separate machines in the central data store , the servers  need not be physically distinct from one another. Rather, the servers  illustrated in central data store  may simply be virtual representations for the purposes of illustrating a strategy for organizing data supported by the central data store , and the servers  need not be separate or distinct machines. The number of servers  or groups of data in the central data store  may be very large, for example where a large quantity of data is supported collectively by the servers . The association of the servers  within the same central data store  does not necessarily require that the servers  are kept in a single location together. In fact, the plurality of servers  may be distributed between a number of separate machines, or geographically across different buildings, cities, states, or even countries.","While a single iteration of the central data store  is illustrated in , the central data store  may also include additional versions or instances running at a given time, e.g., to provide access to data kept in the central data store  to multiple external systems simultaneously. Additionally, data may be segregated within the data store  among the servers  according to at least one parameter associated with the data or an organizational strategy that is convenient for separating the data into groups, e.g., geographic groups such as states. For example, as shown in , each of the servers  include data from groups of states that share borders with each other. Specifically, server includes NTAS data for New York (NY) and Connecticut (CT), server includes data for Maryland (MD), West Virginia (WV), Virginia (VA), and the District of Columbia (DC), and server includes data for Pennsylvania (PA), New Jersey (NJ) and Delaware (DE). Other groupings or strategies for organizing the data amongst the servers  may be employed. The data included in the central data store  may thus be organized into groups that are easier to manage and maintain than a single large server or other hardware for the entire central data store .","The central data store  generally may have processes defined by an administrator for exchanging or updating data with external systems, e.g., a regional billing application . Accordingly, central data store  may be in communication with regional billing application  via any communication link . Communication link  may include any link for transmitting data including, but not limited to, a packet-switched network or the like.","The central data store  may employ batch processes for updating or exchanging data with other external systems, e.g., regional billing application . These batch processes may be defined to allow updates in both directions, i.e., such that the central data store  and local application may each update the other with modified or new data. Further, individual batch processes may, alternatively or in addition to other batch processes, be defined to run in a single direction such that updated information is transferred from one machine in the environment to another machine in another environment. One exemplary process in the central data store  that exchanges data with another environment is a NTAS Billing Sync batch process, which will be described in further detail below.","Generally, one or more local applications may rely upon the central data store  for centralized information or data maintained by the central data store . For example, as shown in  a regional billing application  is in communication with the central data store  to access and update data maintained by the central data store , such as to determine a periodic service charge associated with a given phone number. Any variety of additional applications (not shown) may be employed in conjunction with the central data store .","The regional billing application  includes a dedicated data store  comprising a plurality of servers , , (collectively, ). These servers  are configured to generally synchronize data from the central data store  and provide a local access to the synchronized data for the regional billing application . Accordingly, the servers  may periodically exchange or update data from the central data store , for example when changes are made to the data stored on the servers  via the billing application, or when updates are made via an application other than the regional billing application . The regional billing application  may thus permit updates to data in either direction when an update is made to the data or a batch process is initiated. In other words, the regional billing application  may send updated data to the central data store , and the central data store  may send updated data to the regional billing application .","The servers  may generally be configured to maintain data in a format that is specific to the local application associated with the servers, i.e., regional billing application . For example, data may be segregated according to at least one parameter, e.g., a geographical parameter such as a state, or any other parameter(s) that is convenient. The segregation of the data within the regional billing application  may be according to a same parameter that is used for the segregation of data within the central data store . The servers  associated with a local application may rely on the entire data set maintained by the central data store , or may alternatively utilize a portion of the data set, e.g., data associated with a portion of the parameters or environments included in the central data store . The regional billing application  may thus employ a different segregation of data across the servers  even when employing a segregation strategy according to a same parameter or environment as the central data store . In some cases, groupings of the parameters associated with each server  in the central data store  are not repeated in any of the servers  employed within the regional billing application . For example, while data associated with New York and Connecticut is supported by a single server in central data store , the data for New York is maintained on a single server within regional billing application . Furthermore, the Connecticut data is not supported within the regional billing application , as the regional billing application  only includes data for the District of Columbia, Maryland, New York, Virginia, and West Virginia.","During synchronization of data included in central data store  with an application such as regional billing application , data may be exchanged between the central data store  and regional billing application  in any manner that is convenient. For example, regional billing application  may send a communication or request to the central data store  requesting a list of telephone numbers that became active on a given day. In response to this communication from the regional billing application , central data store  may transmit data relevant to the request, e.g., in the form of a pipe delimited file using secure file transfer protocol (sFTP). Data synchronizations may also be initiated by the central data store , e.g., once per day to ensure regional billing application  maintains relatively current data.","The central data store , regional billing application , servers ,  and other components of the information system  utilized for storing, exchanging, updating, or creating data associated with the information system  may include any one of a number of known computing devices, including, without limitation, a computer workstation, a desktop, notebook, laptop, or handheld computer, or some other computing device known to those skilled in the art. Computing devices such as the foregoing may employ any of a number of known computer operating systems, including, but by no means limited to, known versions and\/or varieties of the Microsoft Windows\u00ae operating system, the Unix operating system (e.g., the Solaris\u00ae operating system distributed by Sun Microsystems of Menlo Park, Calif.), the AIX UNIX operating system distributed by International Business Machines of Armonk, N.Y., and the Linux operating system.","Computing devices in various embodiments such as central data store , regional billing application , or servers ,  may each include instructions executable by one or more computing devices such as those listed above. Such instructions may be compiled or interpreted from computer programs created using a variety of programming languages and\/or technologies known to those skilled in the art, including, without limitation, and either alone or in combination, Java\u2122, C, C++, Visual Basic, Java Script, Perl, etc. In general, a processor (e.g., a microprocessor) receives instructions, e.g., from a memory, a computer-readable medium, etc., and executes these instructions, thereby performing one or more processes, including one or more of the processes described herein. Such instructions and other data may be stored and transmitted using a variety of known computer-readable media.","A computer-readable medium includes any tangible medium that participates in providing data (e.g., instructions), which may be read by a computer. Such a medium may take many forms, including, but not limited to, non-volatile media, volatile media, and transmission media. Non-volatile media include, for example, optical or magnetic disks and other persistent memory. Volatile media include dynamic random access memory (DRAM), which typically constitutes a main memory. Transmission media include coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise a system bus coupled to the processor. Transmission media may include or convey acoustic waves, light waves and electromagnetic emissions, such as those generated during radio frequency (RF) and infrared (IR) data communications. Common forms of tangible computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, DVD, any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, any other physical medium with patterns of holes, a RAM, a PROM, an EPROM, a FLASH-EEPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, as described hereinafter, or any other medium from which a computer can read.","Configuration instructions  may be given in a platform-neutral format that may generally be universally understood by an applicable computing device within system , e.g., servers  of regional billing application . In one example, extensible markup language (XML) is used. The configuration instructions  may generally provide a platform for local applications such as the regional billing application  to provide information to central data store  indicating parameters for synchronizing, updating, or otherwise exchanging data with the local application. Exemplary configuration instructions , , (collectively, ) for exchanging data between the central data store  and local applications, e.g., regional billing application , as best seen in , are provided to generally define characteristics of the local applications relevant to the storage and updating of data associated with the information system . For example, the configuration instructions  may include specific parameters such as addresses or locations of servers , formats for storing data associated with a particular server , etc. The regional billing application  may thus communicate synchronization parameters to the central data store , or even be provided with information regarding the central data store  itself, e.g., parameters for communicating with the central data store , updating the configuration instructions , etc.","More specifically, as shown in , an NTAS synchronization process associated with the regional billing application  (i.e., \u201cNTAS Billing Sync Process\u201d) is defined, including the following parameters:\n\n","Additionally, the configuration instructions  may indicate groupings of parameters or environments associated with local applications, e.g., the states including the District of Columbia and Maryland (i.e., \u201cSTATE\u201d defined as \u201cMD\u201d and \u201cDC\u201d for \u201cBILLSYS1_DC_MD\u201d). Accordingly, the configuration instructions  will indicate that the information described above, e.g., destination server mapping, should be applied anytime a batch process is run to synchronize data relevant to the regional billing application  for data relevant to phone numbers in Maryland or the District of Columbia. Other characteristics of servers relevant to a given group of parameters (e.g., states) may also be included in the configuration instructions , such as formats used for data storage within a particular server , a listing of column headings included in a given data set stored on a particular server , or any other information that is convenient.","In one example, an NTAS batch process associated with the regional billing application  may include mappings for each of the servers  defined in XML instructions. Accordingly, when an NTAS billing synchronization batch process is initiated by one of the servers , the server  may determine which server(s)  support the relevant portion of data included in the central data store . For example, where server initiates a batch synchronization process for telephone listing data associated with New York, the server may read configuration instructions  to determine which server  supports data for a desired parameter or environment associated with the local application, i.e., New York. The server may thus read the specific section of the configuration instructions  relevant to the given parameter, here \u201cNew York,\u201d and obtain information or parameters describing how any data relevant to the \u201cNew York\u201d data should be synchronized with the server , e.g., destination server mappings, location or address data, or the like.","The central data store  may thus be provided with information describing how to synchronize data with various local applications without requiring a manual construction of each individual synchronization process. The servers  may generally employ a translation process that translates data maintained within central data store  to a format compatible with regional billing application  and\/or server . The translation process may include rules for mapping data associated with the central data store  into a model or schema established by the local applications such as regional billing application . As each local application relying upon the central data store  may present a unique data model, an associated translation process is generally customized to normalize each set of data associated with central data store  according to a configuration of the local applications as defined by the configuration instructions .","As stated above, the configuration instructions  may advantageously be platform-neutral or \u201ccontext-free\u201d such that the instructions  may be modified or otherwise written to by any other machine synchronizing or accessing data in the central data store . Accordingly, any context-free grammar format for configuration instructions  may be employed. For example, as described above the configuration instructions  illustrated in  include XML instructions. The provision of configuration instructions  in a generally universally recognized format, e.g., XML, allows the instructions , including file transfer protocol details, mappings to various destination servers , , to be automatically configurable by central data store  and\/or each local application as they are added to the information system  or modified. For example, any local application added on to information system  and placed in communication with central data store  that is not initially included in the configuration instructions  may synchronize data or portions thereof from the central data store  with hardware associated with the local application, e.g., servers, by adding instructions relevant to the newly added application to the configuration instructions .","Turning now to , B, and C, an exemplary XML schema  is illustrated that may be used by any local application, e.g., regional billing application , to interpret, modify, or add to configuration instructions . An XML schema may generally:\n\n","The exemplary XML schema  shown includes two general configuration sections, specifically a Common Section  and a Deploy Section . The Common Section , as shown in , includes non-application specific instructions for configuring a batch process, e.g., a metadata configuration for a given batch process run by the central data store . The Common Section  may thus define parameters relevant to the central data store . The Common Section  thus refers to information regarding synchronization parameters associated with the information system  that are independent of a particular environment or local application such as regional billing application , and therefore these parameters may be the same for a given batch process that is run by central data store  for different environments or applications. The Deploy Section , by contrast, generally provides environment-specific configurations for a given batch process, i.e., for the local applications. For example, the Deploy Section  may include configuration data for server for transferring data using a secure file transfer protocol for any request relevant to the application associated with the specific server ","The Deploy Section  may generally include three distinct levels or definitions of configuration instructions for the local applications or servers , or groups thereof. First, a GROUP level is included that defines a set of parameters or configurations for applications or environments that are grouped together, e.g., for the group of states associated with server , which are New York and Connecticut. For example, in some cases a synchronization batch process in a given server  might communicate or exchange data with a single external server , e.g., where each environment associated with the server  is also associated with the single server . Accordingly, a group based configuration may be defined for the server , as the server  will be the same for each environment associated with the server .","The Deploy Section  also includes an individual or PACKAGE level for batch processes that have a specific configuration based on an associated application or environment. The individual definitions may define exceptions to GROUP level definitions that are defined. For example, a batch process of the central data store  might use a group configuration from the GROUP level for all environments associated with a given application, e.g., all states covered by regional billing application , with a single exception where the application sends data to a different server than is defined for the group.","A third level may be defined in the Deploy Section  that provides a default configuration to be applied when no other definition is provided. Specifically, a DEFAULT option (not specifically shown in ) may be included within the PACKAGE level that includes default settings. A batch process of the central data store  may apply this DEFAULT definition, for example, when the central data store  exchanges data with a server that includes data parameters not specifically defined within the configuration instructions . For example, configuration instructions  may not have a GROUP or PACKAGE level detail relevant to certain states associated with a local application.","Any parameter associated with synchronization processes, e.g., batch processes, run by the central data store  may be provided within the configuration instructions  using the schema . As an example, some batch processes associated with a data synchronization process may use a parameter indicating a wait time before a batch attempts a retry operation after an unsuccessful attempt. Central data store  may use a same wait time for all batch processes, regardless of which application for which the batch process is synchronizing information. Accordingly, an exemplary XML definition is provided below that provides a maximum wait time for a retry operation (i.e., \u201cBATCH_SYN_MAX_WAIT_TIME\u201d) for all batch processes of central data store , as may be defined in a Common Section  of XML schema , as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0051"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"287pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"<!-- To define Common Section -->"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"273pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"<xs:complexType name=\u201cLocalDefs\u201d>"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"259pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"<xs:sequence>"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"245pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"<xs:element minOccurs=\u201c1\u201d name=\u201cBATCH_SYN_SLEEP_TIME\u201d"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"301pt","align":"left"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"type=\u201cxs:string\u201d \/>"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"245pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"<xs:element minOccurs=\u201c1\u201d name=\u201cBATCH_SYN_MAX_WAIT_TIME\u201d"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"301pt","align":"left"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"type=\u201cxs:string\u201d \/>"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"245pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<xs:element minOccurs=\u201c1\u201d name=\u201cRESTRICTED_STATES\u201d type=\u201cxs:string\u201d \/>"]},{"entry":[{},"<xs:element minOccurs=\u201c0\u201d name=\u201cVALID_STATES\u201d type=\u201cxs:string\u201d \/>"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"259pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"<\/xs:sequence>"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"273pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<\/xs:complexType>"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}},"br":{},"b":["102","204"]},"One example of a parameter that may be provided under the Deploy Section  is a file transfer definition (i.e., \u201cFILE_TRANSFER_DEFS\u201d below) that defines what configuration information is required for a given local application, e.g., regional billing application , in order to synchronize files from the central data store  with the local application. Configuration details for this parameter may tend to be specific to a particular application or group of applications. For instance, applications requiring greater security may prefer to synchronize data using a secure file transfer protocol (ftp) process, while applications that are not as security-intensive may employ a plain ftp method. To allow applications to select these different options, a \u201cTRANSFER_MODE\u201d definition may be placed under the \u201cFILE_TRANSFER_DEFS\u201d section of the Deploy Section  of XML schema , thereby allowing regional billing application  to define the desired file transfer mode. An exemplary file transfer definition (i.e., \u201cFILE_TRANSFER_DEFS\u201d) is shown below that specifies available transfer modes (i.e., \u201cTRANSFER_MODE\u201d) as secure ftp (\u201csftp\u201d),

now to , a process  for configuring instructions for a data exchange, e.g., in a batch process associated with a server  or  is described. An exemplary process  may run on any server, e.g., server , that is running a data synchronization process associated with central data store .","Process  may begin at step , where a central data store  is provided that includes data for a plurality of environments. For example, as described above a central data store  may be established that selectively transmits a portion of the data to a synchronized application  in a data synchronization process with the portion of the data being associated with at least one of the environments, e.g., a geographical location associated with the synchronized application. Process  may then proceed to step .","In step , configurable instructions are established in the central data store  that define a plurality of synchronization parameters associated with the synchronized application. For example, as described above configurable instructions  may be established that provide parameters used such as an address or location of servers included in the synchronized application. A wide variety of other parameters may be defined by the configurable instructions, including formats associated with a data storage structure of the synchronized application, e.g., column headings for data included in the synchronized application, or other information specific to the synchronized application enabling synchronization of the data associated with the synchronized application with that maintained in the central data store .","As described above, a database schema may be established for the central data store  that defines a layout for configurable instructions . For example, a schema in a generally platform-neutral format may be established, e.g., XML schema , that generally allows the central data store  to receive instructions from any local application in communication with the central data store . Local applications communicating with the central data store  may thus read the schema , and add parameters to the configurable instructions  defining data formats, server locations, or any other information required for a data synchronization process between the local application and the central data store .","Proceeding to step , at least one of the parameters is received, e.g., by central data store  from a local application. For example, as described above, a local application may use schema  to generate appropriate synchronization parameters and add them to configuration instructions . Process  may then proceed to step .","Proceeding to step , process  may modify at least one of the synchronization parameters via the central data store  based upon the environment(s) associated with the synchronized application. For example, as described above the configurable instructions  may define parameters associated with environments of the regional billing application  that is synchronizing data with the central data store . As described above an environment may include a geographical location associated with the local application, a function of the local application, or any other characteristic of the local application. The parameters may be modified, for example by a local application seeking to synchronize data of the central data store , when a local application provides parameters, e.g., by reading a schema  associated with the central data store  and adding any relevant synchronization parameters to the configurable instructions . Local applications may provide parameters and\/or updates to the parameters by communicating with central data store , e.g., via communication link , thereby modifying or updating the configurable instructions  directly and without manual intervention, e.g., by an administrator of the central data store .","Turning now to , one exemplary illustration of a sub-process  for modifying a synchronization parameter is explained in further detail. Sub-process  may thus be an example of a modification step, e.g., step  above. Sub-process  begins at step , where central data store  reads configuration instructions  associated with a synchronization process for a given local application, e.g., regional billing application . For example, where configuration instructions  are provided in an XML format, an associated XML schema document (XSD) such as that provided above in  may be employed to interpret the configuration instructions . Sub-process  may then proceed to step .","In step , process  establishes a default definition for a plurality of parameters associated with a data synchronization process, e.g., a synchronization process where regional billing application  synchronizes data relevant to a given environment with the data in central data store . For example, as described above a DEFAULT level of schema  may be read by a server .","Proceeding to step , the central data store  reads an environment-specific parameter, e.g., a \u201cPACKAGE_NAME\u201d parameter defined by schema  that indicates a unique identifier for each environment associated with the central data store . For example, the PACKAGE_NAME of server , NTASCP01PRD, indicates that it is a NTAS production environment for a production catalog (\u201cCP01PRD\u201d). A catalog may define a group of environments, e.g., states, that are stored in one database. The \u201cNTAS CP01\u201d catalog, as shown in , has telephone number and address data relevant to the states of Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia.","The central data store  may also read non-environment specific configuration details, e.g., from a Common Section  of configuration instructions . Non-environment specific configuration details may include details that are local to a batch process and not dependent on an environment associated with the local application, e.g., regional billing application .","Proceeding to step , central data store  queries whether a group configuration is associated with parameters of the synchronization process, e.g., an environment of regional billing application . For example, a server  running a batch synchronization process may read a GROUP name included in the configuration instructions  associated to the \u201cPACKAGE_NAME\u201d label. For example, the NTASCP01PRD label of a server  included in central data store  can be grouped under NTASPROD, MDVAWVDCPROD, or any other group definition that is convenient. If a GROUP name is given for the PACKAGE_NAME label, subprocess  proceeds to step .","In step , subprocess  queries whether parameters have been defined for the GROUP name determined in step . Where parameters are defined in the configuration instructions , subprocess  proceeds to step , where the central data store  will parse the XML configuration defined for the \u201cGROUP\u201d under the Deploy Section of the configuration instructions . Proceeding to step , the configuration parameters read in step  will override parameters read in under the default configuration, i.e., from step , wherever there is a conflict or different values provided for a same parameter. For example, if step  indicates that a default file naming convention for a batch process is \u201cFILE_NAME.DDMMYYYY,\u201d certain environments may employ a different file naming convention, e.g., \u201cFILE_NAME.DDMMYYYY.xxxxxx,\u201d where \u201cxxxxxx\u201d is replaced with text indicating an environment associated with the file. Therefore, in step  the file naming convention read under the default definition from step  will be overridden with the value obtained from the GROUP definition from step .","If no group definition is defined in the configuration instructions , subprocess  proceeds from step  to step .","In step , subprocess  queries whether a specific or \u201cpackage\u201d definition is provided, e.g., under the Deploy Section  of schema . Where a PACKAGE definition is provided, subprocess  proceeds to step , where the central data store  parses the XML file to read the specific \u201cPACKAGE\u201d section of the Deploy Section  provided in schema . Proceeding to step , configuration parameters read in the PACKAGE level will override any previous configuration values, e.g., in step  or step . Accordingly, if a batch process needs a specific configuration which is very unique to its particular environment and does not want to employ a GROUP level configuration common with other applications, then a specific configuration can be entered under the PACKAGE section of the DeploySection of schema .","If a PACKAGE definition is not provided, then the default definition or group definition is maintained, and subprocess  and process  may then terminate.","Reference in the specification to \u201cone example,\u201d \u201can example,\u201d \u201cone embodiment,\u201d or \u201can embodiment\u201d means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the example is included in at least one example.
