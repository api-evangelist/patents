{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF INVENTION","SUMMARY OF INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","EXAMPLES"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to aqueous dispersions and dispersion compounds that optionally include a filler. More specifically, the present invention relates to dispersions that are useful in the shoe industry.","2. Cross-Reference to Related Applications","This application is a 371 National Stage Application of International Application No. PCT\/US2006\/046494 filed on Dec. 4, 2006 entitled \u201cAQUEOUS POLYOLEFIN DISPERSIONS FOR TEXTILE IMPREGNATION,\u201d claiming priority from the U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/300,993, which is granted as U.S. Pat. No. 7,528,080, filed on Dec. 15, 2005 entitled \u201cAQUEOUS POLYOLEFIN DISPERSIONS FOR TEXTILE IMPREGNATION,\u201d the teachings of which are incorporated by reference herein as if reproduced in full hereinbelow.","3. Background Art","Many shoes incorporate stiffeners, such as toe boxes (a.k.a. toe cap, toe puff) and counters to retain the shape of the shoe throughout the active life of the shoe. A counter is a piece of heavy leather or other stiffening material inserted between the outside and the lining of the upper at the back part of the shoe. The purpose of the counter is to strengthen the back part of the shoe and to prevent it from sagging and losing its shape. A toe box is a stiffener used to maintain the shape of a shoe toe, preserve toe room within the shoe, and give reasonable protection to the wearer's foot.","Processes used for the manufacture of base sheets for stiffener production include filmic processes, impregnation processes, and sintering. The preferred process to employ often depends upon the desired stiffness of the finished product. For example, there are three types of toe boxes: rigid, flexible, and soft. Rigid toes include safety shoes. Flexible toes may be flexed by thumb pressure, yet have semi-rigid walls. Soft toes include those which are intended to merely preserve the toe form and give maximum comfort to the wearer. A filmic process may be preferred for a rigid safety shoe, as materials prepared by a filmic process are often more resilient compared to impregnated materials.","In a filmic process, a thermoplastic sheet can be extruded and laminated to a low weight textile (typically 20 g\/m), followed by hot melt coating of a polyurethane or polyamide adhesive. The function of the fabric is to provide a compatible layer between the extruded sheet and the adhesive layer. For example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,814,037, a shoe stiffener is formed from multilayer coextruded plastics.","In a sintering process, a thermoplastic powder, such as a polycaprolactone or a PVC-polycaprolactone (e.g. TONE\u2122, a linear polycaprolactone polyester available from The Dow Chemical Company) is applied onto a textile and sintered in an oven. For example, German Patent No. 2,621,195, discloses stiffening materials which are produced by melting powdered mixtures of plastics and fillers onto textile fabrics. Adhesives are then used to bind the stiffener to other parts of a shoe. In U.S. Pat. No. 4,717,496, the polyester used in the stiffening composition has both binding and adhesive properties.","In an impregnation process, a textile is impregnated with an emulsion or with a polymer solution. Impregnation systems can be water based or solvent based, and include SBR, natural and polychloroprene latexes, and styrenic polymers. The compatibility of the stiffener, fabric, and any adhesives used during shoe construction can affect the resiliency (lasting), stiffness, and shape retention of the stiffener and the shoe. For example, in GB 935,001, a heat activable shoe stiffener blank formed as a fibrous base is loaded or impregnated with PS, PVC, PVA, or an SB copolymer resin that stiffens after exposure to a solvent or to a temperature of 100\u00b0 C., yet remains softenable such that the material can be reshaped as needed. U.S. Pat. No. 4,507,357, further adds to the stiffening composition a plasticizer and an aminoplast. In both of these patents, low temperature processability was desired so as to protect other shoe parts from damage during manufacture. U.S. Pat. No. 6,391,380 discloses a stiffener composition which includes a latex forming resin and a powder adhesive polyester resin. To avoid softening during storage or exposure to moderate temperatures, U.S. Pat. No. 3,961,124 employs a stiffening composition having a crosslinkable resin and a peroxide initiator, thermosetting the stiffener during shoe manufacture.","Combinations of the above processes can also be used. For example, In U.S. Pat. No. 3,708,332, fabrics were impregnated with mixtures containing polystyrene and styrene-butadiene copolymers and coated with polycaprolactone to form shoe stiffener sheets.","Other patents related to stiffening compositions and shoe stiffeners include U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,284,872, 3,778,251, and 3,961,124; British Patents GB 2,102,851, 2,091,768, 2,024,279, 1,065,418, 1,062,498, and 1,036,790, and WO2003\/000810, among others.","Impregnated systems incorporating SBR, SB, polychloroprene, or a blend of polychloroprene and natural latex are common, as noted above. Each of these systems has drawbacks such as poor resiliency, elasticity, cost, curing requirements, and allergic properties, as well as potentially poor compatibility with other components in the shoe structure. In view of these drawbacks, there exists a need for suitable replacements for or alternatives to conventional latex stiffening compositions.","In one aspect, the present invention relates to a stiffening composition including a thermoplastic polyolefin that is formed as an aqueous dispersion suitable for impregnating a fibrous structure. In another aspect, a fibrous structure impregnated with such a stiffening composition can provide adequate stiffness, elasticity, resilience, adhesion, and shape retention for use in shoe stiffeners, such as toe boxes, counters, and the like. Use of a thermoplastic polyolefin stiffening composition is advantageous because it can further provide improved compatibility with other components in the shoe structure.","The present invention provides an article formed by impregnating a fibrous structure with a compound, the compound including an aqueous dispersion, and thereafter removing at least a portion of the water from the impregnated fibrous structure. The aqueous dispersion can include (a) at least one polymer selected from the group consisting of an ethylene-based thermoplastic polymer, a propylene-based thermoplastic polymer, and mixtures thereof, (b) at least one polymeric stabilizing agent; and (c) water.","The present invention also provides a method of forming a stiffened textile product comprising the steps of forming a compound, the compound including an aqueous dispersion containing at least one polymer selected from the group consisting of ethylene-based thermoplastic polymers, propylene-based thermoplastic polymers, and mixtures thereof, and thereafter impregnating a suitable textile with the compound, and allowing the impregnated textile to stiffen by removing at least a portion of the water from the impregnated textile structure. The method may include the steps of: forming a compound, the compound including an aqueous dispersion having (a) at least one polymer selected from the group consisting of an ethylene-based thermoplastic polymer, a propylene-based polymer, and mixtures thereof, (b) at least one polymeric stabilizing agent; and (c) water; impregnating the textile with the compound; and allowing the impregnated textile to stiffen. The impregnation and stiffening steps may be carried out by suitable methods known to those skilled in the art","Other aspects and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following description and the appended claims.","Embodiments of the present invention relate to articles manufactured by impregnating a fibrous structure with a dispersion that includes a base polymer and a stabilizing agent. The compositions thus formed are particularly useful in the shoe industry. Embodiments of the present invention are useful for manufacturing shoe stiffeners, such as toe boxes, counters, or the like.","In certain embodiments, a filler can be added to the dispersion to form a dispersion compound. For simplicity and clarity, dispersions and dispersion compounds will generally be referred to as dispersions herein.","As used herein, \u201ccopolymer\u201d refers to a polymer formed from two or more comonomers.

In some embodiments, the propylene\/ethylene copolymer or interpolymer is characterized as having substantially isotactic propylene sequences. The term \u201csubstantially isotactic propylene sequences\u201d and similar terms mean that the sequences have an isotactic triad (mm) measured by C NMR of greater than about 0.85, preferably greater than about 0.90, more preferably greater than about 0.92 and most preferably greater than about 0.93. Isotactic triads are well-known in the art and are described in, for example, U.S. Pat.

No. 11\/376,835 may be used as the base polymer. Such olefin block copolymer may be an ethylene\/\u03b1-olefin interpolymer:","(a) having a Mw\/Mn from about 1.7 to about 3.5, at least one melting point, Tm, in degrees Celsius, and a density, d, in grams\/cubic centimeter, wherein the numerical values of Tm and d corresponding to the relationship:\n\n2002.9+4538.5()\u22122422.2(); or\n","(b) having a Mw\/Mn from about 1.7 to about 3.5, and being characterized by a heat of fusion, \u0394H in J\/g, and a delta quantity, \u0394T, in degrees Celsius defined as the temperature difference between the tallest DSC peak and the tallest CRYSTAF peak, wherein the numerical values of \u0394T and \u0394H having the following relationships:\n\n\u03940.1299(\u0394)+62.81 for \u0394greater than zero and up to 130 J\/g,\n\n\u039448\u00b0 C. for \u0394greater than 130 J\/g,\n","wherein the CRYSTAF peak being determined using at least 5 percent of the cumulative polymer, and if less than 5 percent of the polymer having an identifiable CRYSTAF peak, then the CRYSTAF temperature being 30\u00b0 C.; or","(c) being characterized by an elastic recovery, Re, in percent at 300 percent strain and 1 cycle measured with a compression-molded film of the ethylene\/\u03b1-olefin interpolymer, and having a density, d, in grams\/cubic centimeter, wherein the numerical values of Re and d satisfying the following relationship when ethylene\/\u03b1-olefin interpolymer being substantially free of a cross-linked phase:\n\n1481\u22121629(); or\n","(d) having a molecular fraction which elutes between 40\u00b0 C. and 130\u00b0 C. when fractionated using TREF, characterized in that the fraction having a molar comonomer content of at least 5 percent higher than that of a comparable random ethylene interpolymer fraction eluting between the same temperatures, wherein said comparable random ethylene interpolymer having the same comonomer(s) and having a melt index, density, and molar comonomer content (based on the whole polymer) within 10 percent of that of the ethylene\/\u03b1-olefin interpolymer; or","(e) having a storage modulus at 25\u00b0 C., G\u2032(25\u00b0 C.), and a storage modulus at 100\u00b0 C., G\u2032(100\u00b0 C.), wherein the ratio of G\u2032(25\u00b0 C.) to G\u2032(100\u00b0 C.) being in the range of about 1:1 to about 9:1.","The ethylene\/\u03b1-olefin interpolymer may also:","(a) having a molecular fraction which elutes between 40\u00b0 C. and 130\u00b0 C. when fractionated using TREF, characterized in that the fraction having a block index of at least 0.5 and up to about 1 and a molecular weight distribution, Mw\/Mn, greater than about 1.3; or","(b) having an average block index greater than zero and up to about 1.0 and a molecular weight distribution, Mw\/Mn, greater than about 1.3.","Those having ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the above list is a non-comprehensive listing of suitable polymers. It will be appreciated that the scope of the present invention is restricted by the claims only.","Stabilizing Agent","Embodiments of the present invention use a stabilizing agent to promote the formation of a stable dispersion or emulsion. In selected embodiments, the stabilizing agent may be a surfactant, a polymer (different from the base polymer detailed above), or mixtures thereof. In certain embodiments, the stabilizing agent is a polar polymer, having a polar group as either a co-monomer or grafted monomer. In preferred embodiments, the stabilizing agent comprises one or more polar polyolefins, having a polar group as either a co-monomer or grafted monomer. Typical polymers include ethylene-acrylic acid (EAA) and ethylene-methacrylic acid copolymers, such as those available under the tradenames PRIMACOR\u2122, NUCREL\u2122, and ESCOR\u2122and described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,599,392, 4,988,781, and 5,938,437, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Other polymers include ethylene ethyl acrylate (EEA) copolymer, ethylene methyl methacrylate (EMMA), and ethylene butyl acrylate (EBA). Those having ordinary skill in the art will recognize that a number of other useful polymers may also be used.","If the polar group of the polymer is acidic or basic in nature, the stabilizing polymer may be partially or fully neutralized with a neutralizing agent to form the corresponding salt. For example, for EAA, the neutralizing agent is a base, such as ammonium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide. In another alternative, the neutralizing agent may, for example, be any amine such as monoethanolamine, or 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP). Those having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the selection of an appropriate neutralizing agent depends on the specific composition formulated, and that such a choice is within the knowledge of those of ordinary skill in the art.","Additional surfactants that may be useful in the practice of the present invention include cationic surfactants, anionic surfactants, or a non-ionic surfactants. Examples of anionic surfactants include sulfonates, carboxylates, and phosphates. Examples of cationic surfactants include quaternary amines. Examples of non-ionic surfactants include block copolymers containing ethylene oxide and silicone surfactants. Surfactants useful in the practice of the present invention can be either external surfactants or internal surfactants. External surfactants are surfactants that do not become chemically reacted into the polymer during dispersion preparation. Examples of external surfactants useful herein include salts of dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid and lauryl sulfonic acid salt. Internal surfactants are surfactants that do become chemically reacted into the polymer during dispersion preparation. An example of an internal surfactant useful herein includes 2,2-dimethylol propionic acid and its salts.","Fillers","Embodiments of the present invention employ a filler as part of the composition. In the practice of the present invention, a suitable filler loading in a polyolefin dispersion can be from about 0 to about 600 parts of filler per hundred parts of polyolefin. In certain embodiments, the filler loading in the dispersion can be from about 0 to about 200 parts of filler per hundred parts of a combined amount of the polyolefin and the polymeric stabilizing agent. The filler material can include conventional fillers such as milled glass, calcium carbonate, aluminum trihydrate, talc, antimony trioxide, fly ash, clays (such as bentonite or kaolin clays for example), or other known fillers.","Formulations","In preferred formulations, therefore, dispersions in accordance with the present invention may include a base polymer, which comprises at least one non-polar polyolefin, a stabilizing agent, which comprises at least one polar polyolefin, and optionally a filler. With respect to the base polymer and the stabilizing agent, in preferred embodiments, the at least one non-polar polyolefin may comprise between about 30% to 99% (by weight) of the total amount of base polymer and stabilizing agent in the composition. More preferably, the at least one non-polar polyolefin comprises between about 50% and about 80%. Still more preferably, the one or more non-polar polyolefins comprise about 70%.","With respect to the filler, typically, an amount greater than about 0 to about 1000 parts per hundred of the polymer (polymer meaning here the non-polar polyolefin combined with the stabilizing agent) is used. In selected embodiments, between about 50 to 250 parts per hundred are used. In selected embodiments, between about 10 to 500 parts per hundred are used. In still other embodiments, from between about 20 to 400 parts per hundred are used. In other embodiments, from about 0 to about 200 parts per hundred are used.","These solid materials are preferably dispersed in a liquid medium, which in preferred embodiments is water. In preferred embodiments, sufficient base is added to neutralize the resultant dispersion to achieve a pH range of between about 6 to about 14. In preferred embodiments, sufficient base is added to maintain a pH of between about 9 to about 12. Water content of the dispersion is preferably controlled so that the solids content is between about 1% to about 74% (by volume). In another embodiment, the solid content is between about 25% to about 74% (by volume). In particularly preferred embodiments, the solids range is between about 30% to about 50% (without filler, by weight).","In certain embodiments, a fibrous structure or textile impregnated with a compound can have a combined amount of the at least one polymer and the polymeric stabilizing agent in the range of about 10 to about 150 parts per hundred parts by weight of the textile. In other embodiments, a fibrous structure or textile impregnated with a compound can have a combined amount of the filler, the at least one polymer and the polymeric stabilizing agent in the range of about 10 to about 600 parts per hundred parts by weight of the textile; from about 10 to about 300 parts in other embodiments.","Dispersions formed in accordance with embodiments of the present invention are characterized in having an average particle size of between about 0.3 to about 3.0 microns. In other embodiments, dispersions have an average particle size of from about 0.5 \u03bcm to about 2.7 \u03bcm. In other embodiments, from about 0.8 \u03bcm to about 1.2 \u03bcm. By \u201caverage particle size\u201d, the present invention means the volume-mean particle size. In order to measure the particle size, laser-diffraction techniques may be employed for example. A particle size in this description refers to the diameter of the polymer in the dispersion. For polymer particles that are not spherical, the diameter of the particle is the average of the long and short axes of the particle. Particle sizes can be measured on a Beckman-Coulter LS230 laser-diffraction particle size analyzer or other suitable device.","For example, a formulation of the present invention can include surfactants, frothing agents, dispersants, thickeners, fire retardants, pigments, antistatic agents, reinforcing fibers, antioxidants, a neutralizing agent, a rheology modifier, preservatives, biocides, acid scavengers, a wetting agent, and the like. While optional for purposes of the present invention, other components can be highly advantageous for product stability during and after the manufacturing process.","In addition, embodiments of the present invention optionally include a filler wetting agent. A filler wetting agent generally may help make the filler and the polyolefin dispersion more compatible. Useful wetting agents include phosphate salts, such as sodium hexametaphosphate. A filler wetting agent can be included in a composition of the present invention at a concentration of at least about 0.5 part per 100 parts of filler, by weight.","Furthermore, embodiments of the present invention may optionally include a thickener. Thickeners can be useful in the present invention to increase the viscosity of low viscosity dispersions. Thickeners suitable for use in the practice of the present invention can be any known in the art such as for instance poly-acrylate type or associate non ionic thickeners such as modified cellulose ethers. For example, suitable thickeners include ALCOGUM\u2122 VEP-II (trade name of Alco Chemical Corporation), RHEOVIS\u2122 and VISCALEX\u2122 (trade names of Ciba Ceigy), UCAR\u00ae Thickener 146, or ETHOCEL\u2122 or METHOCEL\u2122 (trade names of the Dow Chemical Company) and PARAGUM\u2122 241 (trade name of Para-Chem Southern, Inc.), or BERMACOL\u2122 (trademark of Akzo Nobel) or AQUALON\u2122 (trademark of Hercules) or ACUSOL\u00ae (trademark of Rohm and Haas). Thickeners can be used in any amount necessary to prepare a dispersion of desired viscosity.","The ultimate viscosity of the dispersion is, therefore, controllable. Addition of the thickener to the dispersion including the amount of filler can be done with conventional means to result in viscosities as needed. Viscosities of thus dispersions can reach +3000 cP (Brookfield spindle 4 with 20 rpm) with moderate thickener dosing (up to 4% preferably, below 3% based on 100 phr of polymer dispersion). The starting polymer dispersion as described has an initial viscosity prior to formulation with fillers and additives between 20 and 1000 cP (Brookfield viscosity measured at room temperature with spindle RV3 at 50 rpm). Still more preferably, the starting viscosity of the dispersion may be between about 100 to about 600 cP.","Also, embodiments of the present invention are characterized by their stability when a filler is added to the polymer\/stabilizing agent. In this context, stability refers to the stability of viscosity of the resultant aqueous polyolefin dispersion. In order to test the stability, the viscosity is measured over a period of time. Preferably, viscosity measured at 20\u00b0 C. should remain +\/\u221210% of the original viscosity over a period of 24 hours, when stored at ambient temperature.","In a specific embodiment, a base polymer, a stabilizing agent, and a filler are melt-kneaded in an extruder along with water and a neutralizing agent, such as ammonia, potassium hydroxide, or a combination of the two to form a dispersion compound. Those having ordinary skill in the art will recognize that a number of other neutralizing agents may be used. In some embodiments, the filler may be added after blending the base polymer and stabilizing agent. In other preferred embodiments, the filler may be added after the dispersion is formed.","Any melt-kneading means known in the art may be used. In some embodiments, a kneader, a BANBURY\u00ae mixer, single-screw extruder, or a multi-screw extruder is used. A process for producing the dispersions in accordance with the present invention is not particularly limited. One preferred process, for example, is a process comprising melt-kneading the above-mentioned components according to U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,756,659 and 6,455,636.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["20","30","40","50","40","50","20"]},"Resin in the form of pellets, powder or flakes is fed from the feeder  to an inlet  of the extruder  where the resin is melted or compounded. In some embodiments, the dispersing agent is added to the resin through and along with the resin and in other embodiments, the dispersing agent is provided separately to the twin screw extruder . The resin melt is then delivered from the mix and convey zone to an emulsification zone of the extruder where the initial amount of water and base from the reservoirs  and  is added through inlet . In some embodiments, dispersing agent may be added additionally or exclusively to the water stream. In some embodiments, the emulsified mixture is further diluted with additional water inlet  from reservoir  in a dilution and cooling zone of the extruder . Typically, the dispersion is diluted to at least 30 weight percent water in the cooling zone. In addition, the diluted mixture may be diluted any number of times until the desired dilution level is achieved. In some embodiments, water is not added into the twin screw extruder  but rather to a stream containing the resin melt after the melt has exited from the extruder. In this manner, steam pressure build-up in the extruder  is eliminated.","Advantageously, by using an extruder in certain embodiments, the base polymer and the stabilizing agent may be blended in a single process to form a dispersion. Also, advantageously, by using one or more of the stabilizing agents listed above, the dispersion is stable with respect to the filler and other additives. Prior formulations involving polyolefin base polymers were unstable with respect to the filler.","Advantageously, polyolefin dispersions formed in accordance with the embodiments disclosed herein provide the ability to apply the dispersion to or to impregnate the dispersion into films, sheets, fabrics, or fibers and achieve good adhesive properties, and to maintain a flexible laminate. In specific embodiments, the inventors have also discovered that dispersions disclosed herein have good adhesion to polar substrates.","In some embodiments, a polyolefin dispersion or dispersion compound may be applied to a fibrous structure using any application method known to those skilled in the art. In other embodiments, a fibrous structure may be impregnated with a polyolefin dispersion or dispersion compound. In certain embodiments, fibrous structures can include textiles, geotextiles, and natural fibers. In certain embodiments, the fibrous structure may be cotton, wool, synthetic wool, cellulosics including rayon, synthetic fibers of polyamide, polyacrylonitrile, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene chloride, polypropylenes, polyesters, or combinations thereof. In other embodiments, the fibrous structure may be flax, hemp, cellulose, pulp, wood, or combinations thereof.","When preparing foams, it is often preferred to froth the dispersion. Preferred in the practice of this invention is the use of a gas as a frothing agent. Examples of suitable frothing agents include: gases and\/or mixtures of gases such as, air, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, argon, helium, and the like. Particularly preferable is the use of air as a frothing agent. Frothing agents are typically introduced by mechanical introduction of a gas into a liquid to form a froth. This technique is known as mechanical frothing. In preparing a frothed polyolefin backing, it is preferred to mix all components and then blend the air or gas into the mixture, using equipment such as an OAKES, MONDO, or FIRESTONE frother.","Surfactants useful for preparing a stable froth are referred to herein as foam stabilizers. Foam stabilizers are useful in the practice of the present invention. Those having ordinary skill in this field will recognize that a number of foam stabilizers may be used. Foam stabilizers can include, for example, sulfates, succinamates, and sulfosuccinamates.","In one embodiment of the present invention, shown in flowchart form in , a polyolefin dispersion is formed (ST ). Next, the dispersion is frothed (ST ), which may, for example, be done by mechanically mixing with air. A fabric, fiber, sheet, or film is then contacted with the froth (ST ). For example, the froth can be coated or spread onto a fabric, or a fabric can be immersed in the froth. In selected embodiments, the polyolefin dispersion is applied at about 65\u00b0 C. to about 125\u00b0 C. In other embodiments, the polyolefin dispersion is applied at about 70\u00b0 C. to about 120\u00b0 C. In preferred embodiments, the polyolefin dispersion is applied at about 85\u00b0 C. to about 95\u00b0 C.","The dispersion impregnated into a substrate, for example, the fibrous structure, as described hereinabove, may be dried via any conventional drying method. Such conventional drying methods include but, are not limited to, air drying, convection oven drying, hot air drying, microwave oven drying, and\/or infrared oven drying.

The dispersion impregnated into a substrate, for example, the fibrous structure, as described hereinabove, may be dried at a temperature in the range of about 60\u00b0 F. (15.5\u00b0 C.) to about 700\u00b0 F. (371\u00b0 C. All individual values and subranges from about 60\u00b0 F. (15.5\u00b0 C.) to about 700\u00b0 F.

The temperature of the dispersion impregnated into a substrate, for example, the fibrous structure, as described hereinabove, may be raised to a temperature in the range of equal or greater than the melting point temperature of the base polymer for a period of less than about 40 minutes. All individual values and subranges from less than about 40 minutes are included herein and disclosed herein; for example, the temperature of the dispersion impregnated into a substrate, for example, the fibrous structure, as described hereinabove, may be raised to a temperature in the range of equal or greater than the melting point temperature of the base polymer for a period of less than about 20 minutes, or in the alternative, the temperature of the dispersion impregnated into a substrate, for example, the fibrous structure, as described hereinabove, may be raised to a temperature in the range of equal or greater than the melting point temperature of the base polymer for a period of less than about 10 minutes, or in another alternative, the temperature of the dispersion impregnated into a substrate, for example, the fibrous structure, as described hereinabove, may be raised to a temperature in the range of equal or greater than the melting point temperature of the base polymer for a period in the range of about 0.5 to 600 seconds. In another alternative, the temperature of the dispersion impregnated into a substrate, for example, the fibrous structure, as described hereinabove, may be raised to a temperature in the range of less than the melting point temperature of the base polymer for a period of less than 40 minutes.

For example, impregnation can be controlled by pressing the fabric between calenders, removing excess material. Impregnation can additionally be controlled, for example, by adjusting one or more of the viscosity of the compound, the concentration of the combined polymer and stabilizer in the aqueous dispersion, the concentration of the filler in the compound, or the polarity of the aqueous dispersion.","In certain embodiments, the impregnated textile can have a combined amount of the at least one polymer and the polymeric stabilizing agent in the range of about 15 to about 75 parts per hundred by weight of the impregnated textile. To maintain the desired degree of impregnation, for example, in certain embodiments, the polyolefin can be controlled in the range from about 35 to about 55 percent by weight of the aqueous dispersion. In other embodiments, the polyolefin can be controlled in the range from about 40 to about 50 percent by volume of the aqueous dispersion. In other embodiments, the viscosity of the compound can be controlled in the range from about 20 to about 3000 cP.","One skilled in the art will appreciate that a desirable degree or amount of impregnation can range from a partial saturation of the fibrous structure to a complete saturation of the fibrous structure. The desired degree of impregnation can depend upon variables including the nature of the fiber being impregnated and the nature of impregnate, for example. One skilled in the art will also appreciate that the intended end properties of the impregnated structure will influence the selection of the specific ingredients (fibers and dispersions, for example) and processing parameters.","In a particular embodiment, a fibrous structure impregnated with a polyolefin dispersion can be used as a stiffener in shoes. For example, a fibrous structure can be impregnated, formed, and dried, where the forming results in an upper assembly stiffener, such as a counter or a toe puff (toe box), which can be incorporated into a shoe to assist in retaining the respective portions of the shoe in a desired configuration.","Polymer dispersions. Two polyolefin dispersions were used throughout these examples, and comprised a base polymer\/stabilizing agent mix. The first was formed using a VERSIFY\u2122 DP4200\/PRIMACOR\u2122 5980I mixture, and the second using an ENGAGE\u2122 8200\/PRIMACOR\u2122 5980I mixture, each of which is available from The Dow Chemical Company (Midland, Mich.). PRIMACOR\u2122 5980I is an ethylene acrylic acid copolymer (20.5 weight percent acrylic acid; MFR of 13.8, using a 2.16 kg weight at 125\u00b0 C.; 0.958 g\/cc); VERSIFY\u2122 DP4200 is a propylene-based elastomer (9 mole percent ethylene; 25 MFR, using a 2.16 kg weight at 230\u00b0 C.); ENGAGE\u2122 8200 is an ethylene-based elastomer (ethylene-octene copolymer; 5 MI; 0.870 g\/cc).","The VERSIFY\u2122 DP4200\/PRIMACOR\u2122 5980I dispersion was produced by simultaneously feeding DP4200 pellets at 13.9 lb\/hr and 5980I pellets at 2.9 lb\/hr into an extruder feed funnel. Deionized water and a 25% (w\/w) aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide were pumped at 19 and 8.3 cc\/min, respectively, combined, heated to about 160\u00b0 C., and injected into the extruder barrel at the emulsification zone, where the barrels were operated at about 150\u00b0 C. Deionized water was pumped at 90 cc\/min, heated to about 110\u00b0 C., and injected into the extruder barrel at the dilution section where the barrels were operated at about 80\u00b0 C. Product dilution was controlled at a pressure of about 300 psig. The resulting VERSIFY\u2122 DP4200\/PRIMACOR\u2122 5980I dispersion had a solids content of 51.6 weight percent, a pH of about 10.0, a volume-mean particle size of about 1.0 micron as measured by a Beckman Coulter LS 230, and a polydispersity (defined as the volume-mean particle size divided by the number mean particle size) of less than 2.","The ENGAGE\u2122 8200\/PRIMACOR\u2122 5980I dispersion was produced by first pre-blending 8200 pellets with 5980I pellets at a 70\/30 ratio. The blend was fed as ambient pellets into the extruder feed funnel at 15 lb\/hr. Deionized water and a 25% (w\/w) aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide were pumped at 14.6 and 15.3 cc\/min respectively, combined, heated to about 130\u00b0 C., and injected into the extruder barrel at the emulsification zone, where the barrels were operated at about 130\u00b0 C. Deionized water was pumped at 85 cc\/min, heated to about 75\u00b0 C., and injected into the extruder barrel at the dilution section where the barrels were operated at about 70\u00b0 C. The diluted product passed through a back-pressure regulator set at about 300 PSIG, exited the process at about 70\u00b0 C., and was collected.

The test specimen  was then heat activated by heating the assembly in an oven at 95\u00b0 C. for 8.5 minutes. The heat activated assembly was removed from the oven and the test specimen  was promptly formed into a dome shape (within about a minute), by extending piston  as illustrated by . The formed test specimen  was then left in a standard controlled environment of 20\u00b0 C. and 65% relative humidity in front of a fan for at least 1.5 hours.","Hardness, commonly referred to as compression strength of a formed dome, provides a measure of the strength of the stiffener in a way that corresponds to wear performance conditions. The top of the formed dome was compressed at a constant rate in a tensile testing machine using a cylindrical plunger with a level lower surface until it collapses. The maximum value was recorded as the initial hardness. This operation was repeated and after nine additional collapses, the load for the tenth collapse was measured and recorded as final hardness. Compression strength of a domed test specimen was measured according to SATRA TM83. Hardness can range from 10 N, for a fashion shoe, to 180 N for military footwear.","Area shape retention was measured according to SATRA TM83. A domed specimen was formed and the shape retention of the test specimen was determined by measuring the height of the dome. Two measurements were taken: after the first (initial compression of the dome) and a after ten collapses (final shape retention). Area shape retention is defined as:\n\n100(12)\n\nwhere H is the height of the relevant forming tool (the dome of the metal mold) and H is the internal height of formed dome after first or tenth collapse, as illustrated in . The harder the stiffener, the higher the shape retention to avoid the deformation of the shoe.\n","Resiliency is calculated according to SATRA TM83, and is defined as the ratio of final hardness (after 10 load collapses) to initial hardness. Resiliency provides a measure of the resistance to small and large deformations during wear.","Standard CRYSTAF Method","Branching distributions are determined by crystallization analysis fractionation (CRYSTAF) using a CRYSTAF 200 unit commercially available from PolymerChar, Valencia, Spain.
