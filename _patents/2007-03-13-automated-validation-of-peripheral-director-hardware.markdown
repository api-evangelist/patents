{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The invention relates generally managing complex switching fabrics, and more particularly to a system and method of automating the validation and control of peripheral director hardware in a switched fabric network.","In large complex information technology (IT) infrastructures, challenges exist in controlling and testing what is referred to as a \u201cswitched fabric\u201d or \u201cswitched fabric network.\u201d A switched fabric is a computer network topology where many devices connect with each other via switches (also referred to herein as switching points, nodes or directors). Switched fabric networks are different from typical hierarchical switched networks (e.g., Ethernet) in that switched fabric networks naturally support redundant paths between multiple devices, forming a mesh network with devices being on the \u201cedges\u201d of the mesh. One of the advantages of this topology is failover, meaning that in case one link breaks or a switch is out of order, datagrams (e.g., packets) can traverse alternate paths. Another is scalability, meaning that more switches can be added as the number of endpoints increases so the route length (and thus, latency and throughput) can remain constant for point-to-point datagrams.","One of the challenges in implementing and maintaining a switched fabric is the fact that many different devices must be able to talk to each other via the various switching points. Accordingly, there are many possible states for all of the switching points, which make configuring the switched fabric error prone. Currently, there exist no automated solutions for controlling and testing switched fabric networks.","The present invention addresses the above-mentioned problems, as well as others, by providing system and method of automating the validation and control of peripheral director hardware in a switched fabric network.","In a first aspect, the invention provides a director control system for controlling directors in a switched fabric network, comprising: a script language processor for interpreting high-level statements and generating command functions understood by an application programming interface (API) associated with the switched fabric network, wherein the command functions include a query switch command, a query interface switch command, a write switch command, and a display result command; and a system for generating an output in response to a set of command functions submitted to the switched fabric network.","In a second aspect, the invention provides a computer program product stored on a computer readable medium for controlling directors in a switched fabric network, comprising: program code for interpreting high-level statements and generating command functions understood by an application programming interface (API) associated with the switched fabric network, wherein the command functions include a query switch command, a query interface switch command, a write switch command, and a display result command; and program code for generating an output in response to a set of command functions submitted to the switched fabric network.","In a third aspect, the invention provides a method of controlling directors in a switched fabric network, comprising: providing a set of high-level statements for controlling at least one node in the switched fabric network; processing the high-level statements and generating command functions understood by an application programming interface (API) associated with the switched fabric network, wherein the command functions are selected from the group consisting of: a query switch command, a query interface switch command, a write switch command, and a display result command; submitting the command functions to the switched fabric network via the API; and generating an output in response to the command functions submitted to the switched fabric network.","In a fourth aspect, the invention provides method for deploying director control system for controlling directors in a switched fabric, comprising: providing a computer infrastructure being operable to: interpret high-level statements and generate command functions understood by an application programming interface (API) associated with the switched fabric network, wherein the command functions include a query switch command, a query interface switch command, a write switch command, and a display result command; and generate an output in response to a set of command functions submitted to the switched fabric network.","Referring now to drawings,  depicts a switched fabric network  comprising various components (e.g., C-C) and switching points or directors (e.g., S-S). Generally speaking, each director includes an addressable port that can be manipulated by one or more commands defined by an application programming interface (API)  associated with the switched fabric network. Coupled to switched fabric network  is a computer system  that includes a server , application programming interface (API)  and a director control system . Director control system  provides a mechanism through which high-level statements  or scripts  can be processed and converted into a set of API-specific commands. This thus allows switched fabric network  to be more easily controlled, i.e., set up, tested, interrogated, etc.","Director control system  includes a script language processor  that interprets \u201chigh level\u201d statements  or scripts ; and generates a set of command functions  to allows director control system  to interface with the switching points (e.g., S-S) and ports in the switch fabric network  via API  and server . In particular, director control system  allows a user, script, other program or system, etc., to set up, test, and interrogate switched fabric network  without extensive manual labor.","In one illustrative embodiment, director control system  is implemented as a REXX program that runs under z\/OS and uses the API  of System Automation for z\/OS to exercise ESCON and FICON directors. In the embodiment shown in , director control system  can issue four command functions  via API . The command functions  include Query Switch command , Query Interface Switch command , Write Switch (Writeswch) command , and Display Results command . These command functions  are generated by script language processor  in response to a set of statements  or script  written in a high-level script language described below.","Director control system  may be implemented as a program that runs as a batch job. Its input may consist of one ore more command scripts , telling director control system  what to do with which directors and ports. Each command script  may comprise one or more tests that consist of one or more commands to query a director, check for certain errors, and\/or modify a port definition or status. In an alternative embodiment, input may consist of statements , e.g., entered via a user interface or from another program.","Output of director control system  output consists of a log file  and a report . Log file  contains every bit of data sent to or received from each director, which is useful for bit-level analysis if something does not work. Report  shows, for each test, the script statements that define the test, any error messages that are produced, and any information that is produced in response to the input, e.g., command script . Extensive error checking is performed, and all errors are reported. This even includes such things as a reserved bit being nonzero in a query response. Report  presents a detailed record of each test, what it was trying to do, and what it did.","Command Functions","As noted, an existing control API  includes predefined commands for interfacing with directors and ports in a switched fabric network . In this illustrative embodiment, the commands are as follows:","Query Switch command  returns a response block consisting of, e.g., 256 80-byte records, one for each possible port address allowed by the director architecture. These records contain definition and status information about each port. Query Switch command  is used to investigate the state of a director, e.g., determining what components are behind the director, and what the status of the director is. For example, Query Switch command  can be used to investigate whether data can flow to a component, whether there are any logical or physical faults, etc.","Query Interface Switch command  is similar, but returns more data, e.g., 360 bytes for each of the 256 possible port addresses. Query Interface Switch command  can be used to query all details associated with a director, and is utilized, for instance, when detailed diagnostics are required.","Writeswch command  sends a variable number of, e.g., 80-byte records to the director, each one of which can effect one or more changes, e.g., changing the port's logical name and\/or how it is switched to other ports, etc. Writeswch command  is thus utilized to alter the status of a director, for example turning it on or off, etc.","Display Results command  is only used when an error occurs on a Writeswch command . Display Results command  asks the API  to provide further details about the error.","Status information about a director can for instance be determined by analyzing entries in the port associated with the director. For example, a first predefined bit in a port's entry obtained in the response to a Query Switch command  or Query Interface Switch command  indicates whether or not that port is implemented. Similarly, a second predefined bit in a port's entry obtained in the response to a Query Switch command  or Query Interface Switch command  indicates whether or not that port is installed.","A Prohibit Dynamic Connection Mask (PCDM), or \u201cdynamic mask\u201d, is also defined that provides a 256-bit control string that is implemented for each port within a director. Each bit corresponds to a port address (00-FF). If the bit is \u201c1\u201d, dynamic connections with the corresponding port are \u201cprohibited\u201d; if it is \u201c0\u201d dynamic connections are \u201callowed\u201d.","Script Language","Script language processor  may be implemented in any manner to generate commands understood by API , and generally is implemented to allow for high-level statements that can be readily understood by a user. The following is an example of a set of such statements, where an asterisk (*) denotes a comment, and a plus sign (+) in the first column indicates an operation that is to be performed within the same Writeswch record as the previous operation (hence it must operate on the same port).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"\u2002IDENT Test 114-2042 7D Mod 256 Ser 13123B8 Addr 007D"]},{"entry":[{},"* This is a comment line with supplementary or"]},{"entry":[{},"* \u2003descriptive information about this test."]},{"entry":[{},"\u2002NAME 007D.1D 2105SJ99.1.3.2 \u2003\u2003\u2003* rename port 1D"]},{"entry":[{},"+ MASK-C 007D.1D \u2003\u2003\u2003* replace PDCM; prohibit all ports"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}},"br":{}},"Listed below describe the various statement types supported by an illustrative embodiment of the script language processor .

An italicized word indicates that the word should be replaced by some value. Items within curly braces ({ . . . }) are optional.","Comment","A Comment statement is identified by an asterisk in the first column. Comments are copied to the report data set, but are otherwise ignored. Also, in any other script statement, an asterisk, along with everything that comes after it, is a comment. A completely blank line is also treated as a comment.","IDENT {text}","IDENT is a required statement that identifies each test that is being performed. All statements following an IDENT statement, down to but not including the next IDENT, constitute one test definition. The IDENT statement contains \u201cIDENT\u201d as the first word. Any text following the word \u201cIDENT\u201d is reproduced as an identifier on the second line of each report page for that particular test. This will typically be the type, model and serial number of the director being tested, and\/or something about the purpose of the test.","QSW address option","QSW performs a Query Switch command .
