title: Social network stealth and counter messaging
abstract: Stealth and counter messaging, in some embodiments in the context of social networking sites, is disclosed. A first user may provide a first, counter-message along with a second, stealth message. When posting the first message, its corresponding identifier as set by the social networking site is recorded in a linked relationship to the second message. When an authorized second user retrieves the first message from the social networking site, its identifier is queried to determine whether there is a corresponding second message. After locating the identifier for the first message, the associated second message is retrieved and transmitted to the second user.

Technical Field","The present disclosure relates generally to electronic communications and social networking systems. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to social network stealth and counter messaging.","2. Related Art","As a communications tool, the Internet has grown well beyond its research and scientific roots, and is now ubiquitous throughout all aspects of daily work and personal lives. Much of business and communications pertaining thereto are conducted electronically over e-mail, instant messaging systems, and teleconferencing systems that all utilize the data transfer capabilities of the Internet. Documents and other media necessary for business are also stored and exchanged electronically. Furthermore, various automated transactions such as the purchase of goods, banking, and even government-related filings may be completed over web-based applications and websites that are accessible remotely from any location at any time.","Along with the increasing use of the Internet for such business and commercial purposes, so is the use for entertainment and social purposes. Currently, one of the most popular sites accessed online are social networking services, in which users establish connections with other users to share information.","There are numerous social networking sites that are currently in operation, and each generally provides a slightly different user experience that caters to different needs and uses than the others. Some of these differences are by design and inherent to the features of the social networking site, while other differences may simply stem from the perceived environment to which the users conform their activities. For example, services such as Facebook (www.facebook.com), MySpace (www.myspace.com), and Google+ (plus.google.com) may take on a more leisurely atmosphere, while a service such as LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com) is more work-oriented, where the focus is more on the professional accomplishments and business relationships of the users. A service such as Twitter (www.twitter.com) may be suitable for broadcasting short, limited length messages to the users' network of \u201cfollowers,\u201d and a service such as Flickr (www.flickr.com) may be limited on the sharing of photographs.","In most cases, the connections or networks that the users establish mirror those of the participants' real-life friendships and associations. However, relationships may also be formed solely online based upon common interests or activities, particularly where the participants are located in disparate geographic areas. Because of the varying uses, one person may have accounts on more than one of the aforementioned social networking sites and others, and information shared on one site may be cross-shared on another site.","The primary feature that is common amongst most social network sites is the user profile. Users establish an account with the social networking site by providing a name and other identifying information, and before any action may be taken in connection with the user profile, the user logs in to the account by supplying an account identifier and a password. The profile may include biographic data such as birthday, gender, current location, schools attended, employment experiences, and personal relationships for searching and viewing by other users. Further information that may provide an even more detailed picture of the profile owner and his personality may be added, such as religious affiliation, personal philosophies, tastes in music, literature, cinema, television, athletic teams, and so on.","Links to other users or contacts may be formally established and publicized on a user's profile as well, which may then permit direct communications via e-mail like messages between the user and the contacts. In some systems, real-time chat with concurrently online contacts may also be possible. Access to the profile information may be restricted based upon the level of affiliation to its owner. For example, contacts having a direct \u201cfriendship\u201d link to a given user may be able to view the complete profile information thereof, while those having only a secondary affiliation (friend of a friend) may be able to view only the basic biographic information. The establishment of a friendship \u201cnetwork\u201d is understood to facilitate new users to the social network to establish their own direct links to common friends.","Specific user-to-user communications is a significant aspect of most social networking services, but another feature which perhaps eclipses this is the broadcasting of information to everyone within the user's circle of contacts. Specific names and implementations may vary, with some social networking services referring to this feature as a \u201cwall,\u201d while others refer to this feature as \u201ccomments,\u201d \u201ctweets,\u201d or others. Regardless of the terminology employed, the feature is essentially the same\u2014a variety of content can be posted by the profile owner or by the profile owner's contacts for viewing by those within the user's network of friends. This content may include text messages, Uniform Resource Locator (URLS) including links to other webpages, photographs, and videos. With the proliferation of GPS (Global Positioning Satellite)-enabled mobile devices with Internet access capabilities, location coordinate data may also be posted. There may be enhancements to the display of the foregoing data, such as showing the location on a map overlaid on the rendered page, or a preview of the webpage for a link.","Oftentimes personal and social lives are kept sharply segregated from work or professional lives. Conduct or activities that may be acceptable within a person's social circles may be deemed completely inappropriate or undesirable within that person's professional circles. It is the rare individual who can seamlessly blend social and professional identities without the risk of repercussions. For example, a person's drinking exploits or frequenting of establishments of questionable repute may be entertaining for friends, but may not be well taken by employers, supervisors, co-workers, and clients.","With social networking services permitting, and indeed encouraging users to post and share all kinds of information, including that which may not be the most professionally advisable, many an unwary social networking user has been unable to exercise discretion and restraint, shared too much, and suffered the consequences. As a result, there have been many instances of imprudent posts that led to dismissals from employment and irreparable reputational damage amongst colleagues. Along these lines, before extending an offer of employment, employers now frequently search social networking sites for obvious red flags and problematic posts that may render a candidate unsuitable. Even within social circles, publicizing certain information may lead to broken friendships and broken romantic relationships.","Earlier implementations of social networking sites did not provide the user with much control over what information was shared with which contacts. Improvements in privacy settings and independent restriction control for each piece of content posted or otherwise associated with the profile has reduced the likelihood of inadvertent disclosure to certain undesired contacts. Still other social networking sites such as Google+ have been built around the concept of grouping contacts into subsets, referred to as \u201ccircles,\u201d with the user having the power to designate which content is visible to which of the \u201ccircles.\u201d","Notwithstanding these additional privacy measures, it may be desirable to post some content, as these \u201con or off\u201d content access limits may result in some contacts not seeing any information at all. There is a delicate balance to be maintained between the sharing and restricting of posts to avoid offending those contacts with which the user would rather not share much of his personal life, but with which the user would nevertheless like to maintain connections for various reasons. Accordingly, there is a need in the art for an improved social network stealth and counter messaging.","The present disclosure contemplates various methods and systems for stealth and counter messaging on a social networking site, an Internet message board, or other interactive communications services. One embodiment contemplates a method for transforming messages that are posted by users, and may include a step of receiving from an originating client a first message and a second message associated therewith. This step may also involve receiving a first access token specific to a first user of the social networking service site that is associated with the originating client. Thereafter, the method may continue with transmitting a message post command to the social networking service site. The message post command may include the first message and the first access token. Additionally, there may be a step of receiving from the social networking service site a first message identifier corresponding to the first message. The first message identifier may be generated in response to the message post command and a validation of the first access token. There may further be a step of storing the second message and the first message identifier in a linked relationship for retrieval based upon a query for the first message identifier. The method may include a step of transmitting a confirmation message to the originating client in response to receiving the first message identifier.","There is also contemplated an alternative method for transforming messages that are posted by users. This method may include receiving from an originating client a message post request including a first message posted to the social networking service site, a first message identifier corresponding to the first message, and a second message associated with the first message. Thereafter, the method may include the step of storing the message identifier in a linked relationship to the second message. There may also be a step of transmitting a confirmation message to the originating client following the storing of the message identifier. The first message identifier may be generated by the social networking service site in response to a message post command from the originating client including a first access token that is specific to a first user of the social networking service site associated with the originating client.","Another embodiment contemplates a method for transforming the messages specifically involving the retrieval thereof. Following the second message and the first message identifier being stored in either of the ways mentioned above, or by any other way, the method continues with receiving from a requesting client a message retrieval request and a second access token specific to a second user of the social networking service site associated with the requesting client. The method may also include transmitting to the social networking service site a message retrieval command and the second access token in response to the message retrieval request from the requesting client. There may also be a step of receiving at least one message identifier from the social networking service site. The at least one message identifier may be the first message identifier, and may also correspond to the first message stored in the content repository of the first profile.","An alternative method for transforming the messages involving its retrieval is also disclosed. This method may include receiving from a requesting client at least one message identifier corresponding to a message designated for access by a second user of the social networking service site. The second user may be associated with the requesting client. The at least one message identifier may be the first message identifier that corresponds to the first message stored in the content repository of the first profile. The method may further include querying for the second message with the at least one message identifier. There may also be a step of transmitting the second message to the requesting client.","According to another embodiment, there is disclosed a system for transforming messages from a first user to a second user on an interactive communications site. There may be a database including a first message field, a second message field, and a first message identifier field. Further, there may be a database query interface that is connected to the database. Data in the second message field may be retrieved in response to a query on the corresponding first message identifier field. The system may also include a messaging interface that interconnects the database query interface to an external message data source. The data source may have a first message and a second message originating from the first user and assigned a first message identifier. The first message, the second message, and the first message identifier may be stored in the respective first message field, the second message field, and the first message identifier of the database in response to a message store request from the external message data source. Additionally, the system may include a client interface that interconnects the database query interface to a client system that is associated with the second user. The second message may be transmitted from the database to the client system in response to a message retrieval request from the client system to the database query interface. The message retrieval request may include a specific value of the first message identifier.","The various aspects of the invention will be best understood by reference to the following detailed description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","Common reference numerals are used throughout the drawings and the detailed description to indicate the same elements.","The detailed description set forth below in connection with the appended drawings is intended as a description of the presently contemplated embodiments of the methods and systems for social network stealth and counter messaging and is not intended to represent the only form in which the disclosed invention may be developed or utilized. The description sets forth the various functions and features in connection with the illustrated embodiments. It is to be understood, however, that the same or equivalent functions may be accomplished by different embodiments that are also intended to be encompassed within the scope of the present disclosure. It is further understood that the use of relational terms such as first and second and the like are used solely to distinguish one from another entity without necessarily requiring or implying any actual such relationship or order between such entities.","The block diagram of  illustrates an exemplary networked computing environment  over the Internet . Various embodiments of social network stealth and counter messaging may be implemented in the context of the networked computing environment , which includes a social networking service site  or other interactive communications sites. There are numerous variations of the social networking service site  currently online and accessible over the Internet  including Facebook, Google+ Twitter, MySpace, LinkedIn, and many others that are popular across a wide user base. Recently, many other types of online services such as e-commerce storefronts, review sites, etc. have also incorporated social networking features by which customers and users can interact with each other. In this regard, reference to the social networking service site  is also intended to encompass such online services.","Different services have features sets suitable for particular uses, though there are some features common to all. The details thereof as pertinent to the social network stealth and counter messaging will be described more fully below. It is envisioned that the methods and systems disclosed herein may be utilized in connection with other communications modalities including e-mail, simple message service (SMS), web-based group discussion forums, mobile group messaging applications, and so forth, and not limited to the foregoing social networking services or websites that incorporate certain social networking features. Thus, inclusion of the term social networking when referring to the social networking service site  and other features described herein are for purposes of convenience only and not of limitation. Such other communications modalities are understood to include corresponding features and perform corresponding functions as those attributed to social networking service site . Those having ordinary skill in the art will be able to recognize the modifications appropriate for these alternative communications modalities and implement similar message transformation methods and systems in such contexts.","The first user  operates a first client computer system  to access the Internet  and the websites connected thereto, including the social networking service site . By way of example only and not of limitation, the first client computer system  is a conventional desktop computer device including a central processing unit, memory, and various input and output devices such as keyboards, mice, and displays. The first client computer system  is connectible to the Internet  via a first Internet link . Although a conventional desktop computer device is shown, the first client computer system  may be a portable device such as a notebook computer, a tablet computer, a smart phone device, and the like that have data processing and communications capabilities.","Regardless of its form factor, the first client computer system  is understood to have executable instructions of a web browser application that is loaded thereon. The web browser application communicates with various web servers connected to the Internet  over the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), among other protocols known in the art as will be further detailed below. Requests for data are initiated by the first client computer system  and transmitted to the servers, while the requested server responds with a transmission of the requested data back to the first client computer system . The operational principles of web servers, web browser applications, and the Internet  are well understood, so no further details will be discussed herein. The present disclosure references the web browser application and the hypertext transfer protocol, but it will be appreciated that there may be some embodiments where such an application or protocol is not utilized. For example, there may be a dedicated social networking service application, or a secure alternative to HTTP such as HTTPS may be substituted. Accordingly, as referenced herein, the web browser application is understood encompass any other application that interacts with various servers connected to the Internet  to exchange data.","Generally, the social networking service site  is understood to facilitate interactive online communications between the user  and a network of contacts with which some linked relationship is established. The first user  is assigned an account  that includes a profile  with basic biographic information, as well as a content repository . It is understood that a variety of user-generated content may be posted to the content repository , including text messages, photographs, videos, event calendars, geographic locations in the form of GPS (Global Positioning System) coordinates, and links to other websites on the Internet . This feature may be variously referred to in the art as a \u201cwall,\u201d a \u201cstream,\u201d a \u201ccomment box,\u201d or the like. Regardless of the specific nomenclature, the function is essentially the same; the users of the social networking service site  are able to publish and share content therewith. Thus, as referenced herein, the term post or posting refers to the upload or storage of any data to the social networking service site .","In the example shown, the account  is linked to a contact B  and a contact C , and possibly others. The contact B  can correspond to a second account  that also includes a separate profile  and a content repository . Furthermore, the second account  may be assigned to the second user , which accesses the Internet  with a second client computer system . It is to be understood that like the first client computer system , the second client computer system  has a processor, memory, input and output components, and data communications modalities including a second Internet connection . A web browser software application loaded thereon may initiate data transfer requests over the Internet connection  with websites such as the social networking service site , and for most part, are the same as the desktop application counterparts running on the first client computer system  described above.","Some social networks enforce bi-directional contact linking, that is, to the extent the first account  is linked to the contact B  and the thus the second account , the second account  also has a link to contact A  corresponding to the first account . This is a feature of social networks such as Facebook and LinkedIn. Other social networks such as Twitter or Google+utilize unidirectional contact linking, where there is a link established between the first account  and the contact B , but there is no reciprocal link back from the corresponding second account  to the contact A  unless a link is independently established.","In general, the social networking service site  facilitates the sharing of content stored in the respective repositories ,  between the first account  (i.e., the first user ), the second account  (i.e., the second user ) and other linked accounts. With bi-directionally linked contacts, content that is posted by the first user  to the content repository  is visible to the second user  when logged in to the social networking service site , unless otherwise blocked according to specific user-adjustable privacy settings. Furthermore, the content repository  is receptive to posts from other users within the network of contacts of the first user , and is visible to the first user  as well as the second user  when logged in. With uni-directionally linked contacts, content that is posted by the first user  may not be visible to the second user  unless the corresponding second account  has established a specific link back to the contact A , or the first account .","The content in the content repository of a particular account can be generated on a page upon other users accessing the profile associated therewith. Alternatively, a main or home page may be generated upon login, with the content from the content repository of all contacts associated with the account are listed in chronological order, together with the name of each author. Besides these two common methods, there are other ways in which content may be displayed. The contemplated message transformation systems and methods may be utilized in connection with such other display methods, and deemed to be within the scope of the present disclosure.","In the context of the first user  and the second user  on the social networking service site , there may be some circumstances where the first user  desires to post certain content to the content repository  for viewing by the second user , but desires other users to see alternative content. For example, being close friends, the first user  may desire to announce to the second user  (possibly among others) that he is consuming copious volumes of intoxicating beverages, while simultaneously announcing to other contacts on the social networking service site  that he is studying at the library. In other words, the first user  may desire to post one announcement for a certain audience with those users being able to retrieve and view the actual or true message, while posting a different, false message for another audience. Accordingly, the false message may also be referred to as a counter-message, as in counter-intelligence, such that users viewing the counter-message are provided false, possibly misleading information. Along these lines, the true message may also be referred to as a stealth message since it is intended to be secret to the extent it is obfuscated by the counter-message. Besides text messages, similar treatment of other content such as links, event calendars, videos, GPS location data and so forth is also envisioned. The present disclosure refers to each such content as a \u201cmessage,\u201d and thus this is understood to refer to any content that can be posted or otherwise associated with user accounts on the social networking service site .","Various embodiments of the present disclosure contemplate methods for transforming messages for the social networking service site  in the general manner described above. As shown in , there is also a proxy messaging server  connected to the Internet  that interacts with the social networking service site  and the client computer systems ,  to achieve this functionality. However, it is expressly contemplated that the functionality described herein as being performed by the proxy messaging server  may also be implemented directly on the social networking service site . Further details of the proxy messaging server  are shown in the block diagram of , including a database , and a database query interface  connected thereto. Other components include a messaging interface  that serves as the intermediary between the social networking service site  to the database query interface , as well as a client interface  that serves as the intermediary between the client computer systems ,  and the database query interface . It will be appreciated that this is only one generalized example of the way in which the various functions of the proxy messaging server  can be implemented as logical software components, and is not intended to be limiting. Those having ordinary skill in the art will readily ascertain alternative components for performing similar or identical functions.","In one exemplary embodiment, the database , and more particularly the database query interface  is a relational database management system (RDBMS) that is queried with the Structured Query Language (SQL). Parts of the functionality associated with the database query interface , the messaging interface , and the client interface  may be embodied as instructions of software code running under a web application server or software framework and runtime environment  such as the Sun GlassFish system. Any other application server may be substituted, however. Notwithstanding the reference to a relational database system and associated commands and querying features, it will be recognized that any other database model may be utilized. For instance, a non-relational database known as Cassandra, which is based on the key\/value model of storing data found in the Google BigTable database may also be utilized. Those having ordinary skill in the art will recognize the necessary modifications to implementation details in embodiments where such alternative components are employed. One example modification is the substitution of the Thrift or other RPC framework and accompanying query commands instead of SQL queries.","With reference to the flowchart of  and the data flow block diagram of , a first embodiment of a method for transforming messages from the perspective of the proxy messaging server , includes a step  of receiving from an originating client, i.e., the first client computer system , a first message , a second message  that is associated with the first message , and a first access token  that is specific to the first user  of the social networking service site . This aspect is understood to relate to the posting of messages to the content repository . The receiving step may be performed by the messaging interface  of the proxy messaging server  in some embodiments.","Since the first message  and the second message  are received from the first client computer system , it may also be referenced as an external data source to which the messaging interface  interconnects the database query interface . Along these lines, the social networking service site  may also be regarded as an external data source to which the messaging interface  interconnects the database query interface . The first message  is understood to be the false or counter-message that is to be posted to the content repository  of the first account , while the second message  is understood to be the \u201creal\u201d or stealth message that is only visible to a select few users that the first user  has designated such as the second user .","Prior to the step of receiving the aforementioned data from the originating client, in order to obtain the first access token , the first user  may first log in to the social networking service site  using a login name and a password. Upon login, a cookie or other browser artifact that includes the first access token  may be stored on the first client computer system . The first access token  may be subsequently extracted and retrieved for transmission to the proxy messaging server . Thus, the first access token  is also associated with the originating client. Alternatively, the first access token  may also be a session identifier, or some other authenticated identifier for permitting access. The first access token  may be generated by the social networking service site , the proxy messaging server , or extracted from another source by either the social networking service site  or the proxy messaging server . One embodiment envisions the use of a phone number associated with a cellular phone where the first client computer system  is such a device.","Thereafter, in step , the proxy messaging server  transmits a message post command  to the social networking service site . Accompanying the message post command  is the first message  and the first access token  so that the proper first account  and related content repository  to which the first message  is to be posted can be authenticated and verified. Effectively, the proxy messaging server  acts as an agent on behalf of the first client computer system  to communicate and upload data to the social networking service site . As referenced herein, the message post command  is understood to include any command destined for the social networking service site  in which data is transmitted and stored thereon. It is to be understood that the inclusion of the term post does not limit the message post command to HTTP POST or other commands, and any other suitable command for data storage on a remote site may be utilized.","Once the message post command  is performed by the social networking service site  by adding the first message  to the content repository  of the specified first account , the method includes a step  of receiving a first message identifier . It is understood that the first message identifier  uniquely identifies the posted first message  within all of the messages existing on the social networking service site , and is generated in response to a validation of the first access token  and a completed and confirmed posting of the first message . There are many ways in which the first message identifier  can be returned to the proxy messaging server , and the preferred, though optional way is structuring the data into a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) interchange format.","Upon receiving the first message identifier , it is stored in the database  together with the first message  and the second message  in a linked relationship according to step . Referring again to , the database  is structured as multiple records  each with a first message field  for storing the first message , a first message identifier field  for storing the first message identifier , and a second message field  for storing the second message . The structure of the database  is presented by way of example only and not of limitation, as there may be some embodiments in which the first message  is discarded or otherwise not stored. It is understood that the database  is indexed with the first message identifier field , such that a query issued to the database query interface  with the first message identifier  retrieves the corresponding data in the second message field . As shown in , an SQL INSERT command  may be utilized to store the first message , the first message identifier , and the second message  in the database . In embodiments where the first message is not stored, the INSERT command  only includes the first message identifier  and the second message . Because the proxy messaging server , and specifically the messaging interface , is responsive to the first message identifier  and initiates the storing of the first message  and the second message , it may also be referred to as a message store request.","If the storing of the first message identifier , the second message , and optionally, the first message , is successful, the method continues with a step  of transmitting a confirmation message  to the first client computer system . Alternatively, the confirmation message  may be sent simply in response to receiving the first message identifier  from the social networking service site . The confirmation message  is also understood to be in the JSON interchange format, though any other suitable format may be substituted. The first client computer system  may handle the receipt of the confirmation message  in various ways, including rendering an indication that the process has completed.","The flowchart of  and the data flow block diagram of  illustrate a second embodiment of the method for transforming messages from the perspective of the proxy messaging server . Again, this aspect relates to the posting of messages to the social networking service site . The method begins with a step  of receiving from the originating client, i.e., the first client computer system , the first message , the second message  that is associated with the first message , and the first message identifier .","Before involvement of the proxy messaging server , the first user  logs in to the first account  of the social networking service site  in the manner described above. A message post command  is also generated, but by the first client computer system . As with the above-described embodiment, the message post command  includes the first access token  retrieved by way of the login process, as well as the first message  entered by the first user . Upon successfully posting the first message  to the content repository , the social networking service site  returns the first message identifier  that corresponds thereto. Again, the first message identifier  is structured in accordance with the JSON interchange format, though this is by way of example only and not of limitation. It is understood that the first message identifier  itself is not it the JSON interchange format, though such data may be extracted from a collection of JSON-formatted data. The first message identifier  may be included in other data from the social networking service site , including the URL, or some other source. For embodiments of the present disclosure that utilize SMS as a communications modality or any others that do not allow the separation of data to a message and an identifier, the first message  may include the first message identifier  in-line together with an escape character or code. For example, the first message  and the first message identifier  may be combined thus: \u201c!28 Hey, what's up?\u201d In this example, the exclamation point is the escape character, with 28 being the first message identifier . The first message is \u201cHey, what's up?\u201d Since the originating phone number is appended to SMS text messages, that can also partially serve as the first message identifier .","According to some embodiments, in a step , the first message identifier  is stored on the database  in a linked relationship to the second message . As will be described more fully below, the proxy messaging server  may only need to be involved with the retrieval and of the second message , since the false or counter-message of the first message  need not be displayed to the audience to which the second message  is directed. Optionally, the first message  is also stored in a linked relationship to the second message  and the first message identifier . The SQL INSERT command  may be utilized to store the foregoing data in the database .","Like the earlier described embodiment, if the storing of the second message , the first message identifier , and optionally the first message  is successful, the method continues with a step  of transmitting the confirmation message  to the first client computer system . The confirmation message  is understood to be in the JSON interchange format, though any other suitable format may be utilized for transferring this data.","The references herein to the first message and the second message are intended in the broadest sense, and may include various types of data besides text as briefly indicated above. Generally, regardless of the type, it is understood that the first message is different from the second message, as the first message  is meant for countering purposes, that is, for disseminating false information, while the second message  is hidden from everyone except authorized users. Similar to simple text messages, the first message  may include a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) link to an innocuous website, while the second message  may include a URL link to a potentially controversial, offensive, or otherwise inappropriate website for a select number of contacts linked to the user profile. Along these lines, alternative video footage may be stored separately in the first message field  and the second message field . Similar counter and stealth messages may be applicable to event invitations. In this case, the first message  may have time, date and descriptor data that is false, while the second message  may have different but accurate time, date, and descriptor data.","The concept is further applicable to location updates in the form of \u201ccheck-ins\u201d that are posted to the social networking service site . In one social networking service, a location is associated with a business or other physical facility. The address therefor is stored in a \u201cpage\u201d representing that business or physical facility, and from the address a set of GPS coordinates may be derived. The first message  is envisioned to indicate the false location. First, input of GPS coordinates may be accomplished visually via online maps, with the location being graphically selected through the map interface. Upon selecting a general area and deriving a set of GPS coordinates therefrom, a list of pages for businesses and facilities close to the specified coordinates is generated. From the list, one page is selected for the purposes of \u201cchecking in\u201d and stored as the first message . Since the page is also assigned a unique identifier, this may be stored as the first message identifier  if desired. A similar process is repeated for the actual location to be stored as the second message , except instead of receiving false GPS coordinates, GPS coordinates from an on-board GPS unit is substituted. Alternatively, location data in the form of GPS coordinates may also be retrieved from cellular phone towers. With some social networking services, additional data such as user-provided, text comments may also be linked to the check-in. Such data may also be incorporated into the respective first message , second message , and first message identifier .","Beyond the content being posted to the content repository , different versions of the names displayed next to posted content is likewise contemplated. Instead of the database  for storing the messages, there may be a separate table  with a profile identifier field  that stores the unique identifier for the account as defined by the social networking service site , and an associated with a name field  that stores the desired display name. The name field  associated with the profile identifier of the first account  would likely include the real name of the first user , with the biographic information and the display name taken therefrom indicating a false name. Further details regarding the steps involved in showing the display name and\/or a false name will be described more fully below.","Having considered the features associated with the posting of messages to the social networking service site , the features for the retrieval of messages from the proxy messaging server  for display by the second client computer system  will now be considered. The flowchart of  and the data flow block diagram of  illustrate another, third embodiment of the method for transforming messages. The method includes a step  of receiving from a requesting client, i.e., the second client computer system , a message retrieval request  and a second access token . It is also contemplated, however, that the requesting client may also be the first client computer system  where the first user  is viewing content posted to his own content repository .","In some embodiments, the second access token  is understood to be specific to the second user  of the social networking service site  and associated with the second client computer system . The second access token  need not be limited thus, and may instead be generated and assigned by the proxy messaging server , with no requirement for the second user  to be logged in, or even have an account with the social networking service site  to view the posted content. Again, obtaining the second access token  may first involve the second user  logging in to the social networking service site  using a login name and a password. After a successful login, a cookie or other browser artifact that includes the second access token  may be stored on the second client computer system . The second access token  may be subsequently extracted and retrieved for transmission to the proxy messaging server . As indicated above in relation to the first access token , the second access token  may be a session identifier, or some other authenticated identifier for permitting access. Similarly, the second access token  may be generated by the social networking service site , the proxy messaging server , or extracted from another source by either the social networking service site  or the proxy messaging server .","The method continues with a step  of transmitting to the social networking service site  a message retrieval command  and the second access token . The message retrieval command  may be generated by the proxy messaging server  in response to the message retrieval request  from the requesting client. The social networking service site , in turn, provides the proxy messaging server  with the messages (or in some embodiments, the identifiers corresponding to those messages) that would otherwise be transmitted to the second client computer system  had a request been directly initiated from the same.","More particularly, the social networking service site  responds and generates an array of values , preferably in the JSON interchange format, of the message identifiers that correspond to the messages destined for the second client computer system . One of the message identifiers may be the first message identifier  discussed above, which references the first message , i.e., the false message. The message identifiers are received by the proxy messaging server , and specifically the messaging interface  thereof.","In step , using the received message identifier and via the database query interface , the database  is queried. If the query results in a match between the queried message identifier  and data in a first message identifier field  of the record in the database , then data in the associated second message field  is retrieved. For example, the query is for the first message identifier . The query will identify a record  with the same value, and then returns the corresponding second message  stored in the database  in accordance with step  or step  described above. There may be more than one received message identifier from the social networking service site , so the queries are repeated for each, finding and retrieving a corresponding second message if one exists in the database .","After completing the queries, the retrieved second messages , and in the above example, the second message , is transmitted to the requesting client, i.e., the second client computer system  per step . The client interface  of the proxy messaging server  is understood to provide this functionality. On the second client computer system , the received second messages  may be rendered on the browser application.","It is understood that the message identifiers received from the social networking service site  may not correspond to any record  in the database . These are understood to be messages visible to the second user  but were posted by other users besides the first user , or were not otherwise posted by the first user  to the content repository  in accordance with the method for transforming messages. The identifiers for these messages may also be transmitted to the second client computer system  together with the second message , so that a client-side application may subsequently retrieve those messages from the social networking service site . Alternatively, the proxy messaging server  may directly contact the social networking service site  to retrieve those messages, and transmit all of the messages, including the stealth messages retrieved from the database , to the second client computer system .","Another, fourth embodiment of the method for transforming messages relating to the retrieval of messages from the proxy messaging server  is contemplated. With reference to the flowchart of  and the data flow block diagram of , the method includes a step  of receiving from a requesting client, i.e., the second client computer system , a set of message identifiers .","In this embodiment, the second user  is understood to first log in to the second account  of the social networking service site . A message retrieval command  is issued to the social networking service site , and includes the second access token  retrieved through the login process. Thus, the user to which the request pertains, that is, the second user , and the messages that are designated for displaying thereto are identified. In response to the message retrieval command , the social networking service site  returns the set of message identifier .","According to step , using the received set of message identifiers  and via the database query interface , the database  is queried. If the query results in a match between the queried message identifier  and data in a first message identifier field  of the record in the database , then data in the associated second message field  is retrieved as discussed above in relation to the third embodiment. Likewise, there may be more than one received message identifier from the social networking service site , so the queries are repeated for each, finding and retrieving a corresponding second message if one exists in the database .","After completing the queries, the retrieved second messages , and in the above example, the second message , is transmitted to the requesting client, i.e., the second client computer system  according to step . On the second client computer system , the received second messages  may be rendered on the browser application. To the extent there were message identifiers in the set  that did not correspond to any records  in the database , the browser application is understood to display the corresponding messages as received from the social networking service site . To ensure that the correct posts and accounts are being subsequently accessed by the second client computer system , the proxy messaging server  may transmit the second access token  thereto.","With either of the embodiments involving the transmission of the second messages  to the requesting client, it is contemplated that the stealth messages and the other non-stealth messages that are to be displayed by the requesting client are retrieved and rendered on a page generated by the proxy messaging server .","The screen shot of  shows a first social networking service user interface , which is a rendered HTML page generated for the second user  who has access to the stealth, or actual messages posted by the first user . The user interface  may be rendered as tables, formatted text, or otherwise, depending on the specifics of the operating platform of the requesting client. In mobile devices, the respective Application Programming Interface (API) function may be utilized to display the content, such as UITableView for iPhones, TableLayout for Android-based devices, and TableView for Blackberry devices. A content posting section  lists, in chronological order, different messages that were shared with the second user . This includes the second message  that was retrieved from the proxy messaging server . Next to each listing, including the second message , there is a username  and a profile picture . As indicated above, a display name that is different from the name associated with the first account  and profile  may be shown.","In contrast, the screen shot of  shows a second social networking service user interface  that is generated for a different user who does not have access to the stealth, second message . Accordingly, the first message or the counter-message that may include false information is displayed in the content posting section . For what appears to be the same posting, the message body is different. Furthermore, a different public name  is displayed. This is understood to be the name associated with the first account  and profile  on the social networking service site .","Other posts from different users not utilizing the disclosed message transformation methods and systems are shown identically in both the first and second social networking service user interfaces , .","The particulars shown herein are by way of example and for purposes of illustrative discussion of the embodiments of the present disclosure only and are presented in the cause of providing what is believed to be the most useful and readily understood description of the principles and conceptual aspects.
