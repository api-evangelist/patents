{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION AND PRIORITY CLAIM","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMDODIMENTS"],"p":["This application is related to co-pending provisional application serial No. 60\/395,487, filed on Jul. 12, 2002, and claims priority from that provisional application under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119. This application is also related to co-pending provisional application No. 60\/472,075, filed on May 20, 2003, and claims priority from that provisional application under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119.","This invention was made with Government assistance under NSF grant number ECS0122906. The Government has certain rights in this invention.","The field of the invention is the field of vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs).","Semiconductor lasers are the basis for optoelectronics, and also many other devices that make use of laser emissions. Laterally emitting lasers are in widespread commercial use. These type of lasers emit from the cleaved facet in the lateral direction. While high powers may be obtained, the lateral emission is inconvenient for integrating the device with other similar or different devices. Laterally emitting lasers also have elliptical beams that diverge at a greater rate along the major axis of the elliptical cross-section of the beam. The uneven divergence and shape of the elliptical beams sometimes limits the effectiveness of the laterally emitting laser devices.","Another type of semiconductor laser is the vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL). The VCSEL emits in the vertical direction. That provides advantages for the integration of the VCSEL with other like or different devices. Though VCSELs typically emit lower power than the laterally emitting lasers, the VCSELs provide a beam having a circular cross-section. The VCSELs are also very compact. A typical VCSEL is a few to ten microns in length and about 1 to 10 microns in diameter. In addition, the circularly shaped beam of a VCSEL diverges at an equal rate in all directions. Although the VCSEL usually inherently exhibits a single longitundinal mode, it is important to achieve single transverse mode operation.","To achieve single transverse mode operation in a VCSEL, several approaches have been pursued. For a conventional ion implanted structure, which has no lateral index confinement, single mode operation is achieved by controlling the size of the transverse cavity diameter. This intrinsically limits the single mode output power. Oxide confined VCSEL structures with sufficiently small aperture diameter have also demonstrated single mode operation. A small oxide aperture realizes single mode operation where higher order modes are in cut-off. However, the refractive index contrast between oxidized and unoxidized regions is so high that the diameter of the aperture should be smaller than 3 to 4 microns at an 850 nm emission wavelength. This geometry is difficult to manufacture and it results in unavoidably high electrical resistance and limited output power of less than around 1 mW. More complicated approaches for achieving single mode emission in VCSELs include surface relief etching, see, e.g. H. J. Unold et al., IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics, vol. 7, No. 2, p386, 2002; mode selective reflectivity, see, e.g., N. Ueda et al., IEICE Trans. Electron., vol. E85-C, No. 1, p64, 2002; and, an extended cavity structure which applies an additional diffraction loss on higher order modes, see, e.g., D. G. Deppe et al., Electronics Letters, vol. 33, No. 3, p211, 1997. In addition, an ion implant and oxide aperture can be combined within a single device to achieve single transverse mode operation, see E. W. Young, et al, Photon. Tech. Lett. Vol 13, p927, 2001. These approaches each deteriorate the lasing performance of the fundamental mode along with the undesirable higher order modes because the fundamental mode and the other higher order modes have a degree of spatial overlap. Introducing scattering losses in the higher order modes introduces loss to the fundamental mode.","There are Japanese patent publications directed to photonic crystal confined VCSELs, see, Japanese Patent publications H10-284806A and Japanese Patent H11-186657A. These publications show a photonic structure including a pattern of holes, and suppose the existence of a photonic bandgap at operating wavelength. Similarly to these publications, the existence of a single mode is claimed regarding a photonic structure including a pattern of holes and a defect in Song et al., Appl. Phys. Lett Vol. 80, number 21, May 27, 2002. However, the publications provide no guidance on setting device physical parameters to permit the design of VCSELs exhibiting single transverse mode operation.","To achieve coherent coupling between VCSELs in a 2D array, several strategies have been previously demonstrated. A leaky mode approach based on changes of the cavity length has been shown to provide coupling between elements, although complex fabrication processing including a re-growth step is required, see, e.g. D. Serkland, K. D. Choquette, et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 75, 3754 (1999). Deep etching the array pixels combined with a \u201cchecker-board\u201d phase matching layers has demonstrated a coupled lowest order array mode, but this also involves complex fabrication procedures, see, e.g., M. Warren, et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 61, 1484 (1992). The objective to all of these approaches is to establish the lowest order supermode, which has high power in the central far-field lobe; achieving this objective will enable the development of very high power (>100 mW) single mode VCSEL sources. There remains a need for improved VCSEL structures which enable single transverse mode operation and\/or transverse coupling.","The invention is directed to a photonic crystal defect structure for a vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL). In accordance with the invention, a set of holes is formed in a pattern with one or more missing holes forming a defect in the pattern of the photonic crystal, according to a prescribed depth, hole diameter, and pattern pitch which will insure operation in a single transverse mode.","This invention concerns a photonic crystal defect structure for a vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL). A VCSEL of the invention includes a photonic crystal with a pattern of holes included a missing hole(s) defect, with the holes, pattern pitch, and hole depth dimensioned accordingly to provide a single transverse mode. The pattern including a missing hole(s) defect is necessary for single mode operation, and our calculations and simulations indicated that, without the defect and without hole diameter, pattern pitch, and hole depth dimensioned accordingly to provide a single transverse mode, even an optimized structure will not exhibit a photonic bandgap at operating wavelength. In another aspect of the invention, the confinement produced by the hole pattern with defect permits optimizations. Optimizations are realized by engineering the transverse optical mode profile in one or more longitudinal cavities. In another aspect of the invention, coupling is engineered between two or more longitudinal cavities by setting the geometrical characteristics of the pattern of holes and the missing hole(s) defect.","Lasers of the invention have many applications. An exemplary application is for high-speed optical communication systems and\/or data links. In such systems, a VCSEL with a single transverse mode optical emission property is a key component. Also, new applications will emerge for transversely coherently coupled VCSELs within a 2-dimensional (2D) array. Transversely coupled cavities also provide a key component for optical processing applications. The coupling of emission responses can be used as a form of logic.","The invention will now be illustrated by discussing some preferred embodiment laser devices and including preferred hole with defect patterns. In describing the invention, particular exemplary devices, formation processes, and device applications will be used for purposes of illustration. Dimensions and illustrated devices may be exaggerated for purposes of illustration and understanding of the invention. The elements of the drawings are not necessarily to scale relative to each other. Like reference numerals designate corresponding similar though not necessarily exact parts through the several views. Schematic views will be understood by artisans as such views are commonly used in the art. Devices of the invention may be formed using conventional equipment.","Referring now to , a vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL)  that includes a photonic crystal defect structure  is shown in a schematic perspective view of a vertical cross section. The device includes a substrate  having a bottom electrode  formed on its bottom surface and in electrical contact with the substrate . A bottom distributed Bragg reflector  is formed on an opposite side of the substrate  from the bottom electrode . A top distributed Bragg reflector  defines the upper part of a vertical cavity , which includes claddings that clad an active region. Lateral confinement in the VCSEL  is achieved with a plurality of holes  dimensioned according to a depth dependence single transverse mode factor. In preferred embodiments, the holes are finite depth holes dimensioned according to the single transverse mode factor, and in other embodiments the holes are infinite depth holes dimensioned according to the single transverse mode factor. A finite depth hole means the hole has a depth that is less than the length of the full reflective path of the beam in the VCSEL, while an infinite depth hole has a length that is equal to or greater than the full reflective path of the beam. The single transverse mode factor of the invention sets the ratio of the hole diameter divided by the pattern pitch according to depth. Finite depth holes require a diameter\/pitch ratio that is easily achieved by current fabrication techniques. Infinite depth holes require a diameter\/pitch ratio for which single mode operation has been mathematically confirmed. The aspect ratio of infinite depth holes formed according to the single transverse mode factor of the invention is readily defined, but may be difficult to manufacture. Improvements of current manufacturing processes and the development of new hole formation techniques will benefit the application of the invention for embodiments using infinite depth holes.","The holes  are arranged in a pattern  including one or more missing holes in the defect  in the pattern. A top electrode  includes an aperture , which may be larger or smaller than the pattern . Multiple patterns each with one or more hole defects may also be formed, and each defect  may include one or more missing holes. With power applied to the electrodes  and , the VCSEL  will emit a beam from an area where the defect  is present.","The holes  in the pattern  are empty spaces or contain material with a higher or lower refractive index compared to the material in which the holes are formed, and may be referred to as air holes. The holes may be formed by a simple etch. Their smallest diameter depends upon their pitch and depth, but their diameter may otherwise be tailored for specific engineered and optimized embodiments of the invention. Additional embodiments are shown in . In the  embodiment, the pattern  extends through both the top and bottom distributed Bragg reflectors  and  and the vertical cavity .","All of these devices have a two dimensional photonic crystal formed by the periodically arranged pattern  of holes  with a defect . The holes  in  are arranged in a triangular grid. One or more of the holes  are removed to create at least one missing hole defect . This hexagonally shaped defect site  is the center of the confined VCSEL single transverse optical mode. A square pattern with a square shaped defect can also be designed to confine a single transverse mode. Similarly, an array of defects  in a larger pattern  will produce a 2D array of transversely confined VCSELs, where the coupling between the individual defects can be designed by varying dimensions of the holes  (diameter), pitch between holes, hole depth and defect radius.","An ion implanted or an oxidized region  may form an electrical current aperture  in a region of the vertical cavity . The electrical current aperture can be larger, equal to, or smaller than the photonic crystal defect diameter.","In the  embodiment, the active region (within the vertical cavity ) is not exposed to the holes , and nonradiative carrier recombination, which is an undesirable carrier loss, will not occur. Also the hole depth, a typically being less than \u02dc5 \u03bcm, is easier to be fabricate than the deep holes  as in the  embodiment. In the  embodiment, the top DBR with the patterned photonic crystal structure acts as a mode selective filter.","The  embodiment has deep holes  reaching substantially below the cavity . A complete single mode waveguide is realized by this embodiment. But this structure has some difficulty compared to the former device, i.e, deeper etching and nonradiative recombination at the exposed surface of the active region. The nonradiative recombination can be reduced by defining the current path to be smaller than the photonic crystal defect diameter.","The  embodiment has a photonic crystal structure only within the vertical cavity  and its vicinity in part of the top and bottom distributed Bragg reflectors  and . In this case, only the fundamental mode can be produced at the active region in the vertical cavity . Since both DBRs are almost perfect without any holes, the highest reflectivity can be expected among these structures. This structure may suffer from nonradiative recombination unless the current path is defined smaller than the photonic crystal defect diameter.","Exemplary material systems are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. Generally, any material system suitable for VCSEL devices is suitable for the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Lasing","850 nm","980 nm","1300 nm\/1550 nm"]},{"entry":"Wavelength"},{"entry":["substrate","GaAs","GaAs","GaAs"]},{"entry":["DBR","AlGaAs\/AlGaAs","AlGaAs\/AlGaAs","AlGaAs\/AlGaAs"]},{"entry":["Clad","AlGaAs","AlGaAs or GaAs or","AlGaAs or GaAs"]},{"entry":[{},{},"InGaP","or GaNAs"]},{"entry":["Active","GaAs\/AlGaAs","InGaAs\/AlGaAs","GaInNAs\/"]},{"entry":[{},"QW","QW","GaAs"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"QW or"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"GaInNAsSb\/"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"GaAs"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"QW or"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"GaInNAs\/"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"GaNAs"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"QW or"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"GaInNAsSb\/"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"GaNAs"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"QW"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 2"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Lasing","1300 nm\/1550 nm","1300 nm\/1550 nm"]},{"entry":"Wavelength"},{"entry":["substrate","InP","GaAs"]},{"entry":["DBR","GaInAsP\/GaInAsP","AlGaAs\/AlGaAs"]},{"entry":["Clad","GaInAsP or InP or","GaInAsP or InP or AlGaInAs"]},{"entry":[{},"AlGaInAs"]},{"entry":["Active","GaInAsP\/GaInAsP","GaInAsP\/GaInAsP QW or"]},{"entry":[{},"QW or","GaInAsP\/AlGaInAs QW or"]},{"entry":[{},"GaInAsP\/AlGaInAs"]},{"entry":[{},"QW"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Fabrication of VCSEL devices is similar to the formation process for conventional VCSEL devices, but includes an additional etch, or other material removal process, to form the holes . By way of example only, the  device may be formed by crystal growth, e.g., metalorganic chemical vapor deposition or molecular beam epitaxy to form the top and bottom Bragg reflectors  and  and the claddings and active region of the vertical cavity . Patterns in the Bragg reflectors are formed conventionally. The electrical current aperture  is formed, for example, by ion implantation with photoresist as a mask. A dielectric evaporation (for example a SiNx film by plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition forms a thin layer for use as an etch mask. Electron beam lithography to define a pattern in the dielectric material creates a pattern mask. Holes are then formed (for example a hole diameter, b, relative to the lattice constant of the photonic crystal, a, is b\/a=0.1) by a dry etching (e.g., inductively coupled plasma reactive ion etching). The dielectric mask is then removed (e.g., by reactive ion etching). Afterwards, a metalization (e.g., a conventional lift-off process on top surface of the top Bragg reflector ) forms the top electrode .","The normalized frequency or V-parameter is used to determine the number of guided modes in cylindrical waveguides, e.g., optical fibers, and we have developed a modified version to be used to tailor the number of transverse modes in a VCSEL of the invention. The cutoff condition of the 1st higher mode leads to V=2.405, and thus a waveguide with V<2.405 is considered to be single mode.

The depth dependence single transverse mode factor \u03b3 can be understood qualitatively as being proportional to the spatial overlap between the photonic crystal structure and the longitudinal optical power distribution inside the VCSEL structure. \u03b3=0 for vanishing etching depth (holes approaching zero depth), \u03b3=1 for infinite etching depth holes, and \u03b3=0.5 for holes reaching the middle of the vertical cavity . The particular form of \u03b3 as a function of etch depth will depend on the specific details of the VCSEL. A refractive index difference in the vertical cavity introduced by the holes should also be kept small enough to produce single mode operation.","For the purpose of further illustration of the invention, particular exemplary embodiments and experimental results will now be discussed. The results demonstrate preferred aspects of the invention, and will be appreciated by artisans to demonstrate the efficacy of the invention. Artisans will also appreciate that results do not limit broader aspects of the invention as discussed above.","In the following discussion, the equivalent defect radius of a single point defect and a 7-point defect structures are assumed to be \u039b-d\/2 and \u221a{square root over (3)}\u039b-d\/2, respectively, where \u039b is the pattern pitch and d is the hole diameter of a circular hole, respectively. Equation (1), which includes the \u03b3 depth dependence factor is used to calculate normalized frequency. By this approach, the invention can be used to engineer particular embodiments of the invention, while providing for single mode transverse operation.","The refractive index variation \u0394n can be obtained from the photonic band diagram of an out-of-plane propagation mode calculated by assuming that the photonic crystal structure is infinite both in lateral and vertical direction. For the following examples, a material index of 3.4 is assumed. The term \u0394n strongly depends on both the pattern pitch and the relative hole diameter, d\/\u039b. As we are assuming \u03bb=850 nm, a pattern pitch of 1 \u03bcm corresponds to 1.18.","A single transverse mode condition can be easily destroyed by a perturbation of refractive indices introduced by thermal effects or carrier injection. For a set of exemplary parameters of 5 \u03bcm photonic crystal lattice constant, d\/\u039b=0.5, and \u03b3<0.1, \u0394n is less than 10. By comparison, thermal effects in VCSELs can produce \u0394n \u02dc10, which will dominate the waveguide characteristics. To avoid this problem, \u0394n should be increased as much as possible, and at the same time, Vshould remain <2.405 to retain the single mode condition. Large d\/\u039b ratios seem to be effective for this purpose. But the large d\/\u039b structure will also induce significant scattering loss.","Another method of increasing \u0394n is by reducing the lattice constant, \u039b, and choosing a 7-point defect structure. A seven point defect and hole pattern, including a missing hole defect  having seven missing holes contained within a a circumference defined by the radius of the defect pattern, is shown in . Since the equivalent defect radius increases from \u039b-d\/2 to \u221a{square root over (3)}\u039b-d\/2 by introducing the 7-point defect structure, Vis enhanced by factor of 2.","Experimental devices in accordance with the invention have been formed. The experimental devices were VCSEL structures comprised of a GaAs substrate with 850 nm resonant-cavity wavelength with a vertical cavity sandwiched by a 25-periods of top DBR and a 35.5-periods of bottom DBR. Both DBRs were formed of AlGaAs\/AlGaAs pairs of layers. Experimental structures had a finite etching depth (in accordance with ) and either incorporated a single point or a 7-point defect formed in the top DBR. Defect structures were delineated on the surface by using electron beam lithography and were fabricated by using an inductive coupled plasma reactive ion etching (ICP-RIE) technique with SiClas the etching gas. After metalization of top and bottom contacts, square shaped mesas were formed by conventional photolithography and additional ICP-RIE. Finally, the AlAs layer in the lower DBR was selectively oxidized to define a current aperture. SiOfilm was used to protect the sidewalls of PhC holes during the oxidation process. We made 7-point defect devices with a lattice constant \u039b of 2.0 \u03bcm and different d\/\u039b ratios of 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7. Since the etching depth of a small hole depends on its diameter, different hole diameters have different hole depths. Etching depths measured by using a scanning electron microscope were 1.68 \u03bcm, 1.85 \u03bcm and 1.92 \u03bcm for d\/\u039b of 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7, respectively. This corresponds to 13, 14 and 15 periods etched into the top DBR, giving \u03b3 values of 0.020, 0.024 and 0.032, respectively.","If the size of the oxide aperture is comparable to the defect size having the equivalent radius of about 3 \u03bcm, the photonic crystal confined mode will be affected by the large refractive index step of roughly 0.05 introduced by the oxide layer. Therefore, we used a large oxide aperture size of about 21 \u03bcm\u00d721 \u03bcm, which was much larger than the defect diameter. An experimental device with the smallest d\/\u039b of 0.3 had the lowest threshold current, but it operated in an oxide confined mode, which was confirmed by its spectrum and near field pattern. Devices with large d\/\u039b (0.7) have high threshold currents and low efficiencies above threshold. Both devices operated in photonic crystal confined modes. Since the optical fields of these devices were confined in central defect areas, most of the injected current for each device passed through the surrounding photonic crystal confinement region and was wasted. This higher threshold current can be reduced by confining the injected current efficiently into the defect site.","The effective threshold current simply estimated by the ratio of the defect area to the oxide aperture area is around 1.5 mA, assuming uniform current density within the oxide aperture. The threshold current density is >6kA\/cm, which is higher than conventional oxide confined VCSELs. We attribute this to unintentional scattering loss introduced by the PhC structure, rather than reduced current injection efficiency. Lasing spectra of the device with d\/\u039b of 0.5 confirmed single mode operation. A weak peak appearing at shorter wavelength than the lasing mode is reproducible in all of our devices operating in a photonic crystal confined mode, and is thought to be one of the oxide confined modes.","Experimental devices also exhibited strong emissions in the defect site(s). The emissions corresponded to the shape of the defect. Thus, a hexagonal emission pattern was evidenced in an experimental device with a hexagonal missing defect defined by a triangular pattern of holes. Experimental devices utilized a structure with a large oxide aperture to prevent a significant contribution of the oxide aperture to the photonic crystal confined mode. A current confinement technique that does not introduce a large refractive index step, i.e., an ion-implanted structure, would enable current aperture size to fit photonic crystal confined modes. As a result, low threshold current and high efficiency, as well as high output power operation should be possible.","While specific embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it should be understood that other modifications, substitutions and alternatives are apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. Such modifications, substitutions and alternatives can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, which should be determined from the appended claims.","Various features of the invention are set forth in the appended claims."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
