title: Scale factors for visual presentations
abstract: A device may display a presentation of elements (e.g., icons) on a display component. However, display components have a pixel density that affects aesthetic and practical aspects of the presentation (e.g., rendering the presentation at a variable and inconsistent size); yet, many presentations are not generated in view of the pixel density of the display component of the device. Presented herein are techniques for generating and displaying a presentation of elements in view of the pixel density of the display component, using a scale factor set of scale factors that specify a pixel density range and a scale factor value (e.g., 120%) to be applied to the elements of the presentation. The scale factor set may be kept small to reduce the administrative burden on the designer of the element, while also achieving approximately consistent sizing of the presentation on display components having variable pixel densities.

Such presentations may be generated and displayed on a display component of a device, either directly (e.g., where the display component is accessible to the device, the device may generate a bitmap that is blitted onto the display component by a hardware component) or indirectly (e.g., the display component may be attached to a client device, and a webserver may generate and send to the client device a web page, comprising a set of elements embedded in a web document, which the client device may render within the web browser). Users may also interact with the presentations in different ways; e.g., a presentation on a workstation computer may involve interaction with a pointing device such as a mouse or trackball, while a mobile device may involve a touch-sensitive display that enables touch input from a fingertip or stylus.","A particular characteristic of display components that may affect presentations rendered thereupon is the pixel density of the display component, such as a pixels-per-centimeter measurement. It may be appreciated that such characteristics may be independent of the size of the display component (e.g., two display components of the same size may present different pixel densities; conversely, two display components of different sizes may present the same pixel density) and\/or the pixel dimensions of the display component (e.g., two display components displaying a presentation with a particular pixel dimensions may do so with different physical sizes). However, the variable pixel densities of different display components may produce some difficulties in the rendering of a presentation on the display components. In particular, applications and application platforms (including the operating system of a device) are often cognizant of the pixel dimensions of the display component, and may take the pixel dimensions into account while preparing a presentation (e.g., web browsers are often configured to adjust the layout of the web page based on the pixel width of the web browser, e.g., by scaling the horizontal pixel widths of relatively sized elements in proportion with the pixel width of the web browser). However, such applications and application platforms less frequently adapt the presentation in view of the pixel density of the display component. Thus, two devices having display components with different horizontal pixel dimensions may adapt the presentation in view of the different pixel counts, but may fail to adapt the presentation in view of different pixel densities of the display components. The elements presented on such displays may therefore have equal pixel widths, but different presented widths in terms of the visual sizes of the elements visualized on the display components. Indeed, in many such devices, the display components may not be configured to report a pixel density; the device may therefore be unable to determine the pixel density of the display components and\/or to adjust the presentation to depict elements of a particular apparent size.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Some techniques have been devised to adjust presentations in view of the pixel density of a display component. As a first example, automated scaling may be applied to adjust the elements to a desired literal size; however, such automated scaling may yield blurry or otherwise undesirable artifacts of the adjustment. As a second example, the device may detect the pixel density of the display component, and the device may request each element to generate a scaled representation in view of the pixel density of the display. However, because the presentation may be displayed on a large number of display components, the elements may have to support a wide range of pixel densities, resulting in an overly complex and\/or resource-intensive presentation of elements.","The techniques presented herein may be utilized to generate a presentation of elements that is adjusted in view of the pixel density of the display component upon which the presentation is to be displayed. In accordance with these techniques, a scale factor set may be selected, comprising a small number of scale factors that are respectively used to adjust a presentation for displays having pixel densities within a pixel density range. For example, a pixel density set may include a 100% scale factor for display components having pixel densities from 8,000 pixels\/square unit to 12,000 pixels\/square unit; an 80% scale factor for display components having pixel densities less than 8,000 pixels\/square unit; a 140% scale factor for display components having pixel densities from 12,000 to 15,000 pixels\/square unit; and a 180% scale factor for display components having pixel densities greater than 15,000 pixels\/square unit. In this example, respective elements are configured to generate four scaled representations, each presenting the same content but rendered within different pixel dimensions, and an embodiment of these techniques may display one of the four scaled representations of respective elements in a presentation based on the pixel density of the display component. The presentation therefore includes elements with approximately the same visual dimensions on different display components, regardless of the sizes, pixel dimensions, and\/or pixel densities of the display components. While the use of a particular scale factor for a range of pixel densities may result in a wider range of variation than other techniques, the techniques presented herein achieve such scaling without automatically and arbitrarily scaling the elements and without configuring the elements to support a large number of pixel densities, and may therefore present an advantageous tradeoff of scaling, quality, and performance.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects, advantages, and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.","The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident, however, that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.","A. Introduction","Within the field of computing, many scenarios involve a presentation of elements on a display component of a device. As a first example, the presentation may comprise an image collection, such as a photo album, a set of icons, or a clip art gallery, and the presentation may comprise a depiction, thumbnail set, or index of the images of the collection. As a second example, the presentation may comprise a graphical user interface including a set of interactive controls having a graphical representation, such as buttons, checkboxes, and textboxes. As a third example, the presentation may comprise a set of interrelated visual components in a design drawing, e.g., an architectural blueprint, manufacturing schematic, or circuit diagram.","These and other presentations of elements may be generated and displayed on various types of devices. Such presentations are often displayed on a display component of a device, such as a cathode-ray television, a liquid crystal display (LCD), a light-emitting diode (LED) array, a plasma display, or a projector. Such display components may have various properties, such as physical size, color depth (e.g., monotone, grayscale, or varying ranges of color), refresh rate, and sensitivity to touch input. In order to render output on such display components, devices often generate the presentation as a data set, such as a bitmap (e.g., an array of color values for respective pixels of the display), that is rendered by a hardware blitter onto the display surface of the display component. Other presentations may be generated by a first device and delivered as a higher-level presentation to a second device for presentation on a display component attached thereto. For example, a webserver may generate a presentation to be displayed on a display component of a web client (e.g., a computer executing a web browser), and may therefore present a web page specifying a layout of embedded elements (e.g., text, drawn shapes, and images).","The appearance of the presentation on different display components may vary due to the characteristics of the particular display component. For many such characteristics, the designers of such presentations may predict the range of characteristics of such display components whereupon the presentation may be viewed, and may design the presentation to be rendered in an acceptable manner for any predicted combination of characteristics. As a first example, a designer may configure a presentation for acceptable rendering at a range of pixel dimensions; e.g., web pages are often designed with a flow layout that positions text in a readable manner despite the horizontal width of the presentation. As a second example, a designer may design a presentation as alternatively presenting high-color images for display components having a high color depth and low-color or grayscale images for display components having low color depth. Presentations may also vary based on the properties of the device; e.g., a web page may present a highly interactive interface for devices having plentiful computing resources or a less interactive interface for portable devices having limited computing resources (e.g., a web page having a \u201cfull version\u201d and a \u201cmobile version\u201d). Additionally, users of such devices often understand the properties of such display components and the variations in the presentation on different devices, and may use this understanding while purchasing and using such devices. For example, a user may adjust the pixel dimensions of a display component of a device in order to achieve a larger or smaller operating environment. Different devices may also inspire a different usage by users; e.g., a user may view a mobile device at a comparatively near distance, an LCD display of a workstation at a comparatively medium distance, and a home theater presentation at a comparatively far distance.","However, one characteristic that may vary significantly among display components, but that is less familiar to users, is the pixel density of the display component, such as the number of pixels that are displayed along a particular dimension or in an area of a particular physical size. In some cases, users may be indirectly familiar with this concept; e.g., by adjusting the pixel dimensions of a display component, the user may appreciate that the operating environment becomes larger or smaller and that elements within the operating environment appear larger or smaller, but may not directly understand that such adjustments alter the pixel density of the display component. Thus, if the user views an image scaled up to a full-screen presentation while the operating environment is presented at different pixel dimensions, the user may observe the image as the same physical size (scaled to take up the entire display surface), and may notice that the visual quality of the image varies, but may not understand why\u2014i.e., because altering the pixel dimensions of the display component varies the pixel density of the display component and affects the amount of detail included in the display component.","Developers may also not fully appreciate the consequences of pixel density while designing a presentation. For example, the presentation may be adaptable for display in a particular manner at particular pixel dimensions, but may not be adaptive to the pixel density of the display component. As a result, the presentation appears of different sizes and\/or quality when viewed on different display components. For example, a 1,024-pixel-wide web page may appear of an adequate size when rendered at a first pixel density on a display component of a notebook computer. However, when viewed as a 1,024-pixel-wide web page on a portable device (which may present a much higher pixel density in order to render such presentations on a smaller display component), the presentation may be illegibly small. Conversely, when viewed as a 1,024-pixel-wide web page on a large display component having a low pixel density (e.g., a 1.3-meter LCD display of a home theater system), the presentation may appear very large. Such variations may significantly impact the visual quality and usability of the presentation, but developers often do not design presentations to adapt to the pixel density of the display component. This failure is at least partly due to the difficulty in querying the pixel density of the display component; e.g., many older devices and platforms (such as older web browsers) failed to provide a mechanism for querying the pixel density of the presentation. Nevertheless, such variations may significantly impact the quality and usability of the presentation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106","108","110","112","110","102","108","110","114","108","110","102","116","106","110","112","102","116","106","108","110","112","102","116"]},"It may be appreciated that such variations in the physical sizes  of the presentation  are not directly related to the size of the display component  (e.g., the first and second display components are of the same size, but have different pixel dimensions , thus resulting in different pixel densities ), the pixel dimensions  of the display component  (e.g., two devices  may have display components  having the same pixel dimensions , but may be of different physical sizes, and may therefore present different pixel densities ); or the size or type of device (e.g., a portable device  may include a small display component  with a lower, higher, or equal pixel density  as that of a workstation device  with a large display component ). Therefore, a presentation  of a fixed logical size  may appear larger, smaller, or the same physical size  on the display component  of the portable device  than on the workstation device . Moreover, the user may not understand why this is the case, nor why adjusting the pixel dimensions  of the device  has an inverse relationship with the physical size  of the presentation  (e.g., it may seem counterintuitive to the user that increasing the pixel dimensions  of the display component  decreases the physical size  of the presentation ). Additionally, if rendered in a full-screen manner on the first display component  and the second display component , the presentation  may have the same physical size  but a different visual quality on each display component . In one such scenario, the presentation  may appear clearer on the second display component  due to the higher pixel density  of the display. However, in another such scenario, the presentation  may appear blurry on the second display component  due to a scaling that introduces visual artifacts in the appearance of the presentation . This diminished appearance may occur even if the second display component  is of generally higher visual quality. Due to an incomplete understanding of the different pixel densities  of the display components , the user may not understand the cause of such visual differences.","In addition to making a presentation  with an inconsistent appearance when displayed on different display components , or when displayed on the same display component  at different pixel dimensions , the inflexibility of the presentation  to the pixel density  of the display component  may present practical disadvantages. As a first example, elements  presented on a display component  at a low pixel density  may be very large, and may be difficult for the user to examine (e.g., extending beyond the peripheral vision of the user). As a second example, elements  presented on a display component  at a high pixel density  may be too small to be identifiable or legible, and in some cases, may not even be visible to the user. Such elements  may also be too small to select with a pointing device; e.g., many devices  feature a touchscreen input that is sensitive to touch from a pointer such as a fingertip or stylus, and a scaled-down representation presented on a portable may be too small to select with the pointer. This disadvantage may arise frequently in the area of portable devices , because such devices often feature display components  that are touch-sensitive and that also feature high pixel densities  in order to present high-quality output on the small display component . Thus, the inflexibility of the display of a presentation  in view of variable pixel densities  of the display components  of such devices  may present these and other aesthetic and\/or practical disadvantages.","B. Alternative Techniques","Some techniques may be utilized to adjust a presentation  in view of the variations in pixel densities  of the display components  upon which the presentation  is displayed. As a first such technique, developers may design the presentation  with a set of selectable pixel dimensions  (e.g., websites existing in different dimensions, such as a first set of web pages viewable at 800\u00d7600 pixel dimensions , a second set of web pages viewable at 1,024\u00d7768 pixel dimensions , and a third set of web pages viewable at 1,280\u00d71024 pixel dimensions ), and may enable visitors to select pixel dimensions  that are suitable for the device  and display component  operated by the user. While providing a greater degree of flexibility than fixed-resolution presentations , this technique addresses the problem in an indirect manner (e.g., often compensating for variable pixel densities  by completely adjusting the visual layout of the presentation ), and involve the attention, subjective judgment, and trial-and-error activities of the user to achieve a suitable presentation .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","108","102","112","110","108","102","106","110","116","102","202","106","110","112","202","116","108","202","110","110","110","112","202","108","204","206","114","116","110","204","202","114","204","206","110","102","116","110","112","108","204","208","110","116","204","208","204","202","208","102","110","116"]},"Additional techniques may be devised used to improve the scaling presented in the exemplary scenario  of . For example, anti-aliasing techniques may be provided to achieve more accurate scaling. Alternatively, the scaling may be applied to a rasterized version of the presentation  rather than a bitmap , leading to scaled representations that preserve the visual layout and relationships of the shapes of the presentation . However, such techniques may be highly complex and computationally intensive, and may lead to an inefficient use of computing resources and diminished performance of the device  (e.g., delays in the rendering of the presentation ). Due to this complexity, it may be difficult to utilize such techniques on devices  having limited computing resources, such as smartphones, which may be unable to apply such complex techniques in a performant manner. Moreover, any such automated scaling typically loses at least some information and introduces at least some visual artifacts and accuracy in the representation of the presentation .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","102","112","110","102","300","108","104","106","116","110","112","104","306","112","104","106","104","112","110","108","108","104","304","112","110","104","104","110","112","306","104","304","104","112","110"]},"A fourth technique for scaling elements  involves the design of a set of different scaled representations of respective elements . For example, in some operating environments, an icon resource may be provided by a developer for display with respect to an application (e.g., the application binary and data files generated and\/or consumed by the application). Such icons may also be provided in several logical sizes ; e.g., an icon resource may include a small version, a medium version, and a large version. In order to represent the application in various contexts, the operating environment may select any of these representations. However, in this technique, the respective icons are intended to be displayed at different sizes in different contexts. For example, the small icon may be presented as a thumbnail representation of the application, e.g., in a notification area; the medium icon may be presented as a notable indicator of the application, e.g., in an application launch menu; and the large icon may be presented within the user interface for the application. That is, the icons within an icon resource not only have different logical sizes , but are intended to be displayed at different physical sizes  depending on the type of representation of the associated concept, and not at the same size but selected in view of the pixel densities  of different display components . Moreover, such icons are typically designed with different information in view of the different logical sizes; e.g., the large icon may present a high-resolution logo with the full name of an application, while the medium icon may present a low-resolution logo with an abbreviated name or acronym of the application, and the small icon may present only the low-resolution logo. Thus, the differently sized representations within an icon resource are intended to present different information at different physical sizes  in different contexts, not as a consistent physical size  across display components  having variable pixel densities .","C. Presented Techniques","Presented herein are techniques for generating a presentation  of elements  for display on a display component  of a device  in a manner that adjusts for the pixel density  of the display component . In accordance with these techniques, it may be advantageous to devise a scaling technique that involves the designer of an element  included in a presentation (e.g., to reduce the inaccuracies that are often introduced by wholly automated scaling techniques), but to reduce the complexity of the design process of such elements  (e.g., by not involving the design of an algorithm or vectorized representation of the element ). Therefore, in accordance with these techniques, a small set of scale factors may be selected as a standard scale factor set. Developers of elements  may be advised to generate scaled representations of the element  in each scale factor (e.g., at different logical sizes  and\/or scale percentages). Moreover, each scale factor of the scale factor set may correlate to a pixel density range, and may be used to scale elements  for a set of display components  within a particular range of pixel densities . An embodiment of these techniques may therefore generate a presentation  for a particular display component  by receiving and\/or identifying the pixel density  of the display component , selecting a scale factor having a pixel density range including the pixel density of the display component , and requesting the elements  of the presentation  to generate a scaled representation  using the selected scale factor. The presentation  may therefore display the presentation  with approximately consistent physical sizes  of the elements  of the presentation  in view of the pixel density  of the display component .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","102","104","116","110","400","104","102","110","112","402","404","406","112","408","104","102","110","112","406","102","110","112","110","404","406","112","110","104","306","404","306","104","102","110","116"]},"It is noted that this technique may result in a less accurate scaling of the elements  of the presentation across display components . As a first example, the use of a small scale factor set , comprising a small number of scale factors  that each applies to a pixel density range  of pixel densities  may yield an approximately consistent physical size  of an element  across display components . As a second example, the small scale factor set  includes a minimum scale factor  and a maximum scale factor , and therefore does not scale elements  presented on display components  having unusually large or small pixel densities . However, these techniques may present some advantages with respect to alternative techniques, even if such alternative techniques may result in more accurate or robust scaling. As a first example, these techniques involve the attention of a designer in designing the scaled representations  of the element ; e.g., the designer may simply generate one scaled representation  for each scale factor . The visual quality of the scaled representations  is therefore likely to be higher than that of automatically scaled representations , such as depicted in the exemplary scenario  of . However, the selection of a small number of scale factors  may conserve the attention of the designer; e.g., the designer is only asked to design a small number of scaled representations , rather than designing scaled representations  for many possible pixel densities , as in the exemplary scenario  of . Moreover, the designer may satisfy this comparatively straightforward task with familiar design tools, rather than having to develop a complex algorithm or a rasterized representation of the element . As a second example, the reliance of these techniques on a small number of scaled representations  may reduce the computational resources consumed by an embodiment of these techniques. For example, rather than requesting an element  to generate a scaled representation  on-the-fly for any arbitrarily selected pixel density , an embodiment may request the element  to generate one of a small number of scaled representations , thereby enabling the element  to include or pre-render all of the potentially requested scaled representations , and\/or the use of caching to expedite the reuse of previously generated scaled representations . These and other advantages may be achieved through the generation of the presentation  with elements  scaled according to the pixel density  of the display component  of the device  in accordance with the techniques presented herein.","D.

Variations","The techniques discussed herein may be devised with variations in many aspects, and some variations may present additional advantages and\/or reduce disadvantages with respect to other variations of these and other techniques. Moreover, some variations may be implemented in combination, and some combinations may feature additional advantages and\/or reduced disadvantages through synergistic cooperation. The variations may be incorporated in various embodiments (e.g., the exemplary method  of  and the exemplary method  of ) to confer individual and\/or synergistic advantages upon such embodiments.","E1. Scenarios","A first aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the scenarios wherein such techniques may be utilized. As a first variation of this first aspect, these techniques may be used to generate many types of presentations  of elements , including graphical user interfaces comprising sets of graphical controls; images in an image set, such as a library; and interconnected visual elements in a design drawing, such as an architectural blueprint, manufacturing schematic, or circuit diagram. As a second variation of this first aspect, these techniques may be used to display the presentation  on many types of devices , including workstation computers, portable computers in notebook or tablet form factor, palmtop computers, smartphones, portable media players, game consoles, and media servers. As a third variation of this first aspect, these techniques may be used to scale the presentation according to the pixel density  of many types of display components , including a cathode-ray display; a liquid crystal display (LCD); a light-emitting diode (LED) array; a plasma display; and a projector. Such display components  may also support many types of features, including light sensitivity, pressure sensitivity, and touch sensitivity to various types of touch input. As a fourth variation of this first aspect, the architecture wherein the technique is utilized may vary in many ways. As a first such example, these techniques may be partly or wholly implemented as a circuit coupled with the display component ; in a software driver for the display component ; in a layer of the operating environment of the device ; or in an application executing on the device . As a second such example, two or more devices  may interoperate to display the presentation  according to the techniques presented herein. As one such example, the display component  may be accessible to a second device in communication with a first device , and the first device  may identify  the pixel density  by receiving the pixel density  of the display component  from the second device, and to send the presentation  to the second device to be displayed on the display component  (e.g., a webserver generating and sending to a client device a web page embedding elements  scaled according to the techniques presented herein). Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many such scenarios wherein the techniques presented herein may be utilized.","E2. Pixel Density and Scale Factors","A second aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the identification of the pixel density  of the display component  and the selection of a scale factor  from the scale factor set . As a first variation of this second aspect, the pixel density  may be identified in various ways. As a first such example, if the display component  is accessible to the device  embodying these techniques, the device  may be able to query the display component  to report the pixel density  (e.g., the display component  may present an application programming interface (API) through which the properties of the display component  may be queried). Alternatively, the device  may be able to infer the pixel density  of the display component , e.g., according to video tests or the performance characteristics of the display component . As another alternative, the device  may query a user of the device  to specify the pixel density  of the display component .","As a second variation of this second aspect, the scale factors set  may be generated in many ways. As discussed herein, it may be advantageous to keep the number of scale factors  comparatively small in order to reduce the magnitude of the design task placed on the developers of the elements . For example, the scale factor set  may include a first scale factor  that is selected based on a first pixel density range  comprising at least a first pixel density  and a second pixel density , and a second scale factor  that is selected based on a second pixel density range  comprising at least a third pixel density  and a fourth pixel density . The scale factors  of the scale factor set  may also be selected in view of a target size of the presentation ; e.g., it may be desirable to render the presentation  or the elements  at a particular physical size , and to select the scale factors  in order to scale the presentation  and\/or elements  to the physical size  on particular types of devices . Additionally, the scale factor set  may include a first scale factor  indicating a scaling up of the elements  (e.g., having a scale factor value  greater than one) and a second scale factor  indicating a scaling down of the elements  (e.g., having a scale factor value  less than one), thereby enabling elements  to be scaled either up or down according to the pixel density  of the display component .","As one such example, the scale factors  may be selected to position and\/or size the elements  within a particular element grid, which a designer may devise and utilize to select the positions and\/or sizes of elements  in order to achieve a desirable alignment. Thus, even if the scaled representations  of the elements  are presented at different logical sizes  within the presentation  (in order to appear with approximately consistent physical sizes  within the presentation  when presented on display components  having different pixel densities ), the elements  remain aligned with one another and with other aspects of the presentation . Moreover, the element grid may comprise pixel boundaries at particular locations, and the scale factors  to be used for the presentation  involving the element grid; e.g., the scale factors  may be selected to, for elements  of an element type having a native size, scale the elements  to match the pixel boundaries of the element grid. This selection of scale factors  may enable the presentation of scaled representations  of the elements  without having to adjust for a partial overlapping of a pixel that may lead to visual artifacts.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","804","802","800","104","102","304","116","104","112","110","102","104","102","306","104","102","804","104","404","402","102","404","402","306","408","106","306","804","102","110","108","306","104","112","110","104","306","804"]},"As a third variation of this second aspect, the scale factors  may be adjusted in various ways. As a first such example, the device  may enable a user to select a user scale factor in order to specify that the elements  of the presentation  are to be rendered larger or smaller than by default (e.g., the elements  may be scaled down in order to enable the maximize the display space of the operating environment, or may be scaled up in order to facilitate a user with poor vision). Therefore, while selecting scale factors  for a presentation , an embodiment of these techniques may be configured to select a scale factor  from the scale factor set  based on the user scale factor as well as the pixel density  of the display component . For example, in order to scale the elements  up in accordance with a user scale factor, the embodiment may identify the scale factor  according to the pixel density  of the display component , and may instead select for application to the elements  the next higher scale factor  in the scale factor set . As a second such example, the selection of the scale factor  may be adjusted in view of other considerations (e.g., if the scaled representations  of the elements  may be disproportionate with other elements of the display , or if the scaled presentation  may substantially fill or even exceed the resolution of the display component , the scaling may be reduced or not performed).","As a fourth variation of this second aspect, the scale factors  (including the pixel density ranges  and the scale factor values ) may be specified in various ways. As one such example, the scale factor value  may be specified as a percentage of the native sizes of the elements , e.g., scaling the element  up to 150% of its native size, or down to 75% of its native size. The scaling factor value  may also be specified in other ways, e.g., a fixed number of pixels to be added to the width and\/or height dimensions of the element . As a second such example, the values within the scale factor range  may be specified in various ways, such as a horizontal pixel density, a vertical pixel density, or a pixel area density (e.g., pixels\/cm). In particular, the manner of representing the pixel densities  of the pixel density ranges  of the scale factors  may affect the performance of the embodiment. For example, if such pixel densities  are specified as pixels per unit (e.g., 100 pixels\/cm), and if the display component  reports its pixel density  as pixels per square unit (e.g., 10,000 pixels\/cm), the device  may have to perform a square-root mathematical operation on the reported pixel density  in order to compare the values. Because such square-root operations are often slow and may involve floating-point numbers, it may be advantageous to store the pixel densities  in the scale factors  as a pixel count per square area, so that the values may be directly compared, or may be compared by computing a pixel count per square area from the information reported by the display component , which involves a multiplication instead of a floating-point mathematical operation. Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many such variations in the detection of the pixel density  of the display component  and the generation and use of the scale factors  of the scale factor set  in accordance with the techniques presented herein.","E3. Generating Scaled Representations and Presentations","A third aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the manner of generating the scaled representations  of the elements  and the presentation  incorporating such scaled representations . As a first variation, one or more scaled representations  at respective scale factors  may be pre-generated (e.g., by a designer of the element  and\/or presentation ) and may be stored by the element , and requesting the element  to generate a scaled representation  may simply involve retrieving the pre-generated scaled representation  from the element . Alternatively, the element  may generate the scaled representation  on a just-in-time basis, e.g., when requested for inclusion in a particular presentation . In order to improve the efficiency of such generation, an embodiment of these techniques may generate on the device  a scaled representation cache, wherein scaled representations  generated by respective elements  for respective scale factors  may be stored for reuse. In this variation, before requesting an element  to generate a scaled representation  for a particular scale factor , the embodiment may first query the scaled representation cache for a scaled representation  of the element  at the selected scale factor , and may retrieve and use a cached scaled representation  if located; and upon failing to locate such a scaled representation  in the scaled representation cache, the embodiment may, after requesting the element  to generate the scaled representation , store the received scaled representation  in the scaled representation cache associated with the element  and the scale factor  for later re-use.","As a second variation of this third aspect, an embodiment may vary in some ways in generating of the presentation  using the scaled representations  of the elements . As a first such variation, where respective elements  have an element type, the embodiment may selectively request the elements  of a first element type to generate scaled representations , and may include unscaled representations for elements  of a second element type in the presentation . For example, where the elements  are of element types such as a static image, an animating image, and an interactive control, an embodiment may be configured to scale only the elements  comprising interactive controls, because the techniques may be applied only to promote a consistent size among interactive elements  (and to render other elements  at a native, unscaled size). As a second such variation, the presentation  may comprise two or more presentation contexts, and an embodiment may be configured to generate the presentation  with scaled representations  of the elements  for a first presentation context, but to generate the presentation  with natively sized and unscaled representations  of the elements  for a second presentation context. As one such example, a presentation  may or may not be presented on a touch-responsive display component  that is responsive to fingertip input of a fingertip of a user, and it may be advantageous to apply the scaling techniques only when the presentation  is displayed in a touch-responsive presentation (and refraining from scaling the elements  in a touch-unresponsive presentation).","As a third variation of this third aspect, an embodiment of these techniques may be configured to reapply the techniques presented herein in the event of a change in the pixel density  of the display component  upon which the presentation  is displayed. As a first such variation, the presentation  may be moved from a first display component  to a second display component  of the same device  or a different device , and the display components  may have different pixel densities . As a second such variation, the pixel dimensions  of the display component  may change, causing a change in the pixel density  of the display component . Therefore, the scaled representations  selected based on the previously selected scale factor  may be unsuitable for the second pixel density , and the techniques presented herein may be reapplied to generate a second presentation  featuring a second set of scaled representations  of the elements  using a second scale factor .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["900","900","108","110","110","902","900","104","102","110","110","110","110","108","102","116","112","110","110","112","104","116","112","906","108","104","116","102","112","110","102","904","102","110","110","108","102","112","112","110","102"]},"F.
