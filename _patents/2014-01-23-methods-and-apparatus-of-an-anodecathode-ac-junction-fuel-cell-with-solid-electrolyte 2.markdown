A rapidly expanding need for electric power sources has stimulated the worldwide research and development of fuel cells for transportation, portable computer, cellular phone and various electronic devices. Typically, a fuel cell is assembled using a 2-electrode configuration. The cathode, or positive electrode, is coated with a catalyst for oxygen reduction. The anode is coated with a catalyst for fuel oxidation. An electrolyte, between the cathode and the anode, provides ionic conductivity for ion transport, and induces the electrochemical reactions at the electrode\/electrolyte interface.","A fuel cell generally uses liquid or gaseous fuel, such as alcohol or hydrogen. In a hydrogen fuel cell, the electrode reactions is:","At the anode,\n\n2H\u21924H+4=0.0V \u2003\u2003(1)\n","At the cathode,\n\nO+4H+4\u21922HO=1.23V \u2003\u2003(2)\n","The overall reaction is,\n\n2H+O\u21922HO=1.23V \u2003\u2003(3)\n","An electro-oxidized molecule of hydrogen generates two protons and two electrons. Meanwhile, a molecule of oxygen is electro-reduced by receiving four electrons. The electro-reduced molecule of oxygen combines with 4 protons to form two molecules of water. The theoretical cell voltage of such a fuel cell is 1.23 V. However, because of slow kinetic rate and high over potential for oxygen electro-reduction, the actual cell voltage is only 1.0 V in open circuit, and 0.75 V in operational status.","In an alcohol fuel cell, such as a direct methanol fuel cell, the electrode reaction is:","At the anode,\n\nCHOH+HO\u2550CO+6H+6=0.02V \u2003\u2003(4)\n","The overall reaction of a methanol fuel cell is,",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":"CH","mn":"3"},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"OH"},{"mfrac":{"mn":["3","2"]},"mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mi":"O","mn":"2"}}],"mo":"+"},{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":"CO","mn":"2"},"mo":"+","mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"msub":{"mi":"H","mn":"2"},"mi":"O","mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"msubsup":{"mi":["E","cell"],"mn":"0"}}},{"mn":"1.21","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mi":"V"}],"mo":"="}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"5"}}]}}}}},"An electro-oxidized molecule of methanol generates one molecule of carbon dioxide, six protons and six electrons. The theoretical voltage for a methanol\/oxygen fuel cell is 1.21V. However, due to very slow kinetics and high over potential of methanol electro-oxidation, such a fuel cell has only 0.7 V for open circuit voltage and 0.4 V in operational status. Furthermore, the greatest challenge for direct alcohol fuel cell is fuel crossover from the anode to the cathode, leading to cathode depolarization, decreasing overall fuel cell's voltage and lowering fuel efficiency. Fuel crossover is a greater problem with increasing fuel concentration. In order to reduce fuel crossover, generally, a fuel cell can use only very low concentration of fuel, for example, less than 1 M for a methanol fuel cell.","Therefore, the inventors have provided an improved fuel cell for generating hydrogen gas, electrical power and mediation of electrochemical reactions and reactant transport.","Embodiments of the present invention relate to a fuel cell which may include an anode; a cathode opposing the anode; a first electrolyte membrane disposed between the anode and the cathode; a second electrolyte membrane disposed between the anode and the cathode; and an A\/C junction electrode disposed between the first electrolyte membrane and the second electrolyte membrane, the A\/C junction electrode comprising a first gas diffusion layer, a second gas diffusion layer, a current collector disposed between the first gas diffusion layer and the second gas diffusion layer, a first catalyst layer disposed between the first electrolyte membrane and the first gas diffusion layer, and a second catalyst layer disposed between the second electrolyte membrane and the second gas diffusion layer.","In some embodiments, a method of generating electric power may include (a) supplying air and fuel to a fuel cell comprising (i) an anode, (ii) a cathode, (iii) a first electrolyte membrane disposed between the anode and the cathode, (iv) a second electrolyte membrane disposed between the anode and the cathode, and (v) an A\/C junction electrode disposed between the first electrolyte membrane and the second electrolyte membrane, the A\/C junction electrode comprising (1) a first gas diffusion layer, (2) a second gas diffusion layer, (3) a first current collector disposed between the first gas diffusion layer and the second gas diffusion layer, (4) a first catalyst layer disposed between the first electrolyte membrane and the first gas diffusion layer, and (5) a second catalyst layer disposed between the second electrolyte membrane and the second gas diffusion layer, wherein the fuel is supplied to the anode and the air is supplied to the cathode; and (b) supplying a first voltage to the fuel cell to process the fuel into hydrogen.","Other and further embodiments of the invention are described in more detail below.","Embodiments of the present invention include an anode\/cathode (A\/C) junction fuel cell.
