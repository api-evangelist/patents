{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CLAIM OF PRIORITY","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application 60\/746,367, \u201cSoftPhone With Simplified Calling,\u201d filed on May 4, 2006, by Lon-Chan Chu, Pitak Leelaphisut and Praveen Kumar Vemparala, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP) is a technology that allows users to make telephone calls using a broadband Internet connection instead of a traditional telephone line. Some services using VOIP may only allow users to call other people who are also using VOIP. However, many services also allow users to call anyone who has a telephone number\u2014including local, long distance, mobile, and international numbers. While some services only work over a computer or a special VOIP phone, other services allow use of a traditional telephone through an adaptor.","To encourage the use of VOIP, technology providers have sought ways to make VOIP more convenient and efficient to use. One attempt to encourage the use of VOIP includes the use of hyperlinks. Developers of VOIP applications have implemented technology that allows providers of content to include hyperlinks in the content. Users can initiate telephone calls by executing (e.g., selecting) the hyperlink. However, the use of these hyperlinks has been limited. For example, some hyperlinks only provide the user with the ability to initiate a telephone call to a preset telephone number.","Even with the hyperlinks, the user typically will still need to perform manual steps for many administrative functions. Additionally, some telephone numbers may only be valid during certain time periods. Outside the time periods, the hyperlink will not be useful because the target telephone number is not valid.","The technology described herein facilitates the use of a communication application with the introduction of a new hyperlink.","A hyperlink is added to user interface code to provide a user with an easy way to access various functions of a communication application. The hyperlink can provide target telephone numbers in different formats, specify a web page (or other content) to be displayed during a call, specify rules to be used to identify a telephone number from a set of telephone numbers, and include commands to manage the communication application.","One embodiment includes receiving a selection of a link in a first interface, establishing a voice connection based on the link, accessing content over a network based on the link, and presenting the content while the voice connection is operational. Another embodiment includes receiving information from a link selected in a first interface, accessing a command in the information, and executing the command using a voice communication application. Another embodiment includes receiving a selection of a link in a first interface, accessing a rule referenced in the link, choosing a communication target based on evaluating the rule, and establishing communication with the target using a communication interface.","The technology described herein can be implemented using hardware, software, or a combination of both hardware and software. The software used is stored on one or more processor readable storage devices including hard disk drives, CD-ROMs, DVDs, optical disks, floppy disks, tape drives, RAM, ROM, flash memory, or other suitable storage devices. This software can be used to program one or more processors to perform the functions described herein. In alternative embodiments, some or all of the software can be replaced by dedicated hardware including custom integrated circuits, gate arrays, FPGAs, PLDs, and special purpose computers. An exemplar apparatus that can perform the functions described herein includes one or more processors in communication with a storage device and a communication interface.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","The technology described herein facilitates the use of a communication application with a hyperlink. One or more of the hyperlinks are added to user interface code to provide a user with an easy way to access various functions of a communication application. The hyperlink can provide target telephone numbers in different formats, specify a web page to be displayed during a call, specify rules to be used to identify a telephone number from a set of telephone numbers, and include commands to manage the communication application.
