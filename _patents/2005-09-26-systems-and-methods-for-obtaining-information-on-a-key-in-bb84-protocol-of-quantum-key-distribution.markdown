Technical Field","The present disclosure is generally related to the secure communication of encrypted data using quantum cryptography.","2. Description of the Related Art","Research efforts by many investigators have significantly advanced the field of quantum cryptography since the pioneering discoveries of Wiesner, Bennett and Brassard, as shown in the following references: N. Gisin, G. Ribordy, W. Tittel, and H. Zbinden, \u201cQuantum cryptography,\u201d 74, pp. 145-195 (2002); S. Wiesner, \u201cConjugate coding,\u201d Vol. 15, No. 1, pp. 78-88 (1983); C. H. Bennett and G. Brassard, \u201cQuantum cryptography, public key distribution and coin tossing,\u201d , Bangalore, India, pp. 175-179, (IEEE 1984); C. H. Bennett and G. Brassard, \u201cQuantum public key distribution system,\u201d IBM Tech. Discl. Bull. Vol. 28, No. 7, pp. 3153-3163, (1985), all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Emphasis has been placed on quantum key distribution, the generation by means of quantum mechanics of a secure random binary sequence which can be used together with the Vernam cipher (one-time pad) as discussed in G. Vernam, \u201cCipher printing telegraph systems for secret wire and radio telegraph communications,\u201d . Vol. 45, pp. 295-301 (1926), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, for secure encryption and decryption. Various protocols have been devised for quantum key distribution, including the single-particle four-state Bennett-Brassard protocol (BB84), Bennett (1984), the single-particle two-state Bennett protocol (B92) as in C. H. Bennett, \u201cQuantum cryptography using any two nonorthogonal states,\u201d . Vol. 68, pp. 3121-3124 (1992), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, and the two-particle entangled-state Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) protocol as in A. K. Ekert, \u201cQuantum cryptography based on Bell's theorem,\u201d . Vol. 57, pp. 661-663 (1991), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. However the original BB84 protocol is presently perceived as the most practical and robust protocol.","One effective implementation of the BB84 protocol uses single photons linearly polarized along one of the four basis vectors of two sets of coplanar orthogonal bases oriented at an angle of 45 degrees (equivalently, \u03c0\/4) relative to each other. The polarization measurement operators in one basis do not commute with those in the other, since they correspond to nonorthogonal polarization states. At a fundamental level, the potential security of the key rests on the fact that nonorthogonal photon polarization measurement operators do not commute, and this results in quantum uncertainty in the measurement of those states by an eavesdropping probe, as in H. E. Brandt, \u201cPositive operator valued measure in quantum information processing,\u201d . Vol. 67, pp. 434-439 (1999), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Before transmission of each photon, the transmitter and receiver each independently and randomly select one of the two bases. The transmitter sends a single photon with polarization chosen at random along one of the orthogonal basis vectors in the chosen basis. The receiver makes a polarization measurement in its chosen basis. Next, the transmitter and the receiver, using a public communication channel, openly compare their choices of basis, without disclosing the polarization states transmitted or received. Events in which the transmitter and the receiver choose different bases are ignored, while the remaining events ideally have completely correlated polarization states. The two orthogonal states in each of the bases encode binary numbers 0 and 1, and thus a sequence of photons transmitted in this manner can establish a random binary sequence shared by both the transmitter and the receiver and can then serve as the secret key, following error correction and privacy amplification, as in C. H. Bennett, G. Brassard, C. Crepeau, and V. M. Maurer, \u201cGeneralized privacy amplification,\u201d , Vol. 41, pp. 1915-1923 (1995), and C. H. Bennett, F. Bessette, G. Brassard, L. Salvail, and J. Smolin, \u201cExperimental quantum cryptography,\u201d , Vol. 5, pp. 3-28 (1992), both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Privacy amplification is of course necessary because of the possibility of an eavesdropping attack, as in Gisin (2002), Bennett (1984), and Bennett (1985). Using the Vernam cipher, the key can then be used to encode a message which can be securely transmitted over an open communication line and then decoded, using the shared secret key at the receiver. (The encrypted message can be created at the transmitter by adding the key to the message and can be decrypted at the receiver by subtracting the shared secret key.)","Numerous analyses of various eavesdropping strategies have appeared in the literature, see e.g., Gisin (2002). Attack approaches include coherent collective attacks in which the eavesdropper entangles a separate probe with each transmitted photon and measures all probes together as one system, and also coherent joint attacks in which a single probe is entangled with the entire set of carrier photons. However, these approaches require maintenance of coherent superpositions of large numbers of states.","Systems and methods for obtaining information on the BB84 protocol of quantum key distribution are provided. In this regard, an embodiment of a system can be implemented as follows. A single photon source is configured to produce a probe photon. A polarization filter is configured to determine an optimum initial probe photon polarization state for a set error rate induced by the device. A quantum controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate is configured to provide entanglement of a signal photon polarization state with the probe photon polarization state and produce a gated probe photon correlated with the signal photon so as to obtain information on a key. A Wollaston prism is configured to separate the gated probe photon with polarization appropriately correlated with a signal photon as measured by a receiver. Two single-photon photodetectors are configured to measure the polarization state of the gated probe photon. The CNOT gate may be further configured to provide optimum entanglement of the signal with the probe photon polarization state so as to obtain maximum R\u00e9nyi information from the signal.","An embodiment of a method for obtaining information on a key in the BB84 protocol of quantum key distribution comprises the steps of: configuring a single photon source for producing a probe photon; determining an initial probe photon polarization state corresponding to a set error rate induced by a probe; entangling a signal with a probe photon polarization state and producing a gated probe photon; separating the gated probe photon with polarization correlated with a signal measured by a receiver; measuring the polarization state of the gated probe photon; accessing information on polarization-basis selection available on a public classical communication channel between the transmitter and the receiver; and determining the polarization state measured by the receiver. A quantum CNOT gate may be further configured to provide optimum entanglement of the signal with the probe photon polarization state so as to obtain maximum R\u00e9nyi information from the signal.","Other systems, methods, features, and advantages of the present disclosure will be or become apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following drawings and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems, methods, features, and advantages be included within this description, be within the scope of the present disclosure, and be protected by the accompanying claims.","Reference is now made in detail to the description of several exemplary embodiments as illustrated in the drawings.

A. Slutsky, R. Rao, P. C. Sun, and Y. Fainman, \u201cSecurity of quantum cryptography against individual attacks,\u201d Vol. 57, pp. 2383-2398 (1998), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, which on average yields the most information to the eavesdropper for a given error rate caused by the probe. The most general possible probe consistent with unitarity was considered in which each individual transmitted bit is made to interact with the probe so that the carrier and the probe are left in an entangled state, and measurement by the probe, made subsequent to measurement by the legitimate receiver, yields information about the carrier state. The probe can be used in an individual attack in which each transmitted photon is measured independently, given that the polarization basis is revealed on the public communication channel. See the following references: Slutsky (1998), as above; C. A. Fuchs and A. Peres, \u201cQuantum-state disturbance versus information gain: uncertainty relations for quantum information,\u201d Vol. 53, pp. 2038-2045 (1996); H. E. Brandt, \u201cProbe optimization in four-state protocol of quantum cryptography,\u201d Vol. 66, 032303-1-16 (2002); H. E. Brandt, \u201cSecrecy capacity in the four-state protocol of quantum key distribution,\u201d . Vol. 43, pp. 4526-4530 (2002); H. E.

Brandt, \u201cOptimum probe parameters for entangling probe in quantum key distribution,\u201d Vol. 2, pp. 37-79 (2003); and H. E. Brandt, \u201cOptimized unitary transformation for BB84 entangling probe,\u201d ., Vol. 5436, pp. 48-64 (2004), all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. It should be noted that in Equation (132) of Brandt (2004), sin \u03bc and cos \u03bc should be interchanged in the coefficient of |w only. Also, e should be e. In Equation (195), the overall sign of the coefficient of |w should be \u2213, rather than \u00b1.","A complete optimization was performed by Brandt (\u201cProbe optimization in four-state protocol of quantum cryptography,\u201d 2002, \u201cOptimization problem in quantum cryptography,\u201d 2003, \u201cOptimum probe parameters for entangling probe in quantum key distribution,\u201d 2003, and \u201cOptimized unitary transformation for BB84 entangling probe,\u201d 2004 above), in which three previously unknown sets of optimum probe parameters were obtained, all yielding the identical maximum information gain by the probe. The probe optimizations were based on maximizing the R\u00e9nyi information gain by the probe on corrected data for a given error rate induced by the probe in the legitimate receiver. A minimum overlap of the probe states which are correlated with the signal states (because of the entanglement) determines the maximum R\u00e9nyi information gain by the probe. This is related to the idea that the more nearly orthogonal the correlated states are, the easier they are to distinguish. The upper bound on R\u00e9nyi information gain by the probe is needed to calculate the secrecy capacity of the BB84 protocol and to determine the number of bits which must be sacrificed during privacy amplification in order that it be exponentially unlikely that more than token leakage of the final key be available to the eavesdropper following key distillation (see Brandt, \u201cSecrecy capacity in the four-state protocol of quantum key distribution,\u201d 2002).","Using the simplest optimal set of probe parameters, it was shown by Brandt (2004) that the above unitary transformation representing the probe produces the following entanglements for initial probe state |w and incoming BB84 signal states |u, |\u016b, |v, or | ,

It was shown in Brandt (2004) that the tensor products of the initial state |w of the probe with the orthonormal basis states |e and |e of the signal transform as follows (See Equation (1) and Equations (35) through (40) of Brandt (2004)), again with the positive over-all sign choice in Equation (26) of Brandt (2004):\n\n|{circle around (\u00d7)}{circle around (\u00d7)}|\u2003\u2003(9)\n\nand\n\n|{circle around (\u00d7)}{circle around (\u00d7)}|,\u2003\u2003(10)\n\nexpressed in terms of probe states |A and |A, where\n\n|=\u03b1+\u03b1,\u2003\u2003(11)\n\n|=\u03b1+\u03b1,\u2003\u2003(12)\n\nin which\n\n\u03b1=2(1\u00b1\u03b7),\u2003\u2003(13)\n\n\u03b1=2(1\u2213\u03b7),\u2003\u2003(14)\n\nand \u03b7 is given by Equation (8).\n","In the two-dimensional Hilbert space of the signal, the two orthogonal basis states |e and |e are oriented symmetrically about the signal states |u and |v, and make angles of \u03c0\/8 with the signal states |u and |v, respectively, e.g., Slutsky (1998). Next, consider a quantum controlled-not gate (CNOT gate), in which the control qubit consists of the two signal basis states {|e, |e}, and the target qubit consists of the probe basis states {|w, |w}, and such that when |e enters the control port then {|w, |w} becomes {|w, |w} at the target output port, or when |e enters the control port then {|w, |w} remains unchanged. It then follows that a quantum circuit affecting the transformations (9) and (10), and thereby faithfully representing the entangling probe, consists of this CNOT gate with the state |A always entering the target port, and {|e, |e} entering the control port. When |e enters the control port, then |A becomes |A, or when |e enters the control port then |A remains unchanged, in agreement with Equations (9) and (10) with |w=|A. According to the quantum circuit model of quantum computation, it is known that three CNOT gates are in general necessary and sufficient in order to implement an arbitrary number of unitary transformations of two qubits, G. Vidal and C. M. Dawson, \u201cUniversal quantum circuit for two-qubit transformations with three controlled-NOT gates,\u201d Vol. 69, 010301-1-4 (2004), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In the present case, a single CNOT gate suffices to faithfully represent the optimized unitary transformation.","Next expanding the signal state |u in terms of the signal basis states, using Equation

object of the present disclosure is to provide an eavesdropping probe for obtaining maximum information on the pre-privacy-amplified key in the BB84 protocol of quantum key distribution.

The signal photon enters the control port of the CNOT gate. The initial state of the probe is a photon in linear-polarization state |A and entering the target port of the CNOT gate. The probe photon is produced by a single-photon source and is appropriately timed with reception of the signal photon by first sampling a few successive signal pulses to determine the repetition rate of the transmitter.

gate)  in which the control qubit consists of two photon-polarization basis states of the signal, the target qubit consists of the two probe-photon polarization basis states, and the probe photon is prepared in the initial linear-polarization state, Equation (49), set by the induced error rate. The initial polarization state of the probe photon can be produced by a single-photon source  together with a linear polarizer . The probe photon can be appropriately timed with reception of a signal photon by first sampling a few successive signal pulses to determine the repetition rate of the transmitter . The gated probe photon , optimally entangled with the signal, enters a Wollaston prism , which separates the appropriate correlated states of the probe photon to trigger one or the other of two photodetectors  or . Basis selection, revealed on the public channel during basis reconciliation in the BB84 protocol, is exploited to correlate photodetector clicks with the signal transmitting the key, and to assign the most likely binary numbers, 1 or 0, such that the information gain by the quantum cryptographic entangling probe  of the key, prior to privacy amplification, is maximal. Explicit design parameters for the entangling probe are analytically specified, including: (1) the explicit initial polarization state of the probe photon, Equation (49); (2) the transition state of the probe photon, Equation (52); (3) the probabilities that one or the other photodetector triggers corresponding to a 0 or 1 of the key, Equations (40) and (41); (4) the relative angles between the various linear-polarization states in the Hilbert space of the probe, Equations (53) and (55); and (5) the information gain by the probe, Equation (50).","The quantum cryptographic entangling probe  is a simple special-purpose quantum information processor that will improve the odds for an eavesdropper in gaining access to the pre-privacy-amplified key, as well as imposing a potentially severe sacrifice of key bits during privacy amplification (Brandt, \u201cSecrecy capacity in the four-state protocol of quantum key distribution,\u201d 2002). The quantum cryptographic entangling probe  measures the maximum information on the pre-privacy amplified key in the BB84 protocol of quantum key distribution.","It should be emphasized that the above-described embodiments of the present disclosure, are merely possible examples of implementations, merely set forth for a clear understanding of the principles of the disclosure.
