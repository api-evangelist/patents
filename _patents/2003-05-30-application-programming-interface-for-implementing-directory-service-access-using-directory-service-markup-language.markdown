title: Application programming interface for implementing directory service access using directory service markup language
abstract: A set of DSML application programming interface (DSML API) functions is provided to facilitate the implementation of DSML-based directory service access. The DSML API includes a DSML document API class for building or accessing a DSML payload, and a DSML connection API class that handles connection and transport to a DSML server. To access a directory service, the client calls functions of the DSML document API class to generate a DSML request payload, and calls functions of the DSML connection API to transport a packet with the DSML request payload according to a pre-selected connection protocol, such as SOAP, to the DSML server for forwarding to the directory service.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION","EXAMPLE 1","Connecting to a DSML Server and Sending a Document Request","EXAMPLE 2","DSML Connection with SSL and Basic Authentication","EXAMPLE ","DSML Connection with Session","EXAMPLE 4","DSML Using Client-certificate Authentication"],"p":["This invention relates generally to computer software, and more particularly to software programming for implementing Directory Service Markup Language (DSML)-based directory service access.","Directory Service Markup Language is an OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards) approved standard specification that defines directory operations (e.g., Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)) in XML form. The DSML v.2 specification has been widely adopted by many software and hardware vendors in the field of directory services.","In one popular approach to implementing directory service access using the DSML v.2 (e.g., the DSML Services for Windows (DSFW) of Microsoft Corporation), a DSML server is provided as an intermediate between a client and a directory service (e.g., the Active Directory of Microsoft Corporation). To use the directory service, the client sends a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) packet with a DSML request as its payload over the network connection to the DSML server. The DSML server converts the received DSML request into a LDAP request, and sends the LDAP request to the directory service. After the directory service responds to the LDAP request, the DSML server converts the LDAP response into a DSML response payload, and return it to the requesting client in a SOAP response.","Although this scheme of enabling DSML-based access to the directory service is very successful, it requires the client to have the ability to construct DSML payloads and handle SOAP packets. To develop such client applications, the client application developers need to have intimate knowledge of DSML v.2 and SOAP, which is often a difficult condition to meet. According, there is a need to simplify the task of client application development to make it easier to utilize the DSML-based directory service access scheme as described above.","In view of the foregoing, the present invention provides a set of DSML application programming interface (DSML API) functions that may be called by a client application for handling DSML-based directory service requests and responses. In accordance with the invention, the DSML API includes a DSML document API class that concerns only building or accessing a DSML payload and is independent of network connection, and a DSML connection API class that handles connection and transport to a DSML server that is independent of DSML document processing. To access a directory service, the client calls API functions of the DSML document API class to generate a DSML request payload, and calls API functions of the DSML connection API class to construct a request packet with the DSML request payload and transporting the request packet according to a pre-selected connection protocol to the DSML server for forwarding to the directory service.","Turning to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to like elements, the invention is illustrated as being implemented in a suitable computing environment. Although not required, the invention will be described in the general context of computer-executable instructions, such as program modules, being executed by a personal computer. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, etc. that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Moreover, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention may be practiced with other computer system configurations, including hand-held devices, multi-processor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, network PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers, and the like. The invention may be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote memory storage devices.","The following description begins with a description of a general-purpose computing device that may be used in an exemplary system for implementing the invention, and the DSML API of the invention will be described in greater detail with reference to . Turning now to , a general purpose computing device is shown in the form of a conventional personal computer , including a processing unit , a system memory , and a system bus  that couples various system components including the system memory to the processing unit . The system bus  may be any of several types of bus structures including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, and a local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. The system memory includes read only memory (ROM)  and random access memory (RAM) . A basic input\/output system (BIOS) , containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within the personal computer , such as during start-up, is stored in ROM . The personal computer  further includes a hard disk drive  for reading from and writing to a hard disk , a magnetic disk drive  for reading from or writing to a removable magnetic disk , and an optical disk drive  for reading from or writing to a removable optical disk  such as a CD ROM or other optical media.","The hard disk drive , magnetic disk drive , and optical disk drive  are connected to the system bus  by a hard disk drive interface , a magnetic disk drive interface , and an optical disk drive interface , respectively. The drives and their associated computer-readable media provide nonvolatile storage of computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules and other data for the personal computer . Although the exemplary environment described herein employs a hard disk , a removable magnetic disk , and a removable optical disk , it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other types of computer readable media which can store data that is accessible by a computer, such as magnetic cassettes, flash memory cards, digital video disks, Bernoulli cartridges, random access memories, read only memories, storage area networks, and the like may also be used in the exemplary operating environment.","A number of program modules may be stored on the hard disk , magnetic disk , optical disk , ROM  or RAM , including an operating system , one or more applications programs , other program modules , and program data . A user may enter commands and information into the personal computer  through input devices such as a keyboard  and a pointing device . Other input devices (not shown) may include a microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner, or the like. These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit  through a serial port interface  that is coupled to the system bus, but may be connected by other interfaces, such as a parallel port, game port or a universal serial bus (USB) or a network interface card. A monitor  or other type of display device is also connected to the system bus  via an interface, such as a video adapter . In addition to the monitor, personal computers typically include other peripheral output devices, not shown, such as speakers and printers.","The personal computer  may operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computer . The remote computer  may be another personal computer, a server, a router, a network PC, a peer device or other common network node, and typically includes many or all of the elements described above relative to the personal computer , although only a memory storage device  has been illustrated in . The logical connections depicted in  include a local area network (LAN)  and a wide area network (WAN) . Such networking environments are commonplace in offices, enterprise-wide computer networks, intranets and the Internet.","When used in a LAN networking environment, the personal computer  is connected to the local network  through a network interface or adapter . When used in a WAN networking environment, the personal computer  typically includes a modem  or other means for establishing communications over the WAN . The modem , which may be internal or external, is connected to the system bus  via the serial port interface . In a networked environment, program modules depicted relative to the personal computer , or portions thereof, may be stored in the remote memory storage device. It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers may be used.","In the description that follows, the invention will be described with reference to acts and symbolic representations of operations that are performed by one or more computers, unless indicated otherwise. As such, it will be understood that such acts and operations, which are at times referred to as being computer-executed, include the manipulation by the processing unit of the computer of electrical signals representing data in a structured form. This manipulation transforms the data or maintains it at locations in the memory system of the computer, which reconfigures or otherwise alters the operation of the computer in a manner well understood by those skilled in the art. The data structures where data is maintained are physical locations of the memory that have particular properties defined by the format of the data. However, while the invention is being described in the foregoing context, it is not meant to be limiting as those of skill in the art will appreciate that various of the acts and operations described hereinafter may also be implemented in hardware.","Referring to , the present invention is directed to a set of application programming interface (API) functions for a client computer  on a network  (e.g., the Internet) to build and transport directory service requests in the Directory Service Markup Language (DSML) format and to process directory service responses. Specifically, in a preferred embodiment as shown in , the client  is connected to a DSML server , which is in turn connected to a directory service . In this context, the DSML server  may be considered as a \u201cgateway\u201d for network clients to access the directory service  using DSML requests. An application program  on the client machine may want to access the directory service . For example, the application program may want to find the phone number of \u201cJohn Smith\u201d in a corporate directory via the Internet. As another example, the client device may be a small device such as a cellphone, and a user may use it to access the DSML server. To access the directory service , the client  forms a DSML request , and constructs a packet  according to a pre-selected transport protocol with the DSML request as its payload, and transports the request packet to the DSML server  under the selected transport\/connection protocol. The transport\/connection protocol may be, for example, the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP).","When the DSML server  receives the SOAP packet  that contains the DSML request , it converts the DSML request to a request according to the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), which is implemented by the directory service . The DSML server  then forwards the LDAP request  to the directory service . In response, the directory service  returns a response  in the LDAP format to the DSML server . When the DSML server  receives the LDAP response , it converts the response to a response n the DSML format, puts the DSML response  as the payload of a SOAP packet , and forwards the SOAP packet with the DSML response to the requesting client.","In accordance with a feature of the invention, the operating system of the client machine implements a set of application programming interface (API) functions that the application program  may call to build DSML requests and process DSML responses, and to handle the transport of the DSML requests and receipt of the DSML responses under the pre-selected protocol, such as SOAP over HTTP, SMTP, DIME, etc. This set of API functions is hereinafter referred to as the DSML API . The DSML API frees developers of client application programs from the task of programming functions for handling the DSML and transport operations, thereby facilitating the use of the DSML-based directory service access as described above by client applications.","By way of example, several scenarios are provided below to illustrate how the DSML API  may be used to enable DSML-based directory service access. It will be appreciated, of course, that the use of the DSML API is not limited to these scenarios. In a first scenario, a smart cell phone or PDA device needs to access directory information but does not contain an LDAP client. By including the DSML API on the device, application programs can be written to employ the API functions to form and send DSML requests for accessing the directory service through the DSML server. In a second scenario, a program on a personal computer needs to access a directory service through a firewall, but the firewall is not allowed to pass LDAP protocol traffic because it is not capable of auditing such traffic. By using the DSML API, applications on the personal computer can send SOAP packets with a DSML request payload, which can then pass through the firewall. In a third scenario, a programmer is writing an application using XML programming tools and techniques, and the application needs to access a directory. The DSML API is designed to allow a seamless integration with other XML programming. For instance, in DSML API object mode, the programmer is able to convert the DSML request to an XML document easily, allowing the programmer to manipulate it further using XML programming or tools.","Referring now to , in accordance with a feature of an embodiment of the invention, the DSML API separates the aspect of building\/processing DSML documents from the aspect of dealing with the transport of the DSML documents, and makes them independent from each other. Specifically, the DSML API  has a set of classes that implements the DSML payload\/message, and another set of classes for handling the transport. The transport may be, for example, SOAP over HTTP or DIME (\u201cDirect Internet Message Encapsulation\u201d), File, SMTP (\u201cSimple Mail Transfer Protocol\u201d), etc. The option \u201cFile\u201d here means that the application reads or writes the DSML payload from or to a file, such as in the case of import and export. The separation of the DSML document processing from the transport operations allows future transport protocols to be implemented without the need for any modification of the classes for handling the DSML payload.","As illustrated in , the DSML API  has several top-level classes. As mentioned above, the DSML Connection class  deals with forming connections to the DSML server and handles remote and focal transport protocols. In other words, the DSML Connection class provides a way to transport DSML documents. The DSML Document class , on the other hand, concerns only accessing or building a DSML payload, and is independent of the connection aspect.","There are two classes, DSML Request Document and DSML Response Document, that inherit from the top-level DSML Document class. The DSML Request Document class  defines functions for building a DSML request payload, such as AddRequest, SearchRequest, etc. On the other hand, the DSML Response Document class  contains the corresponding response elements, such as AddResponse, ModifyResponse, SearchResponse, etc.","Referring now to , each item in the DSML Document class is called the \u201cDSML Element.\u201d Corresponding to the DSML requests and responses, there are two types of DSML Elements: DSML Request Element  and DSML Response Element . Both DSML Request Element and DSML Response Element further define more specialized classes. The DSML Elements for DSML documents are illustrated in  and will be described in greater below. Having the specialized classes allows a user to provide strongly typed classes for each operation, and to define specific constructors, properties, and methods, etc.  also shows a DSML Attribute class , and a DSML Control class , which are normally embedded into DSML Element derived classes.","Returning to , the DSML Connection class  is a base class for different DSML bindings. In one embodiment, the DSML API supports SOAP over HTTP, and has corresponding DsmlSoapConnection class  and a DsmlSoapHttpConnection classes . In alternative embodiments, the API may support other bindings, such as SOAP over DIME, File binding, etc., with corresponding classes ,  in the hierarchy. When a new protocol is implemented, this arranges allows the connection class to be extended without disturbing the existing DSML API system.","By way of example, the class definitions in one implementation for some of the classes in , and some examples of how they may be used, are provided below.","The DSML Connection class and its subclasses are described first.","DsmlConnection",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["Overview:","DsmlConnection is an abstract class, which cannot be instantiated.
