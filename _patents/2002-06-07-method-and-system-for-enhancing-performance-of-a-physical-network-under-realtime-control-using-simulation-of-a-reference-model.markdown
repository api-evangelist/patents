title: Method and system for enhancing performance of a physical network under real-time control using simulation of a reference model
abstract: A system and method for network simulation and enhancement includes an experiment configuration engine that provides various proposed traffic and/or network models, and a simulator responsive to the proposed traffic and/or network models to execute a plurality of simulations for the network using parallel discrete event simulation, to determine an optimal network configuration based upon an objective function for enhancing an aspect of network performance. The traffic and/or network models may be based on monitored data from the network indicating a current network state and current network traffic. Reconfiguration instructions for the new network configuration may be conveyed from the simulator to the network, so as to effectuate ongoing, real-time enhancement of the network. The network model(s) may cover internal operational details of individual network devices (e.g., routers and/or switches) as well as operation of the network as a whole.

Field of the Invention","The field of the present invention generally relates to network management and, more particularly, to systems and methods for monitoring, simulating, and enhancing network performance.","2. Background","Networks and networked applications are difficult to operate at peak efficiency for a variety of reasons. First, the heterogeneous nature of most modern networks often requires that dissimilar or diverse network components interact with one another, leading to potential inefficiencies in overall operation of the network, even if the operation of a sub-network portion or individual network elements have been optimized. Heterogeneity can exist in one or more network or application characteristics including bandwidth, latency, media, and traffic types.","A second reason for inefficiencies in network operations is that the total traffic volume and\/or the mix of different traffic types (e.g., data, image, streaming video) may vary in an unpredictable manner. Identifying a static network configuration that will offer efficient performance in the face of dynamically changing traffic and network conditions can be particularly challenging.","A third factor contributing to operational inefficiencies is the tendency of networks to grow over time. As networks or networked applications grow in scale, a network configuration that may have been optimal or sufficient when the network or application was smaller may no longer be so when the network or application becomes larger in size.","A fourth reason for performance inefficiencies in networks is the need for shared access to network resources. For example, a user communicating with a wireless transmission device may need to share the spectrum with other wireless users. Similarly, a user transmitting large files over a company's intranet may need to share the available bandwidth with users engaged in other activities\u2014for example, a second user engaged in a video teleconference, and a third user sending e-mail. Where a network or application is required to share resources with other users or systems, the available network resources may vary both dynamically and unpredictably. Consequently, a network configuration that is optimal or sufficient when shared resources are not being used by others, or are only lightly used by others, may not be optimal or sufficient when outside users or systems place greater demand upon the shared resources.","To improve the performance and efficiency of networks and\/or networked applications, simulation tools have been developed, whereby traffic flow can be modeled and various network configurations explored. Most, if not all, conventional simulation tools, however, rely upon off-line analysis of the network and its traffic load, and\/or are quite limited in accuracy, speed or capability.","A conceptual illustration of typical off-line simulation and analysis as conventionally practiced in a simulation process  is shown in . Generally in off-line analysis, a network model  is constructed to simulate operation of the network. Information about traffic carried over the network is gathered to determine, for example, appropriate link sizes and optimal routes that will provide a predetermined level of service for a forecasted traffic load. The traffic load may be forecasted using traffic models  that perform statistical analysis of the collected traffic data. The forecasted traffic load is input to a simulation software program  that models the network and forecasted traffic. The network model  and traffic model  are used in conjunction to evaluate alternative system configurations. Typically, the outputs from simulations with various proposed network configurations and\/or forecasted traffic patterns are reviewed manually, and then adjustments to the proposed network configuration and\/or forecasted traffic patterns can be made in an attempt to arrive at a suitable network configuration for the expected traffic load. When a suitable network configuration is found, based upon manual review of the simulation results, the new configuration then may, if desired, be deployed (indicated in  by block ).","While off-line simulation and analysis provides some measure of prediction for network performance, it has a number of drawbacks. First, off-line simulation and analysis can be a resource intensive, time-consuming process. Conventional approaches for off-line simulation and analysis can easily take hours or even days to complete, particularly for large-scale or complex networks. Consequently, the results of the off-line simulation and analysis may be \u201cstale\u201d by the time the process is completed, and may not reflect the actual status of the network or its traffic load at the time that the computations are completed.","In order to increase the speed of off-line network simulations, the network model may be simplified by the incorporation of abstractions or other simplifications, thus reducing the scope of the simulation and, consequently, the computational burden. However, the use of abstractions and simulations in the network model can adversely affect the reliability and accuracy of the simulation results. For maximum reliability and accuracy, networks should preferably be simulated without abstracting system properties that may affect overall system performance. These concerns are particularly prevalent when the simulation objectives include the investigation of scalability and\/or stability of the target network. An overly simplified network model can lead to inaccurate predictions or estimations of network attributes that the analyst is trying to estimate. The problem of obtaining accurate and reliable network simulation results is expected to increase with conventional simulation and analysis techniques as existing networks are integrated into larger communication systems, resulting in large-scale, integrated networks having numerous co-existing heterogeneous nodes with potentially diverse sets of protocols and services operated within the integrated network. Performance of a network may be impacted in a variety of ways by its integration into a larger system, which may lead to catastrophic problems that cannot be predicted by analyzing the individual (sub) networks by themselves.","One example of a method that attempts to enhance the performance of network operation is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,069,894, in the name of Holendar et al. According to the technique described in that patent, a number of logical networks are established on top of a physical network, the logical links of the logical networks sharing the same physical transmission and switching resources. Using an analytical model of the network, an \u201cobjective function\u201d is optimized with respect to at least one set of decision variables (generally either the logical link capacities and\/or the load sharing variables), given the physical network parameters and the requirements of each logical network.","Techniques which rely upon an analytical model for simulation may not capture the full operation of the system, and may therefore lead to sub-optimal results. Analytical models may also lack the ability to simulate detailed behavior of certain individual components, such as routers and switches, that are commonly used in many actual networks. Moreover, it is largely understood that the use of analytical models impose upon the simulation a number of limitations or assumptions necessary for analytical tractability (for example, a reduced load, link independence, etc.).","Another example of a method addressed to enhancing network performance is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,209,033, in the name of Datta et al. In that patent, a system is described for evaluating and planning network capacity based upon measured traffic across the links of the network. Once a link's traffic volume has been measured, it is compared with the link's traffic capability, and the resulting parameters compared with the traffic and capability of other links of the network to create metrics of the network capacity and balance. Then, simulated changes to the network configuration may be made by substituting simulated traffic volume amount and capabilities for selected link traffic measurements and capabilities, and the resulting measures of network capacity and balance are then compared to determine whether the simulated changes represent a preferred network configuration. While addressing certain limited aspects of network performance, the technique described in the patent focuses mainly on achieving overall balance in the network (where all link utilizations are approximately equal), and does not generally address itself to other network attributes that might, for example, rely upon detailed models of routers and\/or other network devices. Moreover, the system described in the patent uses sequential discrete event simulation, which may limit its capabilities or its potential applications to other network scenarios.","Wireless communication systems, in particular, may present difficult challenges for simulation, analysis and optimization. A primary source of these difficulties is the accurate computation of the impact of interference among simultaneously transmitted wireless signals. Much of the previous work has relied on the use of abstract models of dubious practical value because they are generally based on unrealistic assumptions of interference between simultaneously transmitted signals. However, the ability to model, simulate, or otherwise understand the effect of signal interference, and interference reduction techniques (such as power management in a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) communication network), can be quite important, particularly as networks grow and must deal with larger numbers of users.","There is thus a need for a system and\/or method for improving network efficiency and, in particular, such a system and\/or method that may be applied to wired, wireless, and\/or mixed networks with large numbers of network nodes. There is likewise a need for a system and\/or method for improving network efficiency which is well suited for the expected large volume of growth in communication services, and which is well suited for providing differentiated services that can allow the network to, for example, provide continuous unaffected service for premium customers, even as the overall offered traffic load increases substantially.","The invention is directed in one aspect to systems and methods for simulating and enhancing network operation.","According to one embodiment as disclosed herein, a system and method for network simulation and enhancement includes an experiment configuration engine that provides various proposed traffic and\/or network models.

Examples of possible objective functions for an operational network  of certain characteristics include, e.g., throughput of a class of service, and\/or end-to-end latency.

Such parameters may include, for example, algorithms by which various proposed network configurations and\/or network traffic distributions are derived. Various simulation settings (e.g., number and relative locations of nodes in the network, movement pattern(s) of the nodes, battery power and usage of the nodes, buffer space availability of the nodes, channel bandwidth, signal propagation characteristics (if applicable), frequency utilization, etc.) may also be defined at this point. Next, in step , an objective function is defined. The objective function may be entered or defined by a system programmer or operator via a user interface (e.g., entered in a computer workstation). The nature of the objective function will generally depend upon the nature of the network being simulated. The objective function may be defined, for example, to maximize throughput between certain points, or to maximize throughput of certain types of traffic, to attain a certain level of throughput within given constraints (e.g., interference or errors), or achieve other such quantifiable goals.","Once the objective function has been defined, the simulation is initiated, starting with the generation of a first proposed network model and network traffic distribution, as indicated by step . The proposed network model and network traffic distribution are preferably generated according to the simulation parameters discussed immediately above. Then, in step , a simulation is performed on the proposed network model using the proposed network traffic distribution. Preferably, as previously mentioned, a parallel discrete event simulation technique is employed. In a next step , the results of the simulation are evaluated against the objective function defined in step . If the objective function is satisfied, as indicated in step , then the proposed network configuration may be selected, as indicated by step . If, on the other hand, the objective function is not satisfied, then the evaluator or analyzer may determine, if appropriate, whether convergence is still feasible (as evaluated at step ), given the remaining network configurations, proposed traffic distributions, or available time for analysis. Also, certain simulation scenarios may intelligently be culled during the evaluation process. If, for example, a trend has emerged that would logically get only worse as traffic is increased over certain links, then those simulation scenarios may be dropped, and only other simulation scenarios continue to be tested.","If convergence is not feasible, then various options are possible. The \u201cbest\u201d proposed network model (in terms of satisfying the objective function) may be returned (step ), or else a failure indication may be returned, or both. On the other hand, if convergence is still feasible, then the actual network state and\/or network traffic load may optionally be measured, as indicated in step , and the process then return to step , wherein the next proposed network configuration and\/or network traffic distribution may be selected and simulation performed. The simulation loop may continue on various different proposed network configurations and\/or network traffic patterns until the objective function is met or the possibilities have been exhausted, at which point the process completes (step ).","Rather than accepting the first network configuration that satisfies the objective function, the process  in  may be modified so that it runs through some or all of the remaining proposed network configurations and\/or network traffic distributions, and the \u201cbest\u201d network configuration may then be selected based upon the greatest compliance with the objective function, if the level of compliance is amenable to quantification or other objective evaluation.","Returning now to , in accordance with one embodiment, the simulator  is built on top of a simulation environment such as PARSEC (Parallel Simulation Environment for Complex Systems), a process-oriented simulation environment which allows simulation programs to run on multi-processor computers, such as an Origin\u2122-type computer system commercially available from Silicon Graphics, Inc., or an Enterprise\u00ae-type computer system available from Sun Microsystems, Inc. Software source code for PARSEC is included herewith on the two compact discs in the computer program listing appendix. PARSEC object code is also available from the PARSEC User Manual For PARSEC Release 1.1, September 1999, published by UCLA Parallel Computing Laboratory.","Preferably, the simulator  utilizes a \u201clayered\u201d approach based on a reference model having a multi-layer architecture, such as the multi-layer architecture defined by the Open System Interface (OSI) reference model developed by the International Standards Organization (ISO). The OSI reference model, for example, includes seven layers, which are (from lowest to highest): (i) a physical layer, which is responsible for the physical transport of individual bits between two entities over a transmission medium; (ii) a data link layer, which is responsible for moving packets of data frame-by-frame from one node to another, and for performing error detection and correction; (iii) a network layer, which is responsible for routing information (typically in the form of data packets) within a network; (iv) a transport layer, which is responsible for segmenting long messages into packets and for reconstructing messages from received packets; (v) a session layer, which is responsible for controlling sessions between different entities (for example, by managing dialog control, tokens and synchronization); (vi) a presentation layer, which is responsible for managing data syntax, semantics and application-specific services to the user (examples are TCP and HTTP). Specific protocols may be defined for peer-to-peer communication at the transport layer, session layer, presentation layer and application layer, and these protocols are sometimes referred to as the transport protocol, session protocol, presentation protocol and application protocol, respectively.","Where the simulator  utilizes a layered approach based upon a multi-layer architecture (such as the OSI reference model multi-layer architecture), application programming interfaces (APIs), i.e., standardized software specifications which provide interfaces between an OSI-based application and a non-OSI network, between layers of the model are preferably defined as close to the operational protocol stack as possible, thus facilitating rapid prototyping of new protocols and integration of operational protocols.","In the PARSEC simulation environment, each process in the physical network  can be modeled as a logical process, and interaction among logical processes are generally modeled by time-stamped message exchanges. In one exemplary embodiment as described herein, where the simulator  is based upon the OSI reference model multi-layer architecture, the entire protocol stack is modeled as a logical process, and a series of function calls are used for consecutive events with no delay. Alternatively, each layer of the protocol stack may be modeled as a logical process in PARSEC, and the APIs between layers may be defined by the PARSEC Messages, but this approach can substantially increase the number of events to be processed (because a single event involving multiple layers would generally need to be broken down into multiple events) and therefore slow down the simulation. By modeling the whole protocol stack as a logical process, and using a series of function calls for consecutive events with no delay, the simulator  can significantly reduce the number of scheduled events and simplify the communication topology.","It may be advantageous in certain simulation models to restrict the network nodes to communicating with other nodes only through the lowest layer, and to prevent models at layers other than the lowest from directly accessing the data for other network nodes. These restrictions can make the underlying parallel simulation kernel almost transparent at the user level. As described hereinafter with respect to a particular example, each logical process may be required to give its topological information and a lookahead property to the PARSEC parallel conservative runtime code. If a model at an upper layer could communicate directly with other nodes, the topological and lookahead specification for the parallel execution may need to be specified by the modeler (which may substantially increase the programming overhead for protocol modelers). By limiting the communication among network nodes to the lowest layer, the topological and lookahead specifications only need to be placed at the lowest layer, which does not need to be modified or even observed by most modelers.","The simulator  can generally be configured to utilize any of a variety of propagation (i.e., path loss) models, radio models, and other protocol models.

However, the principles of the invention are not limited to any specific set of simulation models.","The IEEE 802.11 standard is well known in the field of wireless communications, and a general description of the standard may presently be found, for example, in \u201cIEEE 802.11 Tutorial\u201d by Jim Zyren and Al Petrick, which publication is hereby incorporated by reference as if set forth fully herein. Besides the parameters defined in the IEEE 802.11 standard, the radio PHY model may further be based upon WaveLAN-II, an actual implementation of the IEEE 802.11 DSSS protocol, as described, for example, in A. Kamerman and L. Monteban, \u201cWaveLAN-II: A High-Performance Wireless LAN for the Unlicensed Band,\u201d Bell Labs Technical Journal, Vol. 2, No. 3, pp. 118-133 (1997), hereby incorporated by reference as if set forth fully herein. Path loss models for signal propagation may be generated in any of a variety of manners. For example, a two-ray path loss model may be formulated assuming, e.g., free space propagation for near sight, and a path loss exponent of, e.g., four for far sight, to account for the effect of ground reflection other than the line of sight between the transmitter and receiver. The cross-over point of near and far sights for such a model may depend upon various factors such as the radio frequency and the antenna heights of transmitter and receiver. Of course, other path loss models may be used.","Modeling of interference of the wireless transmission medium can be accomplished in the simulator  using any of a variety of techniques. Typically for wireless communication systems, one of the more important phenomena to model is interference between simultaneous transmissions on the same channel. Due to its broadcast nature a transmitted signal can increase the noise level at all radios receiving on the same frequency in the vicinity, which can increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Thus, for each signal transmitted by a radio, we must compute the path loss, i.e. the power at which the signal is received, at each of the other nodes in the network. Even weak signals that cannot be effectively received by a radio can nevertheless be accumulated into a high noise level. Simulations that ignore the effects of these simultaneous transmissions will, in general, be unreliable; however, the consideration of such effects can easily increase the number of events at the physical layer by several orders of magnitude.","To illustrate the impact of interference computation on the simulation complexity, it is useful to consider the situation of a radio signal transmitted by one network node to another network node in a wireless network composed of N nodes. Such a transmission creates two events (i.e., a beginning-of-transmission signal and an end-of-transmission signal) at the intended destination receiver, if interference is not considered, while the number of events grows to 2(N\u22121) if interference is taken into account, since every node other than the transmitter would then also require two events to calculate its noise level during the signal transmission. Since a large proportion (e.g., 95%) of the total events might be scheduled at the lowest layer in a high-fidelity network model, including interference effects in wireless network simulation will typically be computationally expensive. As the size (in terms of nodes) of the network under consideration grows, the proportion of scheduled events at the lowest layer will grow at an even faster rate. As a result, the radio and propagation models can play a significant role in determining the performance and the efficiency of an entire wireless network J  simulation. One way to reduce the number of events resulting from interference consideration while maintaining reasonable accuracy of noise level computation, is to restrict the number of other nodes at which the path loss computation must be performed. Although each signal can theoretically increase the noise level of every node in the model, an assumption may be made within the simulator  that a signal's effect will be minor or insignificant for nodes located far from the transmission source of the signal.","In accordance with one or more embodiments, the simulator  reduces the number of path loss calculations by using multiple partitions, each of which represents, e.g., a non-overlapping geographical area of the terrain. A single logical process may represent each partition and may be responsible for simulating all the layers of all the network nodes located in the corresponding geographical area. Each partition preferably calculates the path loss for all the network nodes within the partition area in the same way as without multiple partitions. However, a partition preferably does not directly calculate path loss for nodes located in other partitions; rather, it computes a path loss value for the reference point of every other partition. The reference points of a partition for other partitions are preferably chosen so that they give the minimum path loss value between two partitions. A network model may be decomposed into partitions geographically, as in the example provided below, or may be partitioned according to some other strategy.","To illustrate this concept with an example, two partitions A and B may be defined, as shown in . A reference point  is selected for Partition B, as also shown in . When a network node  in Partition A transmits a signal, if the radio power at the chosen reference point  in Partition B is inside the propagation range (e.g., propagation range ), Partition B may contain network nodes that may be affected by the signal ; thus, in this case, Partition A delivers a message to Partition B. Partition B then calculates path loss for all the nodes in its area and schedules events appropriately. In this situation, the overall number of path loss calculations for the signal  has the same computational cost as compared to the case without partitioning. However, if the chosen reference point  is outside the propagation range (e.g., propagation range ), Partition B is deemed not have any network node that can be affected by the signal ; thus, Partition A would not need to send a message to Partition B based upon the transmission of signal . In such a case, the overall number of path loss calculations for the signal  becomes half that as compared to the case without partitioning, assuming that each of Partition A and B has an equal number of network nodes. Thus, partitioning generally need not be any more expensive in terms of computational cost for path loss calculations, and will frequently reduce the number of path loss calculations depending upon how many partitions exist and how far the transmitted signal effectively propagates.","Although only two Partitions (A and B) are illustrated in , the above example can be extrapolated for simulations in which there are more partitions.","Preferably, when executed using parallel discrete-event simulation, the simulation model utilized by the simulator  is comprised of a number of partitions equal to or greater than the number of processors in the parallel computer on which the model is to be executed. The simulator  further preferably utilizes a synchronization protocol to ensure that no causality errors are introduced in the simulation result. The synchronization protocol may be either conservative (synchronous or asynchronous) or optimistic in nature. The PARSEC simulation environment provides both synchronous and asynchronous runtime libraries, and the simulator  may employ either a synchronous or asynchronous protocol, and either a conservative or optimistic synchronization protocol.","One example of a simulator  as may be used in connection with various embodiments as described herein uses a conservative protocol that is synchronous in nature. According to this embodiment, the synchronization protocol determines a global minimum event time before which none of the logical processes will send any messages to other logical processes. Preferably, the computation of this global minimum event time is based upon corresponding local minimum event times determined individually for each logical process.","In more detail, the synchronous protocol uses barriers to calculate for each logical process a minimum event time before which the logical process will not send any messages to other logical processes. Preferably, the local minimum event time is calculated as the sum of a time period associated with the earliest timestamp for any incoming messages received by the particular logical process LP, and a \u201clookahead\u201d time period during which the logical process will not send any messages to other logical processes. The global minimum time may, if desired, be limited to a maximum ceiling value, which may be uniform for all logical processes, have different static values for different logical processes, and\/or be adjustable dynamically either collectively or individually for different logical processes. The global minimum time, before which none of the logical processes will send any messages to other logical processes, may be calculated by the synchronization protocol based upon the minimum of all the local minimum event times calculated for each logical process. The simulator  then processes only events with timestamps earlier than the global minimum event time calculated by the synchronization protocol.","Operation of the above-described synchronization protocol may be explained in further detail with reference to the process flow  shown in . The synchronization protocol illustrated in  preferably uses barriers to compute the global minimum event time TW, which represents a lower bound on the timestamp of any future messages sent by any logical process. To calculate the global minimum event time TW, as indicated by step , the synchronization protocol first calculates, for each logical process LP, a minimum event time EOTduring which the logical process LP, will not send any messages to other logical processes. Preferably, the minimum event time EOTis calculated as the sum of a time period associated with the earliest timestamp for any messages or events for the logical process, and a \u201clookahead\u201d time period during which the logical process will not send any messages to other logical processes. Accordingly, in sub-step , the earliest event for each logical process LP; is determined, according to the timestamps associated with the various events, and in sub-step , a lookahead value (which is potentially individualized to each logical process LPor groups thereof) is added to the earliest timestamp value for each logical process LP.","In a parallel discrete event simulation, the lookahead for a particular logical process LPat a given simulation time T is defined as the duration for which it will not send any messages to its outgoing links. The lookahead property can significantly affect the performance of a parallel discrete event simulation. The minimum event time for a logical process LPmay also, if desired, be limited to a ceiling value (EOT-ceiling), as indicated in step , which ceiling can be uniform for all logical processes LPi, selected individually for each logical process LP, and\/or dynamically adjusted.","The global minimum event time TW is then calculated as the minimum of EOT(i=1, . . . , N) for all of the logical processes LP; in the simulation, as indicated by step .","After the global minimum event time TW is calculated for a particular simulation cycle , as indicated now by step(s) ,  and , each logical process LPprocesses messages or events with timestamps earlier than the global minimum event time TW without further synchronization, because it is guaranteed that no messages with timestamps earlier than TW will be sent out. When processing of all messages or events in the time window is completed, all of the logical processes stop at the barrier to calculate a new global minimum event time TW, and then the process repeats with the next simulation iteration . As this particular synchronous simulation protocol does not necessarily require the topological information of logical processes, its performance is generally not affected by the specific connectivity of logical processes. However, the parallel simulation may perform poorly if even one logical process has a short lookahead value, because this situation would result in a small advance of the global minimum event time TW and thus relatively few events will be processed in the corresponding global synchronization cycle.","In accordance with a preferred embodiment, each logical process LP; (i.e., partition of network nodes), running in parallel, is augmented with a \u201clookahead calculator\u201d whose task it is to produce the relative lookahead value (L) and the local minimum event time EOT. The lookahead calculator may take advantage of certain protocol-specific characteristics or assumptions in order derive various lookahead values. For example, in the context of an IEEE 802.11 compliant network, the lookahead calculator may utilize certain characteristics or assumptions as described in \u201cRuntime Performance Optimizations for Detailed Wireless Network Simulation\u201d (UCLA Computer Science Department technical paper), by J. Martin, M. Takai, and R. Bagrodia, to assist in calculation of an appropriate lookahead value. The foregoing technical paper is hereby incorporated by reference as if set forth fully herein. To facilitate the calculation of lookahead in this context, the lookahead calculation can be divided into two parts: (1) a relative lookahead calculation that determines the earliest timestamp of outgoing events in response to incoming events, and (2) an optional EOT-ceiling calculation that establishes a lower bound on timestamps of potential events that may be generated by the logical process. The EOT for a logical process (LP) is computed as the minimum between the calculated relative lookahead and the EOT-ceiling. An example of a potential event is a signal reception that is subsequently discovered to have a signal-to-noise ratio that is too high for successful reception. Specific examples of sources to assist in the calculation of an appropriate lookahead value in the context of an IEEE 802.11 compliant network may include the following:","Radio Transmitter Turnaround Delay: The 802.11 protocol specifies a minimum delay of 5 microseconds that is incurred by the radio in switching from receiving to transmitting mode or vice versa. Thus, even if a radio has a packet to transmit, it must incur at least this delay before the transmitted signal gets to the air.","Pre-sample Signal Receptions: If a radio is receiving a frame, there is a minimum delay before which it can respond. This delay includes the time to receive the frame itself plus the Short Inter Frame Space (\u201cSIFS\u201d) delay, which defines a minimum time before which the node can respond to incoming packets. The SIFS delay is generally incurred for immediate response packets, such as acknowledgements. Assuming a 2 Mb\/second bandwidth, the smallest data frame transmission time is 248 microseconds (the synchronization preamble time plus the shortest data duration) and the SIFS constant is defined as 10 milliseconds. Thus, as soon as an incoming frame is sensed by a node, the lookahead calculator can compute an EOT-ceiling as the sum of the data frame transmission time plus the SIFS delay. A further expansion of the lookahead is possible if the intended recipient of the frame is known and it is determined that the node receiving the signal is not required to respond (recall that because of the wireless medium, all nodes in the vicinity of a transmitter will sense the transmission). Of course, if the reception event is subsequently cancelled due to interference, the expanded EOT-ceiling is also canceled, and the node reverts to its previously computed lookahead value.","Further optimizations or enhancements to parallel discrete event simulation in the context of an IEEE 802.11 compliant network are described in the technical paper \u201cRuntime Performance Optimizations for Detailed Wireless Network Simulation\u201d referenced above. Such optimizations or enhancements may include, for example, one or more of (1) adding the MAC backoff delay (if non-zero) to the time window ceiling; (2) expanding the lookahead calculation to account for the upper layer activities; (3) modifying the main event scheduling loop to notify the lookahead calculator of all higher layer timeout events (such as periodic CBR traffic packets created up at the application layer) so as to avoid having to specify lookahead in the upper layer models (the timestamps of these events may be kept in a separate upper layer event heap, with the top element of the heap being the earliest such upper layer event for the particular partition); (4) using an additional queue in the simulator  to store the relative lookaheads of the nodes in a particular partition; and (5) augmenting the radio model to give a prediction of when the radio will transition to the idle state.","An example in which the foregoing parallel discrete event simulation system for the 802.11 protocol can be utilized in connection with an optimization function for optimizing an aspect of network performance is illustrated by a process flow  shown in . As shown therein, in a first step , the network operator configures the simulator with an environment that mirrors the actual 802.11 compliant network to be simulated. The simulation settings may include, by way of example, the number of nodes in the network, movement pattern(s) of the nodes, battery power and usage of the nodes, buffer space availability of the nodes, channel bandwidth, signal propagation characteristics, frequency utilization, and any other network attributes deemed relevant to the simulation. Once the simulation environment is configured, as indicated by step , the simulation is run to determine whether and how the network should be optimized. In the particular example shown in , the simulation determines whether or not to change an RTS\/CTS threshold, which is defined in the 802.11 protocol as the threshold level at which RTS\/CTS control frames will be used prior to the transmission of data frames if the data frame size exceeds this threshold. Thus, in the example of , step  entails running the simulation (using, for example, the parallel discrete event simulation techniques previously described) in order to determine the optimal RTS\/CTS threshold.","In running the simulation, the simulator  waits for network input , such as incoming network packets that are to be transmitted to neighboring nodes. The network input  may take the form of proposed network traffic distribution, and may be based, for example, on the actual network traffic load and\/or a predicted network traffic load. Upon receiving the network input  (e.g., the incoming network packets), the simulator  processes two different scenarios: one with the use of RTS\/CTS to transmit the network packets, and the other without the use of RTS\/CTS to transmit the network packets. A simulation analyzer  then compares the throughput results, or other metrics, from both scenarios, and determines whether superior results would be achieved using the RTS\/CTS method or not using the method to transmit the network packets. If the decision of the simulation analyzer  is different than that of the current settings in the network nodes, as indicated by decision step  in the process flow , then the network nodes are re-configured to use the new RTS\/CTS threshold, as indicated by step , and the network simulation settings are simultaneously updated. If on the other hand, the decision of the simulation analyzer  is that the current settings of the network nodes are preferred, then the network nodes are left with their existing settings, as indicated by step .","In the foregoing example, the selection of the RTS\/CTS threshold setting may be viewed as an optimization function for operation of the 802.11 compliant network being simulated. The simulation of the network provides predictive information from which the preferred settings for the network nodes may be determined. The network is thereby enhanced, effectively in real time, to operate at increased efficiency based upon results of the simulation. Use of the particular parallel discrete event simulation techniques described previously herein can provide the capability of fast enough simulation so as to allow effectively real-time optimization or enhancement to occur.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["700","702","700","702","702","702","1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8"]},"Per step  of the process flow  in , the simulation environment is configured to have the same settings as the actual network portion illustrated in  (a larger portion or the entire network could of course also be simulated). Then, the simulation engine is provided with the network input , which in this example would constitute the CBR sessions and their traffic characteristics, and simulates the network, per step , using various RTS\/CTS thresholds to determine which threshold to use so as to maximize aggregate network throughput (which is the objective function in this case). In this particular example, the simulation engine varies the RTS\/CTS threshold to 0 bytes, 1000 bytes and 3000 bytes, although other values could also be chosen. Results of the simulation are shown graphically in , in terms of bits per second for each of the three selected threshold levels.","Given the simulation results output from the simulation engine, the analyzer (e.g., analyzer  shown in ) determines that the RTS\/CTS threshold for the simulated network portion (cell ) and, hence, the specified network input should be set to 3000 bytes since this threshold provides the best aggregate throughput. The simulation and evaluation system may then check the wireless network card to determine the RTS\/CTS threshold currently being utilized. If the RTS\/CTS threshold is different from 3000 bytes, the simulation and evaluation system sets the RTS\/CTS threshold to 3000 bytes in the wireless network card; otherwise, it remains at 3000 bytes.","It may be noted that the simulation engine and experiment analyzer (e.g., simulator  and analyzer ) can be executed at each node  or at a designated central node (which may, but need not be, geographically centralized with respect to the network boundaries). If they are executed at each node , the network input is broadcast from each node to all other nodes . Then, the simulation engine and analyzer are executed at each node . If the central node approach is used, the simulation engine and analyzer are executed only at the designated central node, but not at the other nodes . In such a situation, the network input is broadcast to the central node by each of the other nodes , and the simulation engine and analyzer are executed at the central node. Once the optimized RTS\/CTS threshold is determined by the analyzer, the results may be broadcast back to each node  to instruct it to adjust its RTS\/CTS threshold accordingly.","In the example shown in , a uniform or global RTS\/CTS threshold is determined. Alternatively, the simulation engine and analyzer (whether centrally located at a base station node, or else located at each node ) could determine the RTS\/CTS threshold individually for each node .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0084"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 6","FIG. 12","FIG. 12"],"b":["1200","1200","1213","1214","1200","1220","1220","1223","1225","1223","1213","1213","1250","1220","1250","1225","1214","1230","1250"]},"Once the network model and traffic are initially processed and provided to the various logical processes , the main simulation loop  of the simulation control process  runs through the simulation. Preferably, the main simulation loop  manages the operation of a parallel discrete event simulation over the partitioned network model. The main simulation loop  conducts a number of successive iterations of the simulation until a termination condition is met (typically a pre-defined time period). For each iteration, the simulation control process  uses the TW calculator  to a new global minimum event time TW. The TW calculator  obtains the local minimum event time EOTfrom the EOTcalculator  of each logical process  and, from all of the data so gathered, selects the lowest or earliest to arrive at the global minimum event time TW.","The EOTcalculator  in each logical process  preferably employs a lookahead calculator , the general nature of which has been previously described, in order to facilitate determination of the local minimum event time EOT. The EOTcalculator  preferably computes the local minimum event time EOTusing the list of events in an event queue  of the logical process  and its lookahead in order to determine the earliest future event, as previously described herein. After the global minimum event time TW has been determined, the main simulation loop  initiates parallel processing of the logical processes  to develop independently simulation results for each network partition. Each logical process , under control of a main logical partition control process , invokes an event processor  to process, in timestamp order, the events  in event queue  for the respective network partition  associated with the logical process , until all the events with timestamps less than the global minimum event time TW have been processed.","The run-time executive  manages the exchange of messages and\/or events between logical processes  between iterations of the simulation. A logical process interface  may be provided in the simulation control process  to interface with (e.g., send control instructions, receive status messages, etc.) with the individual logical processes . A results handler  collects the output results from the various logical processes  and organizes the results for later processing and evaluation downstream. After a simulation has been completed by the simulation control process , a new proposed network configuration  and\/or proposed network traffic distribution  may be presented to the simulation control process .","Another example in which the foregoing parallel discrete event simulation technique can be utilized in connection with an objective function for enhancing an aspect of network performance is shown in . The process  illustrated in  relates to a TCP\/IP network. \u201cTCP\u201d refers to Transmission Control Protocol and relates to a protocol for connection-oriented services, while \u201cIP\u201d refers to Internet Protocol and defines a layer for exchanging data packets between computers connected to the Internet. \u201cTCP\/IP\u201d refers to a well known combination of protocols involving both TCP and IP. In the example of , the objective function is to determine the optimal TCP send window size in order to optimize, by way of example, aggregate network throughput. Other possible objective functions might include, but are not limited to, fairness of TCP sessions, differentiated services (e.g., allocating more bandwidth for premium paying customers), and congestion control. As shown now in , in a first step , a network operator configures the simulator with an environment that mirrors the actual TCP\/IP network. The simulation settings may include, for example, the number of nodes in the network, the network topology (including node location and connectivity), network protocols being utilized, and the link bandwidth and delay. In addition, the simulation settings could also model wireless network attributes and, as such, may also include, for example, movement pattern(s) of the nodes, battery power and usage of the nodes, buffer space availability, channel bandwidth, signal propagation characteristics, frequency utilization, and other wireless network characteristics.","Once the simulation environment is configured, and as indicated by step , a parallel discrete event simulation is run to determine how the network should be optimized. In the particular example shown in , the simulation determines the optimal TCP send window size to use for transmitting TCP data. In running the simulation, the simulation engine (for example, simulation engine ) waits for network input , such as incoming network packets that are to be transmitted to one or more nodes. Upon receiving the network input , the simulation engine  processes various scenarios, by adjusting the TCP send window size, to determine the optimal TCP send window size to use to transmit TCP data. The analyzer  then compares the throughput results, or other metrics, from all scenarios, and determines the optimal TCP send window size. The simulation and evaluation system  then may reconfigure the network nodes to use the resultant optimal TCP send window size, as indicated by step .","While some of the foregoing examples have been explained with reference to particular network types (that is, a wireless network using the 802.11 protocol and a TCP\/IP network using TCP protocol), the principles thereof may be applied to many different types of network systems and environments.","One example of an application of the principles and concepts described herein relates to Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning. As the Internet has grown to service diverse customers with many different service requirements (in terms of bandwidth, speed, protocol, content, quality, etc.), a need has arisen to provide multiple levels of service to meet different customer requirements. The capability to provide service differentiation, via resource allocation, bandwidth provisioning, traffic engineering, and other techniques, is generally referred to in the industry as Quality of Service (QoS). The QoS provisioning ability of a network or network device can be substantially enhanced by using the principles developed herein and described previously. A specific example of tuning a QoS provisioning mechanism may be illustrated with respect to a congestion avoidance scheme known as Weighted Random Early Drop\/Detection (WRED). WRED is used at network devices, such as network routers, to probabilistically drop packets, where the drop probability generally depends on the relative priority of the packet and the level of current congestion in the network, According to one embodiment of a simulator in accordance with certain principles described herein, for each packet priority level, the simulation and evaluation system  (see ) defines a set of parameters, mintand maxtthat respectively refer to the minimum threshold queue length and maximum threshold queue length for the ipriority level. The probability with which a packet at a given priority level will be dropped at a router can be tuned dynamically based on the choice of the minimum and maximum threshold parameters for the corresponding priority level.","Applying this example to a specific network embodiment, consider a network that is servicing traffic at two priority levels, high and low. The simulator  receives network input corresponding to distributions of high and low priority packets. These traffic distributions may be derived, for example, from real-time measurements taken from the network using widely deployed network management tools. Upon receiving the network input, the simulator  determines the overall bandwidth, delay, or related metric(s) for the low and high priority data packets for multiple sets of threshold queue lengths. The analyzer  of the simulation and evaluation system  then may determine specific settings of the thresholds that optimize the objective function, and provide instructions or information for reconfiguring the network routers to use the corresponding thresholds that in turn control the allocation of buffers or queues among the two traffic classes.","Similar applications may be employed to alter the provisioning of bandwidth among audio, video, and\/or data traffic or to alter the per hop behavior (PHB) of a network for different classes of traffic.","Another example of an application to which the principles and concepts described herein may be applied is network routing. To prevent links from becoming congested, dynamic simulation may be employed to change routing protocol parameters, switch between different routing protocols, and\/or reduce routing control overhead. As an example, to reduce routing control overhead, the simulation and evaluation system  receives input from the operational network . In this example, the input may comprise, e.g., the frequency of link breaks in the network. Upon receiving the network input, the simulator  may simulate various options based upon different frequencies of generating routing update packets. The analyzer  then determines the optimal frequency for generating the routing update packets and reconfigures, or provides instructions for reconfiguring, the network nodes of the operational network  to use the optimal frequency.","Yet another exemplary environment to which the principles and concepts described herein may be applied is a wireless domain. Dynamic simulation may be employed, for example, to determine the transmission schedule of the wireless nodes within a cell in a cellular network. In such an example, the simulator  may operate at a base station while awaiting network input. The network input in this case might be, for example, the traffic characteristics of each node in a particular cell, including such things as average packet size, file transfer size, sending rate, burst rate, and\/or priority level of the packets or nodes themselves. Upon receiving the network input, the simulator  may determine the optimal scheduling of the nodes to satisfy the objective function(s). The analyzer  then determines the optimal schedule to deploy, and reconfigures the base station to disseminate the transmission schedule to all nodes operating in the cell.","Software code reflecting aspects of a particular embodiment, and illustrating a tangible application of various concepts and principles as described previously herein, is provided in the computer program listing appendix submitted herewith.","While preferred embodiments of the invention have been described herein, many variations are possible which remain within the concept and scope of the invention.
