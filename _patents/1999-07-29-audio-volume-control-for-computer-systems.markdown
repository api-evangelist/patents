title: Audio volume control for computer systems
abstract: A computer system includes an audio chip to generate audio signals at a target volume level to be emitted as audio output by speakers. Also included in the computer system may be a volume control routine to limit the overall volume level of the system. A maximum volume level may be set by a user through interacting with a software routine. The software routine may include password protection, requiring a user to enter a correct password in order to modify the maximum volume level. If the target volume level is above the maximum volume level, then the volume control routine may set the overall volume level of the system at the maximum volume level. Otherwise the volume control routine may set the overall volume level at the target volume level.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention relates generally to computer systems and more particularly to audio features of computer systems.","Audio features are swiftly becoming important in computer systems. Many computers have a compact disk (CD) player capable of playing musical CD's or computer video games. Also, recent innovations in video technology have resulted in the advent of digital video disks (DVD's) that may store large amounts of video data including full length motion pictures. DVD players are now being included in some computer systems. Additionally, computer video games are a popular use for computer systems. Each of these technologies utilize the audio features of computer systems. While the audio output of computer video games and CD's, etc. may be interesting and desirable to some computer users, others may not be quite as fond of the array of audio output generated by computers. In fact, computer system audio output may disturb others in the vicinity. For example, parents may be irritated by loud sounds generated by video games being played by their children on a computer.","Prior art audio systems include physical locks on speakers in an attempt to alleviate the previously mentioned problems. In these prior art systems, a key may be inserted into a lock on a speaker to change the volume level of the speaker. Unfortunately, the prior art audio systems require a physical lock having both mechanical and electronic parts to be included in a speaker. Additionally, the locking mechanism sets the volume at a certain level and does not allow the level to be raised or lowered without using a physical key. Thus, it would be beneficial to provide an alternative technique to limit the audio volume of computer systems.","In one embodiment, the invention provides a method to limit an audio volume level of a computer system. The method includes obtaining a maximum volume level and receiving a signal having a target volume level. If the target volume is greater than the maximum volume level, then the audio volume level is set at the maximum volume level. Otherwise, the audio volume level is set at the target volume level. In another embodiment, a program storage device includes instructions to obtain a maximum volume level and receive a signal indicating a target volume level. The instructions may also cause a programmable device controller to set an audio volume level at the maximum volume level if the target volume level exceeds the maximum volume level. Otherwise, the instructions may cause the programmable control device to set the audio volume level at the target volume level. In yet another embodiment, the invention provides a computer system including a processor, an audio source adapted to generate audio signals, and a program storage device. A routine is stored on the program storage device that includes instructions embodying a method to limit an audio volume level of the computer system.","Referring to , an illustrative computer system  may include a processor  that may be any programmable control device such as a general or special purpose microprocessor, including multiple microprocessors. The processor  may be coupled to a host bridge circuit  by a processor bus . The host bridge circuit  may enable the processor  to communicate with system memory , which may be any type of random access memory (RAM). The processor  may also be coupled to a primary bus  through the host bridge circuit . An illustrative host bridge circuit  is the 82443BX Host-to-PCI bridge device from Intel Corporation. An illustrative primary bus  conforms to the Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) specification and serves as a communication link between various components of the system  and the processor . Also connected to the primary bus , may be an audio chip  to generate and control audio output from the system  and a sound card  to provide audio signal buffering and amplification. An illustrative audio chip is the CT5880 digital controller by Creative Technology, Ltd.","The system  may also include a secondary bus , such as an Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus, coupled to the primary bus  through a extended bridge circuit . An illustrative secondary bus may conform to specifications such as Industry Standard Architecture (ISA), Extended Industry Standard Architecture (EISA), and Low Pin Count (LPC). An illustrative extended bridge circuit  is the 82371AB PIIX4 IDE controller from Intel Corporation. The secondary bus  may facilitate communication between various input\/output (I\/O) devices, such as parallel and serial ports, and other aspects of the system . Speakers  may be connected to the system  through an audio line to emit sounds based on audio signals generated by the audio chip  and amplified by the sound card . Alternatively, the audio chip  may drive the speakers  directly. An interrupt controller , such as the 820931 Input\/Output Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (IOAPIC) by Intel Corporation, may accept interrupt requests from various devices, such as the audio chip , through interrupt request lines of the primary and secondary buses  and . The interrupt controller may deliver interrupt requests to the processor  through an Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (APIC) bus . In some embodiments, the audio chip  may generate an interrupt request to invoke a volume control routine .","The volume control routine  may limit the audio volume level based on a maximum volume setting supplied by a user. The volume control routine  may be stored on a program storage device  that is coupled to the secondary bus . The program storage device  may be any non-volatile memory store such as non-volatile random access memory (NVRAM) or read only memory (ROM). Additionally, the volume control routine  may be stored as an executable file on a mass storage device (not shown) of the system  or on a floppy disk.","In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, a maximum volume level for the computer system  may be supplied by a user, such as a parent. The user may enter a maximum volume level through interaction with a software routine in order to limit the volume of audio output. For example, if the system  utilizes a text-based operating system such as MS-DOS\u00ae from Microsoft Corporation, the user may enter a maximum volume level through a text command. Alternatively, if a windowing environment is provided as in a WINDOWS\u00ae  or , or WINDOWS NT\u00ae operating system by Microsoft Corporation, a user may access volume controls from a volume dialog window. The volume dialog window may provide graphical volume controls, including a slider, to adjust the volume level by using a mouse or other pointer device. The volume dialog window may also have a maximum volume setting which is password protected.","In accordance with one embodiment, a user may be required to enter a password (comprising alphanumeric characters, for example) to modify the maximum volume setting. Any conventional password authentication algorithm may be used to verify that a user has entered a correct password. The maximum volume setting may be any indication of a maximum volume level, such as 25 or 50 percent of the volume capacity of the system . Alternatively, the maximum volume setting may be expressed as a discrete value (e.g., 70 decibels) or in any other appropriate unit of measurement. A user may set a specific value as the maximum volume setting by entering a value in a text field, selecting a value from a list, or by using a graphical control, such as a slider. An indication of the maximum volume setting may be stored in a read only and\/or hidden data file on the system , or for added security, may be stored in an operating system registry file or in NVRAM. The operating system registry is a central database of configuration information for operating system and application programs. An illustrative operating system registry is the WINDOWS\u00ae Registry which is included in operating systems developed by Microsoft Corporation.","Once a maximum volume level has been established, the setting remains locked at that value until a user again enters a correct password and modifies the setting. With the maximum volume level set\/locked, users are free to utilize standard system volume controls to lower the overall volume level or to raise the volume level for the computer system  up to the maximum volume setting. In order to raise the volume level of the system  above the maximum volume setting, a user is prompted to enter the password used to lock the maximum volume level.","In the event that a user, such as a parent, forgets the password, the maximum volume setting needs to be reset to a default value. The default value may be 100 percent of the audio volume capacity of the system , for example. If the maximum volume setting is stored in a hidden and\/or read only data file, then the file may be deleted to reset to the default value. In an embodiment where the maximum volume setting is stored in an operating system registry file, a user may delete that entry in the registry corresponding to the maximum volume level. If, however, the maximum volume setting is stored in NVRAM, a user may utilize a system's setup routine to restore the maximum volume setting to the default value. Setup routines may, for example, be accessed during computer system startup operations.","When the maximum volume setting is changed, a software interrupt may be generated which invokes the volume control routine . Referring to , the routine  may perform operations necessary to ensure that once a maximum volume level is set, audio output from the system  does not exceed the established maximum volume level. At block , the volume control routine  obtains the maximum volume setting described above by retrieving the setting from its stored location. The audio chip  may generate audio signals to be emitted by the speakers at a target volume level, shown in block . The target volume level corresponds to the overall volume level of the system which may be controlled by any user, as opposed to the password protected maximum volume setting. At block , the routine  compares the target volume to the maximum volume setting to determine if a modification of the audio signals is necessary. If the target volume level is lower than or the same as the maximum volume setting at diamond , no modification of the audio signals is necessary. However, if the target volume level is greater than the maximum volume setting at diamond , routine  may modify the audio signals such that the audio output is emitted at the maximum volume setting, as shown in block .","In one embodiment, the volume control routine  may be implemented as a basic input\/output system (BIOS) routine that is stored in BIOS read only memory (ROM). A hardware interrupt may be generated periodically by the audio chip  in order to invoke the routine . The audio chip  may issue an interrupt request to the interrupt controller  any time that a user modifies the overall system volume. The interrupt controller  may deliver the request to the processor , which may respond by accessing an interrupt vector table to locate a beginning address for the routine . The processor AA executes the volume control routine  to determine if audio signals generated by the audio chip AA need to be modified in order to correspond to the maximum volume setting. In one embodiment, the volume control routine  may be invoked during power on self test (POST) operations wherein the maximum volume setting is retrieved. In order to modify the audio signals, the routine  may issue application programming interface (API) calls to the audio chip . Alternatively, the volume control routine  may be a background process that periodically polls audio signals generated by the audio chip  rather than being activated by an interrupt.","In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, the volume control routine  may be implemented as an operating system service routine. In this embodiment, the routine  may be executed initially when the BIOS loads an operating system into system memory . Thereafter when the overall system volume level is modified, an interrupt is generated in the same manner as described above to invoke the volume control routine . Alternatively, the routine  may periodically poll audio signals as a background process of the operating system to determine if the signals must be modified to correspond to the maximum volume setting. Additionally, the routine  may access and modify audio signal data by calling API operations of the audio chip .","In yet another embodiment, the audio chip  may monitor the audio signals it generates to determine if the target volume exceeds the maximum volume setting. In this embodiment, the maximum volume setting may initially be obtained by the audio chip  during POST operations performed by the BIOS. Thereafter, the audio chip  may obtain the maximum volume setting by generating a hardware interrupt when the overall system volume level is modified.","Computer systems in accordance with the invention benefit users in many ways. One benefit the invention provides is a technique for limiting a computer systems' audio volume level. Another benefit of the invention is that a computer system in accordance with the invention provides flexibility by utilizing a software program to set, modify, and password protect a maximum volume level rather than a physical mechanism which requires additional mechanical or electronic parts in speakers. Yet another benefit is that the invention allows a user to raise or lower overall system volume level as long the chosen level remains at or below the maximum volume level.","While the invention has been disclosed with respect to a limited number of embodiments, numerous modifications and variations will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. It is intended, therefore, that the following claims cover all such modifications and variations that may fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
